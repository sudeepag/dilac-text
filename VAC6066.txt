               CHAPTER I.
               NEW YORK, our Commercial Metropolis. That is, the centre of activity, wealth,
                  amusement,—of sloth, indigence, misery,—the great symbol of the country's daily
                  life. Boston may be its Athens, the seat of intelligence and culture; this is its
                  Rome, the vast arena of concentrated effort and practical skill. The aim of the
                  average American, but especially of the New-Yorker, is riches, material success.
                  Pick out any one, of a morning, from its thousands rushing down town, and ask him
                  why he thus tears along; his answer, if he shall stop long enough to give it
                  faithfully, will be, "Money, money: what do we live for?"
               Stella Maign was a child of this city, though not of its spirit and circumstances.
                  Her father was, perhaps, one of its "representative men." He was a merchant, doing
                  an extensive and prosperous business, when she, his only daughter, was born. He
                  was a man of the world,—still more, a man
                  of New York. He was active and enterprising, and believed in precisely the
                  qualities which he himself possessed. All others he undervalued. He had
                  accumulated considerable property, and was called rich. Respecting and applauding
                  business qualifications, these, combined with wealth, made, in his eyes, a man of
                  men,—one to be sought and honored. Thinkers, scholars, men of ideas, held but a
                  corner of his esteem. They were well enough, he thought; they contributed aliment
                  to the leisure of the rich; they afforded him amusement: but they were always poor
                  fellows, of little account in the world. Here we have his estimate of the world:
                  he meant Wall street, Broadway, and the fine houses up town, of which his own was
                  one of the best, and in the midst of the best.
               Mrs. Maign, his wife, had been, when young, a somewhat aspiring and superior
                  maiden; but, without decided force of character, she had settled down, soon after
                  her marriage, quite to the level of the circle around her. Now she presided over
                  her husband's mansion as he thought a woman of means and fashion should do. Costly
                  pictures were hung on its walls; statues dignified the appropriate niches. The
                  parties given in it were among the gayest of the season. And outside, was the
                  lady's carriage, with driver and footman in waiting, whenever she desired to take
                  the air. Mr. and Mrs. Maign scanned their establishment with proud satisfaction.
                  "I have come to think with you, Mr. M.," she said, "that it would be quite
                  impossible for one who really is anybody, to do without the
                  like."
               This mutual thought very naturally entered into their plan of education for their
                  daughter, and into their determination regarding her future career. At fourteen
                  years of age, after fitting studies near home, she was sent away to be placed in
                  the well-known seminary of Madam de Villier, at Ironton. Here it was supposed she
                  could receive as thorough and accomplished an education as any young lady of
                  wealth and superior prospects would require. Graduated from such an institution,
                  her father deemed she would be fitted to adorn any man's drawing-room as well as
                  the good Mrs. Maign had herself done, and in exactly the same way.
               Stella's conduct, during the three years she was in charge of Madam de Villier,
                  was satisfactory to parents and teachers. She was a keen, appreciative scholar, a
                  healthful, cheerful, dignified person, with whom but little fault of any kind was
                  found. Though spirited, and occasionally wilful if opposed when she regarded
                  herself in the right, she seldom broke over, or evaded, the prescribed limits of
                  restraint, which, at a school like Madame de Villier's, were necessarily rather
                  strict. She was allowed to leave the seminary only once a week, to visit some
                  friend known to her parents, or for shopping, unless, indeed, when in company with
                  forty or fifty others, she took a morning or evening walk for exercise. The latter
                  practice she did not at first wholly enjoy. It seemed very strange scarcely ever
                  to appear in the street except as one of a long double file of young ladies—maiden
                  soldiers of culture.
               And the line was not always viewed by spectators as martial and imposing. Now and
                  then an imaginative urchin was evidently reminded by it of a flock of sheep, and
                  would apostrophize it with the bleating cry by which those innocent and pretty creatures seem wont
                  to express their ordinary emotions.
               On one occasion, largely in sport, though with much pretended vexation, Stella
                  caught hold of a child who was thus shouting near her, and shook him completely
                  beyond any further display of his wit or wits,—a feat which was a palpable breach
                  of decorum, but which caused much merriment in the street. She looked up and saw
                  the eyes of a handsome, stately youth fixed upon hers, and fairly dancing with
                  mirth. She broke into a ringing laugh, blushed to her temples, and hastened back
                  to her place in the ranks, without looking back. The stripling regarded her
                  admiringly for a moment, and murmuring, "What a dear Amazon to be sure," he too
                  passed on.
               The incident was simple enough to have been unremembered and unrecorded. But it
                  appears they were to meet again, and to one of them it was to be rather singularly
                  recalled.
               Stella's education was, at the end of the appointed time, called finished. She
                  left Madame de Villier's seminary, one of the most accomplished of its scholars,
                  as well as one of the fairest and most attractive. She had been placed there to
                  study; and though extraordinary application was not the most prominent of her good
                  qualities, she had attended faithfully to all her allotted tasks.
               She had, at this period, a passion for the beautiful, which distinguished her in
                  all matters of taste, and was remarked by every one about her. But it penetrated
                  deeper than their glances, unconsciously, even to herself, underlying her success
                  in particular studies. She did not know, for instance, why she learned French
                  without effort—almost intuitively. It was much more difficult to many of her
                  classmates, who in other branches were her equals. It was the same with music, in
                  which she at last excelled both scholars and teachers. But French is the high-bred
                  language of courtly elegance. In it, if one cannot cry, it is said: "il n'étoit plus le maître de verser des larmes."* It is the mother
                  tongue of formal taste, as Italian is that of harmonious witchery. Music again, as
                  far as it goes—and that certainly is far—is the most beautiful of all vehicles of
                  expression. Roses and the choicest flowers, may in their way and sphere compare
                  with it. What else can?
               
                  
                  *Madame de Staël's dubious hero "Oswald" (in "Corinne") will be remembered as "no longer the master of shedding tears."
               
               When Stella returned home to New York, it was—to be married. Yes, that was the
                  goal of her youthful destiny, as her father had settled it. She must be married
                  and located. It must be well done too. This he had figured. It was a most
                  important business transaction, in which he must not fail to do himself
                  credit.
               Did he not love his only daughter? Certainly he did. He would have affirmed it as
                  strenuously as any man. Only he supposed that he knew her best interests a great
                  deal better than she did. He did not believe in "overmuch sentiment;" in any
                  "undue weight of love." Taste should have its proper influence, to be sure. But
                  affection had never taken an all-engrossing hold upon him: why should other people
                  go crazy about it?
               
               "Happiness, my dear sir," he was accustomed to say,—"that consists of a proper
                  establishment, and easy, agreeable surroundings. There is nothing in the world
                  like a position and plenty. These, I believe, sir, are available when kisses and
                  notions have melted away."
               So he reasoned, after the manner of heavy Saxons.
               Stella had dreamed of love,—of some one unspeakably dear to her, to whom she could
                  be as dear. What maiden has not? But she had found no one who realized her vision.
                  She had of course seen those whom she preferred to others,—those whom she fancied
                  for the time that she could love. But they had all quickly waned in brightness,
                  and disappeared from her heart, without leaving any deep traces of their fulness
                  or decline. She began to feel that perhaps she should never meet a man who could
                  call forth such vivid emotions as she had imagined; to whom she could devote her
                  whole nature; on whom she could lavish her whole existence, content with being
                  received and being loved.
               Her father, however, had seen one to whom he was quite content that she should be
                  given in marriage,—a Boston gentleman of wealth, station, and forty-five years.
                  During the year previous to her last at Madame de Villier's, she had met him at a
                  fashionable summer resort, where she had gone with her mother and a friend, to
                  spend a portion of her usual vacation.
               He was much pleased, from the first, with her appearance, and as he was a friend
                  of her father's, and she had met him a few times at her own home, she did not
                  hesitate to receive such customary attentions as he chose to offer. Neither did
                  she decline to make herself agreeable to him by any of the accomplishments in her
                  possession. He liked music, he said; and she played for him. At the piano she was
                  conscious of excellence, though she never displayed her power with the least
                  ostentation.
               Of all self-love, that which is gratified by gratifying others, is certainly the
                  most delicate, and the least liable to detection. It can scarcely be unlovely or
                  wrong in the practice, only in the motive. Perhaps a tinge of vanity, possibly the
                  slightest touch of coquetry, mingled, unsuspected by herself, with Stella's
                  endeavors. For say what we will, the desire to please even those we care little
                  for, is everywhere a temptation to the amiable.
               But the idea of loving Mr. Torson never entered her mind. She accepted his
                  offerings of French books and of flowers, very much in the spirit in which he said
                  they were tendered,—"as partial payments for the pleasure she gave him by her
                  playing."
               But he cared less for the music than he asserted. He gave her the books and the
                  flowers, because he was aware that she was fond of them, and because it was no
                  trouble to him; just as he would have caressed any pet that he had begun to desire
                  should follow him. He had grown attached to Stella, as far as he was capable of
                  attachment, and had determined to ask her hand of Mr. Maign. He had been a
                  bachelor up to this time, but now there was no need of it. He had made
                  money—enough money—and could have everything it could buy. What more could any
                  young woman want? He, too, reasoned very much like Stella's father, and supposed
                  himself quite good enough for Stella herself. But he had the subtilty and tact not to exhibit all
                  he felt. He accepted the assertion, that language is to "conceal thought," as well
                  as to express it. He admired Stella, and wanted her as a finish to his leisure,
                  his house, and equipage. He sometimes felt there was something about her that he
                  could not completely understand. But what of that? He had no misgiving about his
                  being able to conceive and appreciate all that was worth the while.
               He knew that she was to remain with Madame de Villier one more year, and that her
                  parents would then be quite willing she should marry, provided the marriage were
                  one of wealth and the proper social position. He thought that his friend, his old
                  business acquaintance, Mr. Maign, would not object to a still nearer intimacy. So,
                  fully assured that he would encounter no opposition from him, he broached the
                  subject, a month or two afterward, in a plain, unhesitating, commercial way,
                  saying that, with his friend's consent, he should like to pay his addresses to
                  Stella, and subsequently, with the consent of the young lady, he should like to
                  marry her. He added that he had a couple of hundred thousand dollars, could take
                  good care of a wife, and that he thought Stella excellently well fitted to take
                  charge of his mansion on B—street, which he had no doubt she would consider one of
                  the best.
               This conversation, this manner, was precisely after Mr. Maign's own heart. Nothing
                  could have suited him better. He scratched his head, pulled the ends of his
                  side-whiskers, and said:
               "Ah, yes, certainly, my boy; I see no objection; I think we may call it as good as
                  settled. Stella would be very silly to hesitate, very unreasonable to refuse you;
                  and it seems to me, she is a pretty sensible girl. My old friend too! No, she
                  can't be so foolish as to deny us: we could never allow it; could we? It would put
                  my mind quite at ease to see her well established, and with you. Besides, girls
                  sometimes get strange freaks into their heads; it is best to put them on the right
                  track early. If permitted to go any way, she might fancy some poor devil who could
                  do nothing but paint a picture or write a song. That would bring me to the
                  grave-digger at once. I will speak to Stella, myself; and you may rest perfectly
                  content. And come to our house as often as your time warrants. Make it your home.
                  You and I understand each other perfectly. Mrs. Maign will be glad to know you
                  better."
               Mr. Jabed Z. Torson had reason to be satisfied with this conversation. His
                  friend's reply was about as he had expected. It was, if anything, more flattering
                  and unreserved. He felt certain of possessing Stella Maign without half trying. He
                  saw that her own father would be an energetic suitor in his behalf, and would end
                  by dropping her into his arms. This was all the better. It would save a long,
                  perhaps a difficult wooing, which might be romantic and engaging to some, but was
                  without charm for him. The end to be attained was herself; the easiest and
                  speediest way to it, he regarded as the most desirable.
               When the winter holidays came, Stella went home for a week, and her father spoke
                  to her, as he had said he should do, in reference to Mr. Torson.
               "Stella," he began, "Mr. Torson, whom you met at Saratoga last summer, has long been a friend of
                  mine; he wishes to become my son; in short, he wants you for his wife. Treat him
                  well; you will like him. He is one of the smartest fellows in Boston. He is a
                  solid. He is worth a quarter of a million, and has made it himself. He is a
                  self-made man. In ten years he will double his fortune. He can take the very best
                  care of you, and place you in a circle you are fitted for. Stella, it is a good
                  thing. You have always placed some confidence in my judgment. Don't belie yourself
                  now; don't stand in your own light, in this most important instance. I told him
                  you were a sensible girl, who knew a man from a humming-bird. I am sure you will
                  prove that I was right."
               Stella was somewhat surprised at her father's directness, and his disposal, as it
                  could not but seem, of her person and affections. She saw at once that he was
                  determined upon the match; that with him it was already a decree. But she was not
                  wholly unprepared for the information he gave her. Hints in her mother's letters
                  had signified that Mr. Torson had been "very much taken" with her, and would
                  probably find occasion to visit New York and her father's house, oftener than he
                  had previously done. But she did not love him: how could she, why should she love
                  him? She had regarded him as a substantial, complaisant gentleman, silver-gray,
                  rather high-fed, quite as strict in manners as in morals, of sound business
                  qualifications, and a handsome fortune. She had seen him occasionally, since she
                  could first distinguish one person from another. For the past three years he had
                  been abroad much of the time, regulating and closing up some com- mercial
                  transactions in England and France. Meanwhile she had sprung up from girlhood to
                  womanhood; and now it was plain that he desired to add her to his list of
                  valuables.
               "But, father," she said, "it would appear very strange for me to marry him. It
                  appears very strange that he wants me. Pardon me, but if I had been accustomed to
                  respect him a little more, I should think of him as an uncle,—your brother, and
                  scarcely a younger one. I have often heard you speak of his ability and industry.
                  I ought, certainly, to respect his good qualities. But have I not heard even you
                  touch depreciatingly upon some of his frailties? Have I not, for example, heard
                  you speak of him, with a slight shrug of the shoulders, as 'a little wild,' in his
                  younger days? It is unnecessary to hide from you that others have alluded to him
                  in the same manner. He has been courteous and respectful to me; I have found no
                  fault with his deportment. But, my dear father, now that I know his intentions, I
                  can't help a slight shrinking from him."
               "Well, well, Stella," responded Mr. Maign, "that will do. 'Frailties!'—'a little
                  wild,' indeed! One would think you were a Beecher, and had gone to preaching
                  infidelity over in Brooklyn. What do you suppose you know about the world as it
                  is? Have you learned from a few books, and two or three languages, that men are
                  mixed of sanctity, sprinkled with cologne, and set on their feet so as never to
                  slip and get the least soiled? Do you imagine, child, that I have lived over fifty
                  years without knowing a thing or two? Is there anybody that can have your interest
                  nearer at heart than I? Can anybody
                  manage it better? I have considered all your objections. Torson isn't Saint John,
                  nor Adam before the fall; but he is a sensible, sober man, who has attended to his
                  affairs and got rich. Any spirited woman in the country would be glad to catch
                  him. He moves in the most respectable society, and nobody but a British peer could
                  carry you higher. He hasn't done anything so very bad, either. Old men shrug their
                  shoulders over young ones, and, at fifty, over themselves at twenty-five. Torson
                  had a few wild oats to sow. Now they are all disposed of, and done with. He is
                  established and sure,—much more so than any youngster I could trust you to. If he
                  had been married, twenty years ago, perhaps you would have heard no pretty stories
                  about him. As it is, all the stories are old ones, and, like the scars of an old
                  soldier, they have brought experience with them. He will treat you better than any
                  boy, believe me. Ask your mother if I'm not right."
               "I know already," replied Stella, "from what she has hinted and looked, what she
                  will say. I do not mean to be capricious or undutiful. Certainly I have no want of
                  confidence in my parents. I will try to look upon Mr. Torson as you do. Perhaps by
                  the time my term at school is finished, I can view him more favorably. I am to be
                  there six months yet; then I will try to do as you think best."
               Stella shut herself up in her room, and wept. The reality, then, had come. She
                  must try to love Mr. Torson. Or could she marry him without loving him?—without at
                  least respecting him? She felt as though she would throw herself on his pride and
                  generosity, and flatly beg him not to persist in his suit. But no. He wanted her.
                  He was cool, unenthusiastic, and not used to being thwarted. He would think her
                  disinclination for him a mere freak, which he could easily overcome. Her father,
                  too, would so declare it. And might it not be so? she asked herself. He had
                  endeavored to please her. He would probably be kind to her; and, at any rate, all
                  the pleasures to be procured by affluence and society would be at her command. He
                  had travelled, and in particulars and details, could make himself interesting. He
                  would soon go to Europe again, her father had told her, and she should go with
                  him,—thus fulfilling a dream of her youth which had so often transported her to
                  the scenes of the old world. Love?—well, would she ever really love any one as she
                  had fancied? Would she ever see any one to love thus? She could only answer that
                  her ideal had not appeared. But if he should appear, what then? God alone could
                  tell. It seemed to her that her father did not appreciate her nature,—that he
                  could not understand the depths of her feeling; but only judged of her as of
                  others about her, whom she felt to be more selfish and frivolous. But had he not
                  experienced all that had agitated her? Perhaps so, and that all had passed away as
                  her illusions would vanish. Oh, yes! he must know best. Yet she trembled, as
                  though fate itself thrilled her with a denial of the thought. There was a
                  clogging, painful sensation in her chest, as if an opinion, gross and monstrous,
                  had become a material substance, and lodged there.
               She went to the window, and threw back the cur- tains. The day had been murky and dismal. But as
                  she stood there, a flood of sunshine poured out of the heavens, and filled the
                  horizon. It lasted but a moment; then all was again gray and sombre.
               Stella had scarcely a tinge of superstition in her mind. But her eye was quick to
                  note all phases of nature that appeared applicable to persons and conditions of
                  feeling. She paid no attention to them as signs or warnings; but they intensified
                  her emotions.
               "Foolish child that I am!" she exclaimed, "yet what if I should sometime stand for
                  an instant in the sunlight of an absorbing fondness, then be thrust back again
                  into the remorseless, abiding gloom!"
               When New-year's had passed, Stella returned to school. She was more sad and
                  thoughtful than formerly; but confided her feelings to no one, and uttered no
                  complaints. She had grown dreamy, and seemed constantly debating within herself,
                  some question that she could not decide. Still, her conduct was not such as to
                  cause remark. Her recitations were as promptly and faithfully rendered as ever.
                  Only when she sat at the piano, and there threw out her soul in strains which
                  seemed to sob, and beg, and bewail; to rave, to pray, to doubt and tremble,—only
                  then was it plain to those to whom music was a living tongue, that there was a
                  weight upon her soul, a terror within her heart.
               As the term drew to a close, she prepared to leave the school, and proceed home to
                  fulfil her father's behest. Her heart had succumbed to his will.
               "Yes," she said, "I must do as Fate and he together demand."
               Sad and tearful, but loaded with compliments and prizes, Stella bade adieu to
                  Madame de Villier, and in a few hours was once again in her father's mansion. Two
                  months from that day she was married, and became Mrs. J. Z. Torson. Forgive her:
                  she was not yet eighteen.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER II.
               MR. AND MRS. TORSON, after making an American tour of about a month's duration,
                  during which they visited some of the most notable places in the country, repaired
                  to their residence in Boston, where they remained a few days, and then sailed for
                  England.
               Stella had not loved her husband when he was her lover, nor had she since learned
                  to love him more. But she had determined to be a reasonable and faithful wife.
                  This was all he could ask, she thought; for he had known her feelings when he took
                  her.
               She had anticipated much pleasure from her visit to the old world. To look upon
                  the parent countries of her own fair land, had been, as we have seen, one of the
                  constant longings of her youth. But she connected their distinguished places,
                  their time-worn edifices, their charming natural scenes, with momentous epochs
                  full of aspiration and endeavor, and with majestic men or noble women who had made
                  them hallowed. Apart from these, palaces, parks, or ruined piles of granite, had
                  no more interest for her than other grand or beautiful objects, which she could
                  see without the fatigue and exposure of travel. They were pleasant enough, even to
                  the eye alone; but she demanded that, in viewing them, the eye should reflect upon
                  the soul, enlightment and elevation.
               Her husband was wholly different. He could give her the square feet of St. Paul's,
                  and catalogue its decorations; he could point out the statues and relics of kings,
                  or queens, or lords, and gaze on them with reverence, whether the dead had, when
                  living, done aught but eat, drink, and misgovern, or whether their presence and
                  action had been a lever and a blessing to the race. He could designate castles,
                  altars, monuments, telling when they were built, their height, and bulk, and
                  material. Then he supposed he had told all that was to be said. He delighted in
                  meeting and associating with the nobility, and could remember the day or hour when
                  he conversed with Lord Bigburgh, or was at the palace of the Earl of Sundryland.
                  For the sake of their society, he would cater to their tastes, their desires or
                  excesses. To him, they were the distinguished men of the realm.
               But Stella cared nothing for them, or for their society and attentions. A few of
                  their number she would have delighted to honor for their large public capacity and
                  worth, which she had read of, and well understood. But she felt that she would not
                  consume the time of these great and busy men, even if the opportunity were offered
                  her. She venerated real power and nobleness so highly, that the famed possessors
                  of these qualities were like distant and almost sacred beings to her. But titled
                  mediocrity, still more, titled vulgarity, however lofty they appeared to others,
                  she looked upon partly with indifference, partly with pity.
               
               She could not, at this time, fully understand her own nature—why she lived in the
                  world, or what she most desired in it. She was, however, a persistent, though
                  unconscious realist, searching below customs and conventionalities, for their
                  meaning and essence, and through the multiplied ambitions, endeavors, and
                  performances of men, to the underlying spirit and end.
               Her husband's mind dwelt wholly amid surfaces—the commonplace affairs and
                  spectacles of the world—and could no more comprehend hers, than Bonaparte, with
                  all his boasted knowledge of ordinary persons—Frenchmen and others—could
                  comprehend a patriot or saint. Mr. Jabed Torson thought, too, that all which he
                  could not appreciate in his young wife, was sentimental and girlish;—that her
                  enthusiasms were weaknesses with which no man like him should be soft enough to
                  sympathize.
               She plainly read this opinion in his words and actions, and felt, for her part,
                  that, like most others, he was merely one side of a man:—that his mind was
                  stationary and executive, without the perception of enlargement and progression;
                  that he had practical talent, but no spiritual insight. To him, she was "an
                  idealist,"—a word which he used without knowing its meaning, except that it
                  signified something for which his own nature had no correlative, and consequently
                  something which must be dreamy, exaggerative, and futile. But to her,
                     he was no mystery. She could define and classify him, placing him
                  where he belonged; because she possessed the properties of his nature—the
                  practical, the definite—and with them also, even at this time, the perception of
                  higher properties by which those were included.
               But he was her husband; and she must love, honor, and obey him, as she had
                  promised to do by becoming his bride. Indeed, she had no inclination to disregard
                  the obligations of a faithful wife; though at times, when enraptured by some
                  mighty work of nature or of art, she longed, with a full heart, for a companion to
                  whom the scene would not be one of mere cubic magnitude and regularity, or solely
                  of material wealth and grandeur.
               Stella remained in England about six weeks, when, Mr. Torson's business being at
                  an end, they crossed "the Channel," and were in France. Stella had not seen in
                  Britain all that she had desired and expected to see; but she was quite willing to
                  leave it, and now looked forward with equal willingness to the time when she
                  should quit France and return to Boston. In a foreign land, the one nearest her
                  person far from her heart, in spite of her efforts to love him as a duty—he having
                  little real sympathy with her in the objects which most interested her, and
                  sometimes deprecating her loftiest qualities, of which he had no adequate
                  conception—she had become weary of the very objects from which she anticipated
                  deriving the most pleasure. Her stay in France was brief and unsatisfactory; and,
                  in another month, it was a relief to be again in New York, at her father's house.
                  There she was to remain a few days, before proceeding to Boston.
               "Well, Stella," inquired Mr. Maign, soon after her arrival, "didn't I do a pretty
                  good thing for you, after all?"
               "I fear not," she replied. "I shall have much to forgive you. But we cannot
                  improve the matter now. I shall try to do
                  my duty, and shall do my best to be content."
               Mr. Torson could not help observing that, although Stella was kind and gentle to
                  him, it was from a sense of right, not from love. He could not fail to see that,
                  sometimes, when she could not impose her wonted restraint upon herself, she
                  appeared to regard him as only her conventional lord, but as her real and natural
                  inferior. This irritated him almost beyond endurance. Only a thoughtful and noble
                  man, as we have often heard, can bear the self-consciousness of superiority in a
                  woman.
               In society he was proud of Stella, and not without cause. As soon as she became
                  fairly settled in her new home, she had paid more attention than ever to her
                  music, as by it she expressed to herself all her joys, her regrets, and sorrows.
                  And when, in social circles, she sat at the piano, she was at once the queen of a
                  charmed and almost breathless group of listeners. Her rather tall and perfectly
                  symmetrical figure; her fine shoulders; her delicate features, not strictly of the
                  feminine Grecian mould, but rather suggestive of the intuitive, thoughtful,
                  Grecian spirit as a whole; her long, heavy hair, dressed low at the sides, with no
                  ornament save its own large glossy twist at the back,—seemed to reanimate, with
                  but little change, the simplicity and power of antique classic beauty. Her
                  appearance itself was an instantaneous assertion of the delight which her first
                  touch of the keys would certainly afford. Others were often asked to play out of
                  compliment, or to fill up the time; she, never except for the pure gratification
                  to be derived from the music itself. Her perform- ance was always unaffected and
                  genuine,—never for the sake of performance,—never with any attempt at display of
                  execution. Every note was palpable, perfect, and in its place. But all endeavor,
                  all labor, was subordinate to the end—deliciousness of sound—harmony—and still
                  deeper, the expression of emotions, and even powers of nature, by this entrancing
                  utterance of the boundless. Children would gather round her, delighted with some
                  gay waltz or polka—the ear alone tickled with time and tune; young men and maidens
                  would name some piece which, as she played it, would utter in melody, perhaps
                  unconsciously to themselves, their own vague ideas and dreamy longings. Then, if
                  she struck up the air of a powerful song, or some deep, threatening march, through
                  which she was now and then secretly wont to throw off her combative and
                  disagreeable emotions,—a sensitive person could scarcely listen without clenched
                  hands and the fire of conflict in his eye. To be sure, most of the sturdy, moneyed
                  friends and acquaintances of Mr. Torson were not people who, with Novalis,
                     thought to music, delving to find its inmost spirit. But they
                  could easily perceive its outward fascination, and thus compliment Stella with
                  earnest looks and words of unfeigned admiration.
               Yes, Jabed Torson was proud of his wife on such occasions, and pleased with the
                  praises bestowed on one of his possessions. It would have been the same, though no
                  doubt in a somewhat less degree, had the encomiums been lavished upon his carriage
                  or country residence. He knew that Stella played remarkably well. He could even
                  enjoy the music himself, to a limited extent. But he regarded the wondrous gift
                     as merely an expert and graceful
                  accomplishment, which his position and his money encouraged and sustained. Stella
                  continued to cherish it, because she loved it. Her piano was now one of her chief
                  comforts,—a partial solace for many regrets and wearisome reflections.
               Mr. Torson had, in his house, what would be termed a handsome library. It
                  contained a fair proportion of the miscellaneous works of the time. As a book
                  became fashionable, or was talked of, he bought it, sometimes looking into it, but
                  much oftener placing it on a shelf where others could see it, and know that it
                  belonged to his collection. Old books, which the ages had venerated—which there
                  was high authority for possessing, if not reading—were better represented there
                  than any others: they gave repute to the whole assemblage. The poets had their
                  allotted space, but were seldom so much as glanced at by the owner of the volumes.
                  Modern thinkers, too, had their position on the shelves, but small place in Mr.
                  Torson's mind. The Journal of Commerce, a paper published in New
                  York, was, in general, his daily literature.
               But for Stella, this library became every day a richer treasure. She was not
                  disposed to be a book-worm,—to hunt amidst the dust of the ages for words, and
                  maxims, and innumerable facts. She was not disposed to convert herself into an
                  encyclopaedia. So many historical incidents and actions seemed to proceed from
                  some one impulse, or foible, or desire, that she regarded it frivolous and
                  mechanical to catalogue a thousand symbols of the same thing. She sought rather
                  for the cause, the explanation, and end of the desire or emotion itself, out of
                  which the multiplicity of facts pro- ceeded. Her soul asked questions which
                  ordinary minds that she met in her parlors, and stronger, but not deeper minds,
                  such as she commonly heard from the pulpit or rostrum, could not answer. Partly on
                  this account, partly to lure her thoughts from immediate distasteful surroundings,
                  she spent many hours in her husband's library, while he was on State street or at
                  the Revere House, as his business or his leisure dictated.
               As Stella had intimated in conversation with her father, Mr. Torson had not always
                  in his younger days been strict in morals, though discreet and guarded in manners.
                  We know that such men, when advanced in life, especially if they have young wives,
                  are the most exacting and suspicious of husbands.
               As Mr. Torson knew that Stella had only kindness, not love for him, he had
                  occasionally asked himself if any one else enjoyed, or had ever engaged her
                  affection. But her unexceptionable deportment in society, and her coveted
                  seclusion at home, gave him no chance for a response injurious to her. One
                  peculiarity offended him, as he watched her in the social circle. When
                  occasionally some young thinker, uninterested in the ordinary topics of the street
                  and the drawing-room, would speak to her of an interior meaning to some strain of
                  music, or to some painting or statue, or would allude to certain men whose names
                  were largely under the ban of popular odium, but who had, as she knew, devoted
                  their time, their lives and fortunes, to elevating public sentiment, and
                  particularly to lifting their countrymen up to the principle of universal
                  freedom,—her eye kindled with an admiring enthusiasm, she lost all restraint, and speaking from the
                  depths of her soul, her face beamed upon her companion with sympathetic generosity
                  and fervor.
               "What a fool she is," muttered her husband, when he saw her thus; "I believe she
                  could love a painter or scribbler, while she would make nothing of snubbing a
                  governor! How many grandiloquent words she has, too, for those miserable devils,
                  the fanatics, who have wellnigh brought the country to disruption and ruin! Bah!
                  she makes me sick of her!"
               But he never discovered anything else in her conduct, to afflict him with sickness
                  of head or heart.
               Mr. Torson and Stella lived thus together, "very pleasantly," as people said,—"she
                  having everything that heart could wish, and he proud of so beautiful and
                  accomplished a wife."
               But on the fourth anniversary of their marriage, he was suddenly and severely
                  attacked with a malady which seemed at first much like bilious colic (unpleasant
                  even to speak of), but which settled into a fever, and finally affected his brain.
                  His physician declared that he could not live.
               The day preceding the first attack, he had attended a large dinner at the Revere
                  House, given in honor of a distinguished Southern politician, who had many times
                  threatened the dissolution of the Union and the cessation of Southern trade,
                  unless slavery, the paramount interest of his section, should be more effectually
                  established and supported. Boston merchants and lawyers—conservative men of
                  wealth, influence, and standing—had met him on this occasion, to toast his
                  sentiments, and to show him that no one of conse- quence in the city, possessed
                  the smallest particle of unfriendliness for him, or held any weak, fanatical
                  opinions regarding the chivalrous South.
               Mr. Torson was a forward and delighted participant in these festivities. He was
                  eager to eat with, drink with, smoke with, and in every way felicitate, the great
                  and distinguished guest. He showed much capacity for solids and fluids, and was
                  profuse and voluble in his attentions. But alas! his geniality was too sumptuous
                  for his health! He passed one troubled, confused night, then grew dangerously ill,
                  and in five days the banquet of life had itself closed. Jabed Z. Torson was
                  dead.
               Stella had faithfully attended him during these five days, and had bestowed upon
                  his distress every alleviation that kindness and duty could suggest. She had even
                  wished, as she saw him lying helpless before her, that Heaven had given her a
                  commoner nature, and that she could have sympathized with her husband, and loved
                  him. But she had done what she could, and now, at twenty-two years of age, she was
                  a widow.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER III.
               "SO Torson is dead. Very sudden, isn't it? What a magnificent fortune he must have
                  left his wife! I've heard he was worth half a million."
               Such were the remarks which Mr. Loudun Braigh addressed to Simeon Ecrit, Esq., Mr.
                  Torson's attorney, the morning after Mr. T.'s death.
               "Not so much," replied the attorney, "'Twill do no harm to speak of it now, and to
                  you. 'Tis a good deal under half a million; but then, 'tis a clean three hundred
                  and fifty thousand. But Torson was a man of sense; he was rather particular about
                  putting even that modest sum completely into the hands of his wife. He had his
                  wits about him, and she, you know, is touched with some slight peculiarities.
                  Besides, her father's money went by the board in '57, a year after her marriage;
                  and of late, he and Torson haven't been such good friends as formerly. I suspect
                  Jabed desired that the old man shouldn't have too much benefit from anything the
                  daughter could control. Anyhow, there are certain pretty little provisions and
                  restrictions in the will. But she can be comfortable enough if she pleases,
                  notwithstanding."
               The fact was, as Mr. Ecrit continued to explain, that Mr. Torson had devised to
                  Stella, as long as she should remain unmarried, any sum not exceeding ten thousand
                  dollars annually, that she might choose to expend for her own support and
                  convenience.
               He premised that he wished her to live like a lady, as his wife always had done.
                  But he had noticed traits of her character which he had been reluctantly obliged
                  to condemn. He thought her imaginative far more than practical; and not likely to
                  use his fortune, if placed entirely at her disposal, in a manner that, if living,
                  would merit his approbation. He had observed, too, that she admired, not only
                  works of art, together with poetry and literature generally, but that her nature
                  inclined her also to the producers of these things; and as they were seldom
                  competent, either to appreciate money or to take proper care of a wife, he had
                  determined that, if he could prevent it, neither his wife nor his fortune should
                  fall to the lot of any individual of their class.
               Moreover, Stella, unlike himself, had a tendency to particular fanaticisms. He had
                  no doubt that a designing man, by an appeal to her sympathies, could persuade her
                  to give thousands of dollars to the cause even of abolition itself, which had
                  always received his frequent and hearty curse. He had resolved that his money
                  should float in no such channel.
               Considering all these matters, he had concluded to make her an annual provision of
                  the ten thousand dollars, or any smaller amount which she might wish to draw for
                  the actual expenses of living,—for conducting her household, travelling, etc.
               He had provided that the remainder of the income should be employed for the accumulation of the
                  principal.
               No part of Stella's income was to be drawn by her, except for the actual purposes
                  specified; and in no one year was she to expend in charity, more than three
                  hundred dollars,—a sum which he thought sufficient for any lady of sane mind to
                  dispose of in that way.
               His house was to be retained as a part of the estate; and he made a moderate
                  yearly allowance for improvements and changes upon the place, and repairs of
                  equipage. This residence was designed for the occupancy of his widow.
               But if she should marry, or should disregard any of the specifications of his
                  will, she should be at once deprived of her income, and all benefit arising from
                  his property, except one third the value of the residence, furniture, etc.—her
                  lawful claim on his only real estate.
               In such case, the entire residue of the property was to go to one Clara Summers, a
                  niece, whom he had seen but once, but who was supposed to be resident somewhere at
                  the South; unless, indeed, she had died there, in which event the estate was to be
                  devoted to the diffusion of arguments and facts opposed to the "disseminations of
                  the American Anti-Slavery Society," and to the lamentable tendency to
                  "rationalism, transcendentalism, and other forms of infidelity," which he stated
                  that he had observed were fast gaining ground throughout New England.
               But in case his wife should do nothing, during her life, to deprive herself of the
                  advantages of his will, at her death the fortune was still to go to Clara Sum-
                  mers, if living, and if not, to be divided among the heirs of one of his distant
                  relatives, who was himself very wealthy.
               Thus Stella was left the serf of a considerable fortune. She was surrounded by
                  every material comfort and luxury that her tastes could crave, but was debarred
                  from opening her heart to love, or her conscience and generosity to their natural
                  action and satisfaction. On the other hand, if she sought to free herself from her
                  bondage—disregarding the will and spurning its aid—it would immediately be turned
                  against objects and ideas which she regarded as the most sacred and beneficent
                  then agitating the mind and heart of the world. For Clara Summers, evidently a
                  Southern woman, would doubtless use the property in Southern fashion, investing
                  perhaps the whole of it in slaves. Or if she were dead, the matter would be yet
                  worse,—the money being hurled directly against the mental and moral revolutions of
                  New England, which, instead of anarchical and infidel in their tendency, as Mr.
                  Torson had considered them, Stella deemed grand, and highly important to the
                  progress of the human race.
               She felt as if bound hand and foot; which had of course been intended by her
                  husband. His interest in political questions had been keen and his negative
                  attachment to certain religious forms had been conspicuous; but not sufficient to
                  secure his deliberate intention to award them his whole property. His will was
                  unmistakably designed to be a chain for Stella, which, with her ideas and
                  convictions, would irresistibly fetter her to a course of life prescribed by his
                  wishes.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IV.
               MR. JABED Z. TORSON died in September, 1860. Stella appeared at the funeral in
                  deep mourning, which she continued to wear during that month and the one
                  following, and then exchanged for less heavy and dismal, but still plain dark
                  colors.
               Her independence of thought had for several years led her to interrogate fashions
                  and customs of all kinds.
               "These sombre weeds," she said to herself, "are the natural expression of our
                  emotions when we are obliged to resign a friend to the dead. We are sad within;
                  how can we be gay without? If we loved and respected the one who is with us no
                  more, we receive a melancholy solace, as well as food for our self-respect, in
                  bearing with us a constant suggestion of his former presence, and of the void now
                  caused by his absence. How could we be worthy of the departed if we should not
                  constantly think of him? should not constantly surround ourselves with objects
                  impelling us so to think? Thus the custom inevitably sprung from human sentiments,
                  and when not carried to a hollow mockery or a formal excess, it is appropriate and
                  beautiful. Other sentiments, however, which are less admirable, often mingle in
                  it. Material minds generally associate death with fearful gloom and ungainly
                  terror. They have painted him as a bony skeleton on a spectral horse. These
                  follies sometimes enter into their mourning robes, which are then typical of
                  mysterious blackness. Faith is not beneath them, and nothing bright can be seen
                  beyond the solid earth. Could we behold the spirits of those who have passed away
                  from us, being ourselves able to rise above our own selfish sorrow at the
                  separation, I suppose we should follow them to the tomb with roses on our brows,
                  rejoicing that, if noble and beautiful of soul, they had gone to a sphere of
                  increased and increasing enjoyment, and if gross and sensual here, they had now
                  become freed from the temptations and downwardness of a bulky body, and by being
                  severed from it, could have scope for the reception of higher powers and
                  satisfactions than it had been possible for them even to imagine, much less to
                  know."
               Stella could not feel that her husband's condition had been changed for a worse,
                  by his death; nor could she mourn him for her own sake, like one who had been
                  loved by him, had been understood and trusted. But she deemed it proper to respect
                  the usual customs of the society around her, and to act as nearly as she could, in
                  accordance with what she thought would be his own wishes.
               Her most immediate reason for such compliance, was, perhaps, that she would not
                  tolerate in herself the smallest vengeful impulse toward Mr. Torson, on account of
                  the narrowness of his will. As he had exhibited meanness, she must beware of
                  entertaining hatred. She must not condescend in anger, to even an appearance of
                  insult.
               
               Mr. Torson's mansion was closed to music and festivities: there was silence in the
                  unopened shutters, and an air of solemnity in the faces of even the domestics. So
                  it remained several months; and there, a placid young woman with mild voice and
                  tender eye, seemed to lament, though with sufficient moderation, the decease of a
                  worthy husband.
               Indeed, Stella felt that, even if he were not greatly missed, there was sufficient
                  cause for quiet consideration, if not for mourning, in the strangely-fettered
                  circumstances in which she had been placed, and in the mistaken endeavors of those
                  who, when she was scarcely more than a child, had thrust her forward to such an
                  untoward destiny.
               But she did not complain of her lot with peevish inanition. She settled into it
                  serenely, with the determination to consider, carefully and leisurely, what she
                  could best do for her own happiness and that of others.
               As Mr. Ecrit observed in his colloquy with Mr. Braigh, her father had lost his
                  property. He had been obliged to sell even his house,—the house of her infancy and
                  childhood. It was through no fault of his. He was an energetic and able merchant,
                  as it was his ambition to be. But he had become involved in large transactions
                  with parties whose credit was unlimited, and whose resources were supposed to be
                  almost unbounded. Then came the "panic" of '57. Every merchant began to distrust
                  his neighbor. The alarm increased. The best paper, thrown on Wall street, could
                  not be converted into money without an enormous sacrifice, if at all. But he had
                  resolved, as he said, to "go through." His notes, which, in the height of the
                  calamity, amounted to fifty thousand dollars a week, "must and should every one be
                  paid." At first he sacrificed thousands of dollars in real-estate and the best
                  fabrics, rather than "suspend." Then came a large loss through fire and the
                  insolvency of several insurance companies which had been presumed to be perfectly
                  sound. At last the notes of some Eastern manufacturers, whose paper, as everybody
                  had declared, was "A No. 1"—the best, or as good as any in America—proved almost
                  valueless—not worth fifteen cents on the dollar. Mr. Maign held a large amount of
                  this paper, and when it was protested, he could no longer meet his own notes.
                  Still, perhaps, he might have weathered the storm, and come out with a little
                  canvas flying,—a few thousands left,—but as previously he had been over-confident
                  and self-reliant, now he was wholly dispirited. He became emaciated and sleepless,
                  and it was even feared that he would be insane. He allowed his property to pass
                  into other hands for settlement, and soon it was reported on 'change that Rufus
                  Maign was "completely wound up."
               He was now a poor man, unable to commence business anew in his own name. But, his
                  depression gone, his knowledge of trade made him a valuable assistant to others,
                  and he could still live comfortably. Yet this was a steep and long descent for so
                  proud a man. Besides, he had lived in affluence twenty-five years, becoming so
                  fully accustomed to wealth, with its many attendant luxuries, that the loss of his
                  mansion or his carriage was like the amputation of a limb. He could not resign
                  himself to such a fate. He had no ambition but a commercial one and no simple,
                  inexpensive tastes, by the gratification
                  of which he could pleasurably occupy his mind.
               Stella pitied him with all her heart. Moreover, as he had imperiously insisted on
                  her marriage, and as the older she had grown, the more her heart had been
                  estranged from his, she was fearful that, in not wholly respecting his
                  characteristics, she might also be prone to overlook a daughter's duty toward a
                  parent now unfortunate and fast growing aged. Here was a point upon which she was
                  extremely sensitive; and she determined to soothe his declining years by every
                  comfort that she could possibly offer him.
               Thanks either to an oversight of Mr. Torson, or else to a mitigating
                  disinclination on his part to prevent her from making any congenial
                  or conscientious use of her income, he had indirectly left one way open in the
                  will, for her to aid her parents. He had not specified whom she should have in her
                  house, what company she should receive, or how much she should pay any person or
                  persons for managing her household, if she should choose to put it in charge of
                  others than herself.
               In fact, the will paid her one very flattering compliment. It explicitly forbade
                  the bringing of an action against her for breaking it, provided that when any
                  question might arise on the subject, she should first solemnly affirm that she had
                  neither avoided nor infringed any of its provisions.
               Mr. Torson asserted, in this connection, that whatever might be his wife's faults
                  and singularities which he wished to correct, he had never known her to deviate,
                  in a single instance, from what she regarded the exact truth; and he firmly
                  believed she would forego all the benefits of his fortune rather than tell a
                  downright lie.
               Mr. Ecrit, when drawing up the document, had inclined to sneer at this clause,
                  intimating that it would counteract all the others. But Mr. Torson told him that
                  he knew what he was about, and needed no dictation; that the will began by
                  affirming him to be in sound mind, which he felt himself to be. Moreover, he
                  begged the attorney to bear in mind that it was his will they were
                  preparing, not that gentleman's own. Mr. Ecrit thereupon proceeded without further
                  comment, and the testament was completed.
               Stella gladly owned that, in this one instance, her husband had done her justice.
                  It filled her with surprise. She could with difficulty understand how he could so
                  implicitly trust a conscience which he could still so meanly restrain. But she was
                  thankful that he had comprehended her even sufficiently to rely thus upon one
                  virtue,—her sincerity.
               "It is true," said she, "that 'we can see only that which we ourselves are.' He,
                  too, possessed a sort of coarse, common honesty, and could accredit me with
                  unbending truthfulness. He meant well in other things, I doubt not, as far as he
                  could see; but his higher perceptions were dwarfed and bounded. Sorrow I
                     must feel for him; unkindness, why should I cherish?"
               When Stella perceived that she could yet aid her parents, or indeed any one else
                  whom a young woman of rectitude could include in her household, she wrote to her
                  father, stating that as his daughter, fully appreciating his pride and his former
                  independent position, she blushed to make
                  him a proposition which she was about to offer, though still she felt it proper,
                  and even necessary to her own happiness, to do so.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "You know, my dear father," she continued, "that I am young, and, as
                              you used to say, rather 'enthusimusy.' Especially during
                              the last year or two, I have given myself up to being musical when not
                              literary, and a blue-stocking when away from my piano.
                           "I intend to remain, at present, where I am; yet I don't want the
                              trouble of superintending affairs in the house.
                           "You know how I am situated,—money enough, a fine house, equipage,
                              servants, comforts, luxuries, all around me, and I their prisoner,—a
                              poor little chippy in a golden cage.
                           "I can't lend you ten or twenty thousand dollars, as I should like to
                              do, and which, with your business capacity, you could treble in a few
                              years. But I can do something for you, nevertheless,
                              while I can relieve myself of many annoying cares.
                           "Now if you and mother will come to Boston, and take charge of your
                              little girl's house for her, as she dares not give or lend, she will
                                 pay you three thousand dollars the first year, or more
                              if you desire it. Then you can do some sort of business, and be with
                              business men, just as well on our Washington or State street, as on
                              your Broadway or Wall street. Why not?
                           "My carriage, too, shall always be at your disposal, and you can ride
                              as often as you like. Now it is idle and almost useless. As for
                              myself, I scarcely ever ride; as when I go into the street, I need a
                              walk; and, like most of our ladies, I get too little air and exercise
                              at that. Once in awhile I ride out to Cambridge or Mount Auburn. But
                              you can have the carriage six days in the week, and with my company
                              for one or two rides, you can have it the whole seven.
                           "Mother may arrange everything in the house to suit herself, except
                              the library and a small room next it, which I am going to turn into a
                              kind of retired musical sanctum. These two apartments will be
                              consecrated to my own tastes and habits,—to order or disorder, silence
                              or sound. All the rest may be as nice and as much like old times as
                              you please.
                           "Tell mother how much I need her, and do come as soon as you can.
                           
                              "Lovingly,
                              "STELLA."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Mr. Maign was deeply affected by this letter. Like so many daily occurrences in
                  the world, it caused him both pleasure and sadness. It seemed, at first thought, a
                  terrible event, for that haughty merchant, whose mustache was now gray, to become
                  a dependant upon his daughter. Yet such a fate promised him the indulgence of all
                  his former habitudes, with even the means of gradually mending his fortune. He was
                  touched, too, by the manner in which Stella made him her offer,—by the feeling of
                  need which she expressed for having him and her mother near her, and her delicacy
                  in volunteering to give up to them the arrangement of almost her whole house, that
                  they might feel at home in it.
               "The dear child!" he exclaimed, "she would do this too;—she who was always so
                  particular herself, and from childhood
                  had the best taste imaginable! Well, she is as singular as ever. I never did know
                  exactly what to make of her ways. But she is the best girl in the world: I'm sure
                  of it. Besides, she shrunk so from the marriage! Yes, we will go and live with
                  her; and perhaps I shall learn something in my old age; who knows?"
               Accordingly, Mr. and Mrs. Maign went to Boston, where they were soon settled in
                  the Torson mansion.
               The old gentleman made arrangements to close up some few debts that still hung
                  over him, and to engage again in business. As he became accustomed to State
                  street, he forgot to pine for Wall street, and as Stella converted her stately
                  house into his home, he could even recall the Fifth Avenue without a shrug of the
                  shoulders or a sigh.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               SEVERAL months passed quietly away, during which Stella remained with her parents
                  in their new home. Much of the time she was secluded in the two rooms she had set
                  apart for herself, and every one in the house became accustomed to her habits of
                  solitude.
               But a few days before the beginning of April, in the spring following her
                  husband's death, she prepared to leave Boston for a brief visit to Ironton, where
                  she had spent three years of her girlhood with Madame de Villier.
               While at school she had formed several pleasant attachments; but Cora Clandon, a
                  girl of about her own age, had been her favorite and most intimate friend.
               Cora Clandon, like Stella, was the daughter of an enterprising merchant. But he
                  was older than Mr. Maign, and had retired from business with a large property. His
                  wife was dead, and Cora was his only daughter. He had one son who was in the army,
                  and was most of the time absent from home.
               Cora was a pleasant, handsome person, not much like Stella, but very fond of her.
                  Her nature was lighter and gayer than her friend's, but she was very brilliant, good-hearted, and agreeable. She was
                  constantly striving to please Stella, while at school, almost every day bringing
                  her delicacies from home, and making her little presents. She regarded her, in
                  fact, with an affection only less ardent than she would have felt for a lover.
                  When they had parted, she had made Stella promise to visit her sometime, and had
                  written to her occasionally, ever since. Stella's marriage, and the four years or
                  more which had now elapsed, made no difference with Cora. She had visited her
                  friend in Boston, and was still determined that the promise should be
                  fulfilled.
               Stella thought that a slight change would be beneficial to her health and spirits,
                  while it would be very pleasant to revisit the scenes of her school-days, at the
                  same time gratifying Cora. The season was forward, the weather already sunny and
                  genial. She sent Cora a few lines to tell of her approach, and the day after the
                  letter was received, she herself arrived at Ironton.
               Not long afterward, as she sat chatting with Cora, a young gentleman called. Cora
                  introduced him as Mr. Merlow, and when she addressed him, she familiarly called
                  him Charley. He was a person rather above the medium height, of slender
                  proportions, quick and somewhat angular motions, having keen, but frank,
                  expressive eyes, and short curling brown hair. When he spoke, there was noticeable
                  in some of his words the trifling difference between the New England and the New
                  York pronunciation, and Stella at once located him as a Massachusetts boy who had
                  spent more or less of his time a little west of that State.
               "It will be a fine evening for those exercises," said he to Cora, after they had
                  conversed some minutes on general topics, and he had addressed a few pleasant
                  remarks to Stella. "I suppose there is nothing to prevent your going with me."
               Then he looked suddenly up, first at Stella, and from her to Cora, as though he
                  had spoken carelessly, and was annoyed at it.
               "I must disappoint you, Charley," replied Cora, "unless my friend would like to go
                  too; and I think she had better not: she has been in the cars all the morning, and
                  will be tired to-night.
               "We were speaking, Stella," she continued, "of the closing exercises of a literary
                  society that Mr. Merlow is interested in. The members close the season, this
                  evening, with 'efforts of overflowing eloquence, effusions of inspiriting poetry,
                  and accordant examples of impassioned song,' as one of our newspapers has it: all
                  of which means, I presume, that they are to have a pleasant affair.
               "Now I don't care about it at all," she added, smiling, "except that this young
                  man invited me to attend with him, and hear a poem read by a friend of his, whom
                  he calls superior, profound, and many other nice adjectives. The friend evidently
                  has no taste; for he has been invited several times by Mr. Merlow, to come here
                  with him and call on me,—which the youth has never done. But not wanting to break
                  Mr. Merlow's heart over a small matter, I accepted his invitation, and we were to
                  hear the poem to-night. Now there's the whole story; and the point of it is, that
                  I shall be delighted, not to go with you, Charley, but to stay at home with you,
                  Stella."
               
               Charley Merlow's dark eyes leaped and capered at this sally.
               "Good!" he exclaimed, "but I hereby invite and implore your friend, Mrs. Torson,
                  to accompany us. Who knows but she may herself prefer hearing the poem, to the
                  enjoyment of your charming though solitary attention?"
               Thus appealed to, Stella said that she should be much pleased to go; that she
                  could not, in fact, be persuaded to withstand the temptation of such an
                  entertainment.
               Her decision settled the matter, and at the appointed hour they started for the
                  hall in which the exercises were to be held.
               On the way, Charley Merlow talked incessantly about his friend, Earnest Acton. The
                  subject of his poem was to be, "Chivalry."
               "It is a minor effort," said he, "what Earnest himself calls a little
                  affair,—something he has almost extemporized. I haven't seen it; but I am sure of
                  one thing—he never writes a line that is not thoughtful, at least. He has had a
                  more than ordinary inward experience, and never thinks or speaks from mere
                  authority. His mind has much less than the customary respect for names, and
                  perhaps much more than the customary veneration for men whom he regards as the
                  exponents of truth. It grasps individuals, standards and customs, not accepting
                  them because they are such, but demanding on what final and absolute grounds they
                  rest. Comparatively few think and act from such a stand-point."
               Stella was much interested in these observations. She was aware that friendship
                  easily praises the objects which attract it; but this criticism touched her own
                  experience, and a part of it seemed as though it might have been said of herself.
                  She felt that she already liked Mr. Merlow, and was prepared to look with favor on
                  his friend.
               As for Cora, she bantered, and laughed at her escort, the whole way, telling him
                  that he repeated Mr. Acton's ideas constantly, and was "a second little Bozzy,
                  with by no means a second Dr. Johnson."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VI.
               AS soon as Earnest Acton appeared on the rostrum, Stella remembered having
                  somewhere seen his face. But her attention immediately recurred to his poem, which
                  was as follows: 
                     
                        "In ages old, but when those lands were young
                        Which gave the fathers of our fathers birth;
                        When Europe, strong of arm and fierce of tongue,
                        Had newly broken from the sombre girth
                     
                     
                        "Of tangled forests which encompassed her;
                        When men almost as savage as the beast,
                        Had bristled out from wilds of oak and fir,
                        Slaying the Roman Empire for a feast;
                     
                     
                        "And by their strife to root all culture up,
                        Had shaken off a portion of their own
                        Huge shagginess—had learned to taste the cup
                        Of that refinement first despised alone;
                     
                     
                        "In those old times which wear the name of 'good,'
                        When worldly honor shone but from the sword;
                        When all of labor save the trade in blood—
                        The battle's reeking barter—was ignored;
                     
                     
                        "When kingship's pride was to dethrone a king;
                        A noble's, to subject nobility;

                        Which filled the medieval ear with song—
                        The voice of Chivalry—and then there came
                        These parting accents, as it throbbed along:—

               CHAPTER VII.
               "WELL, what do you think of my friend? and what about the poem?" inquired Charley
                  Merlow, of the two ladies, after the exercises of the evening had concluded.
               "Yes," replied Cora, "I supposed you would ask that, the first thing. Know, then,
                  that the poem was tolerable for a young man,—just passable—nothing more. There
                  wasn't a thing to laugh at from the beginning to the end of it,—not a single right
                  down spicy line, unless the one about the 'sacred soil, unlike all other dirt;'
                  and that was bitter.
               "It was a fling at the South, and our Southern brethren," she added, looking up
                  mischievously at Stella.
               Charley Merlow laughed.
               "Very well, Miss Lively," he said; "now we have your weighty opinion, which I know
                  you will hold at least five minutes; but, Mrs. Torson, may I ask for yours?"
               He had seen from the expression of her face, that his new acquaintance had
                  listened to Earnest with close attention and keen sympathy. Her eye had kindled
                  with his, and had softened as his voice was modulated to the key of some tender or
                  beneficent sentiment. It was evident that she had been deeply interested. But thus
                  far Charley knew nothing about her, except that she was a young widow from Boston,
                  rich, and accustomed, as he understood, to "the best society." He was very
                  naturally surprised, therefore, at this deliberate response which she gave to his
                  question:
               "I was not disappointed, Mr. Merlow, in your friend's poem. I will not speak like
                  our sprightly Cora here; but quite as I feel. The poem seems to me a brief history
                  of Chivalry, a criticism on it, and an impersonation, in the two songs, of its
                  real spirit in ancient and modern times. The distinction between the heroism of
                  the soldier and that of the self-sacrificing thinker, is clearly drawn, perhaps,
                  while I fancy that your friend's preference for the latter is more decided than he
                  has portrayed it. His allusions to pseudo Chivalry, which vaunts itself as real,
                  because six and a half centuries after Richard Cœur de
                     Lion, it still surrounds itself with the worst faults and barbarisms
                  of his epoch, is, as Cora asserts, bitter. I think nothing on that
                  point can be too bitter, if spoken from the indignation of justice, not from
                  anger. The closing lines of the poem, viewed from the highest possible
                  stand-point, are not the wisest that could be. They are local and temporary, their
                  application being to immediate time and place. I have sometimes thought that the
                  highest art should always close its efforts by lifting us out of locality into
                  what Plato has called 'that one sole science which embraces all:'—into insights of
                  the infinity of absolute wisdom, love, beauty. There the mind always finally loses
                  itself; there is the natural climax, the natural peroration of all its perceptions and endeavors.
                  But one can hardly compress the ordinary and actual, then time and space, into a
                  few stanzas which he is called upon to make interesting to a thousand different
                  listeners.
               "Chivalry," she continued, "in its early and usual sense, was, as the poem paints
                  it, the much-needed application of warfare, in a rude age, to justice,
                  magnanimity, love, mercy. And as, in the minds of the many, a special glory has
                  always hovered about the pursuit of arms, the era when the brilliant knight was
                  lawgiver, protector, lover, friend, has always lingered long both in memory and
                  imagination. But Chivalry itself—its spirit, its essence—can of course pertain as
                  much to an age of commerce, as to an epoch of tournaments and courts of love. It
                  is with us in the world; it has always been so. I think one of its most signal
                  examples, in the medieval, physical sense, was before us not long since at
                  Harper's Ferry. For the most exalted spiritual instance known, we must look back
                  through eighteen centuries, to Mount Calvary and the Cross."
               As Stella spoke thus, she had given herself wholly up to the impressions presented
                  to her mind, and for the moment had nearly forgotten where she was, or with whom
                  she was conversing. It is true that her first words were uttered partly with a
                  special design. She had been really charmed with Earnest, and she wished to know
                  him. It seemed as though he might be a friend with whom her inmost soul could
                  commune. So she had intended that her criticisms should not appear to Charley
                  Merlow as altogether commonplace, and that he should repeat them to his friend.
                  This inten- tion had soon been overpowered by the thoughts which pressed upon her,
                  and she had spoken even more ideally and enthusiastically than she
                  anticipated.
               "Upon my soul!" cried Cora, "how completely you sermonize! Did you ever preach,
                  over there in Boston, where everybody does such strange things? I shall have to
                  look after you, my dear; you never were quite like any one else. But in these
                  parts there is a great deal of decorum. The ladies think highly of Saint Paul:
                  they don't speechify much, unless, indeed, about the clothes and the frailties of
                  their neighbors. There now, your 'sprightly Cora,' as you call her, has delivered
                     her little address; here is the moral of it." And as they entered
                  the hall of her father's house, she put her arms about Stella and kissed her.
               Charley Merlow said but little. He appeared to have been stunned into a sort of
                  deferential silence, which pleased Cora amazingly. She kept looking at him in a
                  way which signified, "How now, Charley? Perhaps somebody else has a friend
                  too!"
               He soon took leave of the ladies, and made straight for Earnest.
               "Great guns, my boy! great guns!" he exclaimed, as soon as he saw the latter;
                  "I've a peach for you to peel now—blooming, ripe, and rosy—a desperately charming
                  widow, just—well, I should say just twenty-three. I took her with Cora, to-night,
                  to hear your poem, and asked her opinion of it. Straightway she threw bonnet and
                  strings clean over the moon in her criticism,—went up out of sight, with high art,
                  Plato, philosophy, Richard the lion-hearted, Jerusalem, and John Brown. You shall
                  go with me to see her, to- morrow night;
                  and if you don't talk the lights out of her, I'll disinherit you from every
                  penny-weight of my affection. Now don't say no: she's Aspasia, Lucretia (the
                  Mott), Cleopatra, Mary Queen of Scots, and Mother Ann Lee."
               Charley finally sobered down to an explanation of his meaning, and repeated
                  Stella's remarks as nearly as he could recall them.
               "Now there's no need of your reading and writing, twenty-five hours to-morrow," he
                  persisted; "you shall go to Cora's with me in the evening."
               Earnest said that he should certainly like to meet so charming a person as Charley
                  had described, and that, if he still insisted, after sleeping off his "afflatus,"
                  they would visit her and Cora on the coming evening.
               But the call was intercepted by a somewhat singular and unpleasant occurrence.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               THE next day, while Stella and Cora were in the street together, they were
                  accosted by an unusually bright, pretty child, who asked something from Stella in
                  charity. The little one's feet were bare, and she appeared to be clad in but two
                  garments—a tattered dress, and a small, miserable shawl, pinned about her head and
                  shoulders. But her features were delicate, her eyes were soft and truthful. She
                  seemed to possess the germs of intelligence and refinement, which even a tolerable
                  fate might develop into beauty and goodness.
               Stella's soul always shrank from extreme poverty, which so generally forces upon
                  its victims an existence scarcely more than animal. But the sight of a pretty
                  little girl, thrown on the street, with its vices, to beg, caused her the saddest
                  pang that she ever felt for the poor. She longed to raise every such child above a
                  need so wretched. But she could not help all, and she could not refuse to help
                  any, without feeling that perhaps she had added an impulsion to the ultimate
                  career of "one more unfortunate"—society's worst sorrow and disgrace. She gave the
                  child now before her a few bits of coin,
                  asked where she lived, and said that she would perhaps go to see her some time
                  during the day.
               "That child, at any rate," said she to Cora, "ought to have one decent change of
                  clothing, and a few kind words to touch her with hope. She shall have them. I will
                  do so much for her, if I cannot do more."
               Accordingly she procured a small bundle of such articles as were required, and
                  immediately after tea, she and Cora started to find the house where the child
                  lived.
               It was fast growing dark; but they expected to be back again in half an hour.
                  There were a few dubious clouds to be seen, and Stella took with her a small
                  iron-framed umbrella.
               Just east of Ironton, and on which, in fact, the city is partly built, is a range
                  of steep, high grounds, which the Irontonians call "the Hill." Somewhat less than
                  half-way up this hill, a street called High street, runs north and south, opposite
                  the central and upper portions of the city. One section of the street was at this
                  time but little more than a road, except that a double stone-wall, built against
                  the upper division of the hill, for purposes of drainage and for security against
                  landslides, made a good foot-path as well as carriage-way.
               It was near this portion of High street, that Stella and Cora went in search of
                  the little girl. It was some time before they could find her, and when their
                  errand was done, it had grown pretty dark. They thought nothing about it, however,
                  but stepped briskly along, intending to come down into the city by a different
                  cross-street. They soon came to the stone-wall; but as the road was hard and free
                  from dust, they continued on that.
               From the foot-path or sidewalk above them, which was often, in summer, the resort
                  of promenaders, one could look down the hill, seeing the portion of it below, then
                  the streets and houses, and extending the view, could have a fine prospect beyond
                  the city, north, south, and west. From the east side of the road, where Stella and
                  Cora were now walking, all this could be seen except the lower portion of the hill
                  itself.
               As they reached the most deserted part of the street, yet were within a hundred
                  and fifty yards of some small tenant houses, they were met by a coarse,
                  hard-featured young man, who, as he came near them, glanced quickly about him,
                  then attempted to snatch Cora's watch-chain, and tear the watch from her pocket.
                  Her shawl had blown aside, leaving the chain partly exposed, and the thief's quick
                  eye had detected it.
               But Cora's motions were almost as quick as his glance. She instinctively sprang
                  aside just enough to avoid his clutch, at the same time shouting with surprise and
                  terror. She placed her hands firmly over her watch, but trembled, and begged that
                  she might not be molested.
               "Give it up, right away!" said the man, "or I'll kill you!"
               "I think not!" sharply responded a voice, which this time astonished all parties;
                  and as the words were spoken, the blow of a fist, from a person running, sounded
                  from the face and teeth of the ruffian. It knocked him away from Cora, but though
                  he stumbled and staggered, he did not quite fall. He was a desperate as well as
                  cool fellow, and on recovering his bal-
                  ance—finding that his new antagonist was unarmed and breathing heavily, as though
                  exhausted—he drew a short club from under his coat, and struck the man with it,
                  partly upon his head, partly upon his arm, which was raised to protect the
                  head.
               "He will kill Mr. Acton," cried Cora. "Murder! murder!"
               Stella, too, screamed, and in her exasperation she struck the robber full across
                  the face with her umbrella, and broke it so that it held together only by the silk
                  covering.
               Half a minute had passed since he attempted to snatch the chain. Earnest Acton—for
                  it was he who had interfered—was on the ground, nearly senseless.
               But still another person was now seen approaching the group. He came running
                  toward them, with an uneven, bandy-legged gait, shouting, swearing, and
                  brandishing a huge knotted stick.
               "Wait till I git forninst ye, ye divl!" he exclaimed, with a savage Irish accent.
                  "Ye'll be in the middle uv Hill afore iver ye'll murther agin!"
               But the "divl," as he was called, would not wait. He saw that now he was fairly
                  foiled, and the best he could do for himself was to hurry away, which he did with
                  all the celerity his legs could command. In another instant he was out of reach,
                  and very soon out of sight.
               "Oh! it's Jerry Kay, it's Jerry Kay!" cried Cora, as the Irishman came up to them.
                  "Jerry, it's I—Cora Clandon; you came just in time; we were frightened almost to
                  death! Come and help Mr. Acton!"
               "Oh! the grace uv God now! and is it yersilf, Miss Clandon?" responded Jerry. "And
                  what wud that thafe uv the wurld be doin' wid ye? Luk at the way now he's kilt
                  Misther Acthon—the nischest young man in the city, that's allays had a good wurd
                  for me and the ould ooman! If it wasn't the damn bad pair uv ligs I have on me,
                  I'd uv been up to the schoundhrel and shlivered the brain out uv 'im!"
               And here, poor old Jerry Kay burst into tears of sorrow and wrath.
               "Misther Acthon, and are ye much hurted now?" sobbed he. "Shure ye wouldn't be
                  goin' to die for the sthroke of a blaggard!"
               But Earnest had received an ugly blow near the top of his head, which had stunned
                  him for the time, and left a gash from which the blood was flowing copiously. In a
                  short time, however, with the assistance of Jerry, he was able to rise. Supported
                  by him on one side, and by Stella on the other, he walked slowly to Jerry's house,
                  which was near by. There a bandage was extemporized by the "ould ooman" and the
                  young ladies, the blood was washed from his face, and at Jerry's urgent
                  solicitation, he took a "small smather uv whiskey."
               "Now, Jerry," said he, "if you can get me a carriage, I will ride home. Miss
                  Clandon, if I may, I will ask you and your friend to accompany me. The carriage
                  can leave me at my door, then carry you straight to yours."
               This proposal was at once accepted; for Ernest was pale and weak, and would be
                  liable to faint at any moment on his way home.
               "Mike," said Jerry, to a boy about fourteen years old, who had betaken himself to a corner, out of
                  the way,—"Mike, git yersilf sthraight dooun till the daypo, and bring up a
                  carriage—a nische one d'ye mind; and luk now, if iver ye got a lickin' in yer
                  life, think of the one ye'll git now, if ye'r long gone."
               Admonished by this very palpable suggestion, Mike soon returned with a
                  carriage.
               "Say now, Misther Acthon," said Jerry, after Earnest and the ladies had entered
                  it, "may I go dooun to luk at ye to-morry? Shure I'm thinkin' ye wudn't
                  objict."
               "Object! my good old friend?" replied Earnest, "of course not. Why should I? Come
                  down by all means, if you should feel like it; I shall be especially glad to see
                  you."
               "Ahah, now! luk a' that!" still continued Jerry. "But I'm remembrin' ye niver were
                  too proud—way up intirely over a poor man. Good luck t'ye, Misther Acthon; God
                  'lmighty bless yersilf an' the darlint ladies. Dthriver, kape yer eyes roound
                  aboout ye; for ye've got the most gintlemanly load uv the sexes that iver yer
                  mares was forninst."
               Saying this, Jerry bowed and scraped a still further adieu, while the carriage
                  rolled away.
               The next morning The Ironton Daily Pitchfork and Raker, contained
                  the following account of the event.
               
                  "A DARING ATTEMPT AT ROBBERY AND MURDER. A sad Catastrophe.—Last
                     evening, just at dusk, as Miss Cora Clandon, a worthy and estimable young lady
                     of our city, the daughter of Richard Clandon, Esq., was walking along High
                     street, in company with a lady friend, whose name we have not learned, they
                     were suddenly attacked by a ruffian, supposed to be the notorious Himmer
                     Gilspe, who demanded her watch and chain, threatening violence in case of
                     refusal.
                  "With rare presence of mind, Miss Clandon immediately placed her hands over her
                     watch, which is said to be a very valuable article, and importuned the
                     scoundrel to desist.
                  "At this moment, Earnest Acton, Esq., who was taking an evening walk,
                     approached High street by the steep, unfrequented acclivity between Crag and
                     Bowdry, having selected that mode of ascending the hill, as affording him the
                     most vigorous exercise. Of course he could not be seen, even when near the top
                     of the acclivity, by persons on the upper side of High street. The intended
                     robber deemed himself perfectly secure in his depredations, when suddenly he
                     was knocked down by a blow from Mr. Acton. But the young gentleman was unarmed,
                     and was, besides, much fatigued by his exertions in climbing the hill. The
                     ruffian, seeing this, drew a 'billy' and a knife, striking and stabbing him on
                     the head and neck.
                  "Meanwhile our old friend, Jerry Kay, well known about Bugsley Corners and the
                     Grumby Market, hearing the disturbance and cries of 'murder!' hastened to the
                     scene, bearning in hand his inevitable 'purty little cane,' as he terms it,
                     which many who have noticed it, will remember as a knotted 'shillaly' about the
                     size of a heavy flail. At his appearance the thief ran.
                  "If the precious villian should be detected, he will probably be found
                     considerably bruised, as apart from the punishment inflicted by Mr. Acton, Miss
                        Clandon's friend—who by no means
                     contented herself with fainting—broke an iron-framed umbrella, as we are
                     informed, three times across his face, while he was maltreating that gentleman.
                     Our principal informant (Jerry Kay himself) says he is sure 'she painted a very
                     nate picture of Purgatory about both eyes of 'im.' It is quite probable that
                     but for her coolness and pertinacious courage, Mr. Acton might have fared much
                     worse than he did. As it is, he was in a critical condition when we last heard
                     from him.
                  "Every effort should be put forth to find the detestable villain who was the
                     cause of this sorrowful calamity, and to bring him to condign punishment. Our
                     present police-force is not, we think, exactly what it should be, and not, as
                     we stated before the last election, what it would be, if in the
                     hands of the party we have the honor to represent. But we give due notice that
                     the least negligence or carelessness in looking after this matter, will not be
                     lightly criticised by the Pitchfork and Raker."
               
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               THE main points of this account, as we have seen, were true. Earnest Acton,
                  however, at ten o'clock the next morning, was sitting up in an easy chair, and was
                  pretty comfortable for one who had been so severely handled the previous night. He
                  was reading The Pitchfork and Raker, rather enjoying the article in
                  reference to the "daring attempt at robbery," etc., and smiling at the remembrance
                  of Jerry Kay, when the latter called, desiring to see him.
               "Is he sittin' up and dthressht did ye say now?" asked Jerry of the girl who went
                  to the door. "And I dramed the doctor had 'im kilt! Thanks to God! Shure I'm
                  thinkin' ye may show me up to 'im; but go an ax 'imsilf. Till 'im its Jerry
                  Kay."
               Jerry was of course invited in.
               A few minutes afterward, Stella and Cora called.
               They said they did not expect to see Mr. Acton, but had heard conflicting rumors
                  regarding him, and wishing to learn in the most direct manner how he really was,
                  they had stopped to inquire.
               Earnest heard their voices from the room in which he sat talking with Jerry, and
                  said, so that they heard him:
               
               "Request the ladies to walk in, if they have time and the wish to do so."
               "You will find here," he continued, with a smile, as he met them, "both the
                  vanquished opponent and the conquering hero; for our friend, Jerry, has come in to
                  see me."
               Their attention thus directed to Jerry, he arose, and suddenly dropping the upper
                  half of his body to a line nearly parallel with the floor, he made an exceedingly
                  angular but very deferential bow.
               "Good morning t'yes, ladies," said he. "I hope yes are both will after the
                  runcontry uv th' avenin'. Misther Acthon, I'm thinkin', is gittin' on fine, only
                  he's a little pale, like a sisther uv marcy. He'll be hardy agin in a couple uv
                  days."
               "And how is yer arm?" he inquired of Stella. "Wasn't it some pursuadin' welts ye
                  gave the thafe wid yer umbril! He'll think a wake was hild on his face, if he
                  looks in aere a glass this mornin'."
               Stella was slightly annoyed at this compliment to a sort of prowess which she was
                  far from priding herself upon; but smiling, she answered Jerry that her arm was
                  still in good condition, though she trusted that she should never be obliged to
                  use it again in the manner he alluded to.
               "I trust not, indeed," said Earnest, who had noticed her momentary annoyance;
                  "although now that we have all escaped with so little injury, I shall scarcely
                  regret, in one sense, having given you the trouble. Had I been armed, as sometimes
                  I am in the evening, perhaps I should have shot the man dead on the spot. By doing
                  so, I should have saved your womanly delicacy a few twinges of vexation;—for it
                  instinctively shrinks from striking a person;—but I should have had something it
                  may be to disturb me during my life. For the old Scandinavian
                  fierceness of the race shoots through our blood at such a sight as suddenly
                  appeared before me last evening, and is liable, for the time, to deprive us of all
                  considerateness. Yet I always feel that if, by any misfortune, I should kill even
                  the worst man on earth, the act would cloud my calmer moments with sadness. The
                  laws might justify it, but I fancy I should constantly see the dead with pity and
                  anguish."
               "And I, the divl a bit!" roared Jerry Kay. "Why, man! if ye'd a shot the thafe,
                  all yer sins wud been forgiven ye for that! I wudn't mind crackin' the head uv 'im
                  more nor a louse. Didn't Miss Clandon till me he said he wud be wiolent wid her if
                  she didn't give up the watch? Shure the baste hadn't a soul in 'im at all at all:
                  he was the manest scut intirely that iver unbuttoned a lip to threaten a
                  lady."
               Jerry had settled the point to his own satisfaction, and no one contradicted
                  him.
               The young ladies soon arose to go. After Cora had invited Earnest to call on her
                  and Mrs. Torson, as soon as he should be able to appear again in the street, she
                  turned to Jerry.
               "My good old friend," said she, "let me give you this;" and she tried to put a
                  gold eagle into his hand.
               "Don't think I mean to pay you for your kindness, by any such bit of
                  money: you were worth more to us than our gold can be worth to you; but you, and
                  your wife, and the boy all busied yourselves for us; so we want you to get a few little things to recall the
                  occasion, and to remind you how much we think of you."
               At first Jerry withdrew his hand. He looked at Cora, then at the piece of
                  gold.
               "Well, God bliss ye, Miss Clandon," he finally exclaimed, "I know ye've got plinty
                  more uv um, an' I'm thankful to God for it.. Ye raelly want to give it me now, I
                  know. Yis, I'll take it.
               "It's purty hard," he added, with a very extended smile, "for a poor divl to shut
                  his fisht agin a thing like that. Shure, Misther Acton, I know ye'll till me the
                  thruth: 'Tisn't ungintlemanly for me to be takin' the gould-pace, is it?"
               Earnest had viewed the scene, not without interest and emotion. Cora's hesitation;
                  her delicacy in impressing upon this poor Irishman, to whom ten dollars was
                  certainly a temptation, that she was not paying him for services, but rather
                  conferring a favor on herself in doing him a kindness; his reluctance to receive
                  compensation for what he had been so glad to do; his innate perception of her
                  feelings and the right of the matter:—all this was very touching to Earnest. When
                  Jerry looked up to him and made the final appeal to his judgment, there was a
                  bright, pleasant gleam on his face, there was also moisture in his eye.
               "Take it, Jerry," said he; "you would hurt Miss Clandon's feelings far more by
                  refusing it, than you would please yourself by accepting it."
               "Well, now, I thought jusht that," returned Jerry; "for that wud be the way wid
                  yersilf."
               "Ladies, if ye'll hould on, the half of a minit, I'll till ye a story about
                  Misther Acthon when he was a little boy, so, up to me hip.
               "He was fishin' dooun beyont there, at the dock, in a yawl that was tied to a
                  schooner. He got a bite, and began to pul up. It came tufer and tufer; and when
                  the thing got nare till the top of the wather, it was an ael nare the lingth uv
                  one uv yersilves, so it was. That ael was the divl. He was nigh till pulin'
                  Misther Acthon out of the yawl. I was goin' by jusht thin, and a nagur. Me and the
                  nagur tuk oursilves dooun into the yawl lively. Afther a while the three of us had
                  the ael in; and he was more nor the lingth uv the breadth uv the yawl. He was like
                  the schooner's cable. Well, well, wasn't Misther Acthon tickled thin? He hadn't
                  got a cint of money wid im; so what does he do but give the nagur the fish-line,—a
                  moighty nische fish-line it was too. Me, he takes along wid'im up to his fadther's
                  house, and afther measurin' the ael roound aboout and ivery way, he turns the
                  coddy over to me. I has a wathery mouth for aels, and this feller made a slammin'
                  dinner for me, and the ould ooman, and Mike, and siveral uv the naburs."
               "Not a very commendable business transaction on my part; was it, ladies?" said
                  Earnest, as the laughter subsided, which had arisen from Jerry's method of telling
                  the story, and still more from his gestures.
               "Perhaps it was so, after all, in the highest sense of all such transactions,"
                  replied Stella; and she looked at him with both of her deep, pure eyes so full of
                  frank kindness and sympathy, that he felt the glance penetrate and warm his blood,
                  while that beautiful face, in one of its loveliest moods, was impressed upon his
                  soul.
               
               "Yes," he responded, looking, in his turn, with that peculiar smile of mingled
                  sadness, earnestness, and gentleness, which is so often the reflection of a deep,
                  sensitive nature;—"yes, you are right; I have not received the last instalment in
                  the matter, I find, until now; but that alone should compensate me a thousand
                  times."
               This was said in so honest a manner, as if every word were weighed and completely
                  felt; with so little the appearance of any mere compliment of gallantry; and with
                  so rapid a change of subject, as though Earnest's delicate acuteness predicted
                  some slight pleasing embarrassment on her part, at the turn he gave to her
                  remark;—that, although a gentle tinge, like a ray of the sunset, consciously
                  glowed on Stella's cheek, her heart found no fault; she was pleased, and still
                  further charmed.
               "Now, Jerry," said Earnest, after the ladies had left them, "I am going to take a
                  glass of light wine which the doctor prescribed for this hour. If you were not an
                  old man, always accustomed to your 'wee drop,' I should hesitate to ask you to
                  drink. I am rather particular about it. But as it is, you must take a glass of
                  wine with me, or, if you prefer it, a glass of brandy. There is some brandy in the
                  house, made from the vineyard of a gentleman of this country—a friend of mine. It
                  is very nice. Would you rather have some of that?"
               "Thank yer honor," replied Jerry, "I will take a small, healthy
                  snifther uv that, if ye plase; but I'm no grate jooudge uv th'article. If ye shud
                  put the bist glass uv brandy forninst me, and the worst, maybe I cudn't till ye
                  the differ between um, but I cud dthrink both."
               Jerry took his "small, healthy snifther," which by no means restrained his
                  loquacity. He sat quiet for a moment, then broke out thus:
               "I say, Misther Acthon, that's a very nische lady with the dark dhress—the Miss
                  Thorson, I blave ye called her. What a swate eye she has; it almost milts out uv
                  her hed intirely on ye. Shure I'm thinkin' she has a punchang for you, as the Miss
                  de Gusty says aboout the roses she picks in the gardin."
               "A what?" asked Earnest.
               "A punchang, shure," persisted Jerry;—"a takin' to a thing—a likin' of it."
               "Oh! yes, I understand!—a penchant," laughed
                  Earnest.
               "Well, I don't know about any special penchant
                  that Mrs. Torson may have for me; but I suspect she is a noble, kind-hearted,
                  intelligent young lady, and such a person almost always finds something to like in
                  everybody. Don't you think so?"
               "Indade I do, thin," Jerry answered; "and they ain't proud nather: they allays
                  spakes to a poor man. There's the Gineral—Gineral Bull; he allays siz, 'Jerry, how
                  ar ye,' when he mates me; and he's one of the grate min intirely—boss of all the
                  sogers roound aboout. But there's more uv um nor doesn't spake nor luk at me. But
                  they's the cods—the small fish wid very disfragrant airs. The min wid the high
                  stations, like the Gineral, and the min wid the brains in um—like yersilf, Misther
                  Acthon, savin' yer modesty—thim's the min that don't go by me."
               Thus Jerry rattled away for several minutes, till be thinking himself that perhaps
                  Earnest had been sitting up too long, and
                  was becoming too much fatigued, he snatched up his hat and stick, and saying that
                  it would be too bad to kill Mr. Acton with himself after saving him from a thief,
                  the strange old man hurried away into the street.
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               "IT seems to me, our dear young widow has been struck by something. What is her
                  dream all about?"
               Such were the words which Cora addressed to Stella, after their interview with
                  Earnest Acton, and when they had proceeded some distance toward Cora's home, while
                  Stella had remained silent and pensive.
               "I was thinking," Stella answered, "how very dissimilar are different people, and
                  yet how nearly alike at heart are all of us who are well disposed, and who trust
                  ourselves to our own natures."
               "Yes," suggested Cora, with a little chuckle, "and how much nicer, how much more
                  sensitive and elegant some young men are, whom one meets occasionally, than most
                  others whom one sees every day."
               "Perhaps so, if you will, my dear Cora," was Stella's reply; "but we must not form
                  such preferences too hastily."
               "Oh, no! certainly not," said Cora; "and especially if we are from Athens the Hub;
                  if we are scholarly and profound; if we are staid, dignified, queenly, and have
                  arrived at the venerable age of twenty-three. But if we should happen to be myself
                  now—a pleasant body only twenty-two, who
                  dearly loves her friend, but who doesn't think a great deal, and whose mouth opens
                  easily to chatter or to kiss,—why, then we should declare that we can't help
                  entertaining preferences rather nimbly and speedily; we should own right up, for
                  instance, that we liked Charley Merlow amazingly, and were inclined just now to
                  take a friend of his into our heart, but generously forebore doing so, because we
                  thought the friend himself would like a dear friend of ours much better than he
                  would like us."
               "Child of twenty-two," retorted Stella, with mock gravity, "do you settle fates
                  too, with as much celerity as you form preferences? What have I to do with your
                  Charley's friend? How do you know that we have seen anything in special to admire
                  in each other?"
               "How do I know? Why, bless you, I feel it. The heart has big eyes sometimes, even
                  when the head isn't so very spacious. When Charley Merlow and I were setting our
                  caps for each other, didn't he use to look at me in the very way I saw you look at
                  Mr. Acton, and the very way, moreover, in which Mr. Acton returned the look? Of
                  course he did. I suppose Charley and I didn't fully know what we were doing at
                  first; but we found out, after awhile."
               If Cora had thoroughly understood Stella, and the position in which she had been
                  placed by Mr. Torson's will, she would not have talked to her as she was now
                  doing, partly in earnest, partly in jest, and partly to afford herself the
                  pleasure of referring to Charley Merlow. But Stella had said as little as possible
                  concerning her husband. All that Cora knew about him, was that Stella had married
                  him reluctantly, that afterward they had lived together kindly, though not with
                  perfect congeniality, and that now Stella had discarded her mourning, as also the
                  frequent mention of his name. She had heard the will spoken of as a strange one;
                  but had not learned the particulars of it.
               At first Stella could return badinage for badinage; but as she continued listening
                  to her friend's playful, bantering, confiding words, feeling that Cora's heart was
                  happy in its love and trust of one who seemed worthy of its overflowing affection;
                  that her own heart, which throbbed with such vehement, impassioned, exalted
                  emotions, had found no rest for its yearnings; that now it could scarcely dare
                  hope for such rest in any event;—now, too, that she had seen one who, as she
                  acknowledged to herself, caused the suggestion that her youthful vision of love
                  might be a possibility in the world:—poor Stella, with all this in her soul, how
                  could she suppress the single crystal drop that melted through those long, dark
                  lashes, suffusing with still deeper tenderness and beauty the look of affection
                  and sympathy which beamed from her eye upon her joyous companion.
               Cora noticed it, and her playful smile was immediately an exile. A troubled cloud
                  of sadness and regret spread itself over her face, and not a trace of lightness
                  was left. But they were near her father's house, and she did not speak again until
                  they had reached her own room, where they went to dispose of their street apparel.
                  She hastily threw off her own, then, going to Stella, untied her bonnet-strings,
                  drew off her mantle, and putting an arm about her friend's waist, hastened into
                  the little parlor adjoining, where, seating herself in front of the cheery grate, she pulled the young widow
                  down into her lap.
               "What have I done to you, my dear Stella?" she inquired, now just ready to weep.
                  "I am so full of nonsense that I am always wounding the feelings of somebody. But
                  I did not mean anything by what I said. I should think you would have known the
                  harmless sound of my rattle-box, especially when I am so fond of you. I know you
                  are not frivolous and giddy, but very thoughtful and good. Was I foolish enough to
                  attribute to you, even in a joke, any injustice to memories of the past? What was
                  it, my darling friend?"
               "Why, nothing, Cora, child,—nothing, at any rate, worth wet eyes; so don't let me
                  see tears between your laughing lids, even if one foolish drop did fall from my
                  own. I have but few memories of the past to trouble me in the way you were
                  thinking of. I was only touched by your happiness, and was comparing, perhaps
                  selfishly, the fulness of your heart with the void in my own, though Heaven knows
                  I would not take a single joy from your life, if by doing so I could wreathe mine
                  with constant delights. But you are frank and honest, my Cora; you are
                  sympathizing; you can be reticent too, if you know I wish it. I will tell you a
                  story of my past three or four years, which you are not wholly acquainted with. I
                  trust the good angels will not let me be unjust in the very manner you were
                  fearful that I shrank from being; for I shall speak to you of my husband,—a man
                  whom I remember with kindness only, not with love, not even with complete
                  respect."
               Then she told Cora of her marriage; of her reluct- ance to it at the beginning; of
                  the wide difference between Mr. Torson's nature and tastes and her own; of her
                  struggles, as a conscientious woman, to love him, which only ended in driving
                  their souls still farther apart; and last, she gave the particulars of the will.
                  But she told nothing of her husband's rudest vices,—for there were some such to be
                  locked forever in her own breast; she palliated some of his harshest evident
                  faults, and appeared to tremble lest any revengeful sentiment should enter into
                  her statement.
               "You see, Cora," she said, in conclusion, "that Mr. Torson did not mean to be a
                  very vicious man. I don't know but many a better girl than I would have been
                  content in my position. He wished to leave me, too, with every material comfort,
                  and his will was largely generous in that respect. But my integrity was almost the
                  only one of my qualities he would trust. It was impossible for him to understand
                  me. Those of my virtues that I knew to be the highest before God and man, he
                  regarded as visionary weaknesses—even wicked absurdities. I could look through his
                  mind and comprehend his motives, because I stood above both,—having experienced,
                  as it were, his characteristics, in my commonest and lowest moods; while he could
                  not know what his nature had never reached. He was honest, in the ordinary
                  business sense; he was lavish, not to say liberal, of mere physical
                  surroundings,—wanting me to have everything that conventionality required; but he
                  had, and could have, no conception of the demands of an aspiring soul. He was of
                  the earth and was earthy,—a common man, who had accumulated a third of a million
                  of dollars, and in that, con- sidered the
                  great aim of life accomplished. He was no worse than a thousand others I saw every
                  day,—my heart has always acknowledged it;—and for him, as for all such, it has
                  never had—at least for more than an occasional moment—any feeling harsher than
                  pity.
               "Well, I have told you of my husband. You know something about my own views, and
                  what I conceive to be my duties. You see the position in which I am
                  placed—virtually forbidden to love;—my heart pitted against my conscience, with a
                  third of a million for the wager. If love should win, I shall not only be poor,
                  which, perhaps, I could bear well enough, but the money will be used to crucify
                  conscience and duty themselves. I have never loved; but God knows how dearly I
                  could love. You have sometimes attributed superiority of intellect to me. Others
                  have been kind enough to do so. Some have called me mental and frigid. It is true,
                  that my heart, yearning for deep, full, responsive throbs, baffled by the living,
                  has turned to the dead. I could not be the bride of a beloved, for I found no one
                  whose nobleness forced me to adoration. So I gave myself up to the lovers and
                  poets of all ages and all climes. Their sentences and songs wooed my
                  spirit—pressed themselves to my inmost life. They knew me. Our souls sympathized
                  in truth, in justice, in beauty. Thus was a vacant place in my heart partly
                  tenanted, while thus it could not, of course, be wholly filled.
               "You spoke of Mr. Acton. I was not troubled by that. As I have talked with you so
                  freely now, why should I hesitate to tell you, as far as I know, the impression I
                  have received from him? I don't love him, certainly. How could I so soon? I don't
                  believe in 'love at first sight.' A person's first glance, a single word, a tone
                  of voice, may strike vividly and pleasurably upon some related chord of our
                  nature, and oblige memory to reproduce it a hundred times. We want to see the
                  glance, to hear the word again. If other properties correspond to this, and the
                  whole nature inclines to us, we love. My heart would never risk the mention of
                  love for one I had seen but two or three times. We all have some good phases; we
                  all have so many bad ones!
               "Yet I will own that Mr. Acton has revived visions of mine that had almost faded
                  away; that I began to see vanish with considerable resignation. Here is a young
                  man who suggests to me, by his presence, that the earth could perhaps afford me
                  the happiness of pouring out my whole soul into another. But by the time I have
                  seen him again, it may quite easily be, that through some one of his words or
                  actions, the veil will fall once more over my eyes, the dreams still be lifeless.
                  And perhaps I ought to tremble if it were not so."
               "I don't think you ought to do anything of the kind," cried Cora, who had listened
                  to her friend, first with glances of sorrowing sympathy; then with flushes of
                  indignation and scorn, as she gave the particulars of Mr. Torson's will; and then
                  with patient silence while she drew her inferences of a general nature.
               "It was monstrous to fetter you so! How can you speak with a sort of kind,
                  reasoning indifference of so mean a man? I would have soaped the stairs to break
                  his neck! No, I wouldn't, either; but I would love somebody, if I could, with all my heart, now he had
                  taken himself decently out of the way. You needn't smile: I would, anyhow! How
                  ridiculous it was of the conceited old dollar-grab, to say that no other sort of
                  man than himself amounted to anything, or would be able to take care of you!
                  That's all he knew—the old stomach! I'm glad you didn't love him any more than you
                  did. But you shall love Mr. Acton now, if you like, or anybody but my Charley. Let
                  the money go to the dogs. More can be got. I shall have plenty, I suppose, and you
                  can have some of that. And if your ideas are right, God will take care of
                     them. How is a big pile of pennies going to outweigh
                  Providence?"
               Cora stopped to breathe, and laughed at her own questions and statements. Stella
                  could not help joining her.
               "True, my dear Miss Impetuous," she said, when Cora was ready to listen: "No
                  amount of money, no mountain even, of present wrong, should at all trouble our
                  serene faith in the ultimate right. But that is scarcely the question. Would it be
                  possible, in any case, for me to do as much by yielding to love,
                  toward performing the duties I regard highest in life, as a large fortune, hurled
                  directly upon them, could do against them?"
               "Well," responded Cora, "I don't know: but I think God intended we should enjoy
                  such a dear blessing as love."
               "Certainly, Cora; He intends we should enjoy every dear blessing; He made us to
                  enjoy; but He made us to do our duty first and foremost; for that, in the end, is
                  always the sweetest, the loftiest enjoyment."
               "Yes, I suppose so;" still insisted Cora: "but a body would think that in a case
                  like this, you would be the last to be hampered and imposed upon. You value money
                  so lightly; it passes through your hands so easily, and, as I have often thought,
                  with a kind of contemptuous indifference. You know everything best, my dear
                  Stella; but let me ask you a question on your own ground. I've heard you speak
                  with enthusiasm of certain men in this country, for instance, as the leaders of
                  great reforms. Now my good papa, and Captain Bub, my brother, don't think much of
                  these men. But you do, and Charley Merlow does. But take one of these notables—say
                  Mr. Curtis. Do you think that any sum of money, used by common or bad men against
                  the truths he utters in his beautiful way, could be at all the measure of his
                  influence?"
               "Surely not, my sweet little Meno," answered Stella; "but what then?"
               "Not Meno, if you please," said Cora, with much pretended dignity; "for I read
                  somewhere, the other day, that he was the man that Socrates twisted out of his
                  sandals so neatly that he couldn't tell the meaning of the very things he had
                  talked about a hundred times. Let me cure you of the illusion that I am any other
                  than Socrates himself. You acknowledge, then, that no sum of money could measure
                  the influence of a great man?"
               "Yes, Socrates," laughed Stella, "you are going right at it in your ancient
                  method, I find."
               "Well, now," continued Cora, "haven't I heard you say that one of your friends, whom you regard
                  as among the greatest minds of the time, has often acknowledged that more than
                  half of his power and perseverance came from the heroic sympathy and encouragement
                  lavished on him by his wife? You know I have heard you say it. Now, finally, you
                  could love only a superior man, and you know well enough that nobody in creation
                  could hold such a man up to his task of greatness and goodness, better than
                  yourself. So, unless you would cut a man's influence in two, and spoil it wholly,
                  by declaring that your half in it were worth less than some fellow's money-bag,
                  I'm sure my argument 'has laid you out,' as the boys say, 'flat and clean.'"
               "Precisely, my Cora," was Stella's response; "I fancied I knew the end you were
                  approaching, and have frequently thought of it myself. But I should be obliged to
                  have a great deal of confidence in my own worth before I should dare avail myself
                  of your inferences.
               "However, now that we have finished arguing, can you tell me anything more than I
                  have already learned about the young man who was the cause of the argument? What
                  do you know of your Charley's friend? I shall be with you several weeks, and shall
                  meet him. I shall be enticed to his acquaintance, for the study of a marked human
                  soul that has come to me differently from others, if for nothing else. I am
                  interested in him, and feel curious concerning his history. What has Charley
                  Merlow told you about him?"
               Cora felt, and was determined to feel, that Stella, in case her great, noble soul
                  should flame into passion, would not be called upon to sacrifice its fondness, as
                  she seemed to contemplate. Something of this prepossession might have colored the
                  account she gave of Earnest; for she spoke of him ardently and sincerely, though
                  partly still with the capricious pleasantry in which she delighted.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XI.
               ALMOST all I know about him," she began, "Charley has told me; but Charley, as you
                  have observed, is very fond of him, and talks about him a great deal. They have
                  known each other ever since they were children. The way they became acquainted was
                  odd, and a bit romantic; but ask Charley to tell you that part of the story
                  himself. You won't have to ask him but once. He would spend the day, any time, in
                  conversing with you about Earnest. They used to live in the same town, somewhere
                  in Massachusetts,—I forget the name of it. Earnest came here when he was a little
                  boy, ten or eleven years old, and afterwards Charley came on and stayed awhile
                  with him, attending the same school. Charley is rather older than Earnest, though
                  he looks younger. Earnest's face is so quiet and meditative;—I suppose that is the
                  reason. He has entirely changed, Charley says, since he was about fifteen. Before
                  that, he used to be full of activity and sport,—not what you would call a
                  downright bad boy, but always ready to run, frolic, be saucy, or fight. Isn't it a
                  shame that little boys all will fight? They're not half so nice as
                  little girls. My brother, Captain Bub, used to worry the life out of me. He would
                  have had a bloody nose every day, if papa hadn't talked to him, and whipped him,
                  and shamed him constantly. He went into the army, at last, as it was. But he has
                  sobered down into a very pleasant relation.
               "Charley and Earnest were not a great deal together, for the few years before they
                  became young men. But they used to correspond; and at last Charley came to
                  Ironton, and went into business. I have known him a year, and he has started
                  several times to bring Earnest here; but something has occurred to prevent, on
                  each occasion. So we have known each other well enough, have bowed as we met in
                  the street, yet we had hardly spoken a dozen words to each other, until that
                  scapegrace tried to steal my watch."
               "Well," inquired Stella, "what has Earnest been doing, all his life? That, you
                  know, is one of the first questions we all ask about each other. What profession,
                  or business, has he been engaged in?"
               "He hasn't any profession," replied Cora; "and now, I believe, he isn't in any
                  business. A little while ago, he was with Mr. Wether, a produce merchant,—as a
                  salesman and accountant, I suppose. But he had a good deal of leisure, which he
                  occupied by reading and hard study. Charley says he understands business very
                  well, but has little taste for it. Besides, some of the most customary
                  transactions connected with it, appear to him so hard and selfish as to be almost
                  dishonest. He says that, particularly in speculative seasons, when he has stood
                  and regulated the price of a product more by one's need than by its real
                  value,—stretching the market a little, if possible,—squeezing out the last cent,—he has felt that, although pleasing
                  his employer and showing the smartness of a salesman, he was pretty nearly picking
                  a pocket; only he was doing it lawfully, and more dexterously than the coarse
                  blackleg. When, too, he has seen Mr. Wether selling a cargo of grain or salt;
                  worming the price up to the highest notch; declaring he would not sell so low to
                  any other man, and, in his excitement, meaning it, although he would say the same
                  thing to the next comer;—declaring, protesting, whining even in the voice of an
                  old woman, all for ten or twenty extra dollars, on perhaps five thousand;—then the
                  clerk has pitied the employer, who had grown rich while his face had grown narrow
                  and pinched, and while his soul had been crammed into his purse.
               "When Charley told me this, I said I didn't think his friend had cause to feel
                  so;—that it was necessary for people to have money, and, as they couldn't do
                  without it, they must try their best to get it. Charley said yes, and told me
                  Earnest saw the fact as plainly as anybody; that he liked business men, and often
                  declared that the very excess of the accumulative spirit, which he deprecated for
                  himself, was the means of developing vast material resources;—levelling mountains,
                  filling up swamps, making corn grow, and comforts increase. 'You mustn't think,'
                  he continued, 'that Earnest despises any class of men, or sort of vocation. He
                  says that men are dependent on each other throughout, and are brothers in spite of
                  themselves; that he should be without a coat and a breakfast, if it were not for
                  some enterprising tailor or butcher among his friends.'
               "Then Charley went on to tell me a lot of stuff about its being right for men to
                  do what they think right, until they can take higher views and so higher grounds
                  of action; and about its being right, in that sense, for men to do things that
                  Earnest could not do. He told me that I mustn't judge such a person by common
                  rules; for he was rather a representative of the future, when men would be better,
                  than a mere dweller in the present time. Perhaps I didn't quite understand all
                  these nice distinctions. At any rate, I'm not going to risk getting into the dusk
                  myself, by trying to bring them to the light for you."
               "But in spite of himself and his ideas, Mr. Acton did, it seems, sell produce for
                  Mr. Wether, and keep accounts for him," said Stella.
               "Yes," answered Cora; "but he never liked it, Charley says, even at first, when a
                  mere boy; though he always had the reputation of attending to it conscientiously
                  and well. But, according to his friend and my oracle, he wasn't made for success
                  in that direction. He was too thoughtful, scrupulous, and independent.
               "You remember the passage in 'Corinne,' that we used to read at school:
               "'Les hommes frivoles sont très-capables de devenir habiles dans la direction de
                  leur propres intérêts; car, dans tout ce qui s'appelle la science politique de la
                  vie privée, comme de la vie publique, on réussit encore plus souvent par les
                  qualités qu'on n'a pas, que par celles qu'on possède. Absence d'enthousiasme,
                  absence d'opinion, absence de sensibilité, un peu d'esprit combiné avec ce trésor
                  négatif, et la vie sociale proprement dite, c'est-à-dire la fortune et le rang,
                  s'acquièrent ou se maintiennent assez bien.'
               
               "Now I missed my lesson once, on this same choice bit of French, and I've never
                  seen any truth or beauty in it since; but I remember it only too well. Charley
                  quoted it in reference to his friend; and I could anticipate him at every
                  word,—not allowing him to air his scholarship singly, you perceive. He declared
                  that nothing could be better applicable to Earnest; and that every syllable of it
                  was true. He said that he met, every day, a score of his friends, who had grown
                  rich far more from qualities which they had not, than from those which they had;
                  that 'absence of enthusiasm, absence of opinion, absence of sensibility, a little
                  smartness'—say a little more than the mere average—not only 'acquire and maintain
                  fortune and rank, but are always the absolute and necessary foundation of
                  fashionable power and respectability.
               "'For,' said he, 'superiority is inevitably trying to improve conventionality,
                  while mediocrity struts satisfied with it, and is active and important in
                  presenting and insisting upon its forms.'
               "That is the way Charley sermonizes to me. But, you see, he knows a thing or two,
                  as well as Earnest.
               "In his opinion, his friend has, of course, just the reverse of the dear Madame de
                  Staël's requisites for fashionable success. He has enthusiasm, opinion,
                  sensibility, and almost no 'smartness,' in the sense, at least, of that
                  calculative sharpness which thrives itself by the suppression and injury of
                  others.
               "You have seen plainly enough that he has some strange ideas. In fact, his ideas
                  about religion, politics, and everything are strange. But I believe, in my heart,
                  he is a good fellow, or Charley wouldn't think so much of him. Besides, my dear
                  Stella, I can't help thinking he is a great deal like you. You and he would make a
                  right nice match,—the most harmonious pair in existence. I'm sure you are bound to
                  like each other.
               "Don't interrupt me now: I'm going to tell you something more about him.
               "While with Mr. Wether, he grew from a boy to a man. His mind formed, and on many
                  subjects he differed from his employer. I know Mr. Wether. He is a kind-hearted,
                  quick-tempered man, well-meaning and honest, but old-fashioned, narrow-minded, and
                  prejudiced. Earnest never talked much with him, because he knew that the old
                  gentleman was fixed in his convictions, and because he thought it wasn't in good
                  taste to force discussion where it would be of no use. But Mr. Wether was
                  aggressive in his views, and often very severe in his comments upon men whom
                  Earnest regarded as among the greatest and best in the world. At such times, when
                  directly addressed, he always said exactly what he thought. Charley used to ask
                  him why he didn't smooth the subject over, and let it drop.
               "'Not at all,' he replied; 'when a person asks me a question, he shall be
                  answered. The honesty which would preserve me from taking money from a man's till,
                  would never permit me to give him a dishonest opinion. If I could do one of these
                  things, I could do both.'
               "It seems to me, he carried the point too far; but that was what he said.
               "After awhile, Mr. Wether began to look on Earnest as an Abolitionist, then as an
                  Infidel. The old gentleman is very
                  religious,—a strong Presbyterian, and a constant reader of the
                     Observer.
               
               "By the way, it was over that newspaper that he and Earnest at last fell
                  completely out with each other.
               "Mr. Wether began a conversation, and quoted the Observer to
                  maintain something or other, when Earnest called that journal itself in question.
                  He said it wasn't always more scrupulous than even the Herald. For
                  only a few days before, he had seen a sentence of Theodore Parker's warped and
                  misconstrued by it in the most dishonest and shameful manner. Mr. Wether defied
                  him to prove it. Earnest found the paper, and showed him that it quoted Theodore
                  Parker as saying: 'Since my eighth year, I have had no fear of God,' and then it
                  took the text: 'the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,' and expatiated
                  on Theodore Parker's infidelity and wickedness.
               "'Well, now,' said Earnest, 'hear the whole sentence as it is:—Since my
                     eighth year I have had no fear of God, only an ever greatening love and
                     trust. Your paper, Mr. Wether, cut a sentence in two, and pilfered half
                  of it to defame a great man.'
               "This was too much for Mr. Wether. He couldn't see anything wrong on the part of
                  his theological weekly, but he was very indignant at Earnest.
               "A few weeks afterwards it was whispered, at a meeting of the Ladies' Sewing
                  Society of the reverend Mr. Defogy's church (Mr. Wether is a member of it), that
                  the young 'infidel and abolitionist,' Earnest Acton, had been tolerated quite long
                  enough by his employer, and that, in another month, his place was to be occupied
                  by a more pious and useful member of society. It was Deacon Jewer, of their own
                  church. Deacon Jewer was twenty years older than Earnest, and had himself been a
                  merchant. But fire and flood had suddenly broken him down.
               "'What can be done for him?' asked one of the Greeds—his particular friends—and
                  Mrs. Crutch and Dea. Longswell, at a circle held two or three weeks before the one
                  that I spoke of.
               "'Perhaps Mr. Wether could be persuaded to change assistants,' suggested another
                  of the Greeds.
               "'What a fortunate suggestion,' said Mrs. Crutch; 'and undoubtedly it would be a
                  pious duty to bring about such a change. I have heard sad reports about that
                  fellow Acton; and they say he hasn't any reverence for God, or respect for good
                  people. He told Mrs. Orter, the other day, that I was a woman who meant well
                  enough, but was a busy-body and a gossip, and that my superior righteousness was
                  all in my eye. What a vulgar expression wasn't it? and everybody knows that I
                  never gossip, but only say what comes into my head, and what is on everybody's
                  tongue. I think we had better use our exertions for Deacon Jewer. I know Mrs.
                  Wether, very well: she is an intimate friend of mine. She is very partial to Mrs.
                  Jewer too. She has much influence over her husband: some say, infact, that she
                  wears the——Well, I don't like to use every common phrase that we hear in the
                  wicked world; but I have often been told that she manages matters much in her own
                  way.'
               "O Stella! I thought I should die laughing, when Charley told me all this, and imitated the
                  different persons, some of whom I knew very well."
               "But how did the affair terminate?" asked Stella.
               "Oh!" said Cora, the conversations at the Sewing Circles were of course repeated,
                  and it wasn't long before the reports came round to Earnest. He went immediately
                  to Mr. Wether, stated their substance, and asked if it was true. He thought, if
                  so, he ought to have been informed of it as soon as the old ladies from whom he
                  had indirectly heard. Yet he had few doubts on the subject. Mr. Wether coughed a
                  few times, tugged away at the muscles of his throat, and finally said: 'Yes, he
                  had thought it best to make a change.' Earnest found no fault; and Deacon Jewer
                  soon presented himself.
               "Some of Earnest's friends called him foolish,—altogether too docile and easy.
               "'Put the accounts into a fog,' said one or two of them: 'make everything as hard
                  as possible.'
               "'No indeed,' said Earnest; 'I have not been treated quite after my own heart, as
                  no breath of fault or warning ever came to me. But what of that? Men must think
                  and act according to their light, Mr. Wether as well as I. I am not docile and
                  easy, but tough and heady. I don't think that a single trader, or a church-full of
                  his goodish friends, can be a feather in my path; especially if God has given me
                  anything worth doing on his earth. And if not, what matter little circumstances of
                  this kind, one way or the other?'
               "That was an odd view to take, wasn't it, Stella? It seems to me, Earnest has no
                  appreciation of the events and interests which make up the life of our kindly,
                  good and bad, every-day people of the world; but looks so intently upon the great
                  that he forgets there is a common and a little.
               "But Charlotte Bronte says something like that, of one of her characters in 'Jane
                  Eyre,' doesn't she?
               "At any rate, I don't altogether like such people. Charley suits me much better
                  than Earnest would. That's fortunate for you, my lady: who knows but
                     I might get him, if I should try?
               "The very indignation he felt over the affair I've been telling you about, seemed
                  only an indignation of the head. He disliked it because he thought it ought to be
                  disliked: scarcely more because he had been its victim, than as though he hadn't
                  been at all interested in it. Here's philosophy for you, perhaps,—mental power,
                  with other 'lofty tumbling,'—but where's the flesh and blood?
               "No, positively; I wouldn't have him. I should find, some fine morning, that the
                  man had dissected himself, to ascertain or confirm some theory or other.
               "Mr. Wether he regards with no unfriendly feeling, but merely as one more specimen
                  of the genus homo, to be encountered thankfully,
                  considered attentively, then shelved in his cabinet. The same with Deacon Jewer.
                  To Earnest, the Deacon, too, is merely pictorial,—regarded as part of a scenic
                  effect; though he had some reason to disrelish him before they came directly in
                  each other's way.
               "He laughed with Charley, a while since, and told him the Deacon would be a far
                  more valuable employé than himself, being sure
                  to save every penny, which he knew how to
                  value above all things; and that his efforts, indeed, had already been
                  praiseworthy as an agent for others.
               "It appears that, several years ago, a pew in Mr. Defogy's church fell into the
                  hands of Earnest's father, for some debt, or through some business transaction,
                  and was estimated to be worth about a hundred dollars. The old gentleman Acton is
                  quiet and easy; and believing, as Charley says, less in theology and more in
                  religion, than Mr. Defogy and his congregation, he seldom used the pew himself, or
                  was present by the proxy of any member of his family. So Deacon Jewer, Deacon
                  Longswell, and the other trustees let the pew and pocketed the proceeds;—'for the
                  Lord, of course,' added Earnest; 'for no one ever supposed they did it for
                  themselves.'
               "The paternal Acton, hearing of the disposal of his pew, made no objection to the
                  result, but disliked the method. The easy man felt as though there would have been
                  some propriety in consulting him in the matter. He was content that they should
                  use the pew for the occupancy of strangers; he said that he would give it to the
                  church right out, if he could afford to do so; for, although Mr. Defogy's
                  preaching wasn't very high, nor wholly Christian, still his church and his sermons
                  did much good, by holding up even to their standard, certain men who wouldn't
                  believe in anything better, and who would doubtless be worse than they were, if
                  they couldn't believe in these. But he said he couldn't give the pew absolutely
                  away; and as the trustees had taken it to themselves to let, he wished them to
                  have a legitimate title to it, and would sell it to them for fifty dollars, half
                  its estimated value. The matter was referred to Deacon Jewer, and he offered
                     fifteen.
               
               "'Yes!' exclaimed Earnest, 'if I were the Lord, and would own that church, I would
                  certainly displace any such individual as I am myself now conscious of being, for
                  the sake of having Deacon Jewer attend to my affairs. How, then, can I blame Mr.
                  Wether for wanting so valuable a person?'
               "It was horrible in him to say so, wasn't it, Stella? Yet Charley persists in
                  telling me that his friend has more real, sensible reverence for God, than Mr.
                  Defogy's whole assembly have.
               "Now, Stella, I've told you almost all I know about the man you're going to break
                  your heart over; and the bell has just been touched for dinner. Let's go down. Pa
                  will wait for us at table."
               Thus Cora finished, or rather broke off, her chatty, rambling account of Earnest
                  Acton, and she and Stella, with their arms around each other, went to join Mr.
                  Clandon in his dining-room.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XII.
               IN the evening Charley Merlow called. He had just come from Earnest, he said, who
                  was quite as well as when the ladies had seen him in the morning, and would be out
                  in a day or two.
               "Then," Charley continued, "I shall bring him here. We were coming last night; but
                  the High-street adventure spoiled our plan. How glad I am, Cora, that neither you
                  nor Mrs. Torson sustained any injury from that rascal Gilspe, or whoever he
                  is."
               "And I am quite as much delighted," said Stella, "that your kind friend fared no
                  worse than he did. Cora and I have been speaking of him to-day, and I already know
                  him sufficiently well to appreciate many reasons for your attachment to him."
               "As for Earnest," replied Charley, "he takes the matter so complacently, pitying
                  himself so little, that I may as well do the same. He regards the occurrence as
                  one more item of experience; the thief, as an individual who aided him to know
                  from the fact itself, how indignation rises against villainy, and how pleasant it
                  is to thwart a ruffian; his pains he watches, to see what effect they have on his
                  moods; and if he should be disfigured, I have no doubt he will scrutinize the
                  scars, to ascertain how such things appeal to personal vanity. So you perceive he
                  is occupied and content in his misfortune. But don't think I have for a friend, a
                  man without a heart. He acknowledges the best of the occasion is, that he has made
                  two warm friends, at first sight, by a condensation of events.
               "'A man can afford to be knocked down, and carry an inch or so of scars for that,'
                  as he said to me just before I left him.
               "'Moreover,' he added, 'these two friends are both very beautiful and noble
                  examples of our dear humanity; and if I am not mistaken, one of them is quite the
                  loftiest woman I have seen for many a day.'
               "Now, Cora, if Earnest had said that of you, I should have been jealous; so, Mrs.
                  Torson—I beg your pardon—I ventured to think he referred to you."
               Stella could not help smiling, and even blushing, with just perceptible confusion;
                  and Charley felt that she too was "penetrable stuff."
               If, on his return from hearing Earnest's poem, he had been slightly surprised and
                  startled by Stella, now he was determined to be completely at his ease. He had not
                  been provoked at her, but piqued with himself, at that time; and he intended to go
                  to the other extreme, being almost saucy, rather than at all disconcerted again,
                  especially in the presence of Cora.
               "I have been told by Cora, as well as by yourself," said Stella, taking up the cue
                  of the conversation a short distance back, "that Mr. Acton is what they term
                  'philosophical,'—considering whatever happens to him, good or bad, as a
                  contribution to his knowledge and advancement. I, too, am a good deal interested
                     in such views of the world, and as
                  much so in those who entertain them. You told me, the other evening, that your
                  friend had been favored with a somewhat extraordinary inward experience. Cora has
                  detailed for me, some of the facts of his external life. You have known him from
                  childhood. May I ask you to tell me, by and by, or whenever you please, something
                  more about him? We shall meet, now and then, I presume, while I am in your city. I
                  always like to know my friends, when I can, before actually coming in contact with
                  them. It gives one the advantage, perhaps, of a speedier intimacy, and is
                  certainly very pleasant. You will not, I am sure, be surprised at my request, or
                  look upon it as causing you too much trouble, when it refers to one you have
                  commended so highly, and spoken of with so much interest."
               Charley Merlow was appeased and happy in an instant. Stella's kind smile; her
                  frankness and simplicity; her freedom from any intention of being imposing,—her
                  care not to make stricken subjects, but happy companions,—which he could not but
                  perceive, in spite of his own accidental moment of confusion; and still more, her
                  acknowledged interest in his chosen friend:—drew Charley directly into the circle
                  of her sympathies, making him heartily ashamed of the suggestion of pertness in
                  her presence. She was so far above it, that he must not
                  sink to its level.
               He said that the most important portions of Earnest's experience,—his revolutions
                  and successions of thought and feeling,—he should prefer to have his friend state
                  for himself.
               "I have travelled so often," said he, "or at least attempted to travel in the
                  orbit of Earnest's mind, that I might possibly draw a tolerable picture of it. But
                  I incline to dread the task. Few things, however, would be more agreeable to me,
                  than to recount all that I can do justice to. He has been my friend almost from
                  infancy. If some facts of his childish and youthful days, with what he thinks of
                  them, would be interesting to you, nothing would suit me better than to begin the
                  recital of them as soon as you like. I have no doubt he will tell you the rest
                  himself. He likes very much to talk in that strain, as he deems his perceptions
                  and emotions, his convulsions, his 'regenerations,' as he terms them, largely
                  expressive and confirmatory of the present epoch in the world's history. It will
                  be easy enough to draw him out. When shall I commence my part?—Now?"
               "Bless me! no, not yet!" exclaimed Cora; "I have been discoursing all day myself;
                  and now you'll discourse all night. But don't be frightened: I won't stop you but
                  a minute, just to place myself in position where I can be easy, and enjoy my share
                  of the exhibition."
               So saying, she sat down on the tête-à-tête, and, taking Charley's hand, put his
                  arm around her waist.
               "Now the other hand and arm you may have for gestures, my good fellow," she said,
                  with a shrewd smile; "but this set, please bear in mind, is reserved for me, these
                  fine evenings. Be perfectly quiet now, perfectly unabashed. If a couple of young
                  people think a good deal of each other, and my dear, deep, wonderful Stella can't
                  comprehend it, what's the use of all her Plato and the other mighties? But it
                  won't trouble her, I assure you. I
                  couldn't help telling her I thought you a very sweet young man. Now see that you
                  act like one, and go straight on with your sermon."
               What could Charley Merlow do, but smile, in his turn, take up the small caressive
                  hand which rested partly on his knee, kiss it, and proceed? For he was a sensible
                  person of twenty-six.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               "WHEN I first saw Earnest," Charley began, "he was only four years old. His home
                  was just out of the village of Laurel, twenty miles from Boston. I was a year
                  older than he. My father had recently moved from another part of New England, and
                  had settled with his family in that village. He started from our house, one
                  pleasant summer evening, an hour before dark, to take a walk. I asked, as usual,
                  to go too. He seldom refused me. I trotted along at his side, and he walked out of
                  the village, on the road to Boston. We passed the house of Alger Acton—Earnest's
                  father—and having proceeded a short distance beyond it, were returning, when we
                  saw coming down the road toward us, a high-spirited white horse, of Arabian mould,
                  drawing a light single carriage, in which were two children. They were very young,
                  the smallest being scarcely more than an infant. The other seemed a year or two
                  older. He sat up straight and important, holding the reins. The horse quickened
                  his trot, and approached us faster and faster. My father felt assured that
                  something was wrong. He scanned the horse quickly, then the children, and as they
                  came up, he stepped in front of the horse, spoke to him, and stopped him.
               
               "'My young friends,' he asked, 'where are you going with this large fiery
                  horse?'
               "'Just to take a little ride, sir,' replied the oldest child.
               "'What is your name,' continued my father.
               "'Earnest Acton, sir; I live in the first house back there.'
               "'Well, how old are you, my bright young horseman?'
               "'I'm four years old, sir, and my cousin Doty Tetson here, is two and a half.'
               "My good father was sure he had made no mistake in stopping this precocious
                  party.
               "We heard, now, another voice on the road, and, in an instant, a middle-aged,
                  blue-eyed man, with a look of vexation, humor, and gratitude commingled on his
                  face, was added to the group. He glanced at the children, at the horse, then at my
                  father.
               "'I thank you, sir,' he said, 'for taking the responsibility to check the
                  pleasures of these hopefuls. The eldest is my son; the other is my nephew. They
                  were in a fair way to be killed in a very few minutes. The least flourish of the
                  whip over that horse, would have been their destruction. I allow no one to drive
                  him but myself.'
               "The affair was explained to us. Mr. Acton had returned, a few minutes before,
                  from a drive to a neighboring village. He had left the horse fastened near his
                  barn, and had entered the house. The little boys were together near by. When he
                  had disappeared, Earnest had proposed to Doty that they should take a ride.
                  Earnest said he could drive, of course he could. He helped Doty into the carriage,
                  unhitched the horse, and climbed in himself. The horse, without much guidance,
                  turned the vehicle round, and started off on the turnpike, toward Boston.
               "But my father had interfered with this proceeding.
               "Earnest was directed to get out of the carriage, and walk home. Mr. Acton
                  permitted Doty to ride back to the house with him. But Earnest was in disgrace. He
                  started along the road with his head down.
               "In the mean time, however, I had made a hero of him. Such a little fellow,
                  driving that big horse, in so much danger, yet perfectly confident, was surely
                  worth knowing. I must make him my friend.
               "Well, said I, going up to him, you brought the horse along pretty well, as far as
                  you came, anyhow.
               "My opinion seemed partly to dispel his shame. We walked together, chatting, until
                  we reached his father's house; then my father and I proceeded home.
               But Earnest and I knew each other; we had come to a good understanding, and were
                  to be friends.
               "But the particulars of our attachment, during the next ten years, the actions of
                  my friend, a mere child, though no doubt interesting to ourselves, at the time,
                  could hardly be entertaining to others.
               "When he was ten years old, his father moved, with the family, here to Ironton.
                  Earnest was thus torn away from me, and for four years I saw him only twice. But
                  on parting, we promised to remain friends forever. We frequently wrote to each
                  other. When he had grown to be a fine fellow of fourteen, I visited him, and we
                  attended the same school for a year. During the year, several little incidents
                  which the school-boys regarded
                  exciting, occurred in Earnest's life, and were impressed upon my memory. Do you
                  think it would be worth while to recount them?"
               "Yes," said Stella, "let us have them."
               "Yes," echoed Cora, with a wink at Stella, "if I must listen, I like
                  to hear about people before they grow to be so big and stupid, that when you
                  continue their history, no one can believe or understand it."
               Charley proceeded.
               "Our instructor was Mr. Tome.
               "'Earnest Acton,' said he, one day as the boys came in from recess,—'Earnest
                  Acton, come here. What did you kick Henry Logbun for, from one end of the yard to
                  the other, as I saw you do just now?'
               "'I kicked him a few times, sir, to show him what I thought of tell-tales; but I
                  didn't hurt him much.'
               "Such was the question that Mr. Tome asked, and such the answer he received.
               "Earnest was called up before his teacher, and Henry Logbun was told to stand at
                  his side.
               "Logbun was older than Earnest, and was taller and stouter. He was a dull, heavy
                  boy, remiss in his studies, and clumsy in play. He had acted the part of an
                  informer against Doty Tetson, Earnest's cousin—the little fellow that was riding
                  with him on the day our acquaintance began. They had lived together ever since,
                  and were like brothers.
               "Doty was a favorite. He was now twelve years old. He was loved by Earnest, loved
                  by all others. He was crammed so full of fun that no amount of repression could
                  quite hold it. If he laughed aloud, or if his chubby mouth took to whistling, it
                  was as nearly a matter of spontaneous combustion as could possibly occur, where
                  the tempering waters of free-will were supposed to be bottled with the qualities
                  which caused the explosion.
               "Doty Tetson whistled. Mr. Tome knew well enough it was Doty and no one else; but
                  he turned round, with severe dignity, desiring to know who had made that
                  noise.
               "The many blank faces which met his inquiry, the many surprised, wandering eyes,
                  turned every way but the right one, assured him unmistakably, that his scholars
                  had all been wholly devoted to their books, at just that important juncture, and
                  couldn't possibly give him satisfactory information.
               "Earnest sat directly behind Doty; but when Mr. Tome spoke, he was very busy with
                  his lesson, or appeared to be so. The expression of his face, if any inference
                  could be drawn from it, showed that the whole affair, the whistling and the
                  investigation of it, was a matter entirely beneath his smallest attention.
               "Mr. Tome passed him by without a word. He knew that if directly questioned,
                  Earnest would not lie; he would flatly refuse to answer, taking the consequences.
                  This would be a point of honor with him.
               "Besides, Mr. Tome didn't really desire to be told that Doty Tetson was a culprit
                  who, as a matter of example at least, deserved the rod. In his heart he didn't
                  want to punish the little fellow. But his school must be kept quiet and orderly.
                  It wouldn't do to ignore a case of plain, round, palpable whistling. So he
                  repeated his question.
               "'Who made that noise?'
               
               "If no one had answered it, this time, he would have soundly rapped some bench
                  near his hand, then, holding up the ruler, would have reminded the boys of what
                  would be the fate of him who should again transgress.
               "This was one of his methods of government that his brightest scholars had long
                  since discovered, and made application of.
               "But dull Henry Logbun had not. Trembling, and at the same time grinning, he
                  whined out:
               "'It was Doty Tetson, sir.'
               "'Doty Tetson, was it?' replied Mr. Tome. 'Well, Logbun, sit up in your seat! stop
                  your laughing immediately! I will have nothing of the kind.' And down went the
                  ruler across Logbun's fat shoulders.
               "He screamed, then whimpered for a moment, and as soon as Mr. Tome turned away,
                  made a face at him.
               "Earnest saw it, and a word from him would have insured Henry another and a
                  heartier admonition of the rod. He said nothing, however, but, as Doty Tetson
                  followed Mr. Tome out on the floor, in front of the benches, there to be feruled,
                  Earnest looked savagely at the tell-tale, shook his fist at him, and pointed to
                  the grounds connected with the building.
               "This was plainly a threat. What it signified, appeared at recess, when, as
                  Earnest admitted, he kicked Henry a few times, but without hurting him much.
               "Then Earnest himself held out his hand, and took half a dozen hard, conscientious
                  blows from Mr. Tome's ruler. He received them without any shrinking, as something
                  expected, and with which he had no fault to find. Two or three tears silently
                  dissolved from pain, were brushed quickly from his cheek, then he turned, and with
                  no sign of disrespect for his teacher, but with a look of ungovernable haughtiness
                  and self-satisfied triumph, he took his seat.
               "Henry Logbun carried a few bruises on his person for a day or two, and so careful
                  a remembrance of them while his school-days lasted, that there was no further
                  occasion to beat him for gratuitious tattling.
               "But a second rupture grew out of this first one.
               James Groby was the largest boy at school. A few days after Doty Tetson's freak of
                  whistling, Groby said to him:
               "'Oh, nonsense, Doty! you think, of course, there's nobody like your Cousin
                  Earnest. He took your part against that lummox Logbun. What if he did? Logbun's a
                  baby, if he is big. Earnest wouldn't have tried anything of that sort on
                     me.'
               "'Hadn't better give him a chance,' replied Doty: 'you're almost a man, and he's
                  only fourteen; but if you wind him up, he'll strike like a clock, every time; mind
                  that.'
               "James Groby by no means relished Doty's opinion, that any boy in school would
                  dare oppose him. But the conversation was cut short by the bell, and the boys were
                  soon engaged with their lessons.
               "Earnest came in late, and knew nothing of what had been said. That afternoon he
                  was to be very busy. A long and tedious algebraic problem had taken up a good part
                  of his time in the morning, and as soon as he entered the school-room, he sat down
                  to finish it.
               "His slate was full of figures. Mr. Tome was hear- ing a recitation in a part of the room farthest
                  from Earnest's seat, with his back turned toward it. James Groby sat about a dozen
                  feet from Earnest, in an armchair, having a movable board attached, which could be
                  used as a writing-desk; and beneath the seat was a drawer in which Groby kept his
                  books. Next him was an unoccupied chair, with an old cushion in it.
               "As Mr. Tome was so far from the boys who sat in this part of the room, some of
                  them had grown restless, and were throwing at each other such bits of paper, and
                  crumbs of sweet-meats, as their pockets contained. It was seldom that Earnest
                  participated in such vagaries; not because he was always obedient, but because he
                  considered them beneath him,—too small a business. Now he was so much occupied,
                  that he paid no attention to anything around him. He had pretty nearly worked out
                  his problem, and was eager to finish it. Several times, small missiles had hit
                  him, and had caused him some irritation. He told the boys that he was in no mood
                  for play,—they had better let him alone.
               "James Groby heard it, and, whispering to a boy who sat near him, said that
                  Earnest Acton was 'putting on the man a little too high, and must have his steeple
                  dropped off.' Then, catching up the old cushion from the unoccupied chair, he
                  tossed it directly on Earnest's slate. It rubbed out a portion of his figures. The
                  problem couldn't be finished, unless by beginning almost anew, and his day's labor
                  was lost.
               "He looked for an instant at his slate, then at the face of James Groby, who sat
                  laughing at him, knowing that he would bring no complaint before Mr. Tome, and
                  fearing nothing worse. Then Earnest laid his slate and the cushion on his desk,
                  got deliberately up, and walking to Groby's chair, struck him so furiously, as he
                  leaned on one side to avoid the blow, that Groby and his chair, his writing-board,
                  books and inkstand, all tumbled on the floor in one confused and noisy heap.
               "The boys arose in their seats, astonished and frightened. Groby extricated
                  himself from the chair, but was so completely astounded, that he made no attempt
                  to retaliate. Mr. Tome hurried across the room, bidding the boys sit down. By a
                  few inquiries, he learned the cause and circumstances of the quarrel. After
                  expressing his surprise, that one so old as James Groby, should, as he said, 'seek
                  instruction for his mind in the peccadilloes of children,' he addressed Earnest
                  Acton.
               "'My child,' said he, 'you do not mean to be vicious, but you have a temper which
                  I sometimes fear will prove your ruin. You have good qualities with it, and if
                  these should by-and-by yoke it to themselves in the pursuit of noble objects, you
                  will perhaps rise to superiority by reason of this very fault. But if not—if such
                  a force should be connected with evil aims—the misery you will bring upon yourself
                  and others, will be greater than any human being should inflict or endure.'
               "Having said this, the good man returned to the class he had left, and never again
                  alluded to the afternoon's outbreak.
               "But his words were rooted in my memory. They partly expressed my own vague
                  imaginings. I had dimly marked out in my mind a lofty career for my friend. I
                  couldn't tell what it would be, but I pictured it as powerful, while I couldn't believe it would
                  be ruinous and disgraceful."
               "Was your friend uncommonly studious," asked Stella, who seemed to desire that
                  Charley should still continue his account of Earnest.
               "By no means," said Charley. "His recitations were always creditable, as his
                  lessons were easily learned. Usually one or two depended more or less upon him at
                  classes. But here, he didn't seem ambitious to excel,—only to show that he could
                  do so if he desired. He was a boy. His ambition was that of a boy: it was of a
                  physical cast. Once out of the school-room, he was the head and life of all sports
                  and contests. No one of his age and size could match him in most of them. Was it
                  wrestling? He was always ready. Was it running? Few would attempt to catch him.
                  Had the season come for snow-balling? His own snow-ball was almost as sure as a
                  gun-shot, and as hard as a stone.
               "Of course this endeavor for mere physical excellence soon passed away. But now he
                  can enter into, and appreciate all tones of mind,—not only that of the
                  intellectual saint, but also that of the rough boxer; for, to some extent, he has
                  himself been both.
               "I must tell you one further instance of his boyish dash, and impudence, and
                  daring. It also speaks of the command he exercised over his school-fellows.
               "His cousin and pet, Doty Tetson, had again got into trouble, and was again
                  punished, but, as Earnest imagined, with some injustice, and undue severity. It
                  was just before school was dismissed in the afternoon. As the boys rushed out,
                  Earnest, pale with anger, collected them together, marshalled them up in front of
                  the door, and actually drove them into giving three groans for their respected
                  teacher.
               "But for years, he didn't, forgive himself for this insult to Mr. Tome, whom he
                  really loved and revered. It was the source of acute bitterness to him, for many
                  days, and more than one sleepless night. His kind preceptor knew him much better
                  than he himself could, and easily pardoned even this indignity,—pardoned it with
                  tears in his eyes. Perhaps it was for this reason that Earnest regretted it more
                  than any other single act of his boyhood. It was difficult to intimidate him; but
                  beneath the rays of kindness, his whole nature would melt."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIV.
               "IT is Earnest's theory," continued Charley, "that the record of childhood is
                  necessarily uninteresting, unless the eye is fixed on the future of the child. As
                  'father of the man,' the boy is engaging. A part from that, save in our own love
                  of the little one we protect, we pass over his history. It is an account of
                  romping; the chasing of objects symbolized by the butterfly; of heedless endeavor
                  for the gratification of impulses; of loving the nearest objects, but fearing and
                  shrinking from the many; of sportive cruelty toward insect and animal. Each child
                  is a little hunter, a little savage,—afraid of all things, yet, having the
                  strength, he would clutch the stars for his playthings. We scrutinize the early
                  days of the prominent, and of our friends, only that we may see how and why their
                  later days were so vivid and important to us.
               "I have told you of Earnest when a child, placing him, to begin with, where every
                  child is naturally placed, I suppose,—in a period of impulse and activity,
                  awaiting higher things. How do you like the picture of his spirit and ability, his
                  faults, his antagonisms, on the low plain, boyhood?"
               "Oh! very well," cried Cora, so hastily that Stella had no chance to speak; "very
                  well indeed, for the edification of philosophers and prize-fighters, and other
                  such people. But I thought you told Stella, the man had a heart. What was he doing
                  with it all the while when he was young? Didn't he ever love anybody? Wasn't there
                  even one sweet-heart who, at least from pity, could condescend to just a little
                  tenderness for such an ugly and outrageous boy? Why, Charley, either he was only
                  half a boy, after all, or else you've told us only one side of a story."
               Charley Merlow was silent for a moment, under this storm of raillery, and then
                  said:
               "Yes, Cora, you are right. You shall have the other side of the story now, while I
                  am in the humor. But to punish you for the terror inflicited on me by your
                  criticism, I shall leave you for at least ten minutes, while I go home and get a
                  letter which Earnest wrote to me four or five years ago. He shall speak for
                  himself on the love-question. That is a matter I know nothing about.
               "Excuse me, meanwhile," he added, and bounding to the door, he shut it behind him
                  before Cora could retort. But he returned immediately, bringing the letter.
               "Earnest would as soon I should read it to you, as not," said he; "for he has
                  often told me, it contains, in effect, no more the affairs of his own heart than
                  of a thousand others. Now listen."
               "Love, my dear Charley, is a reality the most beautiful, perhaps, of all. But
                  there are many follies and vanities, many affectations and fibs, constantly
                  clinging to it. I think it has seldom been deeply un- derstood or naturally portrayed by the writers. A
                  favorite theory, for instance, is a first love, at first sight, enduring forever.
                  Has not any one who has once looked into himself, lived long enough to know
                  better? I suspect a first love is commonly an illusion vouchsafed merely to open
                  our eyes."
               "There, that will do," Cora interrupted, "it's a most shocking epistle!"
               But Charley persisted in reading.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "'Tis true, the affections are precocious. I suppose we have but a
                              very limited perception of the beautiful, before we see it in the
                              glances of a maiden. What of that? By the time she has well aroused
                              the perception, it enables us to see others lovelier than herself. If
                              we have heart, we shall be thankful to her. But is our love often
                              'love forevermore?' Is hers so?
                           "My friend, open your ear for a confession. I have a string of loves
                              for you, that, if they were beads, would reach half round your neck;
                              and if they wholly encircled it, I should not now be jealous.
                           "When you and I first knew each other, I was four years old, I
                              believe. Never mind the occasion: you have laughed at me sufficiently
                              over it. But I insist that I was simply affording my father's Arab an
                              expert driver. Well, young as I was, you, my friend, were not my first
                              love; and I had several of your gender prior to the other sort. I am
                              serious. Love does not begin in any distinction of sex; and if we gaze
                              far enough, I fancy it does not end in any such distinction.
                           "Before your time, I used to see a little chap, in our village—I
                              presume he was of about my own age—who charmed me magically. I was in
                              love with him. I knew the symptoms. I pined to become acquainted with
                              him; yet I was shy, and scarcely durst approach him. I wanted to do
                              him some favor—anything that would please him, and be accepted. I
                              would have given him my candy—the whole stick—gladly. I wished he
                              might fall of his door-step, that I could pick him up, and comfort
                              him. Yet my fondness was unselfish. I would have thrown myself off,
                              rather than that he should have really been injured in the smallest
                              degree. Poor youngster! I have no doubt he was worthy a better fate
                              than befell him the other day in my memory: so untrue to him had I
                              been, that I could not even recall his name.
                           "You perceive, my good friend, that you were my second love. We met,
                              and promised, and neither has proved false. This they call
                              friendship.
                           "However, after moving here to Ironton, I had several passions similar
                              to my first.
                           "One was for a child whom I courted assiduously for a considerable
                              time, and loved dearly. I gained him as a companion and playmate. He
                              did not correspond with the darling my imagination had pictured him to
                              be, and soon he was deserted. His heart remained whole, and his body
                              grew fat. He is now one of the coarsest, commonest, heaviest young men
                              in the county.
                           "But when somewhat beyond thirteen, I had une
                                 grande passion, which lasted me—well, it must have been
                              six months. Here now was an experience to be respected. It was fervid,
                              exalted, even religious. I remember her well, Miss Grey, the dear
                              charmer, as she then appeared. She was a year older than I, which, you
                              know, in a girl, is the same as two or three years with us. She was pretty, had dark
                              hair, in ringlets, black eyes, a clear, fresh face, and considerable
                              body. She was rather stout. My ideal was not a chalk-fed fairy, but a
                              woman with blood in her. I was not yet Byronic enough even to 'hate a
                              dumpy woman.'
                           "I used to see the young lady at church. What set my heart
                              a-fluttering for her I never knew. There she was, in the pew, where I
                              could always look at her—wholesome, quiet, and well-behaved.
                           "While this love possessed me, there was a revival connected with the
                              church. My mind had not been exercised upon religion. I believed what
                              I heard, supposing that the preacher understood the truth, and was
                              right. I was impressed by his sermons, and trembled for my soul. Miss
                              Grey, too, was deeply moved. I was in an agony of fear for her. Hell
                              was depicted in the most shocking colors. Perhaps I could not escape
                              it. I felt myself to be an intolerable sinner. But I prayed in secret,
                              with all my strength, that my adored might be saved.
                           "O God! I cried, if either of us, let me be the sacrifice! I am
                              unworthy; but spare her innocence and beauty from everlasting
                              fire!
                           "I would have given myself to perdition for her eternal welfare. Was
                              not this love?
                           "Meanwhile I was comforted; I thought I had found rest among the
                              faithful, and the tempest of my soul was assuaged. Still, I hesitated
                              to join the church. I waited to become a little better; to try myself
                              a little longer. It seemed that I ought to be very good, wholly free
                              from guile, to take upon me the vows and duties of church-membership,
                              to enter the holy of holies.
                           "Miss Grey became a communicant. She was confident of her salvation,
                              and I would not doubt it. I was delighted, and gave thanks with a full
                              heart.
                           "But the young lady knew nothing of my struggle or my happiness.
                              Notwithstanding I loved her with such intensity, I had scarcely spoken
                              to her in my life. We were almost strangers. Indeed, I hardly durst
                              speak to her. I supposed that so much sweetness, so much worth, could
                              not lavish themselves upon my unworthiness. Circumstances were such
                              that we seldom met, except in the church; and had we been constantly
                              together, I could not at that time have mustered sufficient courage,
                              it is probable, to display my tenderness. Daring, to that extent,
                              would have seemed insane temerity.
                           "It was well that this absorption did not long continue. It was acute,
                              even to pain and debility. But it went as it came, telling not how or
                              why. I looked upon that lovely face, until it was not so lovely, and
                              yet it had not changed. Yesterday I saw it, as I walked the street. It
                              was still pretty and placid, but, as I deemed, somewhat lifeless. For
                              me, in all save kindness and pleasant recollections, it was dead.
                           "I awoke from my religious frenzy even sooner than from my dream of
                              love. For some time, as you are aware, there was nothing but darkness
                              and mist in its place.
                           "After the pure and silent adoration for Miss Grey, I attended a
                              school at which there were both maidens and young men.
                           
                           "Here were two pretty girls who severally inspired me with emotions
                              similar to those connected with my former angel, only not so severe.
                              One was slender, gentle, and yielding, whose chief beauty was a kind
                              smile. Her eyes were blue; her hair would be called auburn, if you
                              disliked to pronounce it a still sunnier hue. She is the worthy wife
                              of an industrious shoemaker. The other enchantress had sparkling black
                              eyes, and hair not a shade lighter. Her laugh was round and loud, her
                              person, large and slightly masculine in movement. She also is married.
                              Her husband is a policeman, saloon-keeper, and expositor of 'the manly
                              art of self-defence.' He is much superior to her quondam lover, both in the immensity of
                              his mustache and the compactness of his muscles.
                           "After the reign of the sturdy brunette, my heart was for a
                              considerable time freer and colder. Still, it was once or twice
                              punctured, if not pierced. I remember particularly well, one strangely
                              simple little incident which occurred to set it fluttering. I was in
                              the street of a morning, and met our Madame de Villier's studious
                                 demoiselles, walking in their
                              pretty file of couples, when a small boy cried out at them: 'Sheep!
                              sheep!' Suddenly, and from sheer fun, as I fancied, the loveliest and
                              most regal maid of the flock, stepped out of it, caught hold of the
                              child, and shook him into a simple bundle of red astonishment. Just
                              then, ready to burst with laughter, I caught her merry, yet most
                              intense and spiritual eye. She laughed, blushed, and resumed her
                              place, without looking back. Would you believe it?—for weeks I could
                              not drive her or the incident from mind, and I have asked myself a
                              hundred times since, if that dash of independence, connected with her
                              dignity and those spiritual eyes, was not indicative of higher phases
                              of the same trait, and of something very near and dear to my own
                              nature.
                           "Now I am touched by memories which bow my head in tender respect.
                              Affie Brantome—my friend, you knew her. She rose in the horizon of my
                              brightening manhood, after a long night of gloom. For three desolate
                              years I had not loved the world, I had not loved myself, when she
                              came, with a softened picture of the summer heaven in her eyes, to
                              glide into my heart, lighting up with her own faith and loveliness,
                              that too dismal shelter. I have told you the sequel. How could I
                              forgive myself, if I did not know that she has forgiven me, and is
                              happy! How her lingering illness veiled that sunny spirit in clouds of
                              melancholy! She thought it would prevent her from becoming a helpful
                              companion, a useful wife. She had lighted my pathway; her own was now
                              dark. She counted on my love—that it would increase with her
                              misfortune; but she would not live a useless pensioner on its bounty.
                              She remembered my pride: I would bear no coldness, no wavering. Poor
                              child! she sent me chilling letters, though it tore her heart to write
                              them. They gave me a sense of uncertainty. Was she trifling, then,
                              after all? I could not know of her saintly renunciation. I wrote her a
                              few kind words, saying they would be the last. She said, in return,
                              that I did not understand her, that she did not understand
                              herself:—pleading not to be forgotten, yet a little while to be loved;
                              but alas! explaining nothing. I persisted in silence, unbroken, complete. God forgive me! I
                              was but nineteen. Is a boy fit to love, or only to be proud?
                           "Indirectly, and a long time afterward, the explanation came. It
                              bruised and stunned me like the shock of a fall. I was stung to the
                              core of my being. But to what purpose? Affie had regained her health;
                              and the tendrils of her beautiful nature, which must, nestle near to
                              some kind support, had partly twined themselves about another
                              existence. I prayed he might be worthy of that lovely flower, wearing
                              it on his breast more carefully, more sacredly, than I had done. I
                              could not ask it now: it was his.
                           
                           "But I am growing sad. I have written too long,—not dreaming, at the
                              outset, where my pen would carry me. In my soul, I press your
                              hand.
                           
                              "EARNEST."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               As Cora brushed away a tear, Charley asked her if he had now completed the story
                  to her satisfaction.
               "Yes," she replied, "as far, perhaps, as you can. But we shall yet add a lady more
                  charming than all, as the last on his list."
               She looked at Stella. But the young widow's face was buried in her hands,—perhaps
                  in thought.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               ON the second subsequent evening, Charley Merlow came again; and this time his
                  friend was with him. Earnest was still pale. A narrow patch on one side of his
                  forehead, almost concealed by the long, clustering chestnut hair which fell over
                  it, was yet a perceptible souvenir of his late rencounter.
               Cora met the young men; but Stella was not visible.
               "Cora, where is Mrs. Torson?" asked Charley, who was now always perfectly at home
                  in the house of Richard Clandon.
               "Know, Mr. Impertinence," was the reply, "that the lady isn't quite ready to come
                  down stairs. If you wish, I'll step and ask her what she is doing at just this
                  instant:—it might be interesting, it might not. Or if you'll wait a few minutes,
                  tolerating my company meanwhile, then, I presume, my friend will appear. Mr.
                  Acton, now, would be perfectly content with me, I'm sure. But our Charley is very
                  difficult to please."
               These last words were addressed to Earnest, with Cora's usual look of merriment;
                  and as he knew the goodness of her heart, her light words and her bright face
                  seemed, just then, two of the most agreeable features of the world.
               
               "You are certainly right, Miss Clandon," he responded; then, with the gentle look
                  of admiration lingering in his eyes, he turned toward Charley, seeming to say by
                  his glance,—Well, my good fellow, you have a treasure, I think.
               The three conversed for a few minutes, when Charley stepped to a window to see
                  something that suddenly attracted his attention. Cora called him, and as he did
                  not come back soon enough, she started toward him, with the evident intention of
                  accelerating his movements. Earnest rose, and as the piano stood at his hand, he
                  touched it.
               "He is very noble and very good, isn't he? and very handsome besides," whispered
                  Cora to Charley, as a noisy carriage rattled by the window. "How he and Stella
                  could love each other!"
               Then she returned immediately to Earnest, pulling Charley by the sleeve. She had
                  heard a boy in the street, whistle a tune, that morning, she said; and now, while
                  two or three notes that Mr. Acton had struck, reminded her of it, she must try to
                  play it. So down she sat at the instrument. But she was unable to recall the whole
                  of the melody, and Earnest, who had also partly caught it, somewhere, aided her by
                  humming portions she could not remember.
               When she had run it over once or twice, to her satisfaction, she struck off into
                  some sprightly operatic music, playing with precise execution and good taste.
                  Earnest told her so, frankly and respectfully.
               "Oh, yes!" she said; "I'm among the champions about here of the so-sos. But I'm
                  glad I happened to play for you in advance of Stella—Mrs. Torson I mean. After
                  listening to her, one never asks anything more of poor Cora. The child may go talk
                  nonsense then,—a feat in which she has few superiors. But Stella is a genius. She
                  carries music to a science. She will make the ocean roar, or the elephant tread
                  for you, on the piano; or she will make the saint pray and the lovelorn maiden
                  moan. Then she will give you a sound that will correspond to a toothache you felt
                  sometime, and you wonder if it's going to begin again. Or, in strict truth and
                  soberness, her playing is the most expressive I ever heard, except from one or two
                  great artists, the best in the country. I've heard her play when I've even
                  preferred her to them. But—and now I'm going to put in a modification, for they
                  say a lady always finds one, when she extols another lady—Stella has a big hand.
                  The man, though, who gets her heart, will, find that bigger. Bless me! I wonder
                  why she doesn't come down!"
               While Cora was thus entertaining Earnest and Charley; chatting, joking, flying
                  from one subject to another; and never forbidding the mouth to utter the thought,
                  the fancy, or oddity that popped into her mind;—Stella, alone in her apartment,
                  was very differently engaged.
               When Earnest and Charley came, they had been expected. As their voices sounded in
                  the hall, Stella had begged Cora to go down and meet them alone.
               "I want a few minutes, dear, to myself," she said: "then I will be with you.
               Cora did as her friend desired. Meanwhile Stella had tried to dream out of a
                  problem, its yet impossible solution.
               
               The truth was, notwithstanding her declaration to Cora that she did not love
                  Earnest; that she could not love any one so suddenly; she felt an indefinite,
                  prophetic dread of meeting him, though she would not give herself up to it.
               "No," she soliloquized, "I have seen him but three or four times in my life.
                  Surely I am not so weak that I need fear meeting him as many times again, before
                  permitting myself such a thought as love. And in any event, is there more than one
                  course?—to walk on till I see when and where I ought to turn? And what if I should
                  love? Where is the danger? Who knows that he would respond to my longing? His
                  heart seems to have passed away from special objects, to a mellowed kindness for
                  all who are noble, and gentle, and fair. But yes, it would be so! He is young; he
                  is generous; he could not repel a heart knowing his, if it painfully leaped out to
                  meet him. It is only too easy for such a soul to love!"
               Then Stella experienced once more the heavy, clogging sensation over her heart,
                  which she had felt before her marriage, as she looked out of the window from her
                  father's house, into the sunshine, which blackened instantly to cloud and
                  gloom.
               "I know it," she murmured: "he can love; and I can love only him. Yet
                  neither of us must love. The reality of my youth's dream is before
                  me. Can I myself now drop the veil to hide it from my sight? Yes, I am strong
                  enough to do my duty; I can."
               Stella sat awhile in deep, silent meditation, then she bent her body, and bowed
                  her head; but her spirit rose on high.
               "My Father," she murmured, "let my soul grow calm by approaching Thee. I know not
                  what to ask; Thou knowest all things best to give. Guide me to see my life's duty,
                  and, seeing it, to shrink not away. Let the example of the world's greatest spirit
                  be ever near me. He was thy noblest Son, my loftiest Brother, by giving all to
                  Thee. In his spirit, grant me to live, grant me to die,—asking no dearer pleasure,
                  no sweeter reward."
               Stella rose, and soon joined her friends in the drawing-room. Her face was
                  thoughtful and a little sad. Her brow was very white—almost pallid; but a flush
                  was on her lips and on her cheeks. Her hair was, as usual, plain and glossy,
                  brushed "madonna-wise." Her dress was a black silk, elegantly fitted, but as plain
                  as her hair. It was finished at the neck and wrists by the simple lustre of pure
                  linen—the collar and cuffs. A white, fleecy knit shawl, almost as soft and
                  delicate as lace, was thrown across her shoulders, and yielded pliantly to every
                  motion. Small golden crosses, enamelled with a blue like the azure of her eyes,
                  and closely set with little pearls as the centre of the skyey tint,—these for
                  ear-rings, and a larger cross of the same kind for a breastpin, were her only
                  jewels. She was very fond of the Christian symbol; and in some color—black, or
                  blue, or the gleaming yellow of plain gold—it was almost constantly worn upon her
                  person.
               "Why, how long you've staid away from us," said Cora, as Stella entered the
                  room.
               "I began to find myself very dull to the gentlemen without you," she continued, as
                  Earnest and Charley advanced to meet
                  her friend, who extended a hand to each of them,—the right to Earnest, as he
                  happened to be on that side, the left to Charley, who did not wait for the other
                  to be disengaged.
               "I was not aware it was long," replied Stella. "As for the dulness, it seems to
                  me, the gentlemen's faces and their merry voices flattered my Cora wonderfully, if
                  she had really lost the least particle of her esprit."
               "Tut, tut!" persisted Cora, "don't you know it's shocking to contradict
                  people?"
               She said this with one of her ever-ready kisses, still declaring that Stella had
                  been up-stairs such a great while, that she couldn't tell without tasting, whether
                  she yet loved her or not.
               From Stella's solicitous glance at Earnest's forehead, and her inquiries after his
                  health, the conversation turned once again to the affray on High street, then
                  especially to Jerry Kay.
               "What a kind-hearted, quick-witted, demonstrative old blarney he is," said Cora.
                  "I think he's the most Irish specimen of Ireland I ever saw. What fun it is to
                  hear him swear! I know it's dreadfully wicked in me to say so; but whenever I hear
                  him, I can't help laughing. I couldn't to save my ears. Stella, why do people
                  swear?"
               "A fair question, truly," replied Stella, "but not so easy as some others, it may
                  be, for me to answer. I believe, however, if you really want to know, there are
                  reasons for the practice in human nature, as there are such reasons for all other
                  human practices. I might give you my opinion, but I should prefer to hear one. Mr.
                  Acton, suppose you tell us why people swear."
               Stella spoke thus, partly because she wished to hear Earnest talk; partly because,
                  in spite of herself, and needlessly, as she knew, she felt slightly awed by his
                  presence and bearing. It was perfectly simple—even childlike; but there was a
                  certain depth, a certain directness in his most careless actions, in his very
                  motions, which others might not perceive, but which she could as little fail to
                  see. The perception might increase rather than hamper her own powers,—she would be
                  sure of being understood. Still, she wished at first to listen, rather than to
                  speak.
               "I am disappointed; " was Earnest's answer to her request. "I expected to hear a
                  much better response to out friend Cora's question, than I could myself offer. I
                  will obey you however; but you must promise to correct me if I should err.
               "Swearing," he continued, when the promise was given, "is confined to no locality,
                  I presume. It is a failing of mankind. Men swore by the gods, as they also
                  worshipped them, before their minds rose completely to the conception of one God.
                  Or they swore by some special deity, or by Jove, the 'Father of gods and men.' The
                  name of Jehovah had evidently been used with lightness, before it was necessary to
                  write the commandment:'Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.'
                  Profanity seems to me the reverse and dark side of prayer. We instinctively
                  believe in a power above us. We call on it to bless us. If ignorant and filled
                  with hate, we call on it to curse the objects of our hatred. If wrapped in
                  excitement, even over trifles, we are apt to feel as though nothing we conceive as
                  limited, can represent our agitation. So we appeal to the Boundless. An oath is thus a recognition of
                  God, in a low and hasty manner. But our reverence demands that the All-High shall
                  be recognized loftily,—never as we bandy trifles. The third commandment is an
                  inevitable decree of the soul,—as inevitably broken by frivolity and heat.
               "But the man who thinks and defines, putting things in their places, has no need
                  to invoke his Creator as he brushes away a fly or describes a toy. We say 'the
                  gentleman does not swear.' The 'gentleman' we account to be thoughtful and
                  cool.
               "I have noticed that the French swear glibly and commonly; the Irish, invariably.
                  These people are hot-hearted, enthusiastic, and light. Their profanity usually
                  means nothing more than that they have a word to say which they cannot say
                  strongly enough to suit them. It is so with our kind old friend, Jerry Kay. He
                  intends no harm, but can hardly breathe without mentioning God or the Devil—the
                  highest good, the greatest evil. Well, the human spirit itself can scarcely throb
                  in any direction, but it shall instantly come upon these:—reverence and love in
                  their own way, violence and anger also in their way."
               "Thank you, Mr. Acton," said Cora, when Earnest had concluded; "I've found out
                  then, at last, why I do really ache sometimes to say—well—'fiddlesticks!' I
                  thought there were roots for it in my blood; I rather suspected the roots were a
                  sort of natural growth in blood generally. They sprout especially in mine, I see
                  now; for somewhere, at the other end of my pedigree, the Clandons were
                  French-Irish. Charley, don't you like Irish girls?"
               "Certainly I do," replied Charley, "and French girls too."
               "Well, then," said Cora, "come here, and sit by me a minute, which you haven't
                  done this whole blessed evening. Mr. Acton, as I know, likes the Germanic blood,
                  or the old Grecian. That means Stella. Come, let us arrange ourselves according to
                  our attractions for blood,—not gentlemen with gentlemen, and ladies with ladies,
                  as some evil genius has now assorted us. It's dreadfully stiff. For my part, I
                  always liked to sit with the boys, even for a punishment at school."
               With this, she took Stella's arm, and pushed her gently into a chair beside
                  Earnest, at the same time taking Charley's arm and pulling him into the chair
                  beside herself, which had been occupied by Stella.
               Both obeyed easily; for everybody obeys a humorous, capricious, irresistible young
                  woman.
               "Now," she exclaimed, "this group pleases me. We'll resume, if you please, our
                  researches into blood, with its morals, manners, and customs."
               But they had not conversed long, before she was ready for something else.
               "Stella," she said, "I told Mr. Acton, before you came down, about your musical
                  proclivities. My criticisms were very impressive: were they not, Mr. Acton? And
                  haven't you been dying ever since, to hear her play?"
               Earnest said he was at that very moment on the point of requesting her to do so;
                  and now, that the opportunity had been given him, he must urge her.
               "I need but little urging," Stella replied. "I am so very fond of music that I am
                  always glad to be at the piano, when
                  others are really glad to listen. Cora, what will you have?"
               "Oh! a jig for me, by all means!" Cora answered.
               "But I think Mr. Acton wouldn't like that. He's been telling me that he likes the
                  German music, considering it equalled in power and richness only by the profundity
                  and research of German literature. I believe that's your opinion too. Well,
                  suppose we have a touch of Mynheer Meyerbeer, to begin with,—say the 'March' from
                  the 'Prophet.' That's Teutonic enough to charm the glass out of the windows."
               Once on the stream of music, with Stella as pilot, the minutes passed to Earnest
                  like seconds. He was entranced. Charley Merlow was again completely amazed, and
                  Cora was radiant with delight at her friend's success.
               "A queen, isn't she!" was her exclamation as she and Charley stood listening
                  together.
               If Stella was now absorbed in the elysium of harmonies which she seemed to create,
                  Earnest would have been as deeply so, if it had not been for his interest in her
                  on whom such felicity depended. At first he could not give his thoughts wholly to
                  the music; for music itself appeared to be embodied in her. He saw at once that
                  Cora had not exaggerated her merits. He acknowledged to himself that he had seen
                  no one who could at all compare with her, except, as Cora had asserted, one or two
                  public performers, and they among the most noted in the world. It would have been
                  difficult to convince him that even these could have excelled her, unless,
                  possibly, in their own favorite efforts. But she played everything, from ballad to
                  oratorio, and all perfectly. Yes, perfectly, in as far as that
                  Earnest could ask for nothing more, in conception or execution, than she was able
                  to render.
               In his reading of different authors, Earnest had tried to understand them, not
                  through prepossessions of his own mind, but by creeping into their minds;—by
                  sympathizing with them for the time being; by making their outlook
                     his stand-point of vision. A book which he esteemed worth reading,
                  he thought deserving of this compliment. The writer once permeated, once
                  comprehended as he comprehended himself, then the reader must judge as to there
                  being a higher outlook than the one just occupied. Earnest now fancied that Stella
                  had done the same in music. Her performance seemed different from that of others,
                  not merely in the faultlessness of the touch, but in the inmost sense of the
                  theme. Her style was her own; yet it was evidently nothing but the most sensitive
                  and accurate appreciation of the grand masters of the art, most dexterously
                  declared by her fingers instead of her words. She had truly "thought to music;" to
                  her it had not been merely a sensuous revel.
               To Earnest, sounds were representative of things. He had not made music a study,
                  but he could never listen to it without knowing that he had come in contact with
                  one more phase of that intelligence which is the centre and substance of the
                  universe. He perceived that it expressed his joy, his sorrow, his worship, his
                  mirth. It uttered his attractions, his repulsions. He had asked if gravitation had
                  a heart, and this were the murmurings of its love. He had sat in church when he
                  could bow to God only through the
                  prayer of the organ; and as some receptive, melodious nature which had no
                  utterence at the lips for its aspirations, but could praise Heaven for blessings,
                  and beg their continuance, by the thanksgiving and the supplication of the
                  key-board,—as genius had thus directly communed with the Father, and Earnest had
                  heard it cease its petition, that perhaps some fleshy face and husky voice in a
                  surplice might say: "We will now begin the service of God,"—the young
                  man's soul had sunk within him, and all worship had fled.
               As Stella now sat at the finest piano that Richard Clandon could procure for his
                  daughter, pouring out all the harmonies of which it seemed capable; as Earnest
                  stood admiring that superb woman,—how soon and how easily they understood each
                  other! how impalpably, yet how surely, their spirits conjoined! She struck up the
                  wild, terrific battle song of Rouget de Lisle's.
                  The storm gathered on Earnest's brow, the spring of the tiger seemed flashing from
                  his eye, and his right hand was clenched, as though a sword was in its grasp. She
                  looked up into his flushed face, anticipating, yet almost recoiling from the
                  effect she had produced, and suddenly that epitome of the French Revolution died
                  from her fingers. It melted into an operatic aria of love and hope. As she looked
                  again into his face, how different must have been the emotions it expressed! For
                  her eye, all softness, turned away, and a deep blush was on her cheek.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               AGAIN the friends met at Richard Clandon's. It seems that after Earnest and Stella
                  had been drawn so near to each other by the charm of music, on that early April
                  evening of our last chapter, Stella had spoken of her pleasure in meeting one with
                  whom so close a communion of the kind could be established. Earnest, in return,
                  had applauded her gift with simple directness and fervor. He had said what he
                  thought, with no strain at personal encomium, with no fear of it; but as though
                  the gift itself were above all persons, and separate from them. She had alluded to
                  his poem, to Charley's remarks on it and on him, and to having somewhat interested
                  herself in his history.
               "I find we are both given," she said, "to looking for a life deeper than this
                  life,—for the undercurrents of affairs about us. Let me ask a favor of you. I
                  always have a strange curiosity to know what picture of God and man is painted on
                  the thought of a person who strikes me as in any way remarkable for good or ill. I
                  regard it as the index of his actions. In it I look for
                     him. You like to talk, I know, on subjects which men have deemed
                  the highest. Would you think your time
                  wasted in talking upon them to me? I wish you would promise to do so
                  sometime."
               It was pleasing for Earnest to give the promise she desired. It might have been a
                  fancy of his, but he regarded his inward experience as in some degree a mirror of
                  great facts and tendencies about him, as Charley Merlow had intimated to Stella.
                  And why should he decline to hold this mirror up to the fair, sympathizing friend
                  whose image had already sunk deeply into his heart?
               When now they met, Stella soon reminded him of their last conversation.
               "I have not forgotten it," he said, "but with your permission I must modify my
                  promise. Such an account of myself as you wish me to give, requires compression
                  and exactness, or it cannot be worth your while. It must relate too, you know, to
                  the deepest questions that have ever engaged the human mind. Now if our friend
                  Cora were obliged to listen to it, she would scarcely hesitate to call it dull, I
                  fear; and perhaps obscure and heterodox besides. Then the experience is such that
                  I should have to speak of myself in connection with some very strong minds and
                  illustrious names. Not at all in comparison, of course, so far as
                  strength and action are concerned; but as having been in, and passed
                  through—although in my youth and weakness—the general phases of thought and
                  feeling, which they, in their might of personalty, represented to the world in
                  their time and place. To any one not having the clearest perception that great men
                  are always representative of ideas and epochs of history,—that they are merely
                  strong embodiments of a common progressive humanity,—I should labor under the
                  disadvantage of much apparent egotism. In conversation, too, my narrative would be
                  almost interminable, as it would lack order. But not long ago, I wrote out a
                  summary of the matter, as well as I could, for a young friend, who was earnest,
                  inquiring, and thoughtful; but sceptical to the last degree; and who yet needed to
                  believe in something,—needed some faith which could be reconciled
                  with his reason, and on which he could rest. Mine was radical enough; but I gave
                  it to him for what it was worth, and at the same time pointed out to him those who
                  had helped me reach it. I have brought the paper with me to-night. It is rather
                  long, and would be tedious to many. But you may take it, if you wish, and read it
                  at your leisure, or brand it 'heavy,' and return it to me unread."
               Stella accepted it gladly, and after Earnest and Charley went home, she sat up
                  late, and read it very patiently, as follows:
               "At sixteen years of age I was at school. During the last year I had lost my
                  boyish vivacity, had grown thoughtful, retiring, and was sometimes much depressed.
                  I had begun to perceive, to reflect, and consider. Who was I? What was around me?
                  What should I do? These are hard questions, and, in general, the last one only is
                  persistently put. But they had all occurred to me, and I could not rest without an
                  answer.
               "I did not consciously say so: I merely opened my eyes, commencing a secret and
                  silent questioning of men and things. I felt strong impulses, premonitions, and
                  powers. I had been a leader among boys. But now circumstances and regulations displayed their
                  checks. I was in a world of fashions, precedents, establishments. Wealth was the
                  special crown of endeavor, and every one was seeking to wear it. It was a despot.
                  It ordained castes, like the Hindoo theology. It was the great Bramin of American
                  society. I saw that it partially excluded me from certain circles into which some
                  of my companions might enter. These circles dubbed themselves the highest, and
                  people accepted the assumption. My father was not rich: he had accumulated and
                  lost: comfort was left, not opulence. Even then, I did not care for the magnates
                  of society, as I saw them, or for their favors. But to be excluded, looked down
                  upon, slighted, by those whom I could not regard as my superiors, if really my
                  equals, enraged me beyond measure. Madame Roland herself never hated the
                  supercilious rich more fiercely than I.
               "Pardon me; but I fancy that if my insight had been less clear, I should have now
                  started with the rest, in the foot-race for dollars. In a country free to my
                  exertions as to those of others; a country not yoked by a titled aristocracy, only
                  by a moneyed class,—why could I not climb the Mammonic hill? So I asked myself.
                  But I turned, scanned the hill, and pronounced it a lie. I said there was no hill,
                  no height there,—nothing but an ant-heap which small eyes had magnified to the
                  Andes. I said that nothing was high but lofty manhood, which was all running to
                  claws for the grasping of ingots.
               "I was not wholly wrong; I was not wholly right. I was ambitious, imaginative,
                  enthusiastic. The pettiness of the rich, and their meanness in accumulating
                  wealth, caused me to detest them, to wonder at the respect paid them by others,
                  and at the airs they took upon themselves. They seemed to me among the least of
                  civilized men. Of course I could not yet perceive their place and use in the
                  world, though it is as definite and necessary as any. But, as I have told you,
                  they sometimes preferred to walk alone,—not at my side. Once in awhile they tossed
                  me a sneer. How I scorned and cursed the presumption. They were superficial and
                  selfish; I had already thought and loved. I was really as snobbish as they; only I
                  would not recognize their special idol. They bowed before lucre; I before culture
                  and intellectual strength. My worship was the better, but not the best. That, I
                  could not yet perceive.
               "Thus I doubted society, spurning its notions and ways. Its ideas of life were not
                  mine; nor its ideas of death. Even the God I heard it proclaim, I could not
                  worship. But I was unable to peer through the objects of my antagonism, and
                  through my own position in the midst of them. So I sank into gloom, without a
                  guide.
               "My father, a man like the spectral Dane,— 
                     
                        'take him for all in all,
                        I shall not look upon his like again,'—
                     
                   could neither gratify my longings, nor teach me the wisdom to forego them.
                  His kind, self-sacrificing, trustful heart, had no experience by which to
                  interpret mine. He was astonished at what he had never before seen—settled
                  misanthropy in a mere boy. He was cheerful, upright, and simple-minded, with such perfect faith
                  in the ultimate right, that he did not ask to seeit. He was a good
                  man, without caring a great deal whether he was regarded so, or not; an honest
                  man, who would have been just as honest if there had been no courts or jails in
                  the universe,—simply because he felt it sweet and pleasant to be honest; and he
                  was practically a Christian man, without knowing or believing much of
                  ecclesiastical doctrine, but conceiving, in his tender, upright soul, that the
                  Golden Rule contained the substance of religion. In short, he was a natural man in
                  an artificial epoch. He could not help me. Who could?
               "About this time I became interested in the strange, sad poetry of Byron, which
                  appealed directly to my disconsolate, combative state of feeling.
               "Prior to becoming acquainted with the 'noble bard,' and while at school, I had
                  gobbled my share of the common novels very properly termed of the 'blood and
                  thunder' description, and a few books of better quality. Of the novels I soon
                  forgot even the names; but if they had all been piled together, and called 'The
                  Long-Bearded, Big-Booted, Bloody-Branded Rover, or the Magic Jib-Boom of the Bay
                  of Biscay,' this appellation would perhaps have rendered a general notion of their
                  calibre.
               "When about eleven years old, I had delighted in a well-Known sporting paper, and
                  had read accounts of the principal English, Irish, and American pugilists. Then I
                  was ambitious to be short and thick-set, a person of superior muscle, handy at
                  'straight-out' blows, 'upper-cuts' and 'under-cuts.'I did not quite want to go
                  into the 'ring,' but imagined it would be a posi- tive accomplishment to have the
                  prowess and the 'science' to go there, while yet remaining out.
               "This view of things soon passed away, as also the desire to become a sailor,—with
                  which 'the Magic Jib-Boom of the Bay of Biscay' had inoculated me to such an
                  unwholesome degree, that like many another foolish lad, I occasionally determined
                  to pack up my trunk, depart from my dear old father and loving mother, and become
                  a second and mightier 'Jib-Boom.'
               "The ring and the sea having faded from my vision, the martial hero appeared.
                  Napoleon—what a man was he among the giants! though Murat, his dashing marshal,
                  with the high, waving plume, seemed in some points the more dazzling leader.
               "Thus my reading had advanced from the idea of strength marvellous and monstrous,
                  to the idea of strength more natural. But still the heroes of my collection were
                  all strong men, not necessarily good ones. There were no saints among them. They
                  were upright and generous, and truthful enough;—because it would have detracted
                  from their greatness to be other-wise;—good fellows as well as mighty, but not too
                  much hampered by any strict sense of duty.
               "The heroes we worship, are our ideals embodied and accomplished. What I was at
                  this period, in my central tone of mind, in my feelings and wishes—without, of
                  course, any ability to execute them—Achilles, and Alcibiades, and Themistocles,
                  had lived and acted in Greece, Caesar and Antony in Rome, and Napoleon in modern
                  Europe. These were all powerful, selfish men of the world, who could secure what
                  they sought in it, and who could do as pleased them best.
               
               "At this time I encountered the fiery soul of Lord Byron, through his 'Harold' and
                  'Corsair,' his 'Vision,' his 'English Bards,' and his 'Don Juan.'
               "Here, again, was depicted, in the most wildly fascinating colors of feeling and
                  imagination, mere strength—ambitious, dark, wasted strength. Yet the devil in such
                  guise seemed more beautiful than an angel; and who but Byron should thenceforth be
                  my criterion of greatness; and what but poetry was worth man's while beneath the
                  sun.
               "But it was decided that I must engage in some kind of business. I was offered a
                  position in a mercantile establishment, and took it. My duties were light, and I
                  had several hours of leisure each day. Sometimes, in fact, I could have almost the
                  whole day. Without neglecting my business, I was sure to occupy the spare time,
                  book in hand.
               "Here my outward life was floating along in the quiet, ordinary channel. But my
                  mind and heart were rolling, surging, and tumbling, far out on a stormy sea. My
                  body was amid the surroundings of commerce. My soul was scudding on chaos,
                  impelled by one restless motor—ambition, toward one goal—poetical glory.
               "How could I be happy? When alone, if not applying myself relentlessly to some
                  book, I was sure to be munching my sorrow. I took every occasion for retirement
                  that I possibly could. I seemed out of place in the world, and the world seemed
                  sadly out of place itself.
               "But was such a state of mind independent? Was it not derived from Byron's
                  influence?
               "The writings of Byron first brought to my mind a keen inherent taste for
                  literature, and especially for poetry. Then followed the ambition to convert the
                  taste into a power. From the exercise of the power, I desired greatness, glory. So
                  far, then, the influence of Byron merely discovered to me what finally appeared to
                  be my 'effectual call,' my dearly beloved, my chosen pursuit.
               "But why the melancholy? Was not that the fruit of the bard's morbid hold upon a
                  young, plastic mind?
               "No. Byron's influence was again a stimulant, not a cause. It only came to
                  properties ready and waiting.
               "What covered Byron himself with gloom? He broke into a world which he regarded as
                  foolish, frivolous, and unkind; its people little in aspiration and
                  endeavor—'tickled with a straw'; large in selfishness—grasping each at the all of
                  every other man. Their pursuits, so important and engrossing to themselves, seemed
                  to him the mere strivings of children for a larger kind of toy-houses than their
                  infancy delighted in, and for a play-ground increased in extent while diminished
                  in innocence. Their conception of God was, to him, a variable and dubious ogre;
                  and their conception of their own relation to their Creator, a matter of mere
                  assent to uncertain formulas,—a thing of belief, which he could not believe,—a
                  matter of set devotions, church-presence, and water-drops. And he himself—what was
                  he? Where was his place in this odd, interminable labyrinth? How was he different
                  from the rest? unless, indeed, in knowing that they could not be right,—that they
                  were far from wise, and that he, too, was more distant from wisdom than even from
                  sympathy and harmony with them. Was he not, in fact, more miserable, more pitiable than they?
                  They could rest secure in their credence, and satisfied with their vocations.
                  However sandy the foundation of the one, or trivial the pursuit of the other, to
                  them, these things were stable, and important, and real. While he, searching for
                  absolute truth, could find no resting-place for the sole of his foot; enamored of
                  perfect beauty, must everywhere drag with him, in quest of it, a poor body touched
                  with distortion; and loving justice and right, as the ideals of his inmost soul,
                  must still be as painfully conscious of incumbent flesh-pots, of muddy promptings,
                  and selfish, savage passions, as any honest parson that ever accepted the notion
                  of total depravity, or dreaded an outward, personal, hotly-located Devil.
               "Strong, wilful, sad man!—a groping colossus amid a thousand wondrously charming
                  mirages, where, for want of an abiding, greenly-growing faith, all was still a
                  desert! He stood on the crust of the world in his time, knowing that beneath him
                  it was hollow,—the philosophy, theology, ethics, all mummies dead and buried, but
                  wrapped in cerements still costly and venerable, which to him were curious, like
                  all idols of man's historical worship, yet which could not seem more than dreams,
                  and could inspire no higher sentiment than an occasional half-tremor of fear, as
                  at the possible reality of ghosts. Yes, he stood on the surface of creeds and
                  customs, and stamping with his heel, broke them through, beholding their
                  shallowness and falsity. Then he strained his eye toward the heavens, trying to
                  see an angel who could yet explain to him how this might be, and be well;—how
                  altars might crumble and fall, and still the altar of worship be ever holy; how
                  creeds might totter and tumble, and belief still be man's halo of happiness; how
                  systems of religion could be false, and religion itself be true; how imperfection,
                  sin, misery, could universally abound, and man still be the child of God, created
                  for a blessing to himself, and a joy to the spheres. He strained his eye to the
                  heavens, but the heavens gave no sign. He had not yet the innate charm to invoke
                  the angel, and she could not come. He rolled and tossed on the waves of doubt and
                  denial, scarcely even approaching the terra
                     firma of faith, until just as he was called away from the shrine of
                  muse and sage, to a realm which faith alone, as it seems, can discover and
                  vivify.
               "It was left for other and later minds to accept the same doubt and denial,—to
                  perceive the barrenness of creeds, and systems, and establishments;—then to
                  reconcile this perception with a higher, a purified belief. Byron in youth, Goethe
                  in youth, were the symbols of an inevitable dissatisfaction, an unavoidable
                  scepticism, which the ripeness and decay of old institutions necessitated for the
                  regeneration of Europe. Byron, the young man, flamed high, and then went out,
                  while the symbol was unchanged; Goethe, the old man, lived to see that the youth,
                  Goethe, was miserable and fantastic, because, perceiving the falsity and
                  rottenness of the world's standards of truth, he could not see beyond his own
                  scepticism. But to the old man, truth was not doubtful or dead, while many things
                  which had been commonly accepted as truths, were forever inhumed.
               "But what could a poor child, like myself, know of all this? Before I could
                  comprehend it, my own mind must be
                  lifted into the sunlight. I must be dashed against some sharp, ragged just of
                  experience; must often be thrown violently in upon my inmost soul, to wonder, and
                  reflect, and suffer; must mount high on many a towering peak of thought, borne up
                  by other intellects, as a traveller on the shoulders of some clear-headed, sturdy
                  guide. Now I was a boy. I had thought, and felt, and read enough to doubt, to
                  discredit, to hesitate. I had stumbled on questions I could not answer; had wept
                  and despaired over defects, sins, and sorrows—my own and others'—which I could not
                  penetrate and solve. In short, my tone of mind epitomized in miniature the chief
                  phase of the general advance of mind in the last half of the eighteenth century,
                  and the earliest part of the nineteenth. This epoch was strangely foreshadowed in
                  Shakespeare's character of 'Hamlet'; Britain incarnated it in Byron, and Germany
                  in the early manhood of Goethe and Schiller. Voltaire was a partial embodiment of
                  it; but the sprightly Frenchman, though the essence and full-bloom of intellectual
                  scepticism, had scarcely the central earnestness of nature to be unhappy about any
                  thing. Germany, however, possessed this trait in a most remarkable degree. While
                  doubting to the depths of negation, the German soul grew sorely sick of doubt. It
                     must break through denial, to something better, or
                     die. So Germany built up the new faith of to-day; and her children
                  have been those 'semi-Greeks' who 'think for Europe,' and for mankind.
               "Their thought is now the thought of the nations. Byron passed away from Britain;
                  and what he might have been had he longer lived; what Goethe was in mature
                  years;—came largely to life in an odd, sonorous, angular Scotchman, Thomas
                  Carlyle. France, whose Père Bonhours was
                  suspended over the pool of oblivion by a single thread, according to that same
                  Scotchman, in memory of having once asked: 'Si un Allemand
                     peut avoir de I' esprit?'—France received the new wine into her very
                  best mental bottles, from Madame de Staël to Victor Hugo; and it has become even a
                  popular beverage, spiced as only France—nicely discriminating, critical, executive
                  France—can flavor the riches of her sunny vineyards. In America, flowing
                  especially through the deep, deep, but clear crystal goblet of Emerson, and
                  through the broad, heavy Saxon mug of Theodore Parker, it has done much more than
                  editors and the clergy know, to shatter unsightly decanters of Church and State,
                  and to infuse into the gigantic young Republic, freedom of body, freedom and vigor
                  of soul.
               "I said that the frame of mind which enveloped me, and which I have been trying to
                  describe, was a sort of summary and likeness of the first part of our century.
               "I had lived, as it were, within myself, the history of the world's life, up to a
                  certain stage of its development.
               "Man, as his records portray him, was at first a simple, cruel, superstitious,
                  pettish being, robust and shaggy in body, and constantly at war, family with
                  family, tribe with tribe. Large physical bulk, with corresponding force and
                  activity—ability to crush enemies—was the desire of the aspiring, was the one
                     constit- uent of greatness. Some
                  Samson or Hercules was the great man, the admired of swains and maids. Mankind
                  took one step forward, and force of mind, applied to the same end—war—constituted
                  greatness and achieved glory. The man who could plan an ambush, invent an arrow or
                  spear, was plainly more powerful than one of huger body, with his weighty fist, or
                  a club. Bigness of proportion—brute bulk—was first eminence; then came a sort of
                  cultivated animalism of the intellect:—first the fighter, whose art lay in his
                  height, his arms, his thighs; then the handy bowman, or swordsman, or organizer of
                  men into companies.
               "In my feelings, in my ambition and imagination, I had been each of these. The
                  pugilist, sporting-paper in hand, proud of his 'manly art,' is nothing more or
                  less than primordial man the savage, of I know not how many thousand years ago.
                  The alphabet and broadcloth have not essentially changed him. When I pictured
                  myself as 'The Long-Bearded, Big-Booted, Bloody-Branded Rover,' fighting for fame,
                  for revenge, for riches, I had advanced one degree, and become the
                  fillibuster—Romulus, or Norman William, Spanish Pizarro, or William Walker.
               "Then I took another step.
               "In recognition of the absolute supremacy of intelligence, the pen had been
                  declared mightier than the sword. I, too, felt that it was greater to think, to
                  know and declare, than to wield the blade of the soldier. Now I was in the realm
                  of intellect, looking down upon physical ambition and force. I wanted them not;
                  but longed to command fame and power through the exercise of thought and feeling.
                  How far had I grown in my wishes and objects? From the savage to the man of
                  letters. It seems a good distance. But ambition was the incentive; glory, power,
                  the end. For fame I would have brandished the pen as ferociously as ever a Carib
                  his club, or a Gallican his battle-axe. Not quite indiscriminately, right or
                  wrong, against friend or foe; yet almost any way to accomplish the purpose.
               "Here was a 'power-man,'—a Mandingo carried up into the sphere of intelligence and
                  refinement.
               "It is a most unfortunate temper of mind. It is an exalted mental cannibalism. It
                  is still mere strength, grasping for its object—fame, wealth, enjoyment,
                  power:—not literally eating up the body of its victim, not necessarily delighting
                  in his torture;—for the senses have become sublimed;—but heedless of any fate that
                  may befall him, willing to submit him to any fate, if only he stands in the way.
                  What cares it, really and inherently, for man or woman? 'Self! self!' is its
                  cry,—'Give! give!'—'What I crave, that will I have!'
               "Yet such, on the one hand, has been the shout of men, the shout of the ages, from
                  barbarism to the highest civilization.
               "On the other hand, there has been a censor and director—conscience, religion,
                  God. Men have asked, when self demanded a thing, 'Shall I do it? Dare I take it?'
                  They have said, 'There is One above; there is duty to him. Is it not better to
                  forego this pleasure, to resist this temptation, than to disobey Him who must know
                  and order best?' They have bowed and believed; they have constructed systems of
                  faith; they have obeyed.
               
               "But they have grown also. The faith, the truth of one age, has been the doubt,
                  the falsehood of the next. And the breaking-up of a special faith, too often,
                  perhaps always for the time, brings universal misgiving and disbelief. Men deny a
                  certain conception of God, a certain standard of right, which they perceive to be
                     not God, not right; but alas! they often see no
                  farther than the contradiction: they doubt God himself, and are not clear that
                  right exists. Still, sense clamors for its dinner, the body for its joys, the mind
                  for the indulgence of its appetites and tastes. Now where is the censor, the
                  director? What voice shall say: 'Peace; be still?' At most, nothing better than
                  the higher attributes of selfishness—refined calculations and fears—can control
                  and rectify. Humanity may then be courteous, dignified, sparkling; it cannot be
                  conscientious, it cannot be good. 'Voltaire,' said one who knew, 'was the
                     cleverest of all men past or present; but a great man is something
                  more, and this he surely was not.' No, the doubter, the denier, cannot be truly
                  great, but merely strong and smart. Cultivated antagonism is dexterity, not
                  ability. Ability journeys with the stars in celestial orbits. It sits in God's
                  hand, and moves with that. Where that moves, let not mere power—man's
                  selfish strength—be stationed, thinking to stand. It must bow low, and supplicate
                  for light; or it shall fall crushed, bleeding, dead!"
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               STELLA leaned back in her chair, wrapped for a few minutes in deep meditation.
                  Then she took up the manuscript and resumed reading.
               "I have endeavored to account, from my own experience, for the cause of the
                  sadness, violence, and discontent, which have pervaded so many minds and so much
                  of our literature, in recent days. It came unavoidably from the growth of mind
                  itself, which had become too large for its ancient forms of belief and action, but
                  was destined to grope awhile sullenly in the dark, before it could clothe itself
                  with better. It is necessary for every soul to feel that it is of use in the
                  world, and to hope confidently for its future well-being, if it is to have present
                  content. How much we are dependent on faith! It smooths all our actual ills into
                  future blessings. The poorest faith is better than none. But our faith is always
                  dependent on our perceptions; even if we perceive nothing more than good grounds
                  for trusting our neighbor, and believing as he does.
               "When thirteen years old, being of Puritanical, orthodox stock, I was a Calvinist,
                  just as I should have been a Mohammedan, if born in Constantinople, and my mother
                  had attended a mosque. That is, the
                  weight of local circumstance was upon me, and I took its assertions for
                  granted.
               "The first time I distinctly contradicted it, was directly on this point of sect.
                  A well-meaning man, with a low forehead, preached the everlasting perdition of all
                  Pagans, Romanists, Jews and sundry, reserving a contracted, insipid heaven for the
                  mouthful of men and women belonging to his own denomination. I was not quite
                  fourteen. I asked myself—doubting for the first time—if the minister could be
                  right. I never insulted my God but once by so foolish a question. In twenty
                  seconds I had broken forever from my accidental church.
               "But I was driven to think. If here was not the truth, where should I find it?
               "I never doubted, for an instant, the existence of God. I could not doubt it,
                  though I knew not the reason. It seemed as much a fact, as my own existence. I
                  should have doubted both, if one. I have since read many writings on the subject,
                  among others, those of that wonderful anatomist of the human soul, Immanuel Kant.
                  I have seen that our faculties rest directly upon the idea of God,—that they
                  cannot take a step in consideration of themselves, or in any direction, without
                  it,—that it is the one pivot whereon each and all of them swing. But at the time
                  of which I speak—in my boyhood—it was enough for me, as for the world, to
                     feel the fact; I did not ask why. Neither did I demand why there
                  should be religion—man's duty to God. Its germs and promptings were in the core of
                  my being. I might as well have ignored the whole of my nature as this part. It was
                  only the theology that I began to rebel against. But they told me the theology was
                  religion—the Christian religion. I must believe it, or be harried along into the
                  pit, with the Pagans and Catholics. I concluded to go, if that was the
                  understanding. But it did not trouble me much. The doctrine was too absurd, too
                  horribly wicked, to inhere long in a healthy mind. It was a sort of pip, to which,
                  at the time, as a young chicken, I was liable.
               "Yet now that I began to interrogate them, many other doctrines seemed no better.
                  Then came my disavowal of money as the measure of worth; my longings for
                  intellectual power and fame. They could not be gratified; and it was well. The
                  period of negation and subversion had been fully represented. Constructive minds
                  were already in manly vigor, though I knew not of them. Within a day's ride were
                  two of the loftiest in the world. But it was to be several years before I could
                  grope my way to them, as there was no sympathetic soul to guide me. So what with
                  my ambition, my doubts, and the knowledge of my sins and imperfections, down I
                  dropped into the misanthropy that I have referred to.
               "Poetry, as a pursuit and solace, was here paramount. I loved Byron and his
                  thrashings of hypocrisy, with all my heart. I liked thrashings in general. I
                  thought the world needed all it ever received. I ached to thrash it myself. But
                  instead, it was giving me the knout, as I needed.
               "No modern poem helped me much, except 'Festus.' For I craved something that would
                  lift me to a sight of the axis of the universe. Then I could perhaps dis- cover why I was whirling around it.
                  'Festus' is a fair attempt to do this. It has been a strenuous aid to many. It is
                  the crystallization of Universalism, and the doctrine, like the crystal, sparkles
                  with manifold hues of love. But the book and the teaching are theological and
                  mythological. They are the half-way-house between 'Orthodoxy' and rational
                  Christianity.
               "Meanwhile I read some of the sceptical writers of the eighteenth century. I could
                  not but credit many of their statements. But they appeared cold, suspicious,
                  mental. They did not sufficiently distinguish between religion and theology; but
                  inclined to ridicule both. I read some of the chief 'Evidences of Christianity,'
                  ancient and modern; but never found one that gave me any satisfaction.
               "At last, a plain, quaint man put into my hands a book of Theodore Parker's
                  sermons. Theodore Parker! Who was he? I had seen his name in the papers; I had
                  heard him called an 'infidel.' That, I knew, sometimes meant a man who doubted
                  miracles; sometimes one who doubted the 'Fugitive Slave Bill.' I had heard Beecher
                  called an 'infidel;' but on reading his discourses, had found only a great,
                  munificent heart, near to God and man, but not very different in leading ideas
                  from my first good parson. It seems astonishing now, that I did not sooner find
                  something to lead me to Theodore Parker. But I fancied him a clever preacher, like
                  Beecher or Chapin,—stronger, broader, better, but not much higher
                  than others. I loved these men; but they had not the kind of light I needed. My
                  friend loved them too. But he said, as he gave me the volume of sermons: 'You will
                  find your doctor here.'
               "He was right. Here, indeed, was the first glimpse I ever had of an American
                  giant, standing up, head and shoulders, with the loftiest thinkers of the human
                  race. The others had been cramped and insulated. I had now come upon a spiritual
                  cosmopolitan. Horsed on a score of languages, he had sped through the literature
                  of all times and all places. What men had anywhere thought, what they had felt,
                  what they had done, that he knew. Could Napoleon sit on his horse sixteen or
                  eighteen hours a day? Here was an iron man, who could keep the saddle of letters
                  as long, day in and day out, preaching, praying, and feeding the poor besides.
                  Where was the scholar out of Germany, or even there, in the land of students, who
                  was so intent and so laborious? Had there been colleges in New England or Old?
                  libraries at Alexandria or Rome, Paris or London? Their use was plain. Here was a
                  mind that engulfed them like a maelstrom. He had watched the growth of his race
                  from its babyhood to the year of our Lord 1855. It was refreshing to get into the
                  wake of this 'Great Eastern.' Of course I had no silly fear of going down in so
                  tremendous a vortex as his intelligence. Only snivellers told me that great
                  knowledge made great demons and fools.
               "It would take me too long to enumerate the particulars of the change through
                  which my mind now passed, and to mention all the sturdy aids to its reflection.
                  Theodore Parker, however, immediately guided me to the books and the men I had
                  been groping to find. He knew them all; and still better, he had compressed their
                  labors into his own. What gave him a great advantage, too, was that while the best
                     new thought and research glowed in
                  his furnace, he could-pound as no other man, with the olden hammer of Scotch
                  logic. His facts were all in order and degree. The executive English and American
                  mind needed this. It could understand him, while it could not grasp the single
                  deeper intellect, which he himself pointed out as such, saying, as he referred to
                  his friend Emerson: 'America had seen no such sight before.' Surely our land had
                  not. 'That great, new star, a beauty and a mystery,' was the one orb which shed a
                  brighter, a keener effulgence, than the mammoth reflector at Music Hall.
               "But many minds, I think, have seen Emerson through Parker. Many have received all
                  the former's light they could contain, by means of the latter, while they could
                  scarcely have received any of it without him.
               "A Boston merchant of practical sense, and a good reader, once told me he did not
                  believe Emerson ever knew what he wrote or talked about. I considered it
                  preposterous to discuss the matter, and so asked him what he thought of Theodore
                  Parker.
               "'Theodore Parker,' he answered, 'was the greatest man that ever lived; he knew
                  everything.'
               "The difficulty was that my friend the merchant, had a tough, formal, Saxon head,
                  and could only perceive truth by means of authority and the customary arrangement.
                  Ordered as it came immediately from intuition, and in Emerson's hydraulic pressure
                  of style, in which sentences mean centuries, it was impossible for the man to
                  comprehend it.
               "Well, Emerson and Parker became my sages, as through them I could behold a
                  universe fit to live in, and a God large enough and good enough to be really the
                  Father of all his creatures. With the service of an extra language or two, it was
                  easy to consult and compare other vast minds. In fact, the busy brains of scholars
                  were bringing every Grecian, Roman, German and Frenchman, to speak first-rate
                  English; and as I was after thought, not its clothes, I always struck for the
                  substance where I could obtain it most readily.
               "In five or six years from the day I stumbled upon the question of perdition for
                  pretty nearly the entire race of man, I had gone over considerable ground,
                  clearing up that matter, with several of its surroundings. I could take my
                  'catechism' to pieces and put it together again, so that it was intelligible to
                  me. I had ascertained when, how, and why, its component parts came out of that
                  human nature which was my human nature.
               "I had found, to begin with, that 'Religion is no more to be confounded with
                  Theology, than the stars with Astronomy.' Religion is always duty to God as best
                  one knows. Theology is always man's conception of God; and it varies according to
                  the wisdom or folly of the man. But to perform our duty to God, we must have some
                  idea of Him. So far, religion is dependent on theology. Yet as soon as man
                  acknowledges himself to be finite, and God to be infinite, he owns that he, the
                  finite, cannot possibly have a complete conception of the Infinite,—only of some
                  of its attributes, as wisdom, justice, goodness. This is the end of theology,
                  which is the attempt of the mind to construct God, and which, in one direction,
                     invariably leads to idolatry of a
                  physical or spiritual kind. Theology is itself the breaking of the first two
                  commandments. It carries the soul,however,—if not to the possibility of defining
                  and picturing God, yet to an idea of Him as all-wise, all just, all-good: that is,
                  Self-conditioned Perfection. Let us not try to name it. It is ineffable. Yet if we
                  mean this, we may call it God.
               "If we have found, then, that perfect wisdom, justice, goodness, is that of God
                  which we may know, what is Religion? Is it not the imbibing by us of these
                  attributes?—the resignation of our nature to their nature?—the approach to God by
                  receiving God into us? Underlying all nominal religions, all forms of worship, I
                  found such to be their essence and intent.
               "My Sunday-school teachers had told me that the Jews alone, of all ancient
                  peoples, were believers in One God. I found that the foremost souls of all times,
                  had looked to one source whence all things proceeded, quite as certainly as had
                  any of my mistaken instructors.
               "The contemplative Bramin among Hindoos, the scientific priest of Amun or Osiris
                  among Egyptians, believed inevitably in the existence of One Supreme God, and did
                  not attempt to portray Him. But the creative, the conserving, the destructive
                  attributes of this supreme One, were imaged in every variety of form, and before
                  these images the people bowed down with orisons. The aristocratic priest despised
                  the masses, deeming it hopeless, even wicked, to teach them religious truth,
                  except by solemn ceremonies and mystic symbols. Moses came. He was the religious
                  democrat of antiquity. He was the adopted son of a king, and so educated, it is
                  said, in the inner sense of the Egyptian worship. At any rate, like every thinker,
                  he pierced through all emblems to their centre; and taking the conception of One
                  God, made him the special deity of the Hebrews, as he had been the God of Abraham
                  and of every other lofty soul. The conception was doubtless somewhat changed,
                  somewhat purified in his mind. But the principal change was in popularizing it,—in
                  setting it up for the adoration of a whole people. And more than a thousand years
                  elapsed, before the children of Israel could fully adopt it, permanently casting
                  aside the idols which Moses had condemned.
               "There has been Fetichism in the world; there has been Polytheism. The Egyptian
                  prostrated himself before a winged bull, a serpent, or a cross. The Persian
                  saluted the orb of day at his coming. The Chaldean kissed his hand to the starry
                  host of heaven. Often both priest and people mistook the symbol for the sense, as
                  now they do, in all nations and under all forms of religion. But there never was a
                  Moses, a Minos, a Zoroaster, a Confucius, a Budha, a Pythagoras,—never a great
                  leader and type of a momentous epoch,—who did not reach the import of all rituals,
                  all representations, and bow lowly to the one God.
               "Having learned the fact, I was no longer troubled with the notion of a haughty
                  and jealous Deity, the patron of a chosen people. God had chosen all the peoples
                  to do his will.
               "In fact, it was not so very difficult to dig to the bottom of the many doctrines
                  which had perplexed and stung me. I ascertained that they had all some- thing to rest on. They were true in
                  essence, false in the acceptation. They were in nowise 'mysteries,' which could be
                  accepted by faith alone. They were fundamental facts of the soul, which had been
                  warped, at different historical epochs, into special and local phases.
               "The Trinity, of all doctrines, contradicted most emphatically my favorite study
                  of geometry. Three Gods in one; and each part equal to the whole! The conception
                  turned one's mind upside down. Yet it was true; and now I could assert it. There
                  is God the Father,—the infinite wisdom, justice, goodness. He has created man to
                  receive these properties infinitely, and thus to be His infinite Son. The universe
                  is infinite in its means of suggesting holiness to man, and of impressing
                  rectitude upon him: it is the infinite Holy Ghost.
               "The Incarnation, really a part of the former doctrine, had also afflicted me. I
                  found that five thousand years ago, it had been believed in India. There, devout,
                  ascetic, mystical men, had retired from the active world to the forest and the
                  mountain, devoting their lives to contemplation. They deemed matter and its forms
                  an illusion. Man's highest good was to crucify and ignore the flesh, and to be
                  absorbed into the one only Being and Reality, Brahm. They imagined that by
                  prayers, and penances, and austerities, they could become incorporated in the
                  Divine Essence, could incarnate God, could be God, as it were, while
                  yet on earth.
               "This was the grandest effort of piety, the most exalted dream of poetry, then or
                  since in the world. On the threshold of time, the sons of God lifted their hands
                  to Heaven, saying: 'Our Creator, let us come to Thee. Let us come into thine
                  inmost spirit, thine inmost life!' What other prayer is worth our while? What
                  other prayer has been uttered since, which this supplication does not include?
               "Our doctrine of the Incarnation was virtually a portion of Asiatic theology,
                  probably before the race could write their record. It inheres in human nature
                  itself, and if we could trace it to its origin, we should doubtless find it as old
                  as man's aspirations for the Better, for the Best. From India it appears to have
                  travelled to Egypt, or wherever there was a brain fine enough to hold it; from
                  Egypt to Greece, with Pythagoras and Plato; from Plato it entered the heads of the
                  Hellenistic Jews; and from the author of the gospel John, was
                  finally reflected, with a special application, into the Christian Church. Its
                  essence and meaning is, that man's nature may draw upon all the omnipotence of the
                  Divine, and by faithful obedience, may become that which it serves.
               "As I think of the age and venerableness of our crude theological tenets, if
                  understood in their deepest and universal sense; still more, as I think of their
                  underlying truth and value; I do not wonder at the tenacity with which strong and
                  good men have held them. I do not wonder I was told to believe, not
                     inquire. The Christian Religion, which is pure love to God and
                  love to man,—containing the most blessed benefactions of morality, of mercy, of
                  fidelity, ever proclaimed,—was destined to wear for a garment through the
                  centuries, all the great philosophical truths of the human intellect. If the garment has proved coarse
                  when the times have been rough,—if it has been a wolf-skin to the wolves' eyes of
                  our shaggy Scandinavian sires,—what matter? It was to serve them as they needed;
                  then to be of finer service to more refined epochs.
               "As the doctrines I have referred to were relieved of locality, and bore universal
                  significance, the others were soon enough cleared up.
               "The Atonement, I had been taught, was the sacrifice of the Divine Nature to
                  itself, for the good of men. God sent his Son into the world, to suffer and die,
                  that the world might be saved. This idea, too, I found to be as ancient as any
                  primeval records. In the Hindoo theology, Vishnu, representing the preservative
                  powers of God, had often been incarnated in mortal shape, to fulfil some
                  beneficent mission on the earth. Said Nareda to Crishna: 'Men, who are buried in
                  the pit of their passions, have no possibility of escape from their control,
                  except by thy mercy in consenting to be born into this transient world!'
               "True enough! How shall we receive the spirit of God—our sole salvation—unless
                  some loftier brother, by containing more of it than we possess, brings it down to
                  us? But shall we accept it gladly when it comes? Oh, no! We are dead in Mammon and
                  in mummeries. We shall say that our more gifted brother is not of God, but of the
                  devil; for we cannot understand him. We shall slay him, or banish him, for
                  interfering with the little gods we had been accustomed to regard.
               "If a Budha comes to love the poor Hindoo; to throw the yoke of caste from his
                  neck; to elevate him to a more spiritual adoration;—the groveller will turn to
                  crush the saint or his disciples,—to annihilate them, or drive them into exile.
                  Yet it shall be seen, in two or three thousand years, that a third of the whole
                  human race shall worship God in the name of Budha, as we see to-day. If a son of
                  wisdom and sanctity is born in Athens, believing that absolute justice is the one
                  thing to live for, he must go straight to prison, and drink hemlock. Then, for a
                  recompense, the sage of every generation shall borrow weight from him, and
                  civilization shall convert his thoughts into laws, for the government of nations.
                  If the most loving heart ever in flesh, descends into Judea, they will crucify him
                  between two thieves, and afterward, impressed with his heavenliness, will declare
                  that it was the Creator himself who came down to suffer and die.
               "Yes, persecuted sons of God are ever atoning to Him, with his own goodness
                  embodied in them, for the sins of all the children of men.
               "Why dwell on the other doctrines that in my childhood I had heard preached? All
                  the principal ones were sectarian applications of universal truths, which had
                  always existed where there had been souls to aspire and minds to reflect.
               "Even the monster of Everlasting Punishment, which I had so detested, I observed
                  to have a true side. It is this. Our souls are finite. If so, we must sometimes
                  err, we must sometimes sin. Only the possession of absolute perfection could
                  enable us to avoid doing so. But then we should be God. When we err, or sin, the
                  retribution must follow,—in this world, in any world, in all worlds. It is our
                  discipline; it helps us to improve upon
                  the last act. In this sense, indeed, we are perpetually punished, but perpetually
                  blessed, as well.
               "The doctrine, however, as established by the Romish church, was unique. There was
                  no such mad cruelty in the former Paganisms. Rome had become the earth's cess-pool
                  of blood and crime. The notion emanated from the interpretations of this Roman
                  people, without imagination, who could perceive no second sense in Oriental
                  symbols, who for their daily pastime tossed men and women to wild beasts, and
                  whose hearts fluttered with ecstasy, as human heads, limbs, and entrails were torn
                  and strewn before them by the teeth and claws of lions or tigers. Through no other
                  medium could the merciful teachings of Jesus have been dragged and harrowed to
                  such depth of distortion.
               "Still, it is God's way that nothing is lost. The doctrine had its use. For
                  several centuries, many rough-riding ancestors of some House of Lords, were
                  doubtless flogged into mercy to the poor, if not sympathy with the free, by the
                  threat of being everlastingly flayed in Hell. And many a baronial or kingly
                  foot-pad was crushed by it into something like justice in governing his people. It
                  was a requirement of the times. Savage men needed savage restraints. Now it is
                  empty, cumbrous, and almost ludicrous.
               "But, my friend, Christianity itself is not at all shaken or impaired, by riddling
                  the doctrinal coat of mail which has so long encased it. To the powerful deniers
                  of the last century, it sometimes seemed to fall, as they stripped off
                  contradiction and mythology, shred after shred. But criticism has only left the
                  person, the character and mission of Jesus, as bright and hallowed as ever, while
                  it has rendered them clearer and dearer, as being wholly consistent with the mind
                  and soul of man. Simply by a comprehension of the Roman Empire in the year 1, it
                  has disburdened Christianity of the miraculous, in the sense that a miracle is
                  ever a monster which breaks a natural law; and at the same time it has relieved
                  the manhood of Jesus from all mythical and abnormal apotheosis.
               "Nineteen centuries ago, almost the whole known world had been sucked into the
                  dominion of the seven-hilled City; and the talent of practical, executive action,
                  rendering such absorption possible, had engrossed about all the physical and
                  mental energy of the epoch, leaving scarcely any material for the embodiment of
                  imaginative, intuitive, spiritual natures. Old faiths were breaking up. They
                  retained but a slight hold on the learned, but were regarded as a necessary part
                  of State. The people—the populace—the vulgar—have now no parallel on earth. They
                  were submerged and overwhelmed in ignorance, superstition, and every unspeakable
                  abomination. Miracles were universally credited, and were inevitably attributed to
                  the exponents of all religions. Magic was as eagerly accepted as it is now
                  contemptuously discarded.
               "At such an epoch Jesus appeared. He came in the midst, and out of the Jews,—a
                  people who, even then, were a proverb for backwardness and superstition. But they
                  had held, through all dangers, trials, and difficulties, to an unswerving and
                  sublime trust in their god, Jehovah, who was to unite their divided tribes, exalt
                  them to material power and splendor, and give them regnancy over all nations.
                  Jesus incarnated this national trust;
                  but in him it was elevated to the bounds of utmost spiritual insight, and was
                  modified by the most loving heart ever in flesh. So the haughty and narrow Jewish
                  conception of God—the Jehovah—became in his mind the bounteous and merciful Father
                  of all mankind. Furthermore, 'he saw that God incarnates himself in man,'—that
                  man's nature is a germ for the infinite reception of God's nature: and never for
                  an instant questioning the great truths which his spirit prompted him to teach, he
                  declared that the authority for them was God himself. He proclaimed the Father's
                  truth. In that truth, then, the Father and he were one.
               "But who was rightly to comprehend this sublime 'Poet of the soul?' The whole
                  epoch was sunk in the lust of aggrandizement and the grossest materialism.
                  Probably there were not twelve minds on the earth of sufficiently celestial
                  texture to understand the thought of Jesus precisely as he understood it. More
                  than once, it seems, he sickened and grieved at the obtuseness of his very
                  disciples. Then, when the innate sweetness and truth of his precepts began to
                  force their acceptance,—first among the poor and lowly, who needed in that age of
                  shocking corruption and innumerable rituals, some religion that could touch the
                  soul and purify the life,—then all the notions, exaggerations, and subtilties of
                  the time, began also to creep into the most natural and beautiful faith ever
                  breathed to mortal ear. Then, for five centuries, the immense fabric of
                  theological dogmas was gradually constructed. Men talked, and wrote, and contended
                  about it, differing as much as they differ now. They bruised each others' faces in
                  street-fights; they skewered each others' bodies in pitched battles. At last it
                  became a thing settled by authority. What authority. Practically the Roman State.
                  It rested on what? The votes of a majority. It was a necessity of the time. Now it
                  is neither necessary nor true; and therefore is so fast dropping away.
               "But the religion of Jesus,—that perfect faith in God as the Giver of his very
                  Self to man,—which includes the Golden Rule, the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord's
                  Prayer, the fidelity of the blood which dripped from the cross—symbol of man's
                  last sublime duty to his Maker:—we need not fear that this religion can pass away
                  from our faith. Its stability is its truth. It is founded on human nature, which
                  is founded on God. It is, in one sense, the condition on which every loftiest soul
                  has been born into the world. Plato was the philosopher of all time, because he
                  saw and expounded through the intellect, what Jesus perceived and declared through
                  the heart. Socrates was wise and grand, because he too went down to death for the
                  same essential justice that Christianity affirms. Budha has four hundred millions
                  of followers, because, long before Christ, he taught something of Christian mercy
                  to the downtrodden children of Asia. Confucius was the sage of China, because some
                  of his best precepts are Christian commands.
               "Let us truly understand this religion, my friend, and we shall never be deprived
                  of a bright, serene, immovable faith."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               "A RATHER strange-thinking, plain-speaking individual, that same Mr. Acton," said
                  Cora, after Stella had finished the manuscript, which, notwithstanding Earnest's
                  warning as to its heaviness, had been read aloud at Cora's request.
               "I wonder how one dares attempt to unriddle the world. Why not be as good as we
                  can, without talking about it? Now I shall lie awake half the night, perhaps, and
                  who knows but I shall be disputing, pretty soon, with Pa, and Captain Bub, and my
                  minister, Dr. Bugle himself. How Earnest takes everything to heart! I never would
                  have bothered myself with all those questions. Yet his experience, he declares, is
                  the experience of thousands. Do you think so, Stella?"
               "I don't think it is literally so," Stella replied; "I don't think he means that.
                  I think he means thousands have had the same doubts as his, with the same
                  consequent gloom, which they have passed through, to arrive at a similar result.
                  Besides, every one has his own special imp of darkness to harass him in life, in
                  addition to the foolish beliefs and fancies of the world. With him, it was early
                  ambition, the want of riches, which he yet despised for themselves, and a painful
                  consciousness of his defects. My demon has been, as you know, a very different
                  one, in most respects. But the great object in life, appears to be the finding of
                  a faith by which we can overlook our present misfortunes in the contemplation of
                  future benefits, and can have a smile and an eye-full of kindness for God's other
                  people whom He has placed beside us. Your Charley's friend has found such a faith;
                  I have found it, though not precisely in his manner. We are now ready to live; we
                  are ready to die when it is best we should. Perhaps there is more to be attained;
                  but I scarcely know what. It is pretty nearly the whole story of our lives,
                  whether they are great or little.
               "But Cora, my dear, let us go to bed and to rest. To-morrow, perhaps I shall leave
                  you. If not, I shall go the next day. I begin to feel that I ought to be making my
                  way homeward. My silent retreat beckons me to return to it, and there think over
                  some matters carefully and alone. My heart would keep me longer here with you; but
                  I had better go. Furthermore, sweet one, I am losing you in another, who is
                  beginning to look too steadfastly on me. Kiss me, Cora, and forgive me; you know
                  what I mean. So make up your mind for a farewell to-morrow noon, or the next day
                  morning, unless you will forsake Charley and accompany me."
               "Cora was in tears in an instant. She loved Stella with an almost childish
                  devotion, and could not bear to part with her.
               "I would go with you in a minute," she said, "if I could. But Captain Bub is
                  coming home on a fur- lough, this week
                  or the next, and of course I ought to be at home with him. He has been away almost
                  a year. He's a dear, good brother, and very fond of me. He wants me to go
                  everywhere with him, when he's here. I wish you would stay a little while longer.
                  I can't go with you. I could write to Charley, every day; and that would do for a
                  week or two; but Pa and Captain Bub wouldn't dispense with me. Come; you haven't
                  been here but a little more than two weeks. You ought to stay two months at least.
                  But I know there's no use of talking. What is said by Stella, Stella does. I wish
                  she were a trifle more yielding, like poor Cora, whom she will certainly kill,
                  some day, by persistence, and absence, and conscience, and such things."
               Yes, Stella had determined to return to Boston. But why so suddenly? What so
                  hastened her conclusion?
               It was a very simple incident of the evening. After Earnest had handed her his
                  "sermon," as Cora failed not to call it, the conversation was turned to light
                  general subjects, and then to literature and music. During the latter part of the
                  evening, Stella had sat at the piano again, and played, while the friends had
                  gathered about her and listened. When she had concluded, Earnest casually took up
                  a book, and after turning the leaves mechanically for a moment, he looked at it.
                  It was a collection of Robert Browning's sweetest poems. Earnest was excited. He
                  turned to the short poem, "Evelyn Hope," the gem of its kind in the English
                  language, then put the book aside, and without a preliminary word, commenced to
                  repeat the stanzas. His friends sat motionless, and scarcely seemed to breathe.
                  Stella placed her hand on her forehead, and gave herself wholly up to the emotions
                  of the piece. She seemed to die, and to pass into other spheres, while one who
                  loved her was revealing his heart. When Earnest—his voice melted to the tone of
                  utmost purity and tenderness—came to the lines,— 
                     
                        "I loved you, Evelyn, all the while;
                        My heart seemed full as it could hold;
                        There was place and to spare for the frank young smile;
                        And the red young mouth, and the hair's young gold,—
                     
                   Stella looked up into his eye, which was beaming upon her face. Could she be
                  mistaken? Was it not love that was there, liquid and light, willing her to
                  approach and linger in it? 'Twas with the greatest difficulty she could keep her
                  seat, she so longed to throw her arms about his neck, and lie clasped to his
                  heart. He finished the poem, and she dropped her head, unable to speak. From that
                  instant, she resolved not to remain at Ironton another evening. The strong-souled
                  Stella shuddered, and felt an absolute dread of being charmed beyond the full
                  control of her will and judgment. How she loved the spell! But she must go
                  home,—yes, home, to consider, to wonder, and now once more to mourn.
               "O God!" she murmured, "would that I had found this at seventeen; but not now, not
                  now!"
               They could not prevail on her to remain. The next day, at noon, Mr. Clandon's
                  carriage was on its way to the depôt, and Cora's friend was about to leave
                  her.
               Through a note from Cora to Charley, Earnest had received an intimation of Stella's departure. He
                  was surprised and saddened. He could not refrain from presenting himself at the
                  cars, to bid her farewell. He looked into her face for the explanation her words
                  did not offer. Tenderness and regret were in the blue eyes.
               "I am very sorry," he said, "to lose, so soon, a friend whom I do not know where
                  to replace. Permit me to say it, Mrs. Torson,—I have spent a few of the happiest
                  hours of my life with yourself and your friends. If anything should come to me
                  that I should think you would take pleasure in, may I write you a line?"
               Stella could not refuse.
               "Yes," she answered; "and you will visit Boston sometime. Come and see me. No one
                  will ever be more welcome."
               Thus the friends parted.
               Stella told Cora that she might mention to Charley the facts connected with Mr.
                  Torson's will. She might also acquaint Earnest with them, if she pleased. He could
                  then draw what inference he might from her hasty departure, "though the Fates
                  know," said she, "that it will not be unfavorable to himself.
               "Neither will he regard me as volatile and capricious, for hastening away with
                  some of our plans and pleasures unfulfilled. We all had several walks, and talks,
                  and rides which I counted on. But here is the end of them."
               She kissed Cora, and stepped into the cars. In another minute the train rolled
                  away.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               STELLA arrived safe at her Boston home, though on her way one of the cars was
                  thrown from the track, causing a temporary delay and inconvenience to passengers,
                  while no one was harmed. The accident was mentioned in the Ironton papers a day or
                  two afterward, and the mention was noticed by Earnest.
               He had been sad and restless, in spite of himself, since he could no longer pass
                  an occasional evening with Stella. She presented herself constantly to his
                  thoughts. He read his books, but her image was between his eyes and the page,
                  which now conveyed to him only half its significance.
               As yet, Cora had said nothing concerning the will. He knew, however, that there
                  must be some mysterious circumstance linked with Stella's procedure, and he
                  connected himself with it. For he did not require words to arrive at human
                  feelings. He was certain that he had seen a more than ordinary tenderness in those
                  glances which had met his; had heard a more than ordinary tenderness in those
                  tones of voice, as she addressed him. He was not to be deceived. Stella had told
                  him she loved, as plainly as though her articulate vows had been communicated to
                  him. He, too, had silently avowed the
                  story of his heart to her. He knew that he had done so. He felt that she knew
                  it.
               As he read of the slight accident to the train of cars on which she was
                  journeying,—an accident which, as the papers stated, might very easily have proved
                  serious,—an irresistible tremor came over him, as though he had heard of a worse
                  fate,—as though some one had told him that his beautiful friend had been crushed
                  and mangled, and snatched away from him forever. What if it had been so!
               Then he sat down to write her of his happiness in learning that she had not been
                  injured. His note was merely expressive of kindness and the loneliness of her
                  friends, one and all, since she had left them. But in it he enclosed a few stanzas
                  of verse, which he said he had picked up recently, and which he had thought might
                  interest her for the moment. He did not say how he had picked them
                  up. Probably there was no need of doing so.
               The note was dated the 10th of April, 1861. The stanzas were these:— 
                     
                        "I sat in the silence alone,—
                        The peace of my quiet room;
                        I looked at the picture that hung on the wall;
                        There were trees and a child and a tomb.
                        But something came and veiled the view:
                        How softly, friend,—'twas a thought of you.
                     
                     
                        "I turned to the book in my hand;
                        On its page were names of the great;
                        Ideas that would soften savage men,
                        Words to be laws of the State.
                        But there on each line—it would peep through—
                        Again, my friend, was a thought of you.
                     
                     
                        "I passed out into the street;
                        'Twas a sunny April day;
                        There were couples walking arm in arm,
                        There was leisure, was haste, was play.
                        I fancied now would be something new;
                        But no, my friend, 'twas a thought of you.
                     
                     
                        "I was met by a gentle maid,
                        Whose locks the air-breath fanned;
                        On her cheek she carried the summer rose,
                        Though a daisy was in her hand.
                        She smiled and spoke; but her eyes were blue.
                        I looked, and then—'twas a thought of you.
                     
                     
                        "I walked on the distant hills;
                        I gazed up into the sky;
                        Goodness and beauty lay stretched below,
                        God and the boundless on high.
                        There was Heaven. I wonder if Heaven knew,
                        And forgave me still, for the thought of you."
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XX.
               IT was nearly two weeks before Earnest received an answer to his letter. But, in
                  the interval, what a startling change had overpowered the whole nation! Fort
                  Sumter had been bombarded! The cannon which first opened its mouth against those
                  walls was the symbol of destruction to the Union, to republican liberty, to the
                  natural laws of God to man. A few saw all this at a glance, and knew that the
                  second great hour of American history had at last struck. The many saw that the
                  Union, the great idol never to be questioned in the instinct of the masses, had
                  been threatened, and was liable to be thrown from its pedestal. This was
                  sufficient for them. The land, east and west, was in a blaze of indignation, a
                  storm of anger. Massachusetts was rushing through Baltimore to Washington; New
                  York was close behind her. God, Liberty, Union, had come to mean something.
                  Religion invoked its followers to take up a cross,—heavy, sad, dreadful war. They
                  said: "We will: God help us!" The great "revival" had been granted of Heaven, and
                  a practical salvation was at hand. It was a salvation of self-sacrifice, of manly
                  deeds, of noble duty. There is no other. The day of grace had dawned, and the
                  American people seemed worthy of its resplendence.
               To Earnest, the outburst was not wholly surprising. He was young. He had trusted
                  the intentions of men. He knew that commonly their vision was very limited, their
                  views were very narrow. But he had been sure that Americans loved America; he had
                  been sure that they meant to love liberty. They had been so warped and confounded
                  by the littleness of politicians, and the grovelling ambition of strong statesmen,
                  who were yet not strong enough to be great, who were too selfish to be true, that
                  they knew not whither they were drifting, where they should find justice and
                  safety. But all the time they were bent on these things.
               A few at the North really gloated over aristocracy and slavery,—believed them
                  necessary and right. These were virtually Austrians and Turks, accidentally born
                  under American institutions. A few others accredited nothing in heaven or earth
                  but a fat pocket. These were of no special nationality. They were poor fellows
                  whom every thinker saw to be lingering in the quadruped condition, attempting to
                  be men, even supposing they were such. But the fox, the jackal, the spaniel,
                  peeped out constantly under their pinched brows.
               There were these two classes. But the American masses looked steadily at Mr.
                  Jefferson's Declaration of the Rights of Man. They trusted it would be fulfilled.
                  They had determined it should be fulfilled. But they thought the Constitution good
                  enough to make its Preamble veracious. If not at once, then sooner or later.
               
               Earnest had scarcely ever talked with a sturdy, honest man, of any vocation or any
                  party, who did not thus reconcile his present political action with the future
                  welfare of his country. He had seen and conversed with many such persons. He had
                  met, too, the sharks, and the rhetoricians of the wind-bubble. But on these he had
                  wasted no time. He had paid but little attention to the mere forms of law and
                  legislation, while he had studied closely the substance which these forms are ever
                  striving to comprise,—progressive human life. He knew himself; he knew others. He
                  prophesied, therefore, that in case of actual collision between the North and the
                  South, there would be an uprousing of the people, and a merging of parties.
                  Cunning graybeards, versed in what they termed practical knowledge, told him he
                  had better wait and tremble; that the masses were chaff, blown one way as easily
                  as the other. Young attorneys reiterated the advice and the assertion. These had
                  felt of their own pulse. Earnest had laid his hand on the nation's heart.
               How he rejoiced in manhood now! How his soul leaped out to the people, who more
                  than affirmed all the soundness he had declared them to possess!
               Now, also, he saw the use of the watchword Union! which mealy
                  hypocrites had so often mouthed, as they favored meanest measures and filthiest
                  harpies, that the word itself had been coated with a secretion of their own slime.
                  By it they had meant lust of wealth, lust of power, lust of rapine. They had meant
                  the assassination of freedom,—the confederation of two hundred and fifty thousand
                  autocrats, to despoil man of his birthright and make him a slave.
               Here was the revulsion. Now again it was Union, Union, Union forever!
                  Ah, yes! and now it was a cry to devour the hypocrite and the assassin
                  himself.
               In itself, and for itself, it was a low war-cry—the shriek of divers and
                  dippers—mud-fowls in quest of worms. It deceived Europe. We seemed an army of
                  peddlers, who had thrown off our packs and gone to a rat-hunt in our stinginess of
                  corn; an army of snakes, full of venom now that we could no longer burrow in all
                  of our accustomed ground-holes; an army of alligators with the jaw thrown back
                  when certain bayous were denied us to batten in.
               Well, how many of us were ourselves deceived. We must do justice to our tough
                  democrats. They had heard so much of Union!that they supposed it
                  meant, under God, everything good and great. They supposed it synonymous with the
                  integrity and sense of Washington, the genius of Jefferson, and the grip of
                  Jackson. When the Hon. Vulgar Loudmouth bawled Union!they imagined he
                  talked of liberty; not a mutton-chop and his glass of brandy.
               This was the rule. Certainly there were many who were ready to fight for the mere
                  acres of ground,—who conceived there was nothing better to fight for. Their shout
                  of Union! was the wrath of man praising God,—mud turned into divine
                  muscle. The end to be attained in God's design, in good men's efforts, was human
                  freedom as the immediate foundation of incalculable human advancement. What a
                  spectacle!—to see for once, saints, scholars, hucksters, hunkers, and thieves, all
                  lending a hand to Heaven!
               Earnest felt it was the one sight of a lifetime, and he threw out all his faculties to the view. He had
                  almost forgotten Stella. But now her letter was before him, and her sweet face
                  rose from his memory, serene, intelligent, sensitive, grand.
               Yes, he would leave the gathering storm of war, and dwell for a little while with
                  his thoughts, and with the image of his friend. His eye ran hastily over the
                  letter, as if to devour its substance at a glance. Then he would read it more
                  carefully.
               But here were some verses. What! was Stella favored of the Muse? Was this another
                  of her accomplishments? Her letter stated it was not. She partly apologized for
                  sending the stanzas.
               "My friend," she wrote, "the floodgates of principle have at last opened in
                  battle, and as there is no other way for them to open, God be praised for this
                  way! I am here among the sons of the Puritans. I am not ashamed of them. They were
                  not dead: they slept. I had sometimes feared the old blood was all out of their
                  veins. But in these last few days I have seen Otis, and Adams, and Hancock,
                  striding about our modern Boston. What else than they and their spirit have I
                  beheld here since the 12th? It is so with you; it is so in all parts of the North.
                  What a time, after all, is this we are fallen upon! What history must the country
                  now inevitably write during the next five or ten years! But I will not look
                  forward. The present is enough.
               "I have done little but read the daily journals since I left you. A few times I
                  have sat down to my piano. The wish came over me to throw something of the passing
                  hour into music. I made the attempt to thun- der, and threaten, and proclaim,
                  sounds descriptive of the outburst around me. Then I tried to adapt the sounds to
                  words. Perhaps the words are lame. I feel that they at least need the music to
                  render them complete. But I send them to you. Try to make me some better ones.
                  Then you and I can have a song for the times."
               "I think I shall not," said Earnest, as he read them. They were these:— 
                     
                        "It has come! it has come!—the cannon's grim thunder—
                        From threatening clouds that have flashed in the South!
                        Columbia, pallid with wrath and with wonder,
                        Darts fire from her eyes, fiery words from her mouth!
                        They have shot down the stars,
                        O Spirit of Mars!

                        "That lazy-leaved tree has borne fruit for the nation,
                        That's poisoned its breath with a feculent lie!
                        And now that for crime, it would sever relation,
                        My banner, with thee, cut it down! let it die!
                        They have hated the good,
                        They have thirsted for blood:

                        "Strong sons of the North, ye are roused from a slumber
                        That long has been rusting your glory away.

                        Ye were drunken with gold!
                        But oh! we are bold!
                        And your grasp is a fate to the purpose ye hold!
                     
                     
                        "Ye meant in your hearts that our country should never,
                        No, never bow down to the whip and the chain!

                        Then war to the hilt!—with a will that is stronger
                        To burst all her shackles and scatter her throng!
                        There, down let her fall!

               CHAPTER XXI.
               SOON after Earnest had read Stella's letter, Charley Merlow came into his room,
                  and told him the circumstances connected with her marriage, and her deceased
                  husband's will. Cora had narrated them in full to him on the previous evening.
               "The secret is out, my boy!" he exclaimed; "and now I scent the sole cause of her
                  fury to regain the classic cow-paths of Boston. A certain dear fellow, over here,
                  was making himself felt as such to my lady the Torson. She has a heart. She fears
                  it is flesh. She would tuck it away out of danger. She is conscientious. She is
                  sensible. She has looked in the glass. She knows she is somebody,—quite somebody,
                  with several attractions,—and doesn't believe you are blind. Well, there
                     was a little conversation, I noticed, between your eyes and hers.
                  They had a way of sparkling to each other that was growing serious. A minus A
                  equals 'ought,' as the boys used to say at school. Heart minus the possibility of
                  hand, equals ought not plus a journey to Boston for consideration of
                  the matter.
               "But you and she were made and foreordained for each other from the beginning.
                  Neither of you will be content alone.
                  She doesn't care a pothook for wealth; and her position, forced by the will, has
                  almost made her hate it. There's money in your brains, and bread to be had outside
                  the bakery of Jabed Z. Torson. The question, then, before my side of the house, is
                  how to send his will to the devil. Furthermore, if one storms Hades, I don't think
                  he should be too tender about the sort of fire he uses. Why not slop a dipper-ful
                  of his own brimstone into his black majesty's very face? But"—
               "Charley, Charley, you are going wild," interrupted Earnest. "Listen a minute. You
                  say the will depends almost wholly on her word?"
               "Yes."
               "Then may she break that word never! You say her parents rely on her. Then Heaven
                  prompt her to stick by the money! You say that, if she disregards the will, the
                  property will probably slide into doctrinal tracts and pro-slavery pamphlets.
                  Well, that is not of so much consequence. The flag that was shot down, the other
                  day, is all that ever gave slavery any real security in the country. It will die
                  now in ten years,—perhaps in five. All the corruption of earth can't save it, to
                  say nothing of a ghost's bank-account. The other matter, too, is of as little
                  importance. God's great truths of faith and life vibrate to no pedant's whim or
                  his purse. Still, a personal inclination to anything but a duty, cannot outweigh a
                  third of a million dollars. I should advise that noble woman, whom I will own that
                  I love, to think well, before allowing her fortune to pass into other hands.
               "My dear Charley, we will not send the Torson's will to the devil,
                  for our own convenience. But I shall have a little talk with Stella in a few days,
                  and tell her that I have not done myself such injustice as to see her and keep my
                  heart. The regal woman! How I long to be with her once more, if only for an hour!
                  I shall not ask her love. I shall not ask for anything except to be followed by
                  her eye and her heart, as I walk away from her with a sword by my side. Yes, one
                  thing more I shall ask,—that we both live to hope.
               "For, Charley, I who have outgrown all ambition for feathers and the stuff they
                  call glory; who now wish to live only for knowledge and truth; I too must strut
                  off, like the rest, with gilt buttons and a cockade. The times have brought us to
                  this. How dearly have we paid for our fostering of slavery, which now threatens to
                  devour the best fruit that Christianity has borne for the ages! And slavery knows
                  no other argument than war. It is a wild beast. To kill or be killed is all that
                  is left to civilization, religion, justice, peace. War is wrong. It is the one
                  great wrong next to slavery. But my country is not going to war. It has shuddered
                  at the thought for years. I mean the nineteenth century at the North. The
                  middle-ages, at the South, have hugged the sword, of course, and have compelled us
                  to wield it against our will, as in Mexico.
               "I say my country is not going to war. It hates war. It has risen above the spirit
                  of military strife. It loves peace, industry, culture. It is going forth to slay a
                  wolf, whose red eyes it now plainly sees, and whose red jaws are agape to craunch
                  the very life of American principles. The wolf would eat up liberty, light, and
                  the sons of God. Not in hate, then, but
                  sorrowfully, and as mercifully as possible, these must eat it.
               
               "There was never slavery that did not bring war; and now it has fallen upon us.
                  But we shall crush the wolf, and then our wars, as I think, will be over. We shall
                  want no more of battles ourselves, and other nations will not dare to force them
                  upon us.
               "Yes, Charley, since I was eighteen, fighting of all kinds has had no charm for
                  me; unless the fighting of truth with error and ignorance. But now I shall go
                  South, and with arms. I can put my hand in God's, and feel that in this one
                  instance He lifts me to the great duty of slaying my brother for my brother's
                  good.
               "In a few weeks I shall leave you, my friend, There is no need of haste for me.
                  Others will go today, to-morrow. They will be needed. But our people do not
                  understand the South. The struggle will not be the trifle they count on. Seventy
                  years of merciless sin will not sink in a spoonful of vitriol. There is work
                  before us,—hard, horrid work. The wondrous development of mechanical forces in the
                  world, will alone preserve us from repeating the Germanic war of thirty years.
                  Possibly we shall finish ours in five. If so, it will be the speediest on record.
                  For, Charley, the South will fight,—will fight better than ourselves, in
                  proportion to numbers. Will they not? How was it with Spain three hundred years
                  ago? How was it with France when her cavaliers had their ten, twenty, or thirty
                  duels before breakfast, and when one of her knights challenged the whole German
                  nation to single combat? Oh, yes! the barbarism of the middle ages will fight; for
                  it believes there is nothing fit for a man to do but to conquer and to domineer.
                  The South is that barbarism. Not wholly so in its outward circumstances, but
                  completely so in the central tone of mind from which all its actions proceed. No,
                  there is one main difference. It has not the faith in God which inspired the
                  Crusaders and their sons. Its only great faith is a glittering dream of
                  conquest,—the conquest of the whole Western Continent.
               "But, Charley, here is a letter from Stella. Read the song she sent me. And what
                  do you think she asks me for? She wants me to write her out the philosophy of
                  slavery,—the reason it has been in the world. I shall try to do it. (Perhaps she
                  may never make me many requests.) Then I shall go to Boston myself. I want to see
                  Stella, and have a fond word from her heart to help me along in the future
                  tumult."
               Charley Merlow was amazed at Earnest's hurried words, and at his intention of
                  becoming a soldier. He knew that his friend had no taste for it, and that nothing
                  but the feeling of duty could induce him to forsake his seclusion and his books,
                  for the savagery of the camp. But he knew that dissuasion would be unavailing. He
                  merely said: "We can't do without you. Think of it again. Don't decide so
                  hastily."
               Then Charley added a good-by, and walked sadly away.
               "Not fit for any such thing!" he muttered. "Use him right up, and make a funeral
                  for us. Plenty of others to go,—strong men, used to exertion. Ought to wait awhile
                  at least. All wrong, all wrong!"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXII.
               ON the 25th Earnest wrote Stella the following letter:—
               "Let it be, my dear friend, as you say. While the whole land is burning with
                  activity, we will pause a moment and ask why.
               "The immediate cause is evident. The South has honestly declared it, throwing down
                  the glove for slavery, which it loves, and which it knows we at the North hate,
                  daily more and more.
               "But the North does not detest slavery as the South adores it. There are few John
                  Browns among us,—men ready to fight and die for the absolute idea of freedom. In
                  one sense, I should say we are not good enough for that. Then I should have to
                  modify the assertion. Conscience is not conservative: yet I think it has largely
                  entered into our forbearance and moderation.
               "There is much to consider when we examine the North.
               "For one thing, we fully appreciate the horrors of war. The South does not.
                  Slavery never did. The system, in all parts of the world and throughout history,
                  has always produced two classes of men,—soldiers and serfs. The master, whose
                  every whim has been gratified by slaves, will brook no contradiction, no
                  restraint. He is always practically a warrior. Oppose his will, he draws his
                  sword. To subdue and govern, or to find 'glory and a grave' in the attempt, has
                  ever been his leading thought. His annals give no other account of him, from
                  Cheops to Beauregard. His conception of manhood has always been to kill his
                  opponent, if an equal, and to crush his inferior into the menial of his household
                  or his land.
               "No, the South has not dreaded war, but has desired it. I know the plea is 'to be
                  let alone.' I think a few Southern men, educated at the North, honestly mean it,
                  and would like peace on that condition. But for years the one blissful vision of
                  the South has been conquest. The South expects to subdue us to its will. It deems
                  us too paltry to fight, and supposes it can beat us if we should do so. Its most
                  scheming men have believed that we would eventually throw up every principle for
                  the sake of Union; and now, seeing us obstinate and enraged, it is glad of the
                  chance to thrash us into humiliation.
               "Here is a mistake similar to that which a rough, brutal man makes in judging a
                  refined, serene man, who dislikes contention, not from fear but from a sense of
                  its wrong. The rough man thinks his neighbor, who will not fight with him, a
                  coward. But surely Socrates and Paul are no less brave than some roistering Earl
                  of Huntingdon turned into Robin Hood, or a Captain Warner wearing on his coat, in
                  silver letters, the avowal that he is 'commander of a troop of robbers, an enemy
                  of God, without pity and without mercy.'
               
               "The North is not timid. It dislikes war, because it sees there is a better
                  arbiter of difficulties. It credits enlightenment, thinking that when men are
                  truly enlightened they will wish to be just, to do right. The South cannot
                  comprehend this conviction. Slavery inevitably believes that mildness and prudent
                  industry are cowards. Feudal France thought that commercial Holland would not
                  resist her,—thought so till the dikes were down and the land submerged. 'Nobility'
                  supposed the early communes would not fight, until the conceit was knocked out of
                  its head, the brains going at the same time.
               "The civilization of the North is superior to the civilization of the South, as
                  the world knows directly from experience, the leading nations having passed
                  through slavery and sloth into freedom and industry, trying and proving both. The
                  difference is solely an affair of growth.
               "Here I come at once upon the matter of your request—the law—the cause in God's
                  providence—of the system of slavery.
               "How should I expect to enlighten you? I know, my friend, that you
                  have been upon these universal grounds which now invite me. You have beheld the
                  light above them which harmonizes all particulars, all incongruties, into one
                  vision of the Creator's beneficence. Well, then, I shall recall and confirm to you
                  that sublime view; without which we are all children; so that every toy of
                  interest, of pleasure sets us spinning in its own little whirl.
               "Let us begin as far back as we may, and speak the one commandment to every
                  created thing:—'Pro- gress!' It is the key that unlocks all secrets. It is the
                  password into all heavens.
               "Was our globe once a mass of fiery ether, the first emanation of Deity that our
                  science perceives? The step from this primary visible effect, back to God, we need
                  not attempt to trace. But the fiery ether solidifies, becoming, in ages enough,
                  the surface of a world. Now it is the barren extremity of matter,—a naked rock.
                  From this point it ameliorates. There is the coral, the fish, the plant, the
                  animal, and, when all is ready, man. Does this last production come up through the
                  preceding ones, retaining their nature, dropping their forms? Is it their direct
                  offspring? However this may be, it embodies all their qualities and powers, and
                  carries them up to a wonderful height,—into the realm of intelligence, reflection,
                  and modified self direction. Behold a being who is the middle of the universe!
                  God's spirit has been breathed into his soul; God's material forces have been
                  thrown into his body and moulded to his shape. He will use everything above him,
                  everything below. He will unfold more and more the wisdom of the skies, the
                  knowledge of the earth, taking the result into himself and growing,—which growth
                  through the spheres will be evermore his life.
               "At first he is in a state of mental babyhood,—roaming the primitive wilds of the
                  earth in uncladfierceness; strong in body, but merely instinctive; knowing just
                  enough to sustain life and to extend it. Yet presently he will arrive at
                  self-consciousness. He will ask himself: 'Who am I, in this strange world, without
                  power to cause myself, and while I can do much, am still limited on every side?' Asking the question, he will draw the
                  inference, 'There is something above me which governs and guides.' Then he will
                  look to the sun and moon as representatives of the Power his thought has mirrored
                  to him. He will worship. He will say that not to worship is a crime. After a
                  while, he will commence to write a history of himself, which will be called 'The
                  Annals of all Races and Nations.'
               "At this juncture, my friend, he is well started in life. Nor could we start him
                  differently and speak the truth. His mythologies all mean this; and you and I have
                  learned better than to read them by their coarser sense.
               "Now let us glance at Slavery as we read history.
               "The system is very venerable, like polygamy and cannibalism. We must make the
                  broadest statement for it in this respect. We may even assert a little crustily,
                  with Mr. Andrew Bell, that 'it is humiliating to civilized man to know that, when
                  authentic general history first records the doings of his earliest progenitors,
                  she speaks of his kind as being nearly all bondmen if not absolute slaves.' The
                  Mother of the Nations said,—I know not how many thousand years ago,—'Some men came
                  from the head of Brahma, to think; some from his arms, to govern and fight; some
                  from his trunk, to produce and distribute the necessaries of life; some from his
                  feet, to dig and build,—to bear the heavy burdens of the others.' The idea was
                  established, and became Hindoo Caste. By it the lowest orders of society in India,
                  the mass of men, were slaves. They were such throughout Asia. They were such in
                  Egypt, in Greece, in Rome.
               "Yes, slavery is venerable. We must even say more for it. In one of its chief
                  phases it was once a benefaction and a reform.
               "Society, at the outset, was patriarchal. The father of a family was the ruler
                  over his wives, his sons, his dependants. The family increased to a tribe. A
                  descendant of its head, or a strong usurper, was then its chief. Men had two
                  pursuits,—to fight for the ground on which they established themselves, and rudely
                  to cultivate it. They were savages. All men, as we have seen, look to some
                  mysterious Power which creates and governs them. A great spiritual intellect
                  pierces through all manifestations of that Power, and calls it Unity, Allah, God.
                  A cannibal believes it to be a more majestic cannibal than himself, with a bigger
                  club and more ferocious appetites. The Hebrews, just emerging from darkest
                  bondage, and entering upon the track of rapine, regard it as a haughty and jealous
                  God-at-arms, demanding the blood of men, women, and children, who worship some
                  opposing military deity. Hence the hot-headed, miscalculating, capricious Jehovah
                  is their conception of the Creator of heaven and earth. He demands the
                  extermination of enemies,—the cutting them up root and branch, leaving none alive.
                  In this state, society is too barbarous for an extended and mature system of
                  slavery. Women are servants or playthings; the weak, who cannot fight, are the
                  same. But veritable, historical slavery is yet to come, an improvement.
               "Now, the soldier kills his foe in battle, or offers him as a sacrifice to the
                  favoring deity who is supposed to have aided in capturing him. The bones, perhaps,
                     are heaped up as a trophy. By no
                  means must the worshipper spare an enemy to his God. But later, both mercy and
                  selfishness conspire to the innovation. It seems rather harsh, even to a Hebrew
                  savage, to murder a poor mortal after he is rendered totally defenceless. Why not
                  make him a 'hewer of wood and a drawer of water'? It is done. The captive,
                  formerly slain, is preserved as a slave. Yet afterward, if a battle go wrong, the
                  conservative priest shall snuff 'infidelity' on all the winds. He shall declare
                  that Jehovah has been disobeyed, Israel has been defiled by mercy to Canaan, and
                  the retribution has appeared. So flinty and frivolous is mankind, in the red,
                  dripping history of his childhood! Slavery is the result of war, and of the proud
                  indolence of the warrior, governor, and priest.
               "We pause here for an instant. Does God, the true Father of all races, ever permit
                  a system to exist which is not best for the time and place, and for the people who
                  are its builders? No. Let us revert to the Hindoo, with his doctrine of caste.
               "We shall find a great truth at the foundation of it. We remember that, to the
                  Hindoo, Brahma is the impersonation of God's creative faculty. Well, some men came
                  from the head of Brahma, to think. These are the highest,—the Brahmins. Here is a
                  declaration that the sage, the saint, is the salt of the earth. The maxims are
                  identical. They mean that God has so constructed the universe that the religious
                  genius is always the first gentleman and the greatest force in any realm.
               "The second class are magistrates and warriors. They come from the arms of Brahma,
                  to govern and fight. But they are under the guidance of the Brahmins, whom they
                  must consult and obey. Here is a recognition of the fact that the practical
                  administrators of the State—those who mould the perceptions of genius into laws
                  and customs—are next in importance to genius itself,—that Aaron must needs
                  execute, while Moses designs.
               "Then come the merchants,—the distributors,—from the trunk of Brahma; and last,
                  the laborers,—the diggers and builders,—from his feet.
               "Really there have always been these four classes of men in the world, perfectly
                  distinct from each other. So far, caste only expresses a universal truth of human
                  nature.
               "But it was made permanent. One class must never rise into another. No member of a
                  lower order must ever attempt to enter a higher, or to perform any of its
                  functions. As one was born into the world, so must he go out of it.
               "This part of the institution is a terrible, unmodified assertion of our maxim,
                  'Like begets like.' We may state its underlying truth thus: Some men are born with
                  natural endowments superior to those of others; culture is necessary to eminence;
                  eminence and culture should transmit superiority.
               "These are rules of every one's mind and conduct. When, too, the sources of
                  culture were very few, and were necessarily monopolized by the few, when it was
                  literally impossible for one condition to ascend into another; when the masses
                  were sunk in hopeless, stupid, willing ignorance and debasement,—caste merely proclaimed a practical, undeniable
                  fact. It was a necessity. It was a blessing, not a bane. But as soon as the
                  sources of improvement multiplied, and it became the wish and the possibility for
                  men indiscriminately to rise, the weighty millstone became a shackle about the
                  neck of progress. Bitter and bloody has been the struggle to throw it off,—a
                  struggle in which millions have yet found their employment, their hope, their
                  gratification, and which has afforded to history nearly all its pages of
                  heroism.
               "In one form and another, caste has existed from the beginning, and to-day a
                  remnant of it is about to fall in America, drenched in blood. Here, you say, it
                  rests on color, and we term it American slavery. Is it a sin?—an absolute,
                  unqualified sin?
               "We must say yes; we must say no; we must add that there is no such
                  thing as an absolute, unqualified sin.
               "Why is it that we all have two eyes, while so few can see two things at once, or
                  two sides of the same thing?
               "Sin is a matter which is heaven to-day, hell tomorrow. The patriarch may think
                  himself a man after God's own heart, yet be a polygamist and a slaveholder. While
                  he does not know he commits a sin, he is no sinner. Refusing to grow,—this is sin.
                  Clinging to the old, while seeing the new and knowing it to be better,—this is
                  sin. Excessive conservatism is the only crime ever committed in the world. If I am
                  a fool or a savage, who shall blame me for mumbling blasphemy or torturing my foe?
                  But if by any means I can be taught to know better, and my conscience rebukes the
                  former ignorance, dare I linger in the old way? Then I am Satan's own.
               "'An eye for an eye; a tooth for a tooth; burning for burning:'—this was once a
                  law of God. That is, it was the best a barbarous people knew, and consequently
                  their conception of God declared it. It was Jehovah's mandate. Virtue and
                  necessity obeyed it. But when there was one came to look deeper, and to say: 'Nay,
                  love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do evermore as ye would be done
                  by,'—and when the hearts around him reiterated this command,—the virtue which had
                  obeyed the old law, if continued, degenerated to a vice.
               "There are a thousand illustrations. But sin is always the refusal to enact the
                  perceptions of conscience, or the weakness which postpones the deed.
               "Slavery was not a sin when the low condition of the race rendered it
                  conscientious, satisfactory, unavoidable. In the nineteenth century, in North
                  America, with the New Testament in every house, and the Declaration of
                  Independence acknowledged as truth, it is the sin of sins, which has debauched and
                  disgraced thirty millions of Christians into such Atheism as ventured to jeer at
                  any law higher or better than a barely tolerable Constitution.
               "Now the retribution is upon us. It cannot but be terrible. We shall deserve to
                  lose every life that will be laid down. God's law of universal justice is exact.
                  The pendulum has swung far into darkness. Its return will be just so much death.
                  Then there will be a better life.
               "I have made the assertion of Progress. You would scarcely ask the
                  proof. You have known it. But the argument is not complete without one more word,—Experience. How do we know that
                  we advance from the lower to the higher? That word gives the answer to men and
                  nations. For the history of nations is only a reflection of man,—the shadow his
                  presence throws upon time,—the outward image of his inward unfolding. Each soul
                  lives, in greater or less degree, the annals of the world. The soul itself is
                  barbarous or civilized, beauteous or unlovely, precisely in accordance with its
                  growth,—its intellectual and moral growth. There is no enduring reward for it
                  except its own enlargement. There is no real punishment save its own
                  debasement.
               "'There is no crime,' said Goethe, 'which I might not have committed.' Why this
                  acknowledgment? Simply that he knew himself, and recognized in his impulses and
                  ideas, from infancy to manhood, those things which, if he had possessed the means
                  of executing every one of them at the moment of desire or temptation, would have
                  parallele-----*/d the record of all misdeeds. Rousseau's "Confessions" are a most
                  unreserved and detailed avowal of Goethe's admission. Here was a man of remarkable
                  virtues in his time and place, who had yet broken about all the commandments, and
                  might very easily have made no exception of any one.
               "Early boyhood makes small scruple of coveting, lying, swearing, stealing, and the
                  like. If I have never killed a person, it is not but I had a hearty will to do so,
                  several times, when a boy, as I distinctly remember.
               "An honest and fair lady once told me that 'every girl is at some period of her
                  life a flirt.' Vanity is active, and craves the admiration of many, before love—a
                  higher, later faculty—is satisfied with the affection of one. I might have told my
                  friend in return, that every boy is at some period of his life a snob. I have
                  never known a bright boy, well circumstanced, who did not think himself a natural
                  lord, born to command and to be obeyed. How many inferiors such a boy imagines are
                  around him, and how gladly he would reduce them to the menials of his wants! The
                  boy is a slave-holder. That is, he would be one if he could. Fortunately he cannot
                  generally carry his views into practice; so he is spared being a Hebrew patriarch
                  or a mediaeval baron. At seventeen, give him full power to express himself in
                  action, he would be Themistocles or the Sultan of Turkey.
               "Slavery and polygamy, always inseparable, are in every youth. I mean the spirit
                  and will of those institutions are in undeveloped human nature. Restraints of
                  circumstance may prevent them from taking shape in action. But there they are, in
                  the boy.
               "So much I have known for myself, and have seen in others. Why not make the
                  statement, as any other truth?
               "But, my friend, let us think not too ill of our kind. You know the features of
                  even the animals are in us, too plainly to be denied. Yet their rough forms are
                  much suppressed when we take them on, and are overgrown by our superior structure
                  and traits. So, the youth's outward action may be decorous and pure, the notions
                  and desires of barbarian ancestors being overborne by the weight of present
                  civilization, until he can grow, perhaps unsullied, to the summit of the loftiest
                  thoughts and emotions that man has ever entertained.
               "This constitutes the thinker, great and good, who comprehends folly as well as wisdom; for he has
                  passed through one state to the other. He knows, from experience, that love is
                  better than passion, that justice is better than will, that kindness is better
                  than hatred, that beneficence is better than oppression. He has found that life is
                  growth. Not that it is the mere accumulation of culture and aids about a certain
                  tone of mind, which may yet be selfish and low; but that it is the ascension of
                  tones of mind themselves, each into a nobler and happier, until the sublime height
                  is reached where the man desires to resign himself to wisdom, to justice, to
                  love,—the height where his will blends with God's will, and where his only
                  selfishness is in seeking welfare by subordinating all things to universal
                  law,—the method and manner of the One Only Perfect.
               "A friend of mine had arrived at an insight of this last ascension, though too
                  often he stood at a distance, looking rather than doing. He was not always good,
                  though always better than many others. Gross and common forms of sin were no
                  longer a temptation to him. He preferred death to dishonor; poverty to mean
                  wealth; insignificance to wrongfully-acquired popularity. He would be his own
                  servant rather than secure his leisure or elevation at another's expense and
                  degradation. He was true and just to man, true and tender to woman. He would not
                  have held a slave to own a continent.
               "But he had not always been so. He had been full of faults. He had wept for not a
                  few sins. We know that man always errs and sins and weeps. My friend, by
                  stumbling, had learned to walk with surer step; by shinning, he had been taught to
                  rise above many sins; having hated, he knew how to forgive hatred; by weeping, he
                  had felt how to pity those who wept. He was natural and human; nothing more. But
                  many changes and many periods of history had been incorporated in his experience.
                  He knew how events had occurred; for they had occurred to him. He spoke from
                  within, and with certainty; for his mind had been a picture of the world, with its
                  lights and its shades. The old and the new made the picture; and the new included
                  the old. It was greater, nobler, happier; so he knew it was better.
               "If any one doubted his argument, as applied to individuals or nations, he did not
                  deem it worth his while to dispute. He knew the doubter did not yet understand
                  himself,—that his nature had not introduced itself to his own observation and
                  reflection.
               "But my letter has become too long; I will close it. I have written only the
                  matter of your request, and of course the subject could be much amplified. But,
                  when writing or speaking to you, I feel as though you had already uttered all that
                  I declare.
               "In a week or two, I trust I shall see you. I intend spending a few days in
                  Boston. Then I shall bid you good-by for a long while. I am going South to
                  philosophize under brass-buttons and danglers. Yet how can I help it? The cause is
                  very sacred, though many of the present motives connected with it are little and
                  heartless. At starting, I shall want your encouragement and a smile. They will be
                  more valuable than most things I shall carry with me. I think you will not refuse
                  them to me.
               
                  "Your friend,
                  "EARNEST ACTON."
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               TEN days passed, and Earnest was in Boston. It was not long, as will easily be
                  inferred, before he presented himself to Stella. As he mounted the steps, and
                  stood in front of the massive door of her residence, he could not but remember how
                  empty and sombre the elegance of that stately mansion had been to its caged
                  inmate; how gladly she would have exchanged it, and all its surroundings, for
                  simple comfort, and one deep, fond, sympathetic heart.
               His name was hardly announced when Stella met him, with an extended hand, a smile,
                  and a slight blush.
               "I am very glad to see you," she said, "and have felt for several hours as if you
                  were near me, although I had received no intimation of your arrival in the
                  city."
               She conducted Earnest into a spacious drawing-room, and seated herself at his
                  side. They conversed a few minutes, and then she said,—
               "Now that you are here, my friend, you will stay with me a while, certainly. And
                  we can do quite well, I presume, with no others to enliven our conversation. In
                  this room we may be interrupted. Some one may call. Let us sit awhile in my
                  'sacred rooms,' as the domestics term the library and a room I have used in
                  connection with it for my music. There we shall be undisturbed."
               Earnest was quite willing to accept her invitation, and to see that Stella did not
                  shrink from him in the least, but seemed to desire that no minute of their
                  interview should be wasted.
               Again they were seated, side by side, now in the library. It was a pleasant
                  apartment, of medium size, furnished plainly, yet with much grace and elegance.
                  Since Mr. Torson's death, Stella had renovated and rearranged it in conformity
                  with her own ease and tastes. He had filled it with heavy and elaborate furniture,
                  which she had removed, and replaced by less weighty and cumbrous articles. Each
                  chair in the room seemed to indicate, by its size and shape, that its occupant
                  could find in it a new and relieved position, without intermission of reading or
                  meditation. Everything was for use and comfort. Even the pictures and ornaments
                  seemed for suggestion. Consequently there was an air of luxury about the place
                  that no amount of mere costliness could have produced.
               Earnest observed this at once.
               "What a cosey, inviting sanctum you have, to be sure," said he; "but I should
                  think it would almost persuade one to laxity instead of application. Here, I
                  should count myself in the paradise of the peaceful, I fear, and never work for
                  improvement, as my friend has done."
               "And I could very well dispense with the place," replied Stella, "although now that I have it, I
                  make it as comfortable as possible, and then try to occupy myself so that I forget
                  all about it. I am better content here, and in the other room there, than
                  elsewhere in the house."
               So saying, she rose and drew aside two large, magnificent curtains, and revealed
                  an apartment in which was a grand-piano, and looking down on it from every side
                  were the tuneful "Nine" in marble.
               "Ah! the home of the Muses," said Earnest.
               "This, too," she continued, "I do not need. I would gladly let it go for the
                  gratification of simpler feelings than it inspires. But, you know, perhaps, that
                  it will not let me go. So I am as thankful as may be, and make the
                  most of my surroundings."
               "It would be almost a pity," Earnest rejoined, "to decrease, in any way, their
                  elegance and suggestiveness. Yet I am aware they have not brought you complete
                  happiness. I suppose, however, you owe them a large debt for that very
                  reason."
               "Certainly I do," said Stella, "and I try both to acknowledge it frankly and to
                  appreciate it. We are all very much beholden to our misfortunes, as no one has
                  declared to me more clearly than yourself. In some way we must all be mellowed to
                  a certain indifference to mere circumstances, before we can be permanently
                  comfortable. We must be willing to forego happiness before we can be happy.
                  Everything is liable to be taken from us but hope and trust. They are worth all
                  the rest, and I am thankful to whatever has been a discipline forcing me to think,
                  to feel, to know.
               "Your life has been very different from mine; yet, if I am not mistaken, we have
                  unconsciously striven to reach the same goal,—a summit from which we could view
                  the world intelligently, devoid of fear, of hate, of misgiving. Our tortuous paths
                  to the height—the mere means of gaining it—are indifferent, now that they are in
                  the distance behind us. To you, were they ambition?—want of wealth, want of
                  station, want of fame? Were these the dreams and playthings that first drove you
                  to the highway of truth and exertion? Well, the result, my dear friend, is
                  generous, noble manhood.
               "To me, also, there were dreams and toys. I dreamed of love, and I longed for
                  admiration. But I wanted the best. Thus I too was in search of power, such as it
                  was; thus I too was inspired to labor. Then, when disappointment and pain came to
                  me, the labor itself had become my inspiration and my solace.
               "I have won something; for it is something to see that I can win nothing more
                  except by new labors and cares and duties, and to accept my lot as Providence
                  imposes it upon me. Nor is this quite all. When I met you, I had so attuned the
                  chords of my nature that it was in harmony with yours. May I say it?—I think I
                  could comprehend and appreciate you; I am sure I could respect you. If one would
                  choose friends, such sympathy is not the least of attainments."
               These last words were calm. There was no tremor in Stella's voice; but that
                  eye,—its soft, deep azure was unspeakably full. Earnest looked into it. His spirit
                  and his will beckoned it to draw nearer.
               
               "Your friends should be very happy," he said. "God grant they may never be
                  unworthy of your choice."
               And as he sat there by her side, his soul still said: Come, come, come! Her eyes
                  she could not take from that look, that imploration, that command. They were
                  fixed, they were charmed, and now they saw the supplication alone. Come, come,
                  come!—and tears blinded the blue, and Stella was in a lover's arms,—a lover whom
                  she loved. The arms folded her all about, and warm lips pressed their fervor upon
                  hers.
               "Speak to me!" she cried. "Oh, it was cruel,—that behest which I could not
                  disobey,—while yet I feared, and grew weak, and—Earnest, speak to me!"
               "Yes, my own, my darling, my beautiful queen!—speak to you and say that your heart
                  rests at last, where mine has throbbed to place it since almost the first moment I
                  saw you; where still I dared not place it, where still I did not mean to press it,
                  as now I do! For I meant to bow lowly,—to tell you I was a suppliant who asked
                  merely to hope,—to think sometimes of love for some very distant day, if life
                  should be spared, and happiness and duty could be yours, while you were mine.
               "But our hearts have spared me several very gallant and very self-sacrificing
                  speeches," he added, with a smile, "while you, the dearest of women, are here,
                  here, bound to my soul!
               "What have I done! Well, I would not undo it. We were created to love each other;
                  were we not, my own? Our fates were joined when we met, and it were better to die
                  for them, if they ask it, than to live and forego this moment!"
               Thus these two restrained, thoughtful young people had resigned themselves to
                  their feelings, and, like the children that we all are at many an hour, they were
                  absorbed and glad in the present. But they were "children of a larger growth."
                  They knew their own hearts; they knew the hearts of others; and, as all emotions
                  blended in the meeting of their lips, they only realized a rapture for which they
                  had long seemed to be waiting. They did not tremble at love, nor shrink from
                  loving. They were young, but they had learned much; and of the heart's wisdom they
                  were not afraid.
               The hour, the morning passed away. Still they were there together.
               "How happy I am, and how secure!" said Stella, as she awoke at last to a thought
                  of the future. "How much delight I find in these caresses, which we cannot hope
                  shall last! You are to leave me in a few days. I cannot bid you stay; and perhaps
                  you will never fold these arms about me again. But I know that you love me. I knew
                  it before, my idol; but now you have told me so, with kisses and embraces. How
                  could I ever see you turning fondly to another, feeling, as I do, that, for both
                  our sakes, you should be mine, I should be yours! Now we may wait, we may mourn,
                  we may suffer. You may be killed, and then I shall not stay long here alone. But
                  what of that? Now we can die for love as well as for duty. We will think, we will
                  pray, we will do no wrong, my guide, my
                  guardian, my only-loved. But our hearts are bound together.
               "We will ask no promises; we need none. Neither of us can be faithless in a
                  thought. God has given me what I have asked. Now, if he should take it away, I
                  will bow, and bless him, and die.
               "Surely I do not think that would be so hard a fate as many another. Better so
                  than to live unloved. Better so than to live unloving. Far better so than to live
                  for love to chill, for enthusiasm to burn out, for life to grow selfish and timid
                  and empty. I am right, dear Earnest; am I not? Whatever may come, we will not
                  regret this hour. I do not feel unworthy of it; for I would give all that you
                  would have me give, for it and for you.
               "My fortune seems a burden, weighing me, as it does, down, down, away from you.
                  How quickly would I push it from me, if I could, to hear you speak one word,—call
                  me that nearest, fondest name I long to hear as I look at you:—to be yours wholly,
                  to us and to the world.
               "But no, you need not speak. I know what you would say. We remain lovers. It is
                  best for us, best for my poor old parents, best for my duty. Were it not so, I
                  would not live apart from you one moment longer than you bade me. And, Earnest,
                  you would not hold me from you long. Surely you would not.
               "Let me dream. We could live, if my wealth should go. Hopefully we could live on
                  little, and thankfully on more. Much, we should not need; for ourselves, not our
                  circumstances, would be our care. Common vanities we have conquered; display would
                  be beneath us; and the opinions of the world regarding our estate,—we have seen
                  their shallowness too fully to heed them. Something for a little home; something
                  for a friend who might come to it; something for books and music; then something
                  for the poorer man or woman or child we should see: would this be so very hard to
                  procure? If one could not do it readily, two, I think, could; finding their tastes
                  cultivated and their improvement secured in the process.
               "Earnest, I have often mourned over the incomplete life I lead. Nothing seems to
                  me so grand as to elevate one's powers, whatever they may be, and to impart the
                  result to others, for their happiness and benefit. How much time and labor, for
                  instance, I have given to my music. Now perhaps you will smile, even against your
                  better judgment, which will sustain me; but I have often thought I should delight
                  to instruct others in the knowledge and pleasure I have gained from that delicious
                  source. And mind you, if anything very, very romantic, or sad, or strange, should
                  occur to tempt me, I would turn public or private performer on my piano, and show
                  that I had not possessed the advantages of wealth so long, without cultivating
                  some taste or talent that could enable me to dispense with it."
               "Hush, my darling, I pray you!" said Earnest, the tears falling from his eyes.
                  "Your dream is noble, and for you it is not at all impracticable. I will
                  acknowledge no sentimentalism that would terrify me at the thought of congenial
                  and worthy employment, for myself or for any other human being. But just now, the
                  vision saddens me. I cannot bear to think of myself as committing you to the
                  smallest inconvenience or discomfort. I
                  should never have come here if I had not intended to fly directly away from you. I
                  knew you loved me. You were to me the dearest object on earth. How could I avoid
                  merely saying as much? It seemed as if I could even die better and more bravely
                  afterward. And in that event you would not mourn me more than as though I had
                  never allowed myself this precious interview.
               "I could not look to the end. Yet I hoped that, in the rapid changes of present
                  affairs, your fortune would soon cease to be in the way of the world's progress,
                  and that you could do with it as your long consideration and deliberate judgment
                  might choose. Perhaps I have too much confidence in myself. But I also have
                  labored hard and a good while to unfold certain powers and attainments. Certainly,
                  if I were unable to render you and yours comfortable, I could quickly decide on
                  some things I would not do.
               "But we will see. For three years I am vowed to the service of my country. What
                  will happen meanwhile, we cannot tell. But I deprive you of nothing by loving you,
                  and I increase my own happiness by adding to it one beautiful hope.
               "There,—a kiss, my darling Stella, and let me go from you. We have been with each
                  other a long time. This evening shall I come again?"
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               THAT evening, and every evening for the next ten days, those two fond hearts were
                  together.
               This was not all. Stella had suddenly taken a liking to her carriage. She must
                  ride to Bunker Hill, to Cambridge, to Mount Auburn, to Dorchester, to
                  Concord,—wherever there was aught that Earnest spoke of with pleasure or
                  enthusiasm,—wherever there was aught that Stella thought he would esteem or
                  admire. Anything that they might be together; everything that as few moments as
                  possible might be spent apart,—this seemed her constant, almost her only
                  thought.
               "My dear Earnest," she said, "we can be with each other only a little while; then
                  long, long months must drag heavily between us; or who knows what besides? I have
                  always lived in the future,—always given the pleasure of to-day for the good of
                  to-morrow. But now, during these days you are with me, I will exist for nothing
                  else than for you and for them. They will pass away. Desolation may follow them.
                  But I shall have known God's sweetest gift.
               "Yet, Earnest, you will try to come back to me again,—will you not? You will never
                  be reckless,— never run into needless
                  harm! I ask so much; I dare not ask more. For then you would no longer love me,
                  and I should blush at seeing the image of my poor, weak self. I will never ask you
                  to be unworthy. God help you to do all you ought. I bid you go where you should;
                  so, if it be down under the red sod, my soul will not be unworthy to follow yours,
                  but 'will wake, and remember, and understand.' But walk carefully, Earnest,—my
                  Earnest now;—walk carefully, where prudence shall not be a crime. Think of me
                  always when you can; yet I too must needs say, think of duty first."
               He kissed her fair, clear brow; he kissed her warm, melting lips; he pressed her
                  to his heart.
               "I will do all you wish, Stella. Let us not paint the future. I too, say, let us
                  live these few days in all their sunshine. How bright and hallowed they are!"
               They would not stay always,—those ten bright, sunny days. They were a delicious
                  revel for two full souls,—a banquet of love such as not every life affords, such
                  as no life often spreads. The chill whisper that breathed of separation, stole
                  among their joys to tip them with the keener zest. But at last the whisper was,
                  "Now: the time has come."
               They tore themselves away from each other, mournfully, tearfully, speechlessly.
                  Yet the warm hands, which wrung out the farewell that their lips refused to utter,
                  were joined in hope; and there was the prayer to God, such as is alone written in
                  the blood of hearts that love, when they are cleft asunder, per haps for months or
                  years,—perhaps for so long a season that earth cannot again join them.
               Now they had parted. Almost it seemed to them as if there was no one left alive in
                  the world. The dream had ended,—the dream in which all but their love was a blank.
                  It had ended, it was broken. But they could wake to nought else.
               Well, there would be time enough to wake, and duties enough to be done. Let them
                  think yet a little of the heaven that was the dearest they had found.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXV.
               "STELLA, my dear, it seems to me you look very pale and very sad this morning. May
                  your poor old father, who hasn't always done the best for you, but has yet always
                  thought he loved you, ask why?"
               So said Rufus Maign to his daughter, the morning after she and Earnest had
                  parted.
               The old gentleman had offered no comments on anything that Stella had done, or
                  wished to do, since he came into her household. Not because he selfishly feared to
                  offend her, but simply because he had come to think, at last, that she was not to
                  be questioned and judged like others. Her seclusion from choice; her tenderness to
                  the humblest of those around her; her constant application to her music, or to
                  studies deeper than he cared to understand or investigate; her wonderful
                  brilliancy at times, in the presence of such friends as she enjoyed to meet; and,
                  withal, her solicitous care that he who had forced her to the one great sacrifice
                  of her life, should have whatever could make him comfortable and happy;—all these
                  things had latterly impressed Mr. Maign with his daughter as with no one else.
               "Ah! mistaken man that I was!" he had more than once soliloquized; "she was born
                  under a loftier star than ever shone over my old counting-room. I didn't
                  comprehend her. How I wish I could make her amends! Perhaps I can yet."
               And ambition rose again beneath those gray hairs; and he toiled and schemed,
                  settling old debts, and freeing himself from their weighty trammels. Happily they
                  were not many now; and using a few thousands of dollars as he knew how to use
                  money, they were soon cleared up. Once more he stood erect, owing no man a cent,
                  as he declared. But still the gray head was busy,—crammed with money-articles and
                  market-reports. The old merchant was again on the scent, and in a few years who
                  could tell what might happen to him? So he thought; so he said—to himself
                  alone.
               Now, for the first time since he came to her home, her father asked a question
                  which Stella could answer by any commonplace, if she chose, but which she knew
                  expressed a desire to probe her heart. Yet the tone was so kind, and the manner so
                  considerate! The man's old haughtiness and abruptness had all gone.
               "Stella, my dear, it seems to me, you look very pale and very sad this morning.
                  May your poor old father, who hasn't always done the best for you, but, who has
                  yet always thought he loved you, ask why?"
               Gently these words came to the sadness of which they spoke.
               Earnest had met Mr. Maign every day,—the young man coming in and going out when he
                  pleased, riding with Stella, sitting hours with her in the "sacred rooms," till
                  the servants stared with wonder at such
                  unusual proceedings. But not a word had been said on the subject, and Mr. Maign
                  always smiled on both his daughter and her friend.
               Yet who was he? It was indeed strange. A young man she had met while visiting Cora
                  Clandon; a good-looking, well-bred, intelligent fellow. Well, Mr. Maign would
                  wait. Stella knew her own affairs; he, or any one else, could well trust her. But
                  now he asked the cause of that pale cheek, the melancholy brow, and the eyes which
                  seemed to have been very tearful.
               "Father, I will tell you. Why should I not? Mr. Acton, the young man who has been
                  here during these last few days, I love; and I love him, knowing that perhaps I
                  shall never see him again."
               "And why not, my daughter?"
               "He is going into the army:—a man who really has no more business there than I
                  have: as gentle as a woman,—shrinking from the least harshness,—his mind having
                  dwelt for years with the sages, the poets, the saints. He thinks it his duty to
                  go, and for that he leaves a quiet seclusion of thought and study, which to him is
                  a sort of earthly paradise, for the life of a soldier. And I know him. I know his
                  will. That hand, which has so tenderly held mine, will be terrible to others,
                  terrible to himself, if necessary, when it grasps a sword. He will laugh at
                  danger, and spurn security. Duty—solemn, stern, unbending duty—will be all he
                  thinks of. He is not like most of us. He means and welcomes death in the cause, if
                  death needs to come. Such a man I have loved, and have seen him leave me. Yes, I
                  am very sad."
               And tears gushed from Stella's lids, and her head fell upon her hand.
               Presently she looked up and continued.
               "I have told you all. It was your due. It seemed strange to you, no doubt, that a
                  main you had never before seen should be with me almost constantly. But we
                  loved,—had done so in spite of ourselves. We were not to remain with each other. I
                  knew there would be time enough to think, to consider everything, after he had
                  gone:—perhaps a whole lifetime. So we filled the hour as it came."
               "Who is he, Stella? Is he rich, or poor? No, no, my good girl; don't curl your lip
                  so. I'm not going to deserve it. I know you think I've considered that question
                  once too often, at least, already. So I have, dear; but this time, you mustn't
                  blame me. You shall have no reason to do so. Let me come to the point, then, as
                  soon as I can. Thanks to you, I've paid all my miserable debts that have been
                  hanging over me, and I've made a little besides. In my judgment, there was never,
                  since I was born, such a time to make money as now. In two years I mean to make
                  twenty thousand dollars. I think I can do it. I couldn't understand such a girl as
                  you. I did you wrong. But the old post-horse is good for something yet, in his own
                  way. In two years, I say, I mean to have twenty thousand dollars. I've almost
                  broken your heart; but I'll try hard to mend it. I want the money for you. If the
                  young man should live to come back, you shall have it, or he shall have it, or we
                  will do what you like with it. I couldn't buy you such a house as this, or the one
                  we used to have. But I know you now:
                  you wouldn't care for it. I'd do my best, and maybe make you happy. Then you could
                  leave these traps of Jabed's behind you, or let them go to the secessionists and
                  the dominies, if they must. The will was a bad affair, a bad affair,—the meanest
                  of all,—curse the thing! But we'll get the better of it somehow. Yes we will,
                  Stella, my dear child, and you shall be content."
               Stella was speechless with surprise. Such words from such a father!—a man who had
                  always been grasping, and worldly, and vain,—whose first thought and foremost
                  endeavor had been possession, accumulation. What had effected so vast a change?
                  Was it the loss of his money? Was it her imprisonment in her own wealth?
               She had noticed that, since he first came to Boston, he had been ceaselessly
                  active,—busy in the morning, thoughtful and engrossed in the evening. He gave
                  himself scarcely any relaxation, unless when it was her hour for sitting with him
                  and conversing, and sometimes smoothing his white hair. Then the restless, knitted
                  brow became unoccupied and sunny.
               Had he observed her loneliness of heart, which had nearly become an accepted part
                  of her life?—that loneliness which her retirement, her music, her studies, had so
                  often been evoked to solace and to cheer? She could not tell. She had striven to
                  appear happy, that he might not be reminded of his having impelled her to be
                  sorrowful. She had often really felt happy in seeing him once more occupied and
                  unbroken.
               But he had made no allusion to former days, to her husband, or to any alteration
                  of his own views and pur- poses, until now. Now she comprehended, in an instant,
                  the meaning of that renewed energy, that intent, anxious, tireless look.
               She was too deeply moved to speak; but she went to her father, and putting her
                  arms about his neck, kissed his forehead and his lips, then hurried out of the
                  dining-hall to her own room.
               The name of father had now a significance which it had not hitherto
                  borne,—which she had longed, only, that it could bear.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               WITHIN a week after leaving Stella, Lieutenant Earnest Acton was in the Volunteer
                  Service of the United States.
               When he first thought of entering that service, he had determined to do so as a
                  soldier in the ranks. He felt himself without capacity to lead men to battle. But
                  many others, possessing quite as meagre an acquaintance with the "tactics" as he,
                  were stepping forward, ready to take high places. Young merchants, and clerks, and
                  lawyers, competent enough, doubtless, in their several employments, appeared to
                  gauge their modesty and their yet undeveloped military skill, precisely by the
                  best possible positions they could secure. It is certainly well for soldiers, as
                  for other men, to have confidence in themselves, if they would succeed. But
                  Earnest supposed that being a commander implied fulfilling the duties of such a
                  person; and although he strongly inclined to trust genius and native good sense
                  more than mere drill and routine, he fancied that he ought to know something of
                  these things, before aspiring to a trust which might easily involve a considerable
                  number of precious lives.
               "But bother your fancies," said Captain Norcum, the friend in whose company
                  Earnest had purposed enlisting; "you shall go as one of my officers, if you go
                  with me. Your conscientious hesitation is all very fine. But you have a head and a
                  heart; and those are things, I can tell you, that will be very much in demand.
                  Come; I am considered quite proficient, as holiday captains average; but you shall
                  be my twin in tactics before the month is over.
               "Besides," added the jolly captain, laughing, "you can resign, you know, and step
                  into the ranks, any time you please. You shall be my first lieutenant. Alf Bowles
                  will be second."
               But Earnest declined.
               "Well, then, Bowles shall be your superior. You take the place I had intended for
                  him."
               "I will try it," said Earnest, and the matter was settled.
               As every newspaper teems with accounts of battles, and with the details of camp
                  and field life, it would be almost uninteresting to follow Earnest through the
                  particulars of his military experience.
               From Ironton, his regiment was sent to Fortress Monroe, where it remained while
                  the battle of Bull Run was fought and lost.
               Earnest's first taste of warfare was at Bethel,—an unfortunate and inglorious
                  taste, he thought; and especially bitter, as the following day he learned the fate
                  of Major Winthrop, the eager and devoted, whom at first sight he had admired as a
                  great-hearted, cultured gentleman, and had loved as native to a more generous and
                  genial world than our poor eyes are accustomed to behold.
               
               The Major fell on Monday. The Saturday preceding, Earnest with fourteen of his
                  men, was out on a scouting expedition between Hampton and Bethel, when suddenly a
                  party of rebels, numbering twenty or more, and mounted, appeared on the road,
                  swung round a brass howitzer, and let fly at the fifteen. Earnest ordered his men
                  to the side of the road, where they were partly sheltered by woods; and by some
                  loud shouting to imaginary reinforcements, and by a cool use of the muskets, he
                  beat a safe retreat for his own party, having had the grim satisfaction of seeing
                  two of the enemy fall from their horses, wounded or dead.
               He supposed that, all things considered, he had done pretty well, and was not
                  dissatisfied with the exploit. But presently he met Major Winthrop, who rode up
                  and questioned him minutely about the skirmis.
               He answered, stating the number of rebels and the number of his own men.
               That dashing hero's eye glistened.
               "Twenty rebs!" he exclaimed, "and you were fifteen! Why didn't you take their
                  gun?"
               This view of the case had not entered Earnest's mind; and the attempt would
                  certainly have appeared somewhat rash. But he felt, instantly, that if Major
                  Winthrop had been in command of the fourteen, the effort would have been made to
                  capture the howitzer.
               Perhaps it would have succeeded. Perhaps the hero would have fallen two days
                  sooner than he did,—"the only brave man," as the rebels declared, that they saw
                  among the Union soldiers, on the memorable day of his death.
               But what was his own life to that great, magnani- mous heart, that keen,
                  thoughtful spirit? One of the few was he, who knew the magnitude of the struggle
                  to which he had given himself,—knew the North, knew the South. Freedom for mankind
                  he asked; not long life for Theodore Winthrop, who was ready and willing to die
                  that his country might live. To be early in heaven was for such as he!
               On the 31st of May, 1862, Earnest was in the van of the Army of the Potomac. He
                  was now Captain Acton. He had been in the service a few days more than a year,
                  having passed through four battles and nine skirmishes without a scratch. Eleven
                  days he had been in the hospital, and every other day on duty. He had not been
                  home, nor had he asked to go. Sternly punctual; and ever ready at his post, he had
                  waited upon duty or death, as that which he had come to do, that to be done. No
                  wonder he was loved by his men; no wonder he was trusted by all.
               In another week he was to be a lieutenant-colonel. Captain, now Colonel, Norcum
                  was in command of the regiment. By rank, the post of lieutenant-colonel belonged
                  to Alfred Bowles. But his turn had come to be magnanimous. He was a good-hearted,
                  faithful officer, yet slow, and wanting in address; while the quick, cultivated
                  mind of Earnest had enabled him to become "every inch a soldier;" and his natural
                  free and easy kindness, all of which he could express, had made him the pet of the
                  rank and file. Besides, he had twice ventured his life to save that of another,
                  and each time it was a private not belonging to his own company. In one of these
                  instances, he carried off a wounded man
                  in his arms, and with his pistol disabled two of the enemy who were trying to
                  oppose him.
               The example of personal valor, and his invariable touch of the cap to the
                  humblest, were in themselves sufficient to make him the private's favorite. But
                  beyond this, he had the name of strict temperance and unmistakable integrity.
                  When, therefore, Major Bowles received friendly intimation that the lieutenant
                  colonelcy would shortly devolve on him, by the resignation of the incumbent, he
                  frankly said, in his homely but noble way, that he knew of a better man; and if
                  the boys all round would'nt object, he would hold his own, and see Captain Acton
                  go over him.
               The offer was hailed with applause, and a torrent of compliments soon rolled upon
                  the honest Bowles from officers and men.
               "It is very generous in you," said Colonel Norcum, "yet I think you'll never
                  regret it. Between you and me, Acton is to-day better able to lead the entire
                  army, than some others that you and I know of. He means fight, at
                  least."
               But the plans of Major Bowles were destined to be sadly frustrated in every way.
                  In his self-sacrificing estimate, he had not taken into account that in a few days
                  was to be fought, and lost, and won, the battle of Fair Oaks. On the 31st of May,
                  and on the 1st of June, 1862, such was the work to be done.
               The record of the battle is known. Heavily, and in force, the Confederates bore
                  down from Richmond on General Casey's division, shattering, and forcing it back
                  upon the larger body. Then came the fearful, the desperate struggle for recovery.
                  Colonel Norcum's regiment was to have its mettle thoroughly tested. Gallantly it
                  went into the fray, its gallant colonel at the head. Another instant, and he was
                  thrown speechless to the ground, his horse killed by a shell. The
                  lieutenant-colonel was sick, and absent from the field. Major Bowles did his
                  utmost, rushing to Colonel Norcum's post, and holding the regiment firmly up to
                  its task. But those terrible rebel sharp-shooters coveted the life of so brave and
                  upright a man. He, too, fell from his horse, shot through the body. As he was
                  raised for an instant, he spoke the name of Captain Acton, glanced at the line,
                  and fell back dead.
               The regiment began to waver. There was not an instant to be lost. Earnest leaped
                  upon his friend's horse, which had not been harmed, and thundered along the
                  front.
               "Boys!" he shouted, "will you see me die alone? Come! Once more!" And away he
                  dashed, straight for the rebel columns.
               With a mournful, dissonant yell, the "boys" followed him. They fought like a
                  regiment of tigers over their young. Yet they lost ground, foot by foot, inch by
                  inch. Only once they gained a few rods. Earnest had shared, in part, the fate of
                  his colonel and major, having been violently dismounted, and shot in two places,
                  through the neck and the arm. Then the regiment, especially the members of his own
                  company, seemed to stake everything on him. Without command, but with united
                  impulse, the latter forced their way to his body, supported by frantic squads
                  along the line. Fifteen Federal soldiers, seventeen Confederates, lay dead and
                  dying, immediately around him, on that
                  disputed piece of ground. But he was borne from it, at last, by those who would
                  know nothing else, for the time, than to achieve their purpose, or to die.
               He had done all that man could there do; and they had done for him all that mortal
                  might can be inspired to do for one who loves and honors men.
               On the 2d of June, removed from the late scene of conflict, Earnest was receiving
                  what care and attention could be bestowed on him by the as yet dishonest and
                  ill-regulated medical and commissary departments at F——. His wounds had been
                  probed and dressed, and it was thought he would recover. Two telegrams had been
                  sent homeward, one to his father, at Ironton, one to Stella, at Boston, stating
                  that he was badly wounded, but doing well.
               From the moment the news of the battle of Fair Oaks reached Stella, she had been
                  exceedingly distressed, as if with a presentiment of terror and misfortune. Her
                  determination was fixed. If word should come from Earnest that he was in danger,
                  she would go to him herself, and provide for his wants. The word came. It was
                  brought to her at the same time with a letter, the superscription of which she
                  recognized as the handwriting of Cora Clandon. She read the dispatch, and threw
                  the letter aside. She then wrote a short note to Earnest's father, informing him
                  that within an hour she should be on the way to Washington, accompanied by her
                  butler,—an old and trusty servant,—and should proceed immediately to F——,to take
                  care of Captain Acton, and to supply him with every comfort and attention.
               She called the man whom she intended to take with her, and, to the utter amazement
                  of that worthy individual, which his rather dark mulatto face did not fail to
                  show, asked him to have a carriage at the door in forty minutes, and be prepared
                  to accompany her to the Army of the Potomac.
               "Don't wait for explanations," she said. "You have lived with me five years, and
                  know me. Please get ready at once."
               "Yes, ma'am." And the old butler left her.
               Stella went to her room, and in a quarter of an hour was draped in plain gray
                  travelling apparel.
               Late the next night she was at F——, and was inquiring for Earnest.
               "Shall I tell him who waits to see him?" asked the person to whom she was
                  addressing her questions.
               "Yes, a sister,—the dearest he has on earth."
               She was in no mood for formalities.
               How surprising, and how welcome was her tired, anxious, sleepless face, to the
                  wounded young lover, pale and haggard, lying there on his pallet!
               "Ah! Stella, I can want nothing now!" he murmured, as he saw her; "but what a
                  place for you!"
               "Never mind that," she replied. "But you must be quiet. I shall stay with
                  you."
               Fortunate was the young soldier to receive such care as that which, during the
                  next two weeks, was supplied by Stella. Carefully was every direction followed by
                  a nurse who had so much to gain or lose. Tenderly were his parched lips moistened;
                  tenderly his hot brow bathed. Gentle was the restraint which soothed him to sleep, when his mind wandered away
                  into the conflict again, and he shouted and begged to be followed to the death.
                  Bravely she bore it, when one of the surgeons told her that, in his next lucid
                  interval, if she had anything she was especially desirous of saying to him, it
                  would be well to communicate it; for he feared that Captain Acton would live but a
                  few hours longer. Tearfully at last, and only then, she sank away, completely
                  overcome, when Earnest was pronounced not dead, but strangely better, and out of
                  all danger. Then she slept a long, deep, heavy sleep, from which it appeared
                  almost as difficult to waken her as it had been to recall her enfeebled lover from
                  his decline toward the land of shadows.
               But the burden had been lifted from her, her prayers had been answered, and her
                  heart was filled with thankfulness and joy.
               Five days still she lingered at F——,an angel of mercy in the abode of desolation.
                  Not Earnest alone, but many another helpless sufferer, blessed her, and prayed
                  that God would spare "the sweet lady's brother" to her who had a kind word and a
                  helpful hand for every one she came near.
               In fact, there were some special reasons for their benedictions. Soon after her
                  arrival, she had ascertained that some of the pale skeleton-figures she saw—young
                  men, many of whom had left good homes, to fight and die for their country—were
                  here actually pinched with hunger,—put off with pitiful, undue allowances of food,
                  that the blood-suckers of the commissariat might fatten their pockets upon these
                  ghastly cheeks. What could she do? Nothing but send John, her dark butler, to the
                  nearest place where provisions could be procured, hand him her purse, and order
                  him to buy whatever was needed, without stint. In her flame of indignation and
                  grief, she thought not of the consequence to herself,—thought not of the annual
                  allowance for charity to which she was limited,—but only remembered that she had a
                  plenty of money with her, and that servants of their country and their God were
                  literally starving to death under her eye.
               John employed the purse freely, and gave it back to her lighter by nearly six
                  hundred dollars. He was honest to buy, and faithful to distribute; and was
                  unaccustomed to question whatever he was told to do.
               "Madam, my mistress, wished me to bring you this; and would you like some of
                  this?"
               Then tears would well up to the eyes of those rough men, their languid faces would
                  brighten, and their voices grow very soft.
               Later, the report was circulated that the mysterious lady who had come to attend
                  Captain Acton, whether his sister or not, was very rich,—worth millions; that she
                  was personally acquainted with the Secretary of War; that she would represent
                  affairs to him as she had seen them here; and that somebody would be sure to
                  suffer in consequence.
               She allowed the report to pass for what it was worth, and instructed John not to
                  lessen its value.
               When, a few days afterward, a certain burly-faced quartermaster desired to be
                  presented to her, she replied, loftily, that she should be very sorry to form
                     the acquaintance of so unscrupulous
                  a man, and should not only be reluctant to take his hand, but, if matters were not
                  mended, she should do what little she could to prevent that hand from repeating
                  its recent niggardly acts.
               Her words, her look, her bearing, were not to be mistaken. She was evidently a
                  lady, and had money. The plethoric rascal of the commissariat was satisfied on
                  this point, and Stella had the happiness to see an immediate change in the
                  rations.
               But for the accidental rumor of her wonderful influence with governmental
                  functionaries, which some imaginative youth had probably dreamed, she would never
                  have thought of attempting to displace a quarter-master of volunteers. On her
                  return to Washington, however, she did make the attempt, in person, stating who
                  she was and what she had witnessed. Her words carried with them the weight of
                  indignant truth, which it almost choked her to utter; and the tears which she
                  could not suppress were perhaps eloquent. At any rate, Earnest, who was yet unable
                  to start for home when she departed from F——,wrote to her that, three days after
                  she left him, the man of whom she had complained had been ignominiously dismissed
                  from the service, and that the poor fellows she had fed from her bounty were then
                  fully impressed with the belief that his"sister" was a "near relation of Mrs.
                  Lincoln."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               STELLA had been at home several days, when suddenly the recollection of Cora's
                  unopened letter occurred to her. She had been pondering, with some mortification,
                  her hasty benevolence to the soldiers at F——,which, if it should come to light, or
                  should be honestly revealed by herself, as she believed it ought to be, might
                  deprive her of her fortune.
               The issue could easily be avoided. She could call the money she had spent, her
                  father's; she could say that John had exceeded, in his purchases, the amount she
                  had designed he should expend; she could replace the money in a hundred different
                  ways. But had she, or had she not, really, though unthinkingly, broken one of the
                  provisions of her husband's will? She acknowledged that she had.
               What, then, was her pleasure and surprise, as she read Cora's long, chatty
                  epistle.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "DEAR, DEAR STELLA:—
                           
                           "I've lots to tell you,—lots to begin with, about yourself, and
                              another sweet, charming dear, and Captain Bub. She—the lady sweet and
                                 charming—is a
                              Southerner, or pretty nearly one, and Captain Bub likes her. She is a
                              relation of yours that you have never seen and don't know; and the
                              whole matter is romantic and curious enough for a novel.
                           "You remember, Captain Bub went to New Orleans with General Butler.
                              Well, only a few days after he arrived there, a young lady accosted
                              him in the street, and asked if he would be kind enough to conduct her
                              to the commanding general. She was very genteel and modest, and didn't
                              offer to spit on him, or pretend to be sick at the stomach when he
                              touched his cap. (Captain Bub is always very gentlemanly,
                              if he is my brother.) He told her he should be very happy
                              to conduct her to General Butler, but that the general was engaged,
                              and would probably not be able to see her before the next day. At this
                              she appeared utterly dejected; and she kept looking behind her, as if
                              she was afraid of something. He stood in front of her, with his cap
                              lifted from his head (I can see just how graceful and handsome he
                              looked), and, when the pitiful tears fell from her eyes, he asked her
                              if it would be possible for one of General Butler's subordinate
                              officers and one of his particular friends to be of any immediate
                              service to her; at the same time handing her his card, with the name
                              of Captain Lawrence Ide Clandon on it.
                           "I don't know,' she answered; 'but I think you can if you will.' Then,
                              looking straight into his face, but blushing as she did so, she asked:
                              'Do I look like an honest person?'and, turning away, she wept like a
                              flood.
                           "'By Jove! you do!' exclaimed Captain Bub.
                           'It would be unsafe for a man to tell me you do not.'
                           "'Then can you see that I am protected—protected even from arrest as a
                              thief, it may be—until General Butler can see and hear me?'
                           "Captain Bub looked at her with perfect astonishment. She bore every
                              mark of being an amiable and cultivated lady. Her conversation and
                              manners both indicated it. Moreover, she was very pretty,—not quite so
                              tall as you, and rather stouter,—with dark hair, brown eyes, prominent
                              but regular features, and an unusually intelligent and sweet
                              expression. Captain Bub was struck with her. He pitied her, and
                              instinctively perceived that there couldn't be any cause to charge her
                              with crime.
                           "'I think,' he said, 'that a word to General Butler will procure me
                              permission to keep you from all harm. But the general will want to
                              know your whole case in twenty seconds. May I ask you some questions,
                              so as to speak intelligently to him? He never admits anything on one's
                              predilection or supposition, but dives right for the facts.'
                           "Meanwhile, since Captain Bub had noticed her frightened glances
                              backward, they had naturally walked towards General Butler's
                              quarters.
                           "Clara—that is the young lady's name—Clara Summers—appeared perplexed
                              and abashed at the further information thus demanded of her by a young
                              stranger-officer; and she hesitated for a moment. Then, looking up
                              into his face, she inquired, 'Have you a wife, or a dear sister?'
                           "Captain Bub smiled, and said, 'I am not so fortunate as to have a wife yet; but I
                              have a very dear sister, not far from your own age, as I should
                              guess.' (Of course he meant me, Stella. I'm glad that he and I think
                              so much of each other.)
                           "'I'll tell you my story,' Clara said to him. 'But it is shocking, and
                              would be painful to relate even to your sister, if she were my near
                              friend. Think of what she would have to do if in my place; and forgive
                              me for telling you some such dreadful things as I must refer to if you
                              are to hear the truth.'
                           "Then she gave him an outline of her whole history.
                           "She was born in Virginia; but her parents came from Boston. Her
                              father's name was James Summers. Her mother's maiden name was Julia
                              Torson.
                           "You will see instantly that Clara is your husband's niece,—the person
                              who, if found, was to have his property, in case you shouldn't abide
                              by the will. Isn't it funny that she should turn up in this way, and
                              now be actually in the house of your best friend?—for she is here with
                              me.
                           "But I must go back to the story.
                           "When Clara's mother was a young lady, she was a great favorite, it
                              seems, with some old stick or other in Boston, who was very rich, and
                              whom her father desired she should marry. But she couldn't be
                              persuaded to do it. She had formed certain preferences of her own,
                              which were in the way of any such arrangement. The affair ended by her
                              marrying Mr. Summers,—a young man whom she loved,—and being forbidden
                              ever afterwards to enter her father's house.
                           "Her brother, who was several years older than she, and who had
                              already acquired some property, sided with her father, called her a
                              fool, and said she had disgraced them both.
                           "It wasn't so very easy to see why; for Mr. Summers was a young lawyer
                              of considerable promise, who soon moved with his wife to Virginia,
                              becoming successful, and even quite distinguished in his
                              profession.
                           "But he had one proud fault. Having been snubbed by his wife's father
                              and brother, he was determined to maintain her in style and affluence.
                              He did so; but spent his income, instead of saving it. He was young,
                              and his practice was constantly increasing. He thought there would be
                              time enough to accumulate money when he desired.
                           "It was so for eleven years; when suddenly he died.
                           "His wife had been more prudent than he. She had persuaded him to buy
                              a house, at one time when he was able to make the investment; and when
                              his affairs were settled up, she found herself in possession of this
                              and some other property, which, being sold, yielded her a few thousand
                              dollars.
                           "She then came North, Clara being about ten years old.
                           "On the way from Philadelphia to New York, Mrs. Summers was sick, and
                              was confined to her state-room on the boat. Clara was permitted to run
                              about in the cabin, promising she would go but a certain distance from
                              the door of the state-room. A number of the passengers took a good
                              deal of notice of her, and
                              as she was not timid, she was quite willing to receive their
                              attentions and their sweetmeats. One gentleman seemed to take a
                              special fancy to her; but finally, asking her name, and being told it
                              was Clara Payson Summers, he let go her hand abruptly, and said not
                              another word to her while she was on the boat. She thought it a
                              strange incident at the time, but soon forgot it. A day or two
                              afterwards, she happened to recall it, and spoke of it to her mother.
                              Mrs. Summers inquired minutely about the gentleman's appearance.
                           "'He was pretty big,' Clara said, 'and had a scar on his forehead, the
                              shape of a y upside down (T), and a large ring on his
                              little finger, with a white stone in it; and on the stone was a lady's
                              head, which looked, mamma, a great deal like yours, when you have your
                              hair put up in puffs. He told me it was a picture of his mother.'
                           "'So it was, Clara,' replied Mrs. Summers; 'and it was a picture of
                                 my mother too. That man, my daughter, was your uncle.
                              But he hates me, and he will never love you.'
                           "Clara says she has never forgotten the sad, weary look with which her
                              poor mother said this.
                           "You knew the man also, Stella; and you have known him still better,
                              since. Do you suppose he relented a little, in after years, and that
                              the image of Clara would haunt him? For you know you told
                              me about the chance he gave her in his will; though he evidently
                              didn't really believe it would avail her much.
                           "She never saw him again, and I presume he never took any pains to
                              inquire after her.
                           "Mrs. Summers' object in coming North, was to give Clara a thorough
                              education, and to fit her for a teacher, as she might some time have
                              to rely wholly on her own exertions for support. She was placed at
                              school; and, if my judgment is worth anything, she must have realized
                              every expectation. My dear Stella, she is positively the smartest and
                              sweetest girl I ever met, your own peerless self excepted. I don't
                              wonder a bit that Captain Bub took a fancy to her.
                           "But how I ramble all around in the account of her!
                           "Clara and her mother lived at the North eight years, Mrs. Summers
                              being an invalid most of the time.
                           "About the close of the eighth year she died. The money was nearly all
                              spent, but Clara had as good an education as one of our best
                              seminaries could afford her. Six months after her mother's death she
                              was prevailed upon to go to South Carolina as a teacher in a
                              gentleman's family there.
                           "Now comes the bitterest part of what poor, dear Clara had to tell
                              Captain Bub.
                           "Colonel Rawlston, with whom she went to reside, was an elderly man,
                              polite and pleasant, whose household was composed of three daughters
                              and one son, the latter a young lad of ten years. Colonel Rawlston's
                              wife had been dead a few months, and his eldest daughter supplied her
                              mother's place as mistress of the mansion. Her education was presumed
                              to be complete. Clara's duty was to instruct the two younger daughters
                              in French and music, and the lad in whatever he could be persuaded to
                              learn, except riding horses and shooting birds,—two accomplishments to
                              which his mind was principally given. He immediately became
                                 attached, however, to
                              the 'Yankee lady,' as he termed Clara, and an occasional lesson was
                              coaxed out of him. He told Clara that she wasn't at all the woman he
                              had expected to see when he heard she was coming. He thought all the
                              Yankee women had 'peaked noses, long, bony arms, only a little thin
                              hair on their heads, and couldn't see without specs;' but that she was
                              'handsomer than any of his sisters except Sallie, and a heap
                              pleasanter.'
                           "This Sallie, the youngest daughter, was Clara's favorite. She was, as
                              young Ben had said, the prettiest one of the three, as she was also
                              the most amiable. She was quiet and sad, and very unobtrusive. She
                              always dressed with remarkable plainness, and shunned, instead of
                              courting society. Her sisters generally treated her with kindness; but
                              appeared quite willing to encourage her seclusive tastes and
                              habits.
                           "You'll hardly believe why, Stella. Southern men are strange beings.
                              Colonel Rawlston, Clara says, was an educated, agreeable man; but
                              Sallie, though his daughter, was not his wife's child,
                              but the child of a quadroon woman, at one time his mistress and slave,
                              who was herself the daughter of a Southern senator.
                           "She didn't wish to live in the relation imposed upon her by Colonel
                              Rawlston, and her reluctance was well known to his wife, who, like a
                              Christian Northern woman as she was, pitied the bondmaid instead of
                              hating her.
                           "Sallie was born, and her mother dying within a year, Mrs. Rawlston
                              insisted on adopting the little one as her own child, which she
                              finally did. When Sallie was fourteen, she heard the circumstances of
                              her birth related by an old slave, and went directly to Mrs. Rawl-
                              ston, to know if it was possible they were true. The good woman told
                              her they were; but called Sallie her own dear daughter, soothing and
                              comforting her in every way she could.
                           "The dear girl's heart was broken. From that hour she was melancholy
                              and timid, shunning nearly all acquaintances. But to Mrs. Rawlston she
                              was more than a daughter,—she was truly a willing, a devoted slave.
                              During the lady's long sickness (she died of consumption) Sallie was
                              her constant attendant and untiring nurse. She saw her last faint
                              smile, and received her last blessing.
                           "Clara had been but a short time in Colonel Rawlston's family, when
                              Sallie informed her of these things, asking the young teacher if she
                              could love and instruct her as well as if she were really Mrs.
                              Rawlston's daughter. Her sisters, she said, had obeyed their mother's
                              dying injunction to be kind to her; but they were proud, and, as her
                              history was not a complete secret, how could they be fully reconciled
                              to the relation she bore to them? Little Ben, she was sure, loved her
                              fondly, and now, while he was a child, she found much happiness in his
                              attachment. But her chief hope was that Clara would teach her all that
                              she herself knew, so that in two or three years she could go North,
                              live there, and take care of herself.
                           "O Stella! how I wish she could have done so, and could have come here
                              to me! But worse than that was to befall the darling.
                           "When Clara had been with her a year and a half,—the scholar, as Clara
                              asserts, being superior to the teacher,—and when they had vowed
                                 inseparable friendship
                              at the North, where they intended going together, Colonel Rawlston
                              died. His estate was found nearly insolvent, and the charge of the
                              family devolved on Captain Raspar Rawlston, the eldest son, who had
                              lived many years in New Orleans, and who seemed almost a stranger to
                              his sisters and his young brother.
                           "He was a terrible man,—a dealer in cotton and slaves, who was very
                              rich, but reckless and dissipated. (I believe that nasty rum puts out
                              the last spark of a man's decency.)
                           "What do you think he did? He introduced the two sisters into the most
                              aristocratic society of New Orleans, and claimed Sallie as his slave,
                              that he had bought in settling up his father's estate. She was a
                              'nigger,' he said, 'but one that had been a favorite in the
                              family.'
                           "Then he tried to make her his mistress, having, it was reported,
                              three others already. He kept her away from his sisters and little
                              Ben, threatened her, and persecuted her, until at last, in a fit of
                              desperation, she snatched one of his own pistols, and spattered her
                              brains in the wretch's face.
                           "A week or two previously she had insisted on giving Clara an elegant
                              necklace, which she had worn, and with it a locket containing her
                              likeness. Rawlston found it out. Not satisfied with what he had done,
                              he soon attempted to repeat the experiment on Sallie's friend, the
                              free, white Clara; and, as one of his loving bits of persuasion, swore
                              he would have her arrested as a thief, if she made any disturbance. He
                              actually abducted her from his residence, where she had remained with
                              his sisters. But she escaped from him.
                           "'And now, sir,' said she to Captain Bub, as she finished the
                              account,—which I, of course, have spun out so as to give you every
                              particular,—'and now, sir, I have found you,—a gentleman
                              I am sure; and can thank God I am safe.'
                           "Perhaps, my dear Stella, you can imagine how Captain Bub bore the
                              recital. I asked Clara. She said that he was perfectly dumb with
                              astonishment. When she came to Sallie's death, his eyes fairly turned
                              round in their sockets, and flashed with a green glow, like a cat's.
                              He didn't speak a word for several minutes, and then his voice was
                              calm and low. But she says she inwardly prayed that Captain Rawlston
                              wouldn't permit himself to send for her that day, and almost as much
                              for his own sake as for hers.
                           "She wasn't inquired for; but the next morning a file of soldiers
                              proceeded to Captain Rawlston's house, to summon him, with his two
                              sisters and little Ben, to appear at General Butler's head-quarters.
                              It was a summons which didn't admit of hesitation or delay on the part
                              of any one of them. They were there in a short time, and were
                              questioned separately.
                           "Captain Rawlston was disposed to be haughty and imposing. He said it
                              was quite likely he had accused a certain Miss Summers, or one passing
                              under that name,—some Yankee woman of no account,—of stealing. It was
                              also quite likely he might have threatened her for so doing. He was
                              not aware, however, that such a matter had anything to do with the
                              military government of New Orleans.
                           "'You have much to learn, sir,' replied General Butler. 'Do you know the whereabouts of
                              a young person named Sallie Rawlston?'
                           "'A certain girl Sallie, whom I suppose you mean, was my nigger. She
                              was foolish enough to blow her head off some days since. If you want
                              her, you'll have to look for her in h—.'
                           "'Take care of this brute!' ordered General Butler. 'I shall want him
                              again.'
                           "The sisters were each examined. They were lady-like, and both seemed
                              surprised, though pleased, to see Clara. They hesitated, evidently not
                              knowing for what they were there, or what they were expected to say.
                              They testified wonderingly to Clara's attainments, integrity, and
                              gentleness.
                           "Then little Ben was brought in. He appeared slightly intimidated at
                              first, probably having heard terrible stories about the Yankee
                              soldiers. But the sight of Clara reassured him. He ran to her, and,
                              putting his arms around her neck, kissed her, and wanted to know if
                              anybody had dared to keep his dear Clara Summers there against her
                              will.
                           "No, she said, she had come there of her own accord.
                           "'My son,' asked General Butler, 'would your dear Clara Summers steal
                              anything?—say this chain and the locket.'
                           "The child stamped his foot, and burst into tears.
                           "'Are you her friend, or not?' he asked.
                           "'Yes, my little man, I am her friend,' the general answered, with a
                              smile.
                           "'Well, then,' cried Ben, 'if you'll lend me those pistols of yours,
                              I'll fight with any man that says Clara Summers would steal. I'm
                              little, sir, but I can shoot like the devil. My sister Sallie, my
                              dearest pet sister, gave those things to Miss Summers, and I saw her
                              do it. Will you let me take the pistols?'
                           "'Perhaps I will let you take the pistols some time, my little friend;
                              but no one here believes Miss Summers would steal, any more than you
                              do. Your brother thought so; but he has made a mistake.'
                           "'My brother thought so? He's a fool. He's mean, he is. He made Sallie
                              go away from us; and she's dead, sir.'
                           "Such was little Ben's testimony; and, as you may suppose, it was
                              satisfactory.
                           "Ben was sent out, and Captain Rawlston brought back.
                           "He was found guilty of using vile, slanderous, and threatening
                              language to Clara Summers; of an assault upon her, and attempted
                              abduction.
                           "'I have seen and questioned your sisters and little brother,' said
                              General Butler. 'I respect them highly They alone save you from Fort
                              Jackson. You will pay within an hour, into the hands of Captain
                              Clandon here, five thousand dollars, as a partial compensation to Miss
                              Summers for your insults.'
                           "Such was the substance of General Butler's decision.
                           "'I'll do no such thing!' shouted Captain Rawlston: 'I'll be
                              d—first.'
                           "'Just as you please, then,' was the general's grim reply. 'Captain
                              Clandon, you will please fill an order to have this man hanged
                              to-morrow at sunrise. Lieutenant, what comes next?'
                           
                           "Rawlston was thunderstruck. Here was a Union general to be obeyed by
                              the 'chivalry' of New Orleans. Or, if not, the chivalry must swing for
                              it.
                           "'I'll pay the money,' growled the culprit; 'but such usurpation I
                              never heard of.'
                           "'Probably not, sir. Captain Clandon, he proposes to pay the money. It
                              must be in gold. You will accompany him, take a man or two with you,
                              and, when the proper amount is in your keeping, discharge the fellow.
                              Should he attempt to escape, remember that you are reputed to carry
                              the surest pistol, next to mine, in the Department of the Gulf. I
                              doubt he has a soul; but let that at least be the only part of him
                              that shall elude you.'
                           "The money was paid. It was given to Clara, and as soon as convenient
                              she came North. Captain Bub insisted on having her come right here. He
                              acknowledges, in his letters, that he likes her very much, and wants
                              me to see how much I can think of her. I shall have no trouble in
                              being very fond of her. She seems sweeter and more pleasant every day.
                              She's stylish too as a princess, though as plain in her tastes as
                              yourself.
                           "I've told her all about you. Captain Bub informed her that he knew
                              her uncle's widow,—'a young woman,' he said, 'to be sought and
                              respected as much as any lady in the United States.' That was starting
                              Clara with a fair impression,—wasn't it?—and I've put on all the
                              finishing touches. I wish you could meet her right away: only then,
                              with you two together, I should have to sit demurely in a corner and
                              play with my thumbs.
                           "But I must stop writing, or you'll never get through my letter in the
                              world. I'll let the rest I had to say go till the next time; or still
                              better, till you come and see me again.
                           "Can't you do it right away? Yes, do. Make Clara and me a visit. We'll
                              have good times. You and Clara can talk up the past, present, and
                              future, interspersed with great men and women; and when I can't reach
                              your sublime heights, Charley Merlow and I will perhaps try to
                              entertain each other in such poor way as the like can.
                           "Do come, Stella, and I'll tell you when Charley and I are going to be
                              married. We've been lovers an age. 'Twont be possible to wait much
                              longer.
                           
                              "Good-by.
                              "As ever,
                              "YOUR CORA."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXVIII.
               STELLA dropped the letter, and, after sitting immovable and wrapped in meditation
                  for several minutes, she hastened to her piano, and the beautiful song, "We may be
                  happy yet," rang through the house, with every shade of force and expression, from
                  the simple melody played with the utmost thoughtful tenderness, to the storm of
                  frantic hilarity in which the air itself was almost covered up and lost in the
                  exuberant wildness of variation. Then she stepped to her writing table and penned
                  a note to Cora, stating that she should be at Ironton the next evening.
               Stella had confidence in her judgment of persons. She wished to see Clara Summers
                  at once, and satisfy herself regarding the mind and heart of one on whom her
                  happiness now so much depended. For she had determined that if Clara should prove
                  to be all that Cora had depicted, she should very soon be placed in possession of
                  the greater part of that estate by which Stella herself had been so hampered and
                  circumscribed.
               Yet now, more than ever, she desired the means of her own comfortable
                  independence. She remembered, of course, the object for which her father was
                  indefatigably laboring. He had already done even better than he anticipated. He
                  was making money very rapidly, and she knew it was for her. But the most of it was
                  constantly invested. As her father's operations had become larger, he had grown to
                  be more and more the venturesome old merchant, seeming bent on making good all his
                  former losses. He was vigilant and shrewd. Still, it was possible that his plans
                  might again miscarry. Then Stella would need something of her own, for him and for
                  her. Earnest had been so badly disabled by his wounds, and, still worse, by the
                  fall from his horse, simultaneously received, that, although he would not probably
                  be maimed, he might never again be able to resume his duties as a soldier; and his
                  surgeons had told him that, for many months at best, he could not completely
                  recover his strength. Him above all else, Stella could not but include in her
                  desires and calculations.
               She had always felt that in strict justice she was entitled to a part of her
                  husband's property,—sufficient to support her comfortably. If he had awarded her
                  so much unconditionally, leaving her mind and body free, she would have been
                  perfectly satisfied. Had she known of such a niece as Clara, she would have begged
                  to have her handsomely endowed, as she would have done for all others having
                  natural claims on the estate. She appreciated the value of money, having no
                  sentimental abomination of it, but only of vanities, frivolities, and abuses so
                  generally attaching themselves to it. She knew that it gave, in special, the best
                  of all the world's good gifts to a superior mind,—the leisure for cultivation and
                  for self-satisfying action. One mode of such action might easily be to aid
                  hundreds of fellow- beings,—a matter,
                  certainly, which Stella, if any one, could comprehend.
               Would it be proper, then, for her to be the recipient of a small part of this
                  fortune which she had about decided to turn immediately over to Clara? Such a
                  person as Clara must be, would not fail in generous appreciation of a transfer,
                  which one word spoken by her uncle's widow could prevent in any case. No, surely
                  not. And she would wish that Stella should still derive some benefit from what she
                  had in so large a degree possessed. Stella thought of her old father, and of her
                  stricken young lover, and said this would be right: she should have some little of
                  Mr. Torson's large wealth. Clara would surely make her the offer.
               Stella was not mistaken. Clara Summers was as represented,—generous, enthusiastic,
                  noble, and highly intellectual. Having been thrown upon her own resources, she was
                  self-dependent; and, with the most feminine delicacy of perception, she had a
                  masculine business tact. Stella perceived at once that her newfound niece was an
                  impersonation of the most lovely features of the present, and a mirror of the
                  future; that her mind dwelt in the realm of ideas; her soul revolved, one with the
                  stars, in the orbit of obedience, law, duty. There was no mistaking that frank,
                  unreserved manner, those eager, unstudied words. What she looked and said, that
                  she felt and meant. And her glances were reflections of the heavens, and her
                  sayings were not those of the selfish or the common. For Stella they were easy to
                  interpret. In three hours she knew Clara well, and loved her fervently. In three
                  days, she trusted her thus:—
               Her arms were about the daughter of Virginia, and they sat together.
               "Clara, dear," she said, "I want you to take your uncle's fortune. You have heard
                  how it has grieved me, perhaps."
               "Yes; and what will you do then?"
               "What would you have me do?"
               "Take three quarters of it, or what more you say, directly back, at my hands, and
                  then love me as your niece and your friend. Will you do that?"
               "No, my Clara, not wholly. I will love you in any way you please. But I do not
                  feel as though much of that fortune belongs to me. Your uncle did not want to
                  trust me with it. He said so. He did not know, of course, that he had a niece who
                  could use it more effectually than myself; and that too in ways I might like to
                  employ it. But that was his own affair. He ran the risk. I regard it as his own
                  responsibility. Yet I have a theory in the matter. I think that when he, a rich
                  man, contemplated leaving me as his widow, it was my right to have a comfortable
                  provision to use unfettered. I would have been content with two or three times my
                  yearly income, as the entire amount, if he had wished. He gave me, instead, the
                  use of the whole estate, but bound me to it like a slave. You shall have the
                  money,—the whole of it. I will then take, if you say so, as a gift of your love,
                  twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars. I think I have a rightful claim to so
                  much."
               "Well, you are a scrupulous soul," exclaimed Clara, with a smile and
                  a tighter clasp of the arms. "But why, in the name of sense and sensibility, are
                  you not as much entitled to ten times
                  the amount you specify as to that little end of the fortune? You were his wife. I
                  was only his niece. My parents displeased him. You lived with him, faithful and
                  trusted; and all the more to be treated handsomely, as you did so without loving
                  him. It is evident that he only gave me a chance in the will because he knew
                  nothing about me; and he probably doubted my ever reaping any benefit from it. I
                  shall employ the money as much against his bygone wishes as you would do. I shall
                  take that course, devoid the smallest twinge of conscience. I am clear on the
                  subject. To me, it is plainly my duty to disregard the inclinations of my sometime
                  uncle. It is only a trifle of indirection to put the whole estate on me. No,
                  positively, my good aunty, my dear Stella, your terms are 'out of the question,'
                  as the merchants say. You are altogether 'too hard on me.' But I am sure it is
                  impossible for us to quarrel seriously about money. We already know each other too
                  well for that. Let me tell you, however, what you may do. You may transfer every
                  cent to me as soon as you please. Then, what I can induce you and yours to accept,
                  by the power of tongue and quill, I suppose will be my affair."
               She kissed Stella as she finished speaking. The caress was returned, and Stella
                  said that she must content herself, she supposed, with being persuaded.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               ON the 7th of July, the "Ironton Evening Chronicle" announced that Captain Earnest
                  Acton had arrived in town, still suffering severely from his wounds received at
                  the battle of Fair Oaks.
               "We are sorry to say," continued the article, "that it is feared this gallant
                  officer will not be able to resume his place in the field. It was supposed at
                  first, as our readers will remember, that his wounds were fatal. In his almost
                  superhuman effort to hold our heroic boys up to their task, after it seemed a
                  hopeless one, Captain Acton's person was necessarily exposed with utter
                  indifference. The result is fresh in all minds.
               "He has partly recovered from his bullet-wounds, and it is thought he will fully
                  recover from them. But in falling from his horse, he received injuries which will
                  probably affect his spine, rendering him weak for many months, if not permanently
                  preventing him from again serving his country in battle.
               "We sincerely regret to learn the fact. He was soon to have held a higher position
                  in the army, and would have filled it with signal ability.
               "It is a loss which the service can ill afford, to be deprived of those who, in
                  addition to bravery and address, have a
                  thorough understanding of the present momentous contest in all its bearings, and
                  who feel that no sacrifice can be too great, in securing for a continent impartial
                  freedom and enduring justice. Captain Acton was one of these. As he fought at Fair
                  Oaks against all odds, so we hope, against all opinions, that he will yet live to
                  fight again."
               The day after the above mention of Earnest's return home, he was not a little
                  surprised by the following letter.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "AT CORA CLANDON'S.
                              "DEAR SIR:—
                           
                           "I do not know that you have yet heard of any such person as myself.
                              Permit me, then, to introduce you to Miss Clara Summers, the niece of
                              the late J. Z. Torson, Esq., and, much better, the friend, as well as
                              niece, of his lovely and accomplished widow.
                           "During the last few days I have been placed in possession of my
                              deceased uncle's entire property. While living, that gentleman did not
                              see fit to own me as his relative; and at his death, did not know, I
                              suppose,—at least was not at all certain,—that I was in existence.
                              Still, he saw fit to make in his will a provision through which my
                              dear Aunt Stella has turned over to me his fortune. On so doing, she
                              expressed herself willing to take back, as a gift from me, the very
                              modest, or rather, under the circumstances, the very pitiful allowance
                              of twenty-five thousand dollars. We could not agree upon that sum. She
                              has, it seems to me, by every principle of equity, a much better right
                              to three quarters of the whole estate, than I have to keep for myself
                              the remaining quarter.
                           "However, she cannot be brought to my terms. She says that she became
                              my uncle's wife against her judgment, and very reluctantly. She took
                              no thought of his money; and, as he did not want her to have it, she
                              thinks that, out of self-respect, she ought to take no more than will
                              support her comfortably and pleasantly. I cannot look at the matter in
                              any such light. I have therefore insisted on putting into her hands
                              twice the sum she proposed (fifty thousand dollars), and, by my utmost
                              powers of persuasion, have at last prevailed upon her to retain that
                              amount.
                           "Now I want to ask a favor of you. It is, that you will receive the
                              like sum, and make what disposition of it you choose. Then I shall beg
                              of Stella's father that he will do the same.
                           "My uncle has, living, two or three distant relatives,—poor and
                              common, but worthy people,—whom he did not recognize in any way, as I
                              can learn, but who have, I think, some natural claim to a small part
                              of his property. I intend they shall have moderate bequests at once,
                              just as though they had been remembered in the will.
                           "There will be left, as I compute, something over a hundred and fifty
                              thousand dollars for my share. If you and her father should agree to
                              my proposals, my dear aunt, my sweet friend Stella, will have,
                              directly and indirectly, about that amount also,—the estate being
                              divided not far from equally between us.
                           "It appears to me that my self-respect is at stake, as
                              well as hers. She should have had the unfettered use of the estate. It
                              was a gross insult and injustice to so noble a woman to deprive her of
                              it. I, the distant, unknown
                              niece, might have had, by right, a small provision,—as much, or rather
                              more, than Stella first proposed to accept from me. And then I should
                              have been much richer than I ever expected to be. Yet, simply because
                              I can do so, I have now figured for myself one hundred and fifty
                              thousand dollars, to half of which, at least, Stella has a better
                              right than I. Is it fair to insist on my being still more
                              avaricious?
                           "Furthermore, if my uncle were now alive, holding his former views, he
                              would be as much adverse to seeing me in possession of his riches, as
                              any other person whatever. For the most of his opinions I have no
                              respect, and for his prejudices I don't care a fig. I shall employ the
                              bulk of his wealth directly against his selfish and obsolescent
                              notions. The system of slavery, for instance, which he inclined to
                              propitiate, if not to foster, I hate heartily, knowing it thoroughly.
                              His property shall aid in supplying materials for its destruction. My
                              religion, too, is practical,—a thing to be used for the welfare of
                              God's children here as well as hereafter. What my uncle
                              termed New England 'infidelity,'—that intense purification of
                              ritualism, and a purification whose exponents have been some of the
                              greatest religious souls living or dead,—I do not fear as he did,
                              knowing more about it, probably, than he had the inducement to
                              comprehend. I would lend it my dollars much more readily than for
                              theological propagation at Timbuctoo. For all these considerations, my
                              mediocre uncle's superior and magnanimous wife might just as well have
                              his fortune as might his wilful and headstrong niece.
                           "But I have another reason for mentioning my own tendencies. Sensitive
                              people recoil from gifts; and if you are not persuaded that you should
                              accept my offer as a right due Stella, I want to prevail on you to
                              take it as a present due yourself. You would not consent to an aimless
                              donation; probably not to one of mere goodfeeling:—you must understand
                              the giver; the giver must understand you. Now, if I can give from
                              sufficiently exalted grounds, perhaps you will grant me the pleasure
                              of acceptance. I have listened with deep interest to much I have heard
                              very discriminating friends say regarding you; I am acquainted with
                              many of your actions, as well as your thoughts. You have been occupied
                              with the gravest questions and interests which affect the human kind.
                              I can easily perceive—it was never plainer than now—what vast
                              influence for good, a generous mind, powerful, cultivated, and
                              independent, can exert in the world. You would commend me, If I saw
                              fit to tender a considerable present to a beneficent institution. Yet
                              I know several Americans, each one of whom is a greater benefit to the
                              country than any hundred such institutions that could be picked out.
                              Pardon me for offering you the sincere compliment of thinking that you
                              have begun life in a way to become such a man.
                           "Believing so, I shall be very grateful, I assure you, if permitted a
                              contribution to the more ordinary materials of your advancement and
                              usefulness. What I shall expect in return, yet have no need to ask,
                              is, that the zeal of the scholar for the true and the right will equal
                              that of the former soldier, who now, it is said, can be a soldier no
                              more.
                           "Hoping that I may have, at the proper time, the honor of being your niece, I content
                              myself now with being
                           
                              "Your friend,
                              "CLARA SUMMERS.
                              
                                 "To Capt. EARNEST ACTON."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Clara's letter was enclosed to Stella, and sent to Boston, whither the two had
                  gone some days before, Clara having returned alone. Mr. Gebard, a conscientious
                  and able young lawyer, had accompanied them to Boston. Their purpose had been to
                  enter at once upon the transaction which Clara's letter now referred to as
                  complete.
               Stella had acknowledged her infraction of the will, and nothing could be done but
                  to execute the provision in favor of Clara Summers. So Clara became an
                  heiress.
               The parties representing the pro-slavery interest in the will had materially
                  changed their views since the inauguration of rebellion, and said that they should
                  now be heartily ashamed to lend their efforts in even the remotest manner to
                  oppose the cause of freedom. They were democrats of the Butler persuasion.
               The theological interest was at first disposed to stand out, especially as it had
                  just entertained hopes of coming into its share of the property, through Snorton
                  Ruffat, the peculating quartermaster of F—who, after being dismissed the service
                  of his much-abused country, had come to Boston, and, seeing Stella in the street,
                  had made inquiries by which he learned something of her history, and obtained a
                  clew to the tenor of the will. He was immediately eager for retaliation, offering
                  to prove that Stella had no further claim upon the Torson estate. The regenerated
                  hunkers were cool to him; the agents of theology hailed his statement with
                  gladness. But at this juncture Clara Summers stepped in, Mr. Gebard's keen eyes
                  twinkled humorously, and the necessary documents were in his pocket. Distinguished
                  counsel on both sides declared the case to be clear, all argument to be futile.
                  Discomfited theology therefore concluded to be peaceable,—its invariable course in
                  all history, when it has been able to take no other.
               The business settled, as far as Clara's presence was necessary, she returned to
                  Ironton, Stella promising to follow her soon, and to complete the visit, never too
                  long, which she had intended for Cora.
               "And where we can be conveniently near our dear friend Captain Acton, my
                  delectable auntie," suggested the smiling Clara.
               But, as we have seen, the "delectable auntie" had not yet come.
               So Clara's letter was sent to her. Earnest would not conclude anything in her
                  behalf without consulting her, and he asked her judgment concerning his own
                  acceptance of so large a gift, provided she should not wish him to take it, having
                  her welfare in view.
               Stella replied: "Do as you like, my dear Earnest—as you think right and best. I
                  trust your judgment more than my own. Perhaps my feelings were morbid regarding my
                  apportionment. But I never craved a very large fortune, and I came almost to
                     hate Mr. Torson's money.
               "Now it is Clara's. She certainly has a right to dispose of it as she chooses.
               
               "One thing I will say of her. She is regal in mind and heart. She is not to be
                  judged by others. She can be injured neither by granting nor by submitting to
                  favors.
               "Pardon me, my love, a bit of pleasantry. Clara is the only person I have met,
                  whom I would do the honor to be jealous of, if you knew how to be capricious. She
                  is a pearl of great price."
               Earnest soon had an interview with Clara, and, after conversing with her an hour
                  or two, he concluded to take from her fifty thousand dollars, which she bestowed
                  with as simple satisfaction as that with which a generous child shares an orange
                  with a pet companion.
               Yet this superb young woman had, on one or two occasions, been in actual need of a
                  few dollars. She had labored for her daily bread, and was already meditating upon
                  the manner of investing her remaining capital, so as to make it pay every fair and
                  honest cent. She was prudent, and of Yankee stock. Only she knew the meaning of a
                  sacred trust.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXX.
               STELLA soon fulfilled her promise, coming back to Ironton to complete a visit of
                  uncertain duration.
               Clara remained there for the present, and to Cora's inexpressible, yet constantly
                  declared satisfaction, the three friends were together under one roof,—all happy
                  in the commodious mansion of Richard Clandon.
               Cora wrote to her brother, "Captain Bub," all the circumstances of the young
                  teacher's sudden transmutation to a lady of fortune; and deputed him, in Clara's
                  name, to hunt up little Ben, and assure him that his friend Clara Summers
                  remembered him with much affection, and would hold for him at the North five
                  thousand dollars,—the money his brother had been obliged to pay her,—which the boy
                  should have, with interest, whenever he should need it.
               "Tell him, too, that if he is ever in trouble, he must come to Clara; and she will
                  try to be a sister, almost as good to him as his poor Sallie.
               "And now, sir," she continued, "you may as well be assured that Miss Summers will
                  be, in this place, a person of innumerable attractions, acknowledged by several
                  more than innumerable adorers. So look sharp, absent soldier. If you don't want
                  her for my sister in-law, what in the
                  world shall I do with a brother of such sorry taste? If you do,—well, that's all:
                  but time is precious where rubies are scarce. Get a furlough, my tall brother; get
                  a furlough, and come to pay us your respects."
               Captain Clandon replied that he should do so as soon as he could without personal
                  discredit or injury to the service.
               "In respect to Miss Summers," he wrote, "I shall defer, in my taste, to no one,
                  not even to the crazy and bantering Sissy Cora herself. When I think of Miss
                  Summers, I almost wish, momentarily, that I were one of the 'peace party' with you
                  at home. Yet I suspect a man must be worthy of his country to win
                     her.
               
               "Seriously, dear Cora, the lady has left a deep impression on me. I think of her
                  very often. If the beaux multiply to my harm, say to her that when the celestials
                  are raffled for, I must positively have one chance in the chief prize. Then I will
                  do my best, and abide my luck quietly, like a decent, practical fellow."
               Cora was certainly proud of the fine, soldierly Captain Lawrence Ide Clandon,
                  whose lofty figure and almost imperious bearing appeared in ridiculous contrast
                  with her diminutive appellation of "Captain Bub." How could she help reading to
                  Clara a brief extract from his letter!
               "What shall I tell him?" she asked. Clara smiled and blushed.
               "Tell him the celestial raffle shall not come off while he is deprived of a
                  chance."
               Here were indications of more lovers for the future.
               But Earnest and Stella, Charley Merlow and Cora, were soon to be established in
                  another category. They were to move out of the world of "young people," all
                  migrating together. The day was set. It was to be early in September.
               By close care and constant attention to his ailments, Earnest had regained his
                  health much more rapidly than was at first deemed possible. He was still rather
                  weak,—so was easily fatigued; but otherwise he appeared nearly as well as
                  ever.
               The marriage ceremony was very simple,—the immediate relatives and a few warmly
                  attached friends being present at Mr. Clandon's, where the two young couples were
                  joined in wedlock till death should sever the solemn tie. Weighty forms and
                  profuse display were needless, that to them the hour and the lesson should be
                  impressive. They had read the meaning of that blessed sacrament, in life and in
                  their own souls. Thoughtfully yet gladly and trustingly it was to be received;
                  sacredly it was to be regarded and preserved. Years ago, in his boyhood, Earnest
                  in particular had questioned the rite, as he had done with many another,—demanding
                  its central import to him, to the world, to God. He had scrutinized its historical
                  phases; he had worked upon the problem of its moral aims.
               Like all other of the world's chief institutions, he had found it established,
                  first in human nature, then in customs and laws.
               In the earliest ages, when the mind of childhood, with its restless and wilful
                  strivings, was the motor and guide of mature men—their wishes having almost no
                  limitation save the boundaries of their mere strength to do,—intellectual, reflective morality not yet
                  evolved,—marriage was, as Earnest had found, the conjunction of tyrant and his toy
                  or slave. The equality of woman's nature with man's was not perceived; for only
                  the roughest properties of man's nature were held in esteem. Virtue was physical
                  courage and force. Beauty was a sweet bauble, to occupy one's leisure; to be
                  tossed aside or changed at one's pleasure. But the race grew out of childhood. In
                  Greece, it became a sprightly, enthusiastic, sensitive youth. Man's attachment to
                  woman was then purer. Spiritual values and refinements could be considered. The
                  Grecian could love; and mere passion was no longer paramount. Civilization thus
                  began the disuse of polygamy. Out of civilization at last came a soul loving
                  enough to bestow Christianity upon the nations; and this was to complete the
                  amelioration.
               Earnest had but to look into his own experience for a reflex of the entire
                  transition, except that his sentiments, through these changes, had not, as in
                  history, been unfolded into multifarious actions.
               Marriage, then, was to him, as its forms declared, an indissoluble bond, holding
                  him to the pure, radiant woman there at his side, until her mild, happy eyes could
                  look no more into his, or until his own should lie cold, rayless, and closed.
                  "Love, cherish, and protect;"—this he would do, and would impart to her what
                  wisdom and worth might be given him, that lasting benefit might flow upon her; and
                  he would receive the promptings of her tenderness, her perceptive goodness and
                  truth, that enduring profit should flow to him. "Love, honor, and obey;"—this
                     she would do; for to both there should be no standard of will or
                  whim. The true, the right, which are that heaven the soul exists to seek, should
                  claim the allegiance of each, and to this she and he would gladly bow.
               Thankful for every good thought, for every noble deed of his life; grateful to
                  Heaven for every crystal of purity garnered, and for every temptation repelled;
                  glad that he was in some sort worthy, yet very humble that his worth was less than
                  he or the angels might wish,—Earnest took the hand of her who was the chosen of
                  his heart. Charley Merlow and Cora stood at their side. The few questions were
                  asked, the few responses were given, and the friends were husbands and wives.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXI.
               AMERICAN events of the year succeeding Earnest's marriage were to be momentous in
                  their effect upon the ages, and prominent in the history of man. But amidst them
                  Earnest was to be an observer, not what is commonly considered a doer. Cheerful
                  and happy, capable of regular and continuous mental exertion, it was still much as
                  the physicians had predicted:—he did not recover his full bodily vigor and
                  endurance. Among half-invalid civilians he passed as sound. Old Doctor Wisely, and
                  many another friend, bade him look well to his health if he wished to stay long
                  with them.
               His sword had been thrown aside. Now, however; he grasped the pen. He wielded it
                  often, sometimes assured that error was weaker for the stroke,—that man was
                  stronger in faith, higher in freedom.
               Thus he gave the soul's mite of charity, as best he could, to the needy, while his
                  open hand never withheld the more material offering with which God's rich are
                  favored, not vulgarly, for themselves alone.
               But, toward the close of the year 1863, Earnest determined upon visiting New
                  Orleans. His chief motive was to see for himself the condition of the many poor
                  beings, suddenly emerged from slavery to freedom, who were in that vicinity and at
                  Port Royal, and to look into, or at least glance at, the noble efforts which had
                  been made in their behalf by humane men and women of the North. He thought that
                  perhaps he too might lend his hand, his brain, or, if nothing more, his purse, to
                  the cause.
               Not men now—not any one class of men, but man—all men, he regarded as his kin.
                  There were threads of relation, he observed, however subtile, between him and the
                  highest of these,—between him and the lowest also. He ignored none. But he
                  perceived that of all classes in the land, the slaves and the freedmen most
                  required, and best deserved, the philanthropic attentions of the intellectual, the
                  wealthy, and the benignant. They were the most helpless, and had been brought to
                  their impoverishment by the selfishness and sin of American citizens. It was for
                  American citizens, then, to try, even at the eleventh hour, to afford them what
                  incomplete reparation might be possible.
               And above all, Earnest saw plainly that until the Negro should be recognized as a
                  man, with all the natural rights and privileges of any and every man, the White
                  would himself be petty, tyrannical, lazy and snobbish,—far enough from the
                  likeness of God, in which he supposed himself created,—a sorry child, indeed,
                  needing costly and severe instruction, some portion of which he was already
                  receiving, from the sabre, the rifle, the cannon. Whatever then might contribute
                  to the manhood of the Black, would contribute in quite as large degree to the
                  manhood of the White; and Earnest had
                  traversed the centuries and the soul too carefully to be unaware that the White's
                  manhood required enlargement much more than his pocket, however astonishing the
                  fact might appear to him.
               The riots of the preceding summer, induced by those not without a certain kind of
                  intelligence, though consummated by the most ignorant of the vile, showed that in
                  both the hyena and the jackal were to be tamed and overgrown, and that thousands
                  of Americans were like the diseased and bloated German in the play, who was cured
                  of his malady by having a large number of fools cut out of him. Education,
                  employment, encouragement to martial valor,—anything that would aid the Black to
                  assert his equal humanity,—would cut one fool of prejudice or distrust out of the
                  White; and for the good of all, such surgery was unmistakably the achievement of
                  the age.
               It is probable, too, that those truculent demonstrations of July made Earnest, as
                  many others, actually prefer, in most respects, the loyal, unoffending Negro, to
                  the Celtic or Saxon savage, who ground him into bloody dust. Even the pictorial
                  newspapers represented the rioter as uglier in face, uglier in form, worse
                  smelling, and in every way lower and more beastly, than Sambo was ever depicted in
                  the palmiest days of Pierce or Buchanan. The persecutor or persecuted—which would
                  the sane, not to say the cultivated, deem superior?
               Indignation is sometimes a powerful auxiliary to benevolence. Possibly it was a
                  spur to Earnest's action, when he decided to proceed South, and throw all the
                  energy and means he could spare into a single channel. For his health was not yet
                  secure, and although Doctor Wisely said that the mere change would not be
                  detrimental, he declared that his friend would be sure to excite and overwork
                  himself, "into the box, into the box!"
               But go the young man would, and his wife, with their friend Clara Summers,
                  accompanied him.
               Clara enjoyed participating in all good works. Perhaps, also, she enjoyed the
                  prospect of meeting Colonel Lawrence Ide Clandon;—for "Captain Bub" now wore that
                  title, with the corresponding insignia on coat and cap; and he was still stationed
                  at New Orleans, where the party were to proceed at first, stopping at Port Royal
                  on their return. Three months after Cora had advised her brother to "get a
                  furlough," he had procured it, and had spent a few weeks at home. It was not long
                  before numerous young ladies began to whisper to each other, that Captain Clandon
                  and Clara Summers were "engaged." It was probably true in this instance, though it
                  is not infallibly so in all instances, as we know, when young ladies whisper the
                  like.
               But Earnest's plans were to be suddenly frustrated. The day after his arrival in
                  New Orleans, while in the street with Stella and Cora, proceeding toward Colonel
                  Clandon's quarters, they were met by a person in uniform, who appeared slightly
                  intoxicated, and whom Stella immediately recognized as her old enemy, Ruffat, the
                  discharged quartermaster. He also recognized her as well as Earnest, and was
                  unable to contain his rage.
               "Ah! you damned Miss Virtuous!" he exclaimed with a sneer, as he brushed past, "so you've got
                  your brother cured,—have you?"
               Earnest's first impulse was to knock him down. But as his face flushed, and his
                  arm rose, Stella besought him to take no notice of an affront from a drunken man;
                  or, at any rate, to do nothing more than report it to Colonel Clandon.
               They passed on, and in a few minutes were in their friend's apartments. On
                  mentioning the insult to him, and the causes of it, his eye glittered and his lips
                  whitened; but in a tone even lower and calmer than usual, he inquired the man's
                  name. Stella gave it, and Earnest said he wore a lieutenant's cap.
               "He could not have entered the service again under his old name, however," said
                  Colonel Clandon. "He has changed it. Describe him, if you please."
               To describe him was easy:—
               "A coarse, gross person, with a repulsive scar from the left cheek-bone down
                  toward the mouth."
               "I know him," said the colonel; and, stepping out of the room, he ordered that a
                  guard be detailed to arrest Lieutenant Murkin, acting in the commissary
                  department, and that the prisoner be brought forthwith to him.
               It appears that the man was connected with the brigade of which Colonel Clandon
                  was then acting as commander.
               About ten minutes elapsed before his order was obeyed. Meanwhile he conversed
                  cordially with Earnest and Stella, and with a tone of unmistakable pride and
                  tenderness, as he spoke to Clara Summers.
               Lieutenant Murkin was brought in, and the guard was ordered to leave the
                  apartment, but to remain just outside the door, in the street. The culprit seemed
                  to read his fate at a glance, and to feel that humiliation and renewed dismissal
                  from the army would be meted out to him, if nothing worse. He glared on the party
                  with maudlin yet desperate fury, and, before a single question was put to him, he
                  suddenly drew a pistol and aimed it at Stella. Earnest as suddenly stepped in
                  front of her. The pistol was discharged, and the ball entered his chest near the
                  shoulder. He staggered and fell, and for an instant he alone was heeded. Colonel
                  Clandon caught him, and laid him carefully on the floor, perceiving at once that,
                  however badly he might be injured, he was not killed.
               Murkin sprang to the door and rushed out. His colonel, whose lip was perfectly
                  livid, but whose movements were fearfully calm followed him. The guard had raised
                  their muskets to fire, as Colonel Clandon reached the door. He ordered them not to
                  do so. Then, as he drew a rather small single-barrelled pistol from his pocket, he
                  muttered,—"No musket-shots: sure work for the fellow this time!"
               That unerring weapon,—not the second in the Department of the Gulf, as General
                  Butler had once intimated, but the first, the surest,—was levelled and fired.
               "Sergeant," he ordered, "have the body removed: he is dead: you will find him shot
                  through the brain."
               He then sent for the two best surgeons of the brigade, and, composed and grim, he
                  returned to Earnest.
               As he reentered the room Clara looked up into his face, then turned away with
                  terror. Her lover's ex- pression, at
                  that moment, she never forgot. The trained officer bred to kill; the flaming
                  volcano hideously self-controlled; the gladiator with deliberate death in his
                  gaze,—had broken through those refined, handsome features; and, as he replaced the
                  pistol in his pocket, she read the fate of the man who had ventured to insult, and
                  had then attempted to shoot, a soldier's guest and a lady.
               The look flitted away. Bending over Earnest, and looking at the wound, he said,
                  "It is serious, but not mortal. He will live."
               Stella and Cora were reassured; and, under his inflexible, imperturbable will,
                  were quiet and helpful, like children.
               The surgeons came; Earnest was removed to another apartment; his wound was
                  dressed; and once more Stella's soothing and vigilant attentions as a nurse, were
                  exerted to prolong that dear life.
               He recovered very slowly. The shock had been too great for one whose constitution
                  was already shattered. Tedious weeks passed before he gained sufficient strength
                  to walk, or even to stand. Finally it was thought that he could return North with
                  safety; and, as he was impatient to go, Colonel Clandon secured the party every
                  comfort that could be afforded them for the voyage, and they started for New
                  York.
               The passage was long and stormy, and when they reached that city, Earnest was
                  obliged to wait there several days. He was too weak to continue his journey
                  immediately to Ironton.
               "Once in our snug home, which you have arranged so cosily, my Stella, and I feel
                  as though I should scarcely leave it many times again."
               Such was his first intimation,—which was spoken with a quiet smile,—that he looked
                  forward to what Stella and Clara had both begun to dread, in spite of their hopes,
                  although neither would own it to the other by as much as a look.
               Stella perceived his meaning instantly.
               "O Earnest!" she murmured, and sank to the floor.
               She had borne up with cheerfulness, even humor, until that moment. But she had
                  come to place such implicit reliance on what her husband said, that now, when he
                  spoke thus to her, she felt as though even this matter were settled; that she must
                  give him up; that before long he would die.
               Fair, loving young wife,—it was well, perhaps, to prepare her for the stroke. Yet
                  how could she bear it? It seemed as though her own life would ebb immediately
                  away, if his were taken from her.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXII.
               EARNEST was not mistaken. He had but a short time to live. From this last
                  infliction by the bullet, with the attendant debility, he never recovered,
                  although he lingered several weeks, between life and death, after he reached
                  home.
               To him it was not dreadful to die. In his early youth, it will be remembered,
                  life, not its termination, had appeared terrible; and more than once, in his
                  doubt, his misanthropy, his antagonism with the world's ideas and endeavors, he
                  had longed to flee anywhere away from the hated scene. So trivial, so selfish, so
                  mean it all seemed, that why should he stay where there was nothing, and yet worse
                  than nothing, for one like him? Bitterly he had asked himself the question; then,
                  from regard to others, and from sheer scorn of all possible events, he had still
                  maundered and groped along, tempted, but not quite enticed, by every dark rolling
                  stream, until at last the sunlight of truth and faith broke through upon his soul,
                  and he felt as jubilant in his independence of persons and circumstances, as he
                  had felt disconsolate before their secret was read and their tendency revealed.
                  The sphinx answered, the riddle solved, the heavens opened,—what was there now to
                  fear?
               "It is pleasant to die of there be gods; it is sad to live if there be none."
               "True, Marcus Antoninus," Earnest could declare; "and I have beheld the gods: it
                  is beautiful to live, it is beautiful to die. Sad? There is nothing sad, but
                  living to hatred, and littleness, and folly."
               Whatever the sermons teach, the bed of death is not commonly a spectacle of terror
                  to the departing soul. Sorrowful it may often be to leave its familiar
                  surroundings; unspeakably pained it may be to sever from other loved souls whom it
                  could aid and succor in this hard circle of fleshly phantoms, where none may be
                  left to protect when it is withdrawn. But for itself it does not usually tremble,
                  if left to its own thoughts, and to its God.
               Every one views himself as no one else can regard him. He sees where his ignorance
                  submerged him in sin,—where circumstances bore down upon him with a pressure,
                  overwhelming at the moment, if not at a later moment when he might have been
                  stronger to resist. He would do better now, he feels; but could not do better
                  then. Somewhere there will be help for him,—somewhere, pardon. Such is doubtless
                  the view and the hope of the very worst: else would he crave dissolution,
                  annihilation, the sooner the better, by his own hand. For the universe is a
                  poisoned dagger to the breaker of its laws, and stabs the criminal, of its own
                  accord, at every turn.
               Even the most vile and wretched often die with complacency, with gladness: for is
                  not hope literally their all? William Mumford the gambler, like John Brown the
                  religious enthusiast, is hanged perfectly composed.
               
               But a faith, little or great—anything that is trusted,—makes death a festival.
                  Relying upon it, the Hindoo will pitch himself into the mouth of the nearest
                  crocodile, and the Christian will sing hymns at the stake while his tongue
                  shrivels in his throat, and the throat is crisping into cinders. If Voltaire the
                  sceptic will meet death calmly and courteously, much as he would greet a polite
                  Frenchman, what affright has it to the searching insight of Socrates, or the
                  all-believing, all-pitying love of Jesus?
               It had been Earnest Acton's fortune to live his short but crowded life, which was
                  now about to breathe itself away, in a period when old forms of faith had been
                  broken up, while many materialistic, and practically atheistical minds yet clung
                  to the creeds and rituals for respectability or greed; while many other minds—the
                  little and common—honestly worshipped in the old ways, unquestioning because
                  unthinking; and while a few other minds,—active, conscientious, and aspiring, but
                  without intuitive perception sufficient to melt forms and doctrines into their
                  historical meaning and essence,—after struggling a while with doubts that
                     would arise, looked upon all matters as doubtful, and then,
                  unreconciled with their thoughts, but needing some faith, accepted the one of the
                  most accessible evangelical church, and debarred the intellect from further
                  questioning.
               These three classes composed the conventional religionists,—a large body,
                  excluding and misapprehending the loftiest intelligence and deepest piety of the
                  time, and hesitant to accept the noblest works; but still helpful to themselves,
                  and beneficent to the country, especially during the last two or three years, by
                  magnificent undertakings of patriotism, charity, and practical Christian
                  mercy.
               Outside their circle, beyond it and above it, lived and labored in America some of
                  the mightiest religious spirits that ever existed in the world. They were called
                  infidel, yet they were most faithful; they were called destroyers, yet they were
                  constructors. They were confounded with the deists of the eighteenth century. But
                  what were Voltaire and Hume and Gibbon? Strong men, it is true, and superior in a
                  moral as every other sense to the majority of their contemporaries. But they were
                  of this world: they lived in material facts. Seeing the rubbish which littered
                  Church and State, they kicked it out of the way, doing noisy and disagreeable, but
                  worthy service.
               They were so impatient, however, of the rubbish, that they spurned spiritual
                  truths which it concealed.
               They caused every good intellect to doubt; but this was all; they helped it no
                  farther.
               The nineteenth century completed their task, thanking them for all their negative
                  demonstrations, but reconciling these with the presence of God in the human soul,
                  and with the exalted mission of the Christian Religion.
               Through the thick darkness Germany first saw the new sun, while yet it has shone
                  most brightly upon that favored granite where the Pilgrim landed solely that he
                  might worship his God; and, when it lighted Theodore Parker into the world, it
                  made even the piety of ecclesiasticism appear as inferior as its
                  mental capacity.
               
               The number of minds that had completely and satisfactorily wrought out within
                  themselves this transition, was comparatively very small. Earnest had followed
                  them, had understood them, was one of them.
               Then there was a large class in the process of that transmutation which he had
                  undergone. They were rationalists, doubters, and sneerers, of all shades and
                  degrees. The most of them were honest, well-meaning, and instinctively favorable
                  to each noble movement for the freedom and elevation of mankind. Uncertain of
                  man's relation to God, they yet held to man's just relation to his
                  fellow-beings.
               Earnest had known a few men, like his father, so natural and unconstrained in an
                  artificial epoch, that they had walked along untouched by dogmas and
                  mystifications, believing in God, believing in goodness, and asking no more. They
                  were too healthy to catch the prevailing theological epidemics, and so had never
                  been troubled with the affliction or the cure.
               Through such a period of spiritual convulsion, with the changes it brought upon
                  institutions and customs, Earnest Acton had journeyed to an overlooking, inclusive
                  faith, and now the journey was to end.
               To leave Stella, while they were both so young, and had just begun their glad
                  dependence on each other,—this was the keenest sorrow, though less for him than
                  for the dear one to be left behind. Heavy-hearted she would be, heavy-eyed and
                  dreary.
               But the world would still be around her; and her duty would ever be before her. If
                  there would be few to bless her as he had done, there would be many whom she could
                  bless,—poor souls who would much need that her kind, chastened heart should find
                  rest for itself in being busy for them.
               And was not the love of two hearts, each for the other, but a delightful
                  initiatory symbol of a love that both were to feel for universal beauty, and
                  truth, and goodness?
               Bright vision of earthly fondness—such was, after all, its enduring splendor! The
                  one great, happy lover of all history—was it not that most divine man of Calvary,
                  who could sweetly, willingly embrace death itself, in his love for the fair, the
                  true, the infinitely beautiful?
               To such love the soul of man and woman must rise before it can be free, before it
                  can know the meaning of heaven. The end of life is to reach such a love; the
                  beginning of joy is nothing else than this.
               Upon such high ground Earnest consoled her who was worthy of such consolation, and
                  would not forget it in his absence. It is all the living can offer to the living!
                  It is enough to offer. It is all the dying can offer to the living! Let them heed
                  it; for they too are in the presence of death, and to triumph is to know that
                  death is easy to those who love so much that they cannot fear.
               During one of the last days of Earnest's life he was visited by a friend, Mr.
                  Welby, a conscientious and devoted young clergyman of the Methodist church. They
                  had known each other several years, and, though very different in all respects, a
                  warm personal regard existed between them.
               "Well, my friend," asked Mr. Welby, "how do you feel to-day?"
               "As though I should last it out, and perhaps two or three days after it," Earnest
                  replied, cheerfully; "but I shall leave
                  you pretty soon. Any day, almost any hour, may take me now."
               The good, sensitive clergyman saw that here was the same friend he had so many
                  times met in health, highhearted, firm and trusting to the last. No need of
                  discussion,—no place for it here. Mr. Welby had felt, at first, as if he ought to
                  say some word to that dying man whom he loved,—some word even yet for his soul.
                  But that soul was so calm, so content, so ready for the coming change, that he saw
                  it rested on immovable convictions, and must be left to its God alone. He forbore
                  all remarks, therefore, that might excite Earnest, but, before leaving him, asked
                  if he might pray for one who was very dear to him,—one who was himself aware that
                  perhaps they might never see each other again in life.
               "Certainly, my dear friend," said Earnest; "let us repeat together the Lord's
                  prayer. You remember the old Grecian, Pythagoras, taught that we should not plead
                  with God for particular favors, because we are perpetually ignorant of what God
                  always knows to be best for us. We are to trust his plans, not beg for the
                  fulfilment of our own. I have often felt this inculcation; and some prayers I have
                  heard would have choked me in the utterance. Yet we constantly aspire, in our
                  feelings, to be something better than we are; and the aspiration for good may
                  surely come to our lips. And thanksgiving for God's bounty and his goodness must
                  be felt and expressed, wherever his presence is truly in the heart. That beautiful
                  prayer which Jesus addressed to his Father in heaven, hallowing his name; asking
                  that the divine will be done on earth; that our simple daily needs be supplied to
                  us; that our sins may be forgiven, and that we may forgive the sins of others;
                  that we may not be tempted, yet when tempted may be delivered from the evil:—that
                  prayer has long seemed to me to include all that man may say to God, or ask of
                  him,—all that a trusting soul can present to the Author of its being and
                  blessings."
               Earnest spoke with fervor. His eye brightened and his cheek flushed. The friend
                  made no reply, but knelt at his bedside, and together they repeated those tender,
                  touching, solemn words.
               Mr. Welby then rose and took Earnest's hand.
               "Good-by," he said; "Iam very glad I came to see you. I hope we shall meet
                  again."
               Yes, we shall meet again," answered Earnest,"and where there are
                  better gifts than we know."
               With strange yet far from unpleasant feelings, the clergyman departed.
               The next two days Earnest sank rapidly. The third morning the sun rose bright and
                  warm, and though, during the night, a January snow-storm had covered the ground
                  with pure white, the day was brilliant and beautiful.
               When he had found himself unable to leave his room, our friend had requested
                  Stella to have a bed put up for him in the little library, so that he might hear
                  her play on her piano, in the adjoining room. Her music was never more welcome to
                  him than now; and besides, he wished to impress her as far as possible with his
                  own realization that his descent to the tomb was but a triumphal march beyond it.
                  Could she only mount the car with him!
                  When he thought of this, he sighed, for the moment, and longed to look back.
               Stella would not leave him night or day. At first she shrank from her piano,
                  almost frightened at its tone; but it was such a pleasure for him to hear it that
                  she overcame her reluctance, and even gleaned some small comfort for herself as
                  she played.
               On this resplendent winter morning, after a fevered, restless night, Earnest sank
                  into a quiet slumber of an hour or two, and then awoke.
               "Stella, my dear," he murmured, "will you play me, 'Who Treads the Path of
                  Duty'?"
               She went to the piano, and the music of that grand, impressive, yet joyous song of
                  Mozart's floated through the rooms. He thanked her with a fond smile, as she
                  returned to him; and drawing her face down to his, he kissed her lips and her
                  brow.
               "Stella, you have been a dear, good wife,—all my soul asked. And even now you are
                  worthy not to despair. Without this last sweetness and trusting greatness, I
                  should not be quite satisfied. We are not dependent on so poor a stay as persons
                  and circumstances. God bless you. God will bless you."
               Earnest spoke clearly and unbrokenly, but with great effort of will; and when he
                  had finished, he sank away exhausted. In a few minutes he looked up once more,
                  still with a smile.
               "My father,—poor old man,—love him, Stella, while he stays; he has done a great
                  deal for me. Let Charley Merlow have my cane; and if Clara and Cora would like any
                  little keepsakes, you select something for each. Give Jerry Kay a hundred
                  dollars."
               Saying this, Earnest dropped back on his pillow, closing his eyes. Presently his
                  father, accompanied by Charley Merlow, with Clara and Cora, entered the room.
                  Alger Acton had been in the house during the night, and toward morning had lain
                  down for a little rest. It was early; but Charley and the other friends had called
                  to inquire after Earnest, just as Stella left him for an instant, to tell his
                  father that he was dying. They all followed Stella to the library without a
                  word.
               Earnest saw them as they stood around his bed, and his eyelids moved with an
                  expression of salutation. His lips parted as if he was about to speak; but he only
                  smiled, and, first placing his hand over his heart, he raised it slightly, and
                  pointed upward. He then extended it to Stella, and held the other out to his
                  father. It seemed as if he could still talk to them, if he should try, but that he
                  had no more to say, and was quietly observing this last strange transition. He did
                  not struggle, and he appeared to feel but little pain. But in half an hour, as the
                  sunlight, which he would not have excluded, fell upon the spot where he lay, his
                  features had turned to marble whiteness: they were rigid and cold.
               Earnest Acton had entered upon a higher life. But there were sobs and tears; and
                  muffled voices mourned him as dead.
            
            
               
               LAST CHAPTER.
               ANOTHER year has gone since Earnest died. Its months have not passed unfraught
                  with changes in the world; they have not passed without some changes amidst the
                  group which made up the attractions and repulsions of Earnest's life.
               Let us glance at some of the group.
               His friend Clara Summers, although she is still simply Clara to her immediate
                  circle of companions, is called by society Mrs. Clandon, while the punctilious
                  speak of her as Mrs. General Clandon. Her husband is one of the most efficient and
                  trusted among the younger officers of the regular army.
               To Charley Merlow and Cora nothing, save the absence of Earnest and the quiet,
                  uncomplaining grief of Stella, has yet appeared to dim their joys. A baby-boy,
                  Earnest Acton Merlow, has been given them to love.
               It would be painful, very painful, for Charley to leave his wife and child; but as
                  the war has continued, and he has felt that he might be called on to bear his part
                  of the heavy burden, he has learned something of the soldier's duties; and both he
                  and Cora look forward to a day when possibly he can no longer remain beside her
                  and regard his duty; when she can no longer bid him linger at home. They look at
                  their infant, and perceive that what the father shall leave undone, the child must
                  do; that peace cannot bless the nation till barbarism and its warriors are
                  crushed. Shall one generation fail in the effort?—then it will be for the next
                  generation to succeed. God has meted the task to the century, and they know that
                  it cannot shirk the stint.
               Rufus Maign is no longer in business. At the time of Earnest's death the veteran
                  merchant had nearly retrieved his fortune. Stella had more wealth than she needed;
                  and why should he strive and labor still? To comfort his daughter now, and to aid
                  her in benevolent undertakings, would be enough, he thought, for a man over sixty.
                  Father, mother, and daughter are again together, and together they are busy,—busy
                  for many others than themselves.
               Jerry Kay, the strange old Irishman, has followed Earnest into a higher life. On
                  earth he was deprived of advantages; he was devoid of culture; he was deemed
                  ignorant and common and low. He swept the streets, and went on errands about the
                  markets. But the uses and manners of that other world are not as our customs and
                  distinctions. Who shall tell what the old man is doing? Was he faithful and honest
                  below? We may be sure, then, that the gods have missions for him now.
               And Stella,—is she content? can she be happy? Not wholly content, not quite happy,
                  as you commonly mean it; nor does she need to be so. She is very calm and placid,
                  very sweet and kind. Her spirit dwells in a high, pure atmosphere, and though she has been selected to bear much sorrow,
                  she is not deprived of all joys.
               During those winter days, after Earnest had gone, it seemed doubtful that she
                  would long tarry to mourn him. She was so prostrated with anxiety and fatigue,
                  that only through a prolonged sickness, she found renewed health and strength. Her
                  soul was clouded with grief, and her eyes were often wet with tears. So much she
                  gave to nature, and could not help giving. But she knew there was brightness
                  beyond the clouds, and that not even to her was life for weeping. So when the
                  sunny spring days came, she placed flowers on the spot where Earnest seemed to
                  have been laid; then turning with a serene smile and a generous hand to the needy
                  and the lowly, she felt that his spirit descended, and was close beside her.
               She does not complain. She hopes, she loves, and is loved by many. She has learned
                  to renounce selfishness, that to unselfishness all things may be awarded. She
                  blesses God, and lives in the world to do his will as best she can, until it shall
                  be his will that she remain no longer. Then she will die as Earnest died, still
                  with thanksgiving on her gentle lips.
               She sat, a few evenings since, alone, as she thought, in the twilight. She sang;
                  and her fingers flitted once more along the key-board of her piano. I listened in
                  the distance, sacredly, but caught these words:— 
                     
                        "I have laid my dead on my country's altar!
                        God gave me to moan:—
                        To moan with a broken wail, to falter,
                        And to feel alone, alone!
                     
                     
                        "But that dearest life—oh, yes, it was needed!
                        God gives me to bear.
                        It was Freedom's call that was heard and heeded:
                        And now he is there—up there!
                     
                     
                        "The great and good of the ages are round him:
                        He would not be here.
                        Yet fondly he looks on the love that bound him,
                        And is near me, very near!

                        One Will: it is gentle and just."
