               NEW YEAR'S ADDRESS.
               BY MRS. A. M. EDMOND.
               
                  I COME, I come with the glad New Year,
                  With the grateful wish and the word of cheer,
                  For the gentle friends that have on me smiled,
                  From the Eastern coast to the Western wild.
                  I come with hopes of a brighter day,
                  With winning words to the pleasant way,
                  Where wisdom beckons the steps of youth,
                  To the shining paths of heavenly truth,
                  And the precious lambs of the flock are told,
                  The way that leads to the Saviour's fold.
               
               
                  I come to the mother whose anxious eye,
                  Looks o'er life's sea where her treasures lie,
                  Now calm, now safe, on the waves so mild,
                  The morrow may lash to a tempest wild,
                  And the idol bark that left the shore,
                  In the pride of hope, may return no more.
                  I come with a voice of an earnest heart,
                  To warn of the rocks where the billows part,
                  To point the way to the port of peace,
                  Where the loved may meet when the voyage shall cease.
               
               
                  I come to the mourner that sits alone,
                  In the nest of the cherish'd nursling flown,
                  In the home where the toys on the echoing floor,
                  Broken and scatter'd, are prized no more,
                  So treasured once by the tiny hand,
                  That folded lies in the silent land.
                  
                  I come with the voice of heavenly cheer,
                  To whisper within her sorrowing ear,
                  "What God hath taken, He will restore,
                  Not lost, not lost, it hath gone before."
               
               
                  I come, I come with the glad New Year,
                  O welcome me to your friendship dear.
                  O give me room by the social hearth,
                  Where the holy joys of home have birth,
                  Let me come with love that shall ne'er grow cold,
                  As comes a friend that is prized if old.
                  Let me whisper of help from the Lord above
                  To the toiling heart in its work of love,
                  And point to the peace and bliss of heaven,
                  The crown to the faithful mother given,
                  Shining with jewels forever fair,
                  She won to the skies by her holy care.
               
            
            
               I WISH YOU A HAPPY NEW YEAR.
               THIS, truly, is an auspicious day. The first breath of the morning is freighted
                  with wishes for the richest blessing that can come to the human soul. HAPPY NEW
                  YEAR. It is whispered in the bedchamber, as the eyes of its occupants first greet
                  its opening light, and bursts into a song as parents and children gather around
                  the domestic board. It is echoed from friend to friend, from satcheled school-boy
                  to the hoary head, from the grave and the gay, from the rich and the poor, till
                  the congratulations rise from the Christian world, in one continued invocation for
                  happiness to crown the new year.
               It is a beautiful custom. The sentiment expressed in these simple words is so
                  kind; and their combination so appropriate to every relation and condition.
                  Playmates may wish each other "A Merry Christmas," and so may those whose object
                  and enjoyments are merry-making and jollity; but it scarcely seems suitable for a
                  child to greet his parents with the expression, much less his venerable
                  grandparent, who is bowed by age and infirmity—or the man of God, who every
                  sabbath stands in that sacred place, the pulpit, and teaches the people to "live
                  soberly and righteously:"—and oh! how discordant "I wish you a merry Christmas!"
                  falls on the ears of those who are weeping over buried joys; or those who have no
                  comforts, and certainly no sources of merriment! But, "I wish you a Happy New Year," flows like music from childhood's lip, full of kindness and
                  respect for all classes. It is simple, dignified, and refined, and may
                  appropriately be uttered under all circumstances. Whatever have been the cares,
                  the sorrows, the privations, the follies, the sins of the old year, it is the
                  desire expressed, that they may not come into the new.
               Yet how little is the sum of happiness increased by these wishes! they are as a
                  breath of kindness, a floating bubble which soon disappears;—and why? Because they
                  are heartless, and are followed by no efforts for the real happiness of the
                  recipients.
               Do fathers and mothers wish their children a happy new year? Then let them seek to
                  open before them all the sources of true happiness; by the cultivation of their
                  minds and moral feelings; by reproving their faults, restraining their
                  waywardness; forming in them habits of industry, of economy, of benevolence and
                  self-control; and by making home the pleasantest, most alluring spot on earth.
                  This done, it will be a happy new year to them.
               Do children greet their parents with "A Happy New Year!" Father!—Mother? Let them
                  remember that their conduct will make, by far the largest amount in the happiness
                  or misery of their parents. Parents have little of life, but in their children.
                  Oh! could the wayward child—the reckless votaries of pleasure or of sin, feel but
                  one throb of the anguish of the father's and the mother's hearts, which the
                  present holiday amusements and revels cause, it would stay their mad career, and
                  be the commencement of a new year, and a new life of hope and happiness to
                  each.
               Do brothers and sisters wish each other a "Happy New Year!" and immediately
                  disagree about trifles—speak unkindly, and make no sacrifices for each other's
                  comfort and pleasure? If so, the new year will bring them no joy.
               Does the husband greet the wife with the cheering "Happy New Year!" accompanied,
                  perhaps, by some rare gift, a gilded
                  book, or some ornament for her person or parlor; and then turn to seek his
                  enjoyments, and spend his hours of leisure with associates who set at defiance
                  domestic peace, and estrange the heart from its obligations to wife and children,
                  and home? Honeyed words, and ardently expressed congratulations will bring no
                  permanent happiness to her heart, if indifference or partial neglect characterize
                  his course of action. The new year will only bring new grief, and
                  trace deeper the lines of sadness over the face, which the smile of confiding
                  love, and the rose-tints of youth, made so charming to his eyes.
               And then is there the wife, who, after uttering with seeming sincerity this
                  kindest wish, and surprising her husband with a token of affectionate sympathy, it
                  may be a tastefully wrought dressing gown, an elegant pair of slippers, a
                  beautiful watch case, and the bestowal of a few extra attentions and smiles for
                  the day, thinks she has discharged her duty toward the realization of her
                  expressed desires? Does she imagine that these will purchase the indulgence of
                  fretfulness, ill-humor, complainings, sharp retorts, and a carelessness and
                  disregard of his interests and happiness? Be assured, oh wife! that the year will
                  pass with leaden tread, leaving a weight on thy spirit, and crushing every rising
                  hope and aspiration.
               Do we wish the aged, the laborer, the wayfarer, "a happy new year?" Let sincerity
                  be its accompaniment, and respectful kindness and benevolence, mark all our future
                  conduct.
               The New Year! God has made us, to a great extent, the almoners of its happiness to
                  ourselves and the circle in which we move:—for if we scatter blessings 
                     arounds
                     around
                   us, they will surely reflect their image on our own spirits.
               
                  Then, go forth, and in the soil of human hearts,
                  Sow with a liberal hand the seeds of truth, and love,
                  And charity. They shall not perish, for they grew
                  On heavenly trees; but anon, when spring time comes
                  They'll greet thine eye with living shoots; and along
                  Thy summer path they'll shed the grateful fragrance
                  Of their flowers; and in thy sere and yellow autumn,
                  Thou may'st fill thy hands with fruit, and shout
                  The full harvest of thy smiles and deeds!
               
               
                  MRS. M. G. CLARKE.
               
            
            
               WAY MARKS TO HONOR; OR WORDS TO YOUNG MEN.
               BY REV. H. C. FISH.
               
                  THE Scriptures no where discountenance self-respect, nor the desire to be
                     respected by others. When one loses a respect for himself his
                     condition is indeed deplorable, he is already on the way to the lowest point of
                     degradation. And unless one desire to enjoy the respect of others, he is nearly
                     in the same condition. "I don't care what men think of me," is an
                     ominous remark from any one.
                  When he can really cast off all regard for the esteem of mankind, he has lost
                     one of the most wholesome restraints from vice, and an important stimulus to
                     the practice of virtue. I do not mean by this to minister to an unlawful
                     ambition. The love of applause, and a thirst for honor, has been the ruin of
                     not a few. Thousands in courting fame have been wedded to eternal
                        disgrace. In these instances, a principle implanted in us by
                     our Maker has become perverted. That which was designed for good, has been
                     abused and made the means of evil.
                  
                     Ambition, in the sense of a wish to deserve well of our fellowmen,
                     is a virtue, and not a vice. It is however like anger, and many other passions,
                     oftentimes sadly prostituted; and thus a virtuous principle becomes vicious.
                     While therefore, I would not be thought to commend a spirit of mere sordid
                     ambition, and a time serving policy to secure the honors or adulations of men,
                     nor foster a thirst to stand on the pinnacle of mere human glory, I would
                     recommend that you, young friends, desire and seek to
                        deserve the esteem and respect of all—that you imbibe such
                     principles, and lead such a life as to merit the honors bestowed
                     on men of real worth. It is in this sense that I use the term
                        honor. I accept Plutarch's definition. "True honor and
                     distinction" says he, "consist in the sincere esteem and affection of the
                     people, founded on real merit and
                     effectual services." You should aim at this. It is commendable in every one to
                     desire to be beloved, respected, and honored of mankind. He who desires it,
                     will seek to render himself worthy of it. And there are certain features of
                     character and life which ensure it to those who possess them. Proceed with me
                     then, to consider some of the WAY-MARKS TO HONOR.
                  1st. Let your aim in life be one of an elevated character. Determine to do
                     something worthy of your noble nature. Set up before you a high standard to
                     which it shall be your constant endeavor to attain. If you will analyze the
                     character of the men who have filled a large place in the world's eye, you will
                     find that it was some exalted purpose, some eminent
                        point of attainment, that made them what they were. This
                     was the case with Cæsar, who figured so largely in Roman history. During one of
                     his journeys in Spain he came upon a statue of Alexander the Great, that
                     adorned an edifice in the city of the present Cadiz. He stood before that
                     statue and remembered that Alexander, though he died at the age of thirty, had
                     made himself master of the world. He reflected also that he himself was already
                     thirty-five, and that though he had lived five years longer than Alexander, he
                     was yet the second in a single province. He felt himself rebuked.
                     His ambition was aroused, and he there became so fired with his zeal for glory
                     that before his time expired, he returned to Rome fully bent on acquiring
                     power. It is probable that the standard of greatness which he then determined
                     to reach, and which was as high as that to which Alexander had attained, more
                     than anything else made Cæsar what he at length became. But for this elevated
                     aim he might have ever remained but second in power, and that in but a
                     province.
                  Cicero might also be mentioned, as another character illustrating our remark.
                     One has doubtless testified truly of him when he says, "it was the grand
                     conception of eloquence which perpetually revolved in his mind. That idea of
                        aliquid immensum infinitumque—of something
                        immense and noble, which always haunted his thoughts, that drew
                     forth those splendid displays of genius which the world continues to admire,
                     but cannot rival."
                  The same was true of the Grecian orator. Had not Demosthenes aimed to be
                     nothing less than Callistratus, by whose eloquence quence he was so much
                     effected, he had not attained to his exalted eminence. Lord Nelson testifies
                     that there was a time in his youthful days when he was on the point of yielding
                     to despondency. "I felt impressed," said he, "with the thought that I should
                     never rise in my profession. At length a sudden glow of patriotism was kindled
                     in my bosom, and presented my king and my country as my patron. Well then, I
                     exclaimed, I will be a hero." From that time a radiant orb, as he expressed it,
                     was suspended before his mind's eye, which urged him on to honor and renown!
                     Here was the secret of his greatness.
                  It is told of Thorwaldsen, the great Danish sculptor, when found by a friend in
                     a state of despondency he pointed to his statue of Christ and exclaimed, "that
                     his genius was decaying, as it was the first work he had felt satisfied with,
                     nor should he ever again have a great idea." It was the first work he
                        ever felt satisfied with. He was satisfied with
                        it. He had reached his highest conception. He might well fear
                     that his faculties were decaying. His "great idea" being wanting, he well knew
                     he could no longer rise. Without a "great idea," many a bright name had never
                     shone forth from the dim past.
                  
                     
                        Visions of an untold glory
                        Milton saw in his eclipse.
                        
                        Holier Christs and veiled Madonnas
                        Painted were on Raphael's soul;
                        Melodies he could not utter,
                        O'er Beethoven's ear would roll.
                     
                  
                  When John C. Calhoun was in college, a classmate expressed his surprise that he
                     should be found so ardently poring over "Malthus and Smith's Wealth of
                     Nations," which he alleged would be of no use to him unless a member of
                     Congress, which station he could not expect to attain to for the next twenty
                     years.
                  "Twenty years! Twenty years!" returned he. "Why my friend if I did not believe
                     that before ten years have passed away, I should be in Congress, I pledge you
                     my word I would leave college this moment." In eight years he was there. That
                     lofty purpose—that high mark of attainment—it was that led him onward and
                     upward to his enviable distinction.
                  
                  We perceive then that it is an elevated aim that, under God, renders one truly
                     great. It is true of Christians, statesmen, scholars, and all classes of
                     men.
                  Let me urge upon you, then, my young friends, the importance of forming to
                     yourselves a high standard of excellence and real greatness. It is for want of
                     this that thousands are almost cyphers in society. They never expect to be
                     anything—they have no idea of rising higher than their fathers or neighbors,
                     and of course remain on the same level. I would have you, instead of this,
                     place before you characters of real distinction, and keep your eye upon them
                     until you are inspirited by their example, and impelled to press with
                     earnestness to at least the point of eminence they attained. Let there be in
                     your breasts a commanding purpose, a fixed determination to be truly great
                     because of real attainments. I would not have you aspire to be heroes, but
                        men, men worthy of your noble natures and exalted privileges.
                     The language of the venerable Dr. Nott, President of Union College, when once
                     addressing his students, is much in point on this subject. "I have been young,
                     and am now old; and in review of the past, and the prospect of the future, I
                     declare unto you, beloved pupils, were it permitted me to live my life over
                     again, I would, from the very outset, live better. Yes, from the outset, I
                     would frown upon vice, I would favor virtue; and lend my influence to advance
                     whatever would exalt and adorn human nature, alleviate human misery and
                     contribute to render the world I live in, like the Heaven to which I aspire,
                     the abode of innocence and felicity. Yes, though I were to exist no longer than
                     the ephemera that sport away their hour in the sunbeams of the morning; even
                     during that brief period, I would rather soar with the eagle, and leave the
                     record of my flight and my fall among the stars, than creep the earth and lick
                     the dust with the reptile, and having done so, bed my body with my memory in
                     the gutter."
                  Be your resolve, young friends, in keeping with this sentiment, without this
                     lofty purpose, this firm 
                        determinantion
                        determination
                      to do something, and be somebody, because
                     of a well spent life, you may abandon the hope of real greatness, and be
                     content with the expectation of being but little known and esteemed in life,
                     and soon forgotten when life shall end.
                  2. Closely connected with this, and not less important, is
                        self-independence and perseverance.
                  Most young men have difficulties to contend with in rising to any higher sphere
                     of influence than that which parents or guardians have assigned them, and that
                     which is reached by most of those around them. Many are apprenticed early in
                     life, so that their time is not their own; many are poor, and almost all, if
                     they mean to be great in service to the world, have before them numerous and
                     serious obstacles to overcome.
                  Let me say, then, that these difficulties will best enhance the merit of
                     success, and that they are necessary to real greatness of character. If wisely
                     improved and resolutely grappled with, they will become the architects of your
                     celebrity. Your conflicts with difficulties are the exercises of the moral
                     gymnasium, which develop and invigorate the moral and intellectual energies.
                     Unless a man be thrown upon his own resources in his youth, he will rarely put
                     forth the effort necessary to real greatness. Of what value are the brittle
                     willows that grow by the side of the meadow brook? They have too many
                     counterparts in the saplings of our family circle!
                  Give me the oak that, "springing from the hardy soil, amid the clefts of the
                     rock, and battling with the storms, swells into giant proportions that defy the
                     lightning and the cloud." Most men of eminence are grown under such
                     circumstances as those of which I speak. They are seldom reared in the lap of
                     luxury. Socrates, in early life, was entirely destitute of property, and once
                     might have been heard saying in an assembly of friends, "If I had money I
                     should buy me a cloak." Mr. Crabbe, of Maryland, once said to a young friend,
                     "you will have a large fortune, and I am sorry for it, as it will be the
                     spoiling of a good lawyer." "You may take" says he, "the whole population of
                     the state, and select from it the fifty men who are most distinguished for
                     talents, or any description of public usefulness, and I will answer for it,
                     they are all, every one of them, men who began in the world without a
                     dollar."
                  I doubt not that his remarks as to that state would apply generally. Our
                     greatest men are self-made men. One of our strongest and best men,
                     member of a late Presidential Cabinet, remarked marked not long ago, concerning a former
                     President of the college in Vermont, where he graduated; "I never heard him
                     utter what seemed to me a harsh reproof but once, and that was when he directed
                     me never to appear again in the recitation room without shoes. The
                     harshness of the remark sprung from the fact that I had no
                        shoes. I procured some, however, and for the sake of economy,
                     carried them in my hand to the door of the recitation room and
                     then put them on." From extreme poverty, he has arisen to honor, where he stood
                     not "before mean men." Powers, the celebrated sculptor, once said, when
                     speaking of the expense of supporting his family. "To tell the truth, however,
                     family and poverty have done more to support me, than I have to support them.
                     They have compelled me to make exertions that I hardly thought myself capable
                     of; and often, when on the eve of despairing, they have forced me, like a
                     coward in a corner, to fight like a hero." Franklin and Jefferson and others,
                     might also be instanced in our country's history, but it is needless. The same
                     has been found true in other countries. Columbus was a weaver. Sixtus V. was
                     employed in herding swine. Ferguson and Burns were ploughmen. Æsop was a slave.
                     Hogarth an engraver on pewter pots. Ben Jonson was a bricklayer. Akenside was
                     the son of a butcher; so was Wolsey. Halley was the son of a soap-boiler.
                     Belzoni the son of a barber. Blackstone and Southey were the sons of linen
                     drapers. Crabbe a fisherman's son. Keats the son of a livery stable keeper.
                     Buchanan was a farmer. Captain Cook began his career as a cabin boy. Luther
                     might have been once heard, morning after morning, passing through the streets
                     of the city where he then lived, singing his familiar songs to procure a few
                     pennies or a loaf of bread. Bowdwitch studied mathematics on shipboard, in
                     hours snatched from service. Ferguson first studied astronomy while tending
                     sheep in Scotland, lying on his back, and mapping out the heavens, by means of
                     a string with beads upon it. Arkwright was a barber till thirty years of age,
                     and Burritt, in our own New England, who can read fifty languages, was an
                     apprenticed blacksmith, at which business he has always worked. Goldsmith was
                     once so pressed for means when in college, that he sold out all his books to
                     pay expenses, and wandered about for days, half alive and half starved upon his
                     last shilling. Long afterward a merry tune upon his flute was his resort to
                     procure a supper and a night's lodging. He now lies in the Poet's Corner in
                     Westminster Abbey. John Foster labored to procure knowledge, and became
                     eminent, under the most depressing circumstances. He was not able to meet his
                     expenses at an insignificant academy, but by laboring at his trade much of his
                     time, and even then on the most niggardly scale. With similar difficulties, or
                     those of a different character, I repeat it, most of the noted characters in
                     every country, were, in early life, compelled to contend.
                  Be not discouraged, then, ye who must needs overcome serious difficulties in
                     order to become prepared to exert an honorable influence in the world. There is
                     no lack of illustrious characters that have had to do the same. Be brave, then,
                     be self-dependent, grapple manfully with opposing influences, and
                     success is certain.
               
               
                  WAY MARKS TO HONOR.
                  CHAPTER II.
                  ANOTHER essential pre-requisite, is decision of character, or fixedness
                        of principles.
                  For want of this, whole multitudes are ruined. No one destitute of it can
                     attain to eminence. The world is full of temptations, and the flesh, and the
                     great enemy of mankind, are leagued to render man belittled and besotted by
                     causing him to indulge in practices forbidden alike by the word of God, and the
                     laws of our nature. Hence the need of
                     cultivating established rules or principles of life, from which we will not
                     depart. It was this which saved Joseph in Egypt when tempted by an infamous
                     character to do evil. He replied nay, how can I do this wicked
                     thing? and fled as for his life from the tempter. But for this he had not
                     reached the glory to which he afterwards was exalted. It was decision of
                     character, too, that makes the name of Daniel shine out so conspicuous in the
                     holy writings. Though in the very hot-bed of vice, in a heathen land; though
                     threatened with death in a den of lions, he swerved not an hair's
                     breadth from the rule of duty he had resolved to follow. He still entered his
                     house, raised his window toward Jerusalem and prayed, as always, three times a
                     day, though forbidden to pray to the King of heaven. God delivered him, not
                     only, but both God and men, even his enemies, honored him.
                  You will find this same firmness of character necessary, oftentimes, in life,
                     and for want of it you may have already suffered much injury.
                  My advice then is, go to the word of God, and learn what is right, what is
                     duty, what are the laws of God which govern us, and when you have ascertained
                     them, abide by them with an undying determination. Do what is
                     right, let the consequences be what they may. Of what worth in society is the
                     man destitute of this decision of purpose and character?
                  He is driven about by every wind that may chance to blow. He is unfit for
                     business, he cannot succeed in it because too vacillating; he is unfit for
                     service in his country's cause, he cannot be depended upon, and besides this he
                     is so much the sport of circumstances, the easy prey of every tempter, that he
                     is not, nor can he be himself happy and contented with life. He is a poor,
                     imbecile, pitiable, contemptible creature. And all because he has not firmness
                     of principle. Let him serve, at least, one good purpose, let him
                     admonish and warn you of such fatal indecision.
                  I would advise you to read Foster on Decision of Character, and other works of
                     like nature, as means of incitement and instruction in acquiring this feature
                     of character. Without this, depend upon it, you will live to little purpose;
                     your attainments will be at best but moderate, and even these may not save you
                     from infamy. Let your ways then be established. Heed the
                     admonition of one of years and experience. The wind and waves may beat against
                     a rock planted in a troubled sea, but it remains unmoved. Be you like that
                     rock, ye young.
                  Vice may entice, and the song and the cup may invite. Beware; stand firmly at
                     your post. Let your principles shine forth unobscured. There is glory in the
                     thought that you have resisted temptation and conquered.
                  I have no hope of eminence in attainments on the part of any unstable, double
                     minded, unprincipled youth. A hundred chances to one that he will make
                     shipwreck somewhere in his passage o'er the treacherous sea of life. But
                     present to me one of fixed principles of action, of unbending purpose to adhere
                     to such rules of life as wisdom dictates, one 
                        
                           "Who does as reason, not as fancy bids;
                           Who hears temptation sing, and yet turns not
                           Aside; sees sin bedeck her flowery bed,
                           And yet will not go up; feels at his heart
                           The sword unsheathed, yet will not sell the truth;
                           Who, finally, in strong integrity
                           Of soul, 'midst want, or riches, or disgrace,
                           Uplifted calmly sits, and hears the waves
                           Of stormy folly breaking at his feet,"
                        
                     
                  
                  Show me such an one and you have found the youth that will yet be
                     honored and esteemed, be his condition now what it may.
                  
                     Industry is another way mark to true honor.
                  It is a sad misconception of things, that which is sometimes entertained by the
                     young, that it is degrading to labor—that it is
                     inconsistent with a life of gentility and refinement to have any particular
                     employment at which they are found working; that it is disgraceful
                     to bear the marks of hardy toil.
                  O for the return of the simplicity of ancient times! when a Rebecca and a
                     Rachel, a David and Paul, wrought with their own hands—when a Homer would sing
                     of princesses who drew forth water from the springs and washed the linen of
                     their respective families—when the sisters of the greatest monarch and
                     conqueror the world ever saw, and daughters of the most remarkable queen known in other days, made with their
                     own fingers the garments with which their brother, the world's conqueror, was
                     attired, and when princesses themselves thought it no ignominy to descend from
                     the throne and assist in domestic duties! Alas! that it is no longer the eulogy
                     of woman that "she layeth her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the
                     distaff," that "she looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not
                     the bread of idleness," and that it has become disreputable in the esteem of
                     some to live in keeping with the inspired injunction, "this we command you,
                     that if any would not work neither should he eat," and that so "with quietness
                     they work and eat their own bread." It is well, however, that a correct
                     sentiment upon this subject prevails so generally as it does; and that industry
                     is being more and more honored by the great and good.
                  An active life, of some kind, leads to honor; because this is necessary to the
                     full development of one's mental and physical energies, as there must be some
                     leading, commanding object of interest, to arouse, stimulate and ennoble the
                     powers of man. I can heartily endorse the language of one who said, "I would
                     rather have a child of mine begin life with nothing to rely upon but his own
                     exertions, than be the heir to the richest estate in the country. Character and
                     success depend vastly more in personal 
                        affort
                        effort
                      than any external advantages. With such efforts, the humblest cannot
                     fail to rise; without such efforts, the highest cannot fail to sink."
                  And besides, industry is desirable, if for no other reason than to prevent from
                     vice. Isaac Watts never sang truer lines than these: 
                        
                           "And Satan finds some mischief still
                           For idle hands to do."
                        
                     
                  
                  Vice is almost always the sure concomitant of idleness. If one does not find
                     himself something to do, the devil will. The historian tells us, speaking of
                     Alexander's excesses, "he wanted action and motion, for he always, when
                     unemployed, lost part of the glory he had acquired in war."
                  The record of the life of this wholesale murderer proves it, and verifies the
                     remark that "the rust of idleness is far more destructive structive both to
                     soul and body, than the friction of the most intense
                     activity."
                  Would you, therefore, young friends, attain to respectability and usefulness in
                     life, be industrious, whatever your circumstances or prospects as
                     to wealth. Avoid idleness as the canker of worth, and the road to disgrace.
                  I remark, again, that habits of morality are necessary to the
                     attainment of true honor. It is, I am happy in being able to make such a
                     remark, it is becoming more and more necessary in one who is to be promoted,
                     that he respect the Bible, and our holy religion, and at least externally
                     conform to its dictates. Even one of our earliest Presidents (Jefferson) said,
                     "were I to commence my administration again with the experience I now have, the
                     first question I would ask respecting a candidate would be, does he use
                     intoxicating drinks?" So highly did he value correct morals in this respect. It
                     is related that Nicholas Biddle Esq., late president of the Bank of the United
                     States, once dismissed a clerk because he refused to write for him on the
                     Sabbath. The young man, with a mother dependent on his exertions, was thus
                     thrown out of employment, by what some would call an over nice conscience. A
                     few days after this, Mr. Biddle being requested to nominate a cashier for
                     another bank, recommended this very young man, and mentioned this incident as
                     proof of his trustworthiness. "You can trust him," said he,
                        "for he would not work for me on Sunday." Here you will
                     perceive how a man is compelled to respect correct morals, even though himself
                     does not practice them, and how sure of honor is he who does what is right.
                  I exhort you then, young friends, cultivate correct morals.
                  Be strictly honest. Some of you have the opportunity, and are
                     tempted perhaps, to take, it may be, money from the drawer of your employers,
                     (it is a desperate temptation, and ruins thousands;) or in some way to possess
                     yourselves of that to which you are not entitled. And hereafter, when you are
                     acting for yourselves, by unjust charges, or unfair dealing, you will be
                     tempted to take the advantage of others. But forget never, that
                     honesty is, on all accounts, "the best policy." "Riches got by
                     deceit," it has been said, "cheat no man so much as the getter. Riches
                        bought with guile God will pay for
                     with vengeance. Riches got by fraud are dug out of one's own heart, and destroy
                     the mine."
                  Live or die, fall or rise, be honest. If you cannot succeed in
                     business and be so, then leave your business. If you cannot be honest where you
                     are, then change your position or employment. By no means be dishonest.
                  Cultivate also, an unflinching integrity. Speak the truth, though
                     it be apparently at the greatest sacrifice.
                  
                     
                        "Dare to be true, nothing can need a lie,
                        The fault that needs it most grows tired thereby."
                     
                  
                  Besides this, maintain a strict observance of the Sabbath. It is of
                     inconceivable importance that you remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.
                     Moreover, avoid profanity, that unprofitable, heaven-daring, God-insulting
                     practice to which (I blush to say it) many young men are addicted.
                     I thank our common Maker that no man can respect himself who is
                     guilty of this wicked and foolish habit, and that even swearers
                        themselves cannot respect those who swear! Few vices are more hideous
                     and disgraceful to the character of rational beings. It insults God—it dares
                     his vengeance—it defies his law, which says—
                  "Thou shalt not take my name in vain." It is a sin against one's
                     own soul, against the laws of his being, against all the interests and social
                     relations of life.
                  There is another immoral practice to which the young, particularly young men,
                     are exposed; I mean the use of intoxicating drinks. I warn you
                     against this habit. Time was, when the use of strong drink was so universal as
                     not to detract from the respectability of those who indulged in it, in the
                     esteem of men generally. It is a bright mark of the progress of the age, that
                     this is true no longer. It is not now true that one can use strong drinks as a
                     beverage, without tarnishing his character. The young man who does it, is
                     virtually excluded from the purest and best of society, and with most who seek
                     men for employment in office, as it was with Jefferson, the question is,
                        "does he use strong drink?" An answer in the affirmative is, in
                     the main, of itself, considered a sufficient cause for giving him the "go
                     by."
                  I know that Bacchus still has his devotees. I know that some young men there
                     are, who are simple enough to suppose that it is "fashionable,"
                     and the mark of a "gentleman" to strut before a bar of splendid
                     decanters, and call for the glass of sparkling poison. But let him go with his
                     blood-shot eyes and tainted breath into the presence of the virtuous of the
                     gentler sex—let him seek employment in the first mercantile or other houses—let
                     him aspire to the offices and honors of the town, county, or state, and he will
                     find that the odds are fearfully against him. What lady would choose him for a
                     companion? what house would have a drinking clerk? what man would cheerfully
                     promote him to offices of honorable distinction? And let me here remark that
                     "wine is a mocker," as saith the Scriptures. It is deceptive. You do not
                        intend to be ruined by it, it does not threaten you with
                     injury, it is inviting. But the more important because of this, is entire
                        abstinence. It is the only safe course. To touch it at all, is
                     playing with the tempter. To use it now, when young, even occasionally, and
                     moderately, is almost the certain pledge of a drunkard in after
                        life. Would you preserve the immortal mind "clear and
                     unclogged"—would you breathe the pure air of freedom, and maintain the dignity
                     of a being formed in God's own image"—would you seek to enjoy the respect and
                     approval of the wise and the good, dash from your lips, if it be even there,
                     the cup whose mingled ingredients are wormwood and gall, and poison and death.
                     And if these motives of honor and self-respect be not sufficient, O, ye young,
                     then turn ye to the picture of the inebriate which the pencil of heaven hath
                     sketched, in the 23d chapter of Proverbs, and by the terrors of this miserable
                     and wicked creature, flee even the slightest intermeddling with this great
                     destroyer.
                  Yea, my young friends, I most earnestly entreat of you, that you will abstain
                        wholly from that which intoxicates. And be assured that each of
                     these habits of morality, which I have mentioned, honesty, veracity, chastity
                     of speech and temperance, are necessary features in a character of
                     acknowledged, eminent respectability. The vicious cannot attain to greatness.
                     In Long-fellow's beautiful lines—
                     
                        
                           "The low desire—the base design,
                           That makes another's virtues less;
                           The revel of the giddy wine,
                           And all occasions of excess;
                        
                        
                           All thoughts of ill—all evil deeds
                           That have their root in thoughts of ill;
                           Whatever hinders or impedes
                           The action of the nobler will;
                        
                        
                           All these must first be trampled down
                           Beneath our feet, if we would gain
                           In the bright fields of fair renown
                           The right of eminent domain."
                        
                     
                  
                  And finally, I observe, would you attain to true honor, serve the
                        generation in which you live, and live for generations yet to come.
                     In other words, usefulness is a pre-requisite to true honor. If
                     you serve your fellow men, they will honor you. A life of real usefulness is
                        always one of respect, even in the eyes of the worst of men.
                     More than this, in loving and doing good to your race, God will honor you.
                     Doing it with right motives, is serving God, and he hath said, "he that serveth
                     me will I honor," and the "righteous shall be had in everlasting
                     remembrance."
                  Begin then when young to be useful—seek out ways now in which you may do good,
                     and make it the great object of life to exalt and bless your fellow man.
                  Of Sir Christopher Wren, it is inscribed in St. Paul's, in London, "Si monumentum requiris, circumspice." "If you
                     inquire for his monument, look about you." Aspire to such an inscription at
                     your departure. Leave everywhere about you the monuments of your
                     usefulness, the sure pledges of a well spent life.
                  Remember that— 
                        
                           "We live in deeds, not years; in thought, not breath;
                           In feelings, not in figures on the dial.
                           We should count time by heart-throbs when they beat
                           For man, for God, for duty. He most lives
                           Who thinks most, feels noblest, acts the best."
                        
                     
                  
                  These, respected young friends, are the prominent way marks that I
                     would set along beside the road of true honor, or as already
                     defined, the sincere esteem and affection of the people, founded on real merit
                     and effectual services.
                  You will not fail then, to take note of these inscriptions that are to direct
                     you in the way of its attainments. Here you will perceive as inscribed—an
                        elevated aim—there self-dependence and
                        perseverance—there fixedness of principles—there
                        sound morals—and farther on, eminent
                     usefulness.
                  Possessing such a character, and leading such a life, you will not, it is true,
                     be exempt from the malice and envy, and perhaps the ill-treatment of the
                     wicked; as they that will do good must suffer persecution, but their malicious
                     endeavors will but brighten, instead of dim your shining virtues." Wither's
                     poem, illustrated by an emblem representing a flame upon a mountain, driven to
                     and fro by tempestuous winds, yet continually gathering strength and
                     brightness, will be applicable to you.
                  
                     
                        "Thus fares the man whom virtue, beacon-like,
                        Hath fixed upon the hills of eminence.
                        At him the tempests of mad envy strike;
                        And rage against his piles of innocence;
                        But still the more they wrong him, and the more
                        They seek to keep his worth from being known,
                        They daily make it greater than before,
                        And cause his fame the farther to be blown.
                        Discourage not thyself, but stand the shocks
                        Of wrath and fury. Let them snarl and bite,
                        Pursue thee with detraction, slander, mocks,
                        And all the venomed engines of despite.
                        Thou art above their malice, and the blaze
                        Of thy celestial fire shall shine so clear,
                        That their besotted souls thou shalt amaze,
                        And make thy splendors to their shame appear."
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               WAYSIDE FLOWERS.
               
                  
                     "And so I gather encouragement as I pass along, picking a few flowers here
                        and there by the way-side, to cheer me in my path."
                  
               
               
                  OH! gather the flowers by the wayside,
                  Oh! gather the fresh springing flowers;
                  They will cheer thee on in thy pathway,
                  They will brighten thy saddest hours.
               
               
                  There are thorns in a mother's pathway,
                  And her heart may be bleeding and torn,
                  But oh! let her gather the flowers
                  Of childhood's dewy morn.
               
               
                  They are springing so fresh and fragrant,
                  Wherever our footsteps rove,
                  They are filling the heart of the mother,
                  With a sweeter and holier love.
               
               
                  Oh! list to the guileless prattle
                  Of the baby upon thy knee;
                  The flowers will spring up by the wayside,
                  And he'll be a teacher to thee.
               
               
                  He will make thy faith grow firmer,
                  He will strengthen thy hopes so dim,
                  He will bring the angels near thee,
                  If thou wilt but listen to him.
               
               
                  My path through life has been thorny,
                  With many an anxious care,
                  But all along by the wayside,
                  The flowers have been fresh and fair.
               
               
                  I have found them in early morning,
                  And at sultry noonday's heat,
                  And in the dim gray twilight,
                  They have sprung beneath my feet.
               
               
                  When my heart has been the saddest
                  They have bloom'd with the fairest light,
                  And e'en on the clouds around me
                  They have thrown a rainbow bright.
               
               
                  And I thank my Heavenly Father,
                  For these fragrant wayside flowers;
                  They have covered the thorns in my pathway,
                  They have cheered my loneliest hours.
               
               
                  Let precepts of love and kindness,
                  From the mother's lips distil;
                  Let her lead her babes to the Saviour,
                  As a mother only will.
               
               
                  And the blossoms of early devotion,
                  Will open before her eyes,
                  And these germs of faith and submission
                  Point her soul from the earth to the skies.

               PRAYER FOR THE SAILOR.
               I HAD rather live on poor and scanty fare, and shelter my head under the meanest
                  roof that ever covered a child of God, than be denied the privilege of praying for
                  the sailor. Let me say why:
               1. My father was a sailor.
               I can remember, as though it were yesterday, how he used to go away. I was a
                  little girl then. The little prayer mother taught me to say for him I shall never
                  forget; nor how glad we were, Rover and all, to see him come home. One night there
                  was a dreadful storm. Mother had been telling us some days that he would come
                  to-morrow. That night she came and spread another blanket over me, and I don't
                  know how many times she came and tucked the clothes around me; and I asked her
                  what was the matter. All she could say was, "Your poor father!" Two days after, I
                  was told the vessel was strewed on the beach. Nine bodies were found; but father
                  never came home.
               2. My husband is a sailor.
               
               The minister on our wedding day said we should have some bitter with the sweet. He
                  told us, too, that prayer could sweeten the waters of Marah. And just so I have
                  found it. Sometimes I have felt as if my poor heart would break. I have gone to my
                  neighbors, and come home sighing. But when I have gone to God, and told him my
                  troubles; when I have committed my husband to his care; when I have believingly
                  said, O, thou who didst still the winds and waves of the sea of Galilee, and
                  protect the loved ones there, do thou keep and bring my beloved one to the desired
                  haven—then have I found comfort come down like sunlight from heaven; then have I
                  found 
                     
                        "There is a home for weary souls,
                        By sin and sorrow driven."
                     
                   Oh, how can I forego the comfort and safety for myself and mine found at the
                  mercy-seat! Besides,
               3. My son is a sailor.
               This is another link which binds me to a throne of grace, and with more than cable
                  strength, keeps me there to plead for those exposed to perils in the sea. I go
                  there oftener and stay longer than formerly. At first I adopted the resolution of
                  David, "Morning, evening, and noon will I pray;" but as my treasures afloat
                  increase, my anxieties for their safety increase; so that many times in a day I
                  find myself looking up to my Heavenly Father. Sometimes I have fancied myself like
                  Hagar in the wilderness of Beersheba, the bottle of water spent, and the son cast
                  under one of the shrubs to die. And then, like her, I have lifted up my voice and
                  wept. But a night of sorrow has invariably been succeeded by a morning of joy; for
                  the same voice which answered Hagar out of heaven has said to me, "Fear not; for
                  God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is." Such an answer has been to my
                  spirit like the breath of morning on the meadows. My treasures are in
                  the care of Him who is faithful to his promises.
            
            
               FRANK MAYNARD; OR, AUNT MARY'S WAY OF TREATING PASSIONATE BOYS.
               "MARGARET," said Frank Maynard, as he entered the kitchen, after having been on an
                  errand, "I have something here which I want you to keep for me a while;" and he
                  began to remove some small parcels from the basket he held in his hand. "No," he
                  continued, lowering his voice, "don't say anything now, nor move the bundles;
                  there's Bertie coming," and as his brother entered the room, he sauntered to the
                  window, and looked out into the yard. Margaret wondered what master Frank could
                  have to be so sly about, but she asked no questions, and went on with her
                  ironing.
               After a while Bertie left the kitchen, and Frank hastened to remove the parcels,
                  and, from the bottom of the basket, brought forth several smooth pieces of pine
                  board, and some smooth sticks of pine, with four reels like those on which ribbon
                  is wound. "Now, Margaret," said he, "I want you to put these in some safe place,
                  where none of the children will see them, for to-morrow evening you know will be
                  the last of December, and I am going to make a little wagon of these materials,
                  for a New Year's gift to Willie. Won't Willie be pleased? He has wanted a little
                  wagon so long, to draw his playthings about in. And it will be a great deal
                  stronger than the little tin one which was bought for him at the toy-shop;
                  besides, it will hold more, and I am going to fasten on the wheels, so they will
                  not come off, as those did."
               "Indeed, an' I'll take care of them for ye, Master Frank," said Margaret, and she
                  mounted a chair, and reaching to the highest shelf of the closet, placed them out
                  of the reach of busy little fingers.
               "To-morrow evening after Willie goes to bed, and Mary and Bertie begin to study
                  their lessons, I shall come down in the
                  kitchen to put the little wagon together—it will not take long to do it, for Mr.
                  Blake, the carpenter, who gave me the boards, fitted the corners nicely for me,
                  and showed me how to fix the axles."
               Frank was a very ingenious boy, and in his spare moments his knife was in constant
                  requisition, provided a bit of soft wood could be obtained. To procure a box of
                  tools was his strongest desire, but his father was too little acquainted with him
                  to know what were his particular talents, tastes, or wishes, for he was at his
                  business from early morning until tea-time, and when he returned home tired at
                  night, he desired that the children should be kept quiet until bed-time. He wished
                  Frank to apply himself constantly to his books, and his chief ambition was to see
                  him make high attainments as a scholar. But to him Frank seemed little else than a
                  proud, fiery, impetuous boy, who desired to have his own way. His own disposition
                  was reflected in the boy with startling accuracy, and, impatient at the picture,
                  he vainly tried with stern reserve, and peremptory commands, to subdue his
                  impetuous spirit, and procure implicit and willing obedience.
               His mother, who knew that kindness would sometimes secure obedience from him, when
                  stern treatment only produced sullenness, failed in her government, by often
                  hiring and coaxing him, and shielding him from his father's merited reproofs,
                  thereby losing his respect, and weakening her own authority, when a mild firmness
                  would have secured both his obedience and love.
               All through the next day would visions of the little wagon completed, and Willie's
                  surprise and pleasure, come between Frank and his books, and when evening came, he
                  could scarcely restrain his impatience until tea was over, and Bertie and Mary
                  were at their lessons, and his father occupied with his newspaper.
               When his mother left the room with little Willie, to prepare him for bed, Frank
                  followed her to the entry, and whispering in her ear, "Please don't let the
                  children come down in the kitchen, for I am making something that I wish to keep a
                  secret," he hastened down stairs, and having his treasures brought from their
                  hiding-place, proceeded to his work.
               "Now, Margaret," said he, "if you hear any of them coming, you must tell me quick,
                  so that I can slip this out of sight."
               "That I will; but is your task learned yet, Master Frank? for your father'll be
                  askin' ye," said the girl.
               "Oh, I've only one lesson to prepare," said he, "and that I can easily do in the
                  morning. School only keeps half the day tomorrow, as it is Wednesday, you
                  know."
               The work went on merrily. Mrs. Maynard came down after Willie was safely in his
                  crib, and stopped a little while to note the progress of his work. She was pleased
                  to see how neatly he was doing it, and sympathized warmly in his anticipations of
                  Willie's delight.
               "When it is done I am going to carry it up and put it in the crib, beside Willie,"
                  said he, "so that he will see it as soon as he wakes up in the morning. And
                  mother, oh! if I could only have a box of tools for a New Year's gift! Have you
                  told father how much I want them?" he continued.
               "No, my dear," said his mother, "I do not think he would buy them for you,—indeed,
                  I know he would not, he would think it a useless expenditure, which would take
                  your attention from your books."
               "If I only had the right things, I could learn to carve beautifully, mother; and I
                  would study ten times as hard as I do now, if I were sure of having a box of
                  tools," continued Frank, earnestly.
               "Well, dear, we'll see what can be done about it," said the indulgent mother,—and
                  hearing Willie's voice, she returned again to her chamber.
               In the meantime silence reigned in the parlor, broken only by the ticking of the
                  little clock upon the mantel, until Bertie, looking up from his book, said, "Mary,
                  do you know where Frank is?"
               "I don't know," she answered, "he went out when mother did."
               "I'm going to see where he is," said Bertie, leaving the parlor. Frank heard him
                  coming, and slipping the little wagon into a chair, Margaret threw over it an old
                  shawl of hers, which was within reach, and when the little boy entered the room,
                  Frank was whittling a stick to a point.
               "Why don't you come up and learn your lesson, Frank," said he.
               "I'm going to learn it in the morning," he replied.
               "What are you making?" inquired Bertie.
               "Don't you see, I'm sharpening this stick; it will be like a Chinese chop-stick, I
                  expect, when it is done." Bertie went up
                  stairs again. "Frank is down in the kitchen, whittling out chopsticks," said he,
                  "and he is not going to get his lesson till morning."
               Mr. Maynard threw aside the newspaper, with a gesture of impatience. "I'll see,"
                  said he, "whether work or play is to be done first," and he proceeded to the
                  kitchen. Frank was driving a nail, and did not hear his father's step, until he
                  was looking over his shoulder. "What child's play is this for a great boy like
                  you?" said he, "whittling out toys, when you should be at your books. Have I not
                  said enough to you on this subject? Away with such nonsense!" and gathering up the
                  pieces of wood, and among them the little axles of the wagon, he threw them upon
                  the burning coals in the range.
               The crimson flush had mounted to Frank's forehead, and his heart beat violently,
                  as he attempted some explanation or rather vindication, but as he saw part of his
                  cherished work fall before the flames, the words died upon his tongue, and with
                  flashing eyes, he dashed the little wagon and the wheels furiously into the
                  fire.
               He watched the curling flames wreath around the precious fabric, and then slowly
                  gathering up his hammer and nails, he laid them away; while his father, who had
                  seen similar ebullitions of passion in his boy, stood eyeing him with scarcely
                  less of anger depicted upon his own countenance, and grasping Frank sternly by the
                  arm, forced him up stairs, into his room, and saying, "I'll settle with you, sir,
                  for this, to-morrow," he left him for the night, a prey to rage that admitted of
                  no tears.
               The sky was scarcely reddened with the first glow of dawn, when Frank was awakened
                  by his father's voice, not wishing him a "happy New Year," but calling him to
                  attend to the hitherto neglected lesson. He went down stairs, cold and
                  uncomfortable, and with the memory of last night rankling in his breast, attempted
                  to learn the lesson. He was in too sullen a humor to return the "Happy New Year,"
                  of his brother and sister, when they came down, and, indeed, it was any thing but
                  a happy new year to him. A new book each, for Bertie and Mary, lay
                  upon the table, and a toy for Willie, but nothing for himself. He well knew the
                  reason, and asked no questions.
               His father took no notice of him, except to give him a bill with directions to
                  carry it to Mr. Wilton's immediately, on his way to school, to which place he
                  escaped as soon as possible. The merriment of the boys dispelled in some measure
                  the cloud that rested upon his spirits, but in the midst of the morning
                  recitation, the thought flashed upon him sudden as a thunder-clap, that he had
                  forgotten to leave the bill at Mr. Wilton's, on his way to school. His confusion
                  caused a failure in the lesson, and he was detained at noon to recite it, after
                  which he went to Mr. Wilton's, and then walked moodily homeward.
               Turning a corner, whom should he meet but Mr. Blake, the carpenter, who had
                  interested himself so much about the little wagon. "A happy New Year to you,
                  Master Frank," said he, "how did little brother like his present?" Unlucky
                  question! The color flew to Frank's face, and as he attempted to stammer out a
                  reply, Mr. Blake perceived that something was amiss, and passed on.
               Frank came to the dinner table with a down-cast face, and a perfect tumult of
                  anger, 
                     disappoinment
                     disappointment
                   and wounded pride, raging within, which was in no way diminished by the
                  prospect of being "settled with," after dinner. He dreaded his father's inquiries
                  concerning the errand to Mr. Wilton, but not a word was said until after dinner.
                  Mr. Maynard had especially desired the bill to be left in the morning, as at
                  eleven o'clock Mr. Wilton was to start for New York, and he had been very anxious
                  to have the bill settled before his departure. As no message came from Mr. Wilton,
                  Mr. M. rightly concluded that Frank had not performed his errand punctually; and
                  highly incensed at what he considered another proof of the boy's wilfulness, he
                  rose from the table, and in a voice of sternness ordered Frank to go to his
                  room.
               He obeyed; and his father taking a slender cane from its place in the hall,
                  followed him up stairs. He was just turning the key in the chamber door, when a
                  violent ring at the door bell was followed by a message from his office boy, that
                  Mr. Wilton was at the office and desired to see him. With a hasty order to Frank
                  to remain where he was until tea time, and to Mrs. M. not to go to him, nor allow
                  the children to do so, he left the house. Mr. Wilton had been detained by pressing
                  business, and had called to settle the bill, previous to going in the
                  afternoon.
               Frank's room was comfortable, and books lay upon his table, but the conflict in his breast would not allow him
                  to read, and in a spirit of vindictive defiance, he sat uttering mental anathemas
                  upon his father.
               An hour passed and he had not stirred, when glancing into the street, he saw his
                  Aunt Mary approaching the house. Dear, kind Aunt Mary, with her sunshiny face! The
                  very sight of her softened his heart, and when, after a brief chat with Mrs.
                  Maynard, she learned that her favorite Frank was in disgrace, she ran up stairs
                  and tapped gently upon his door, he could hardly command his voice to return her
                  kind greeting.
               He knew that of all persons in the world Aunt Mary best understood him, and as she
                  sat down beside him upon the edge of his little bed, and putting her arm around
                  him, kindly inquired the cause of his troubles, the pent up torrent of feeling
                  gave way, and leaning his head upon her shoulder, he burst into a flood of tears.
                  She did not attempt to check it at once, but as his emotion subsided, she drew
                  from him a full confession.
               "I know it was wrong to get so mad, Aunt Mary," said he, but before I could even
                  tell father what I was doing, he threw part of my work in the fire, and then I
                  didn't care what I did. George Wilton's father would have inquired what it was,
                  and been interested in it, and—oh! dear, Aunt Mary, I don't believe father loves
                  me at all, he treats me as if he thought I tried to be just as bad as I
                  could!"
               "Hush! hush! my dear," said Aunt Mary, "have you given him reason to think you
                  have tried to be just as good as you could? Ought not
                  the lesson to have been learned first?"
               "Yes, but then it would have been bed-time, and I could have learned the lesson in
                  the morning, but I could not make the wagon in the morning."
               "Then, under the circumstances, would it not have been better to have told father
                  your plans, and obtained his consent?"
               "I used to ask him to let me do such things, but he would say, Nonsense! a knife
                  and a stick is all you care for—and it takes all your attention from your
                  books."
               "But, Frank, you admit that you were wrong in neglecting the lesson, and in
                  getting in such a rage, and in not charging your memory more faithfully with the
                  note?"
               "Yes, Auntie, but I should not have forgotten the note if I had not been so
                  unhappy."
               Aunt Mary felt that negotiating between father and child was a delicate business,
                  yet she did not despair of bringing about a better state of things. She had the
                  advantage of many years' experience, and had trained her own head-strong boys,
                  admirably. She knew her brother's disposition well, and saw with pain, that his
                  efforts to subdue violence by violence, were ruining the disposition of the
                  boy.
               "Frank," said she, "I think things can be much pleasanter between you and your
                  father, if you will promise me two things, which are these; to do your utmost to
                  meet your father's approbation, by studying his wishes; and, when he reproves you,
                  even if it seems harder than you deserve, to control your temper."
               "I will promise you anything, Aunt Mary, you are always so kind. I
                  wish I could be good to please you!"
               "Be good to please God, and pray for His assistance, and you will succeed in being
                  good and pleasing me," and with an affectionate kiss she left him. He spent the
                  remainder of the afternoon strengthening his good resolutions.
               When the tea hour arrived, Frank's countenance wore a gentle expression and his
                  voice was soft and mild.
               The children had retired, and Aunt Mary was considering how she could best
                  approach her brother on so personal a subject, without being obtrusive, when he
                  suddenly exclaimed—"Mary, what shall we do with our Frank? He is
                  getting perfectly unbearable! I doubt not you will say there is some defect in our
                  government, and perhaps there is, but we have no trouble comparatively with our
                  other children. Frank resents every reproof and punishment as a flagrant act of
                  injustice."
               "I think," said Aunt Mary, "he may resent the manner of the reproof which wounds
                  and irritates, when his moral sense acknowledges the justice of it. Frank is of
                  entirely a different temperament from your other children. Would it not be well
                  before administering punishment, to inquire into the reasons of the course he
                  takes, mildly point out the error, and then punish, not according to your own
                  amount of irritated feeling, but so far as you can ascertain, according to the
                  amount of his wilfulness."
               
               "In other words, you would have me stoop to inquire into my child's reasons
                     for disobeying me, as if a child could have a sufficient
                  reason for disobeying a parent," said Mr. M., a little nettled at his sister's
                  plainness.
               "Since human nature is not infallible in adults, or children," replied his sister,
                  "I do not think it will be a greater sacrifice of parental dignity to investigate
                  these things, than to forfeit your child's respect and confidence by
                  administering, even occasionally, an unjust punishment;" and she repeated what she
                  thought proper, of Frank's remarks concerning the late occurrence.
               "There is another proof of his temper," replied Mr. M., "he never told me the why
                  nor wherefore of his course—"
               "Because he had not the opportunity, before the destruction of part of his work
                  threw him in such a frenzy of passion, that he rightly termed it 'madness,'"
                  replied Aunt M., determined to urge the cause of her favorite. "To be candid with
                  you, brother," she continued, "I think if your were to allow Frank to exercise his
                  mechanical ingenuity after his appointed tasks are done, and interest yourself in
                  his little plans, assuming that he means to do well, I doubt not you will find him
                  a more dutiful son; and when he has given you cause of offence, perhaps a little
                  patient investigation will, in nine cases out of ten, show the act to have been
                  the result of boyish inadvertence, instead of deliberate wilfulness."
               "If I had any hopes of seeing him as good a boy as your Arthur, I might be induced
                  to try your suggestions," said Mr. M.
               "Do you not think," interposed Mrs. M., "that the promise of some reward, a box of
                  tools for instance, would induce him to govern his temper better?"
               "Very likely," said Aunt Mary, with a smile; "almost any child can be
                     hired to be good; but the goodness that is obtained by bribes,
                  usually fails when the object is attained. And the practice of offering rewards
                  will soon effectually destroy all voluntary obedience, and love of right, because
                     it is right.'
               The conversation continued much longer, and at its close Mr. M. found himself
                  secretly resolving to try his sister's plans; and Aunt Mary had another talk with
                  Frank, before she left, in which he voluntarily renewed his promises.
               Two months passed by. Mr. Maynard was surprised at the improvement in his boy; and
                  Frank was equally surprised at the kind consideration and interest evinced by his
                  father. On the morning of his tenth birth-day, he found in his room a beautiful
                  box of tools, accompanied by an affectionate note from Aunt Mary.
               "Dear, good Aunt Mary," he exclaimed, as he read the note, "if I am a better and
                  happier boy than I was, I owe it all to you!"
            
            
               THE SALE OF THE PET LAMB.
               BY MRS. M. ST. LEON LOUD.
               
                  OH! say not childhood's griefs are light,
                  Its tears as morning dew-drops fleeting;
                  Say not its sky is always bright,
                  With clouds its sunshine never meeting;
                  That sometimes it hath heavy woe,
                  Those little troubled faces show.
               
               
                  What! sell their lamb, their pride—their joy—
                  Their gentle playmate of a summer?
                  To see him bound by that rude boy,
                  What child could bear without a murmur?
                  Oh! then the bitter grief to part,
                  First fell upon each tender heart.
               
               
                  Years will pass by, and in their home
                  Full many a cherish'd tie be broken;
                  Sorrow and tears, and heart-break come,
                  When last farewells are sadly spoken,
                  Yet can life's billows ne'er o'erflow
                  The memory of that earliest woe.
               
               
                  Then say not children's griefs are light,
                  A lamb—a bird—a flower once cherish'd,
                  Make spring-time life so warm and bright
                  They can but weep when all have perish'd;
                  But soothe with gentle words the heart,
                  That mourns from aught beloved to part.
               
            
            
               
               THE POSITION AND WORK OF WOMAN.
               BY REV. I. BEVAN.
               GOD has assigned to everything in the universe its place, and to everything in
                  that place its beauty or utility, or both. This we find to be true in the world of
                  matter, and no less so in the world of mind. And as in the physical and mental
                  constitution of things, so is it in the social. Thus did the Creator design the
                  existence and presence of order, and that from that order should radiate all
                  possible forms of beauty, and that in the continuance of that order should be
                  found all possible good. It is only as things are found to harmonize with this,
                  the first great design of God, that they prove to us of true value, and is their
                  real excellence made manifest. It is thus only that they are found in their true
                  and natural positions, and are appropriated to their legitimate uses. Thus and to
                  that extent do they answer the end of their creation.
               In our system the sun has his place. So has our earth, and every other planet that
                  with never-failing loyalty and beautiful allegiance acknowledges the sun as its
                  liege sovereign and centre. Each body hath its own place, its pathway, its work to
                  do, and end to accomplish. Thus do all combine in sweet and ceaseless harmony to
                  present us with a complete and perfect system of surpassing beauty, grandeur and
                  utility.
               In our own physical constitution we find a necessity for the same consistent and
                  symmetrical development. The human form presents us with an adaptation for varied
                  and extensive utility when it is perfect in all its parts; no member nor organ
                  wanting, and every one in its own appropriate place. It presents us with at image
                  of the beautiful when all the parts are symmetrical and perfect in their relations
                  to each other, and the whole is cast in an exquisite mould.
               The internal or mental possesses the same adaptation, and is invested with the
                  same beauty, when we can easily detect the obvious vious presence of each faculty
                  of the soul, and all those faculties are well balanced, working with perfect
                  regularity and order in their necessary relations to, and dependence upon each
                  other.
               In each case we have suggested to our minds the conception of a piece of mechanism
                  perfect in each of its parts; complete in its adjustment and correspondence;
                  harmonious and efficient in all its working as a whole.
               All this may serve as an illustration of what is found to be true in the social
                  relations of man. In all these relations God has wisely and benevolently assigned
                  to each of the sexes a place and a work. And it is only for each to find his or
                  her place, and to be cheerfully engaged with the appropriate work of that place,
                  and the entire machinery of the social system will be perfectly orderly and
                  harmonious. All in the social compact will be no less useful than beautiful. Each
                  member will contribute in a natural way to the strength and efficiency of the
                  other. In all there will be honor, beauty, and enjoyment. There will be no
                  unnatural friction; no jostling of parts in the machinery; no defeat of 
                     ligitimate
                     legitimate
                   ends, but a most delightful and uniform evolving of just and benevolent
                  results. Man, the sterner and hardier sex, will have his position, and do his
                  work. Woman, the frailer, but lovelier, will find hers, and do her work.
               As in pristine loveliness and purity they came from the hands of their wise and
                  benevolent Creator, they had their position and work in their relations to him and
                  to each other, no less than to the world around them. While they were content with
                  the sphere assigned them, and aspired to nothing beyond this, all was well. They
                  were loving and earnest in discharging the duties of that sphere. All was harmony,
                  all was delight in all their relations. All was radiated and animated with the
                  life, the beauty and loveliness of the divine. But no sooner did they become
                  dissatisfied with the sphere assigned them, and cherish the ambition to arrogate
                  one which did not belong to them, than they found written, as with a pen of iron,
                  and in letters of fire, upon their persons and upon all their
                  relations—"Ichabod"—the glory is departed. The entire machinery was at once
                  disarranged and thrown into confusion and disorder. From that time to this the
                  whole social system has been suffering from the most grating and unnatural friction and ruinous jostling. The
                  consequence has been an untold amount of human debasement and misery.
               Christianity is the divine system to reconstruct the machinery—to restore all the
                  parts to their respective places and workings in relation to God and to each
                  other. Its noble and benignant design is to restore all to order and usefulness,
                  and again to establish all in perfect harmony, loveliness and beauty. All this it
                  is accomplishing in a quiet, noiseless, but truly efficient and successful manner,
                  in regard to all that concerns the social as well as the civil relations of man.
                  In this it proves to be pre-eminently the friend of woman, as it everywhere
                  elevates and restores her to her true position, and as it gives to her the
                  appropriate work of her hands. It makes her at once the meet
                     companion of man; the sweetener of his toils; the sharer of his
                  joys and sorrows; the presiding genius of gentleness and love in his home; the
                  almoner of his bounty, and the angel of his mercy to the suffering and the
                  destitute. Home is her place of power, and there she finds as a wife, mother, or
                  sister, her first and most appropriate work. As she is, in her love and estimate
                  of home, and as she cheerfully and faithfully devotes herself to its duties, and
                  adorns it with her womanly virtues and loveliness, so is her influence for good.
                  It is thus that she proves the greatest blessing to society. It is thus only that
                  she can retain her true power over man, and secure the homage of his highest
                  respect. Her position here is elevated, and her work, though toilsome, most
                  important and ennobling. This is her high place. It is that of her true womanly
                  dignity. Here, while fully discharging the duties of her station, she reigns as
                  queen, and proves to her husband, her sons, or brothers, their greatest earthly
                  benefactor. She possesses a power to reach and control, to mould and influence
                  them second only to that of God himself.
               Let her never be unnecessarily drawn away from this her high place of power and
                  usefulness. As she would value her own honor and happiness, and as she would prove
                  of the highest benefit to her race, so let her steadily resist every temptation to
                  forsake this her own sphere for the pulpit, the arena of debate, or any other
                  which more legitimately belongs to the other sex. The moment she travels out of
                  her own appropriate sphere, she parts with the true sceptre of her womanly power.
                  As far as she does this, she unsexes herself and degrades her position. As she
                  becomes ambitious of parading herself before the public in ways that are not
                  natural and feminine, she will necessarily acquire a distaste for home duties, and
                  subject herself to the contempt of man. Let her see to it then that her own true
                  position of home is well maintained. Let it be fortified and made strong by all
                  that is potent and lovely in piety, by all that is attractive and beautiful in
                  virtue, and there will be no limit to her power for good. She will do more for the
                  family, the state, and the world at large, than any other created agency. As she
                  in the spirit of the Saviour sustains her character in the home sphere, and with
                  gentleness and fidelity does her work there, she will become pre-eminently the
                  educator of the race.
               As woman yields her heart fully to the teachings of the Bible, and her character
                  is moulded by its influence, so does she find her position elevated, and her power
                  for good increased. So does she become contented with her position, and her heart
                  delights in all its important work. Give to the religion of the Bible its time and
                  legitimate working, and it will restore to woman all her rights. It will give her
                  in all the relations of life her true place and work, and will qualify her for
                  them. It will make her everywhere an honor and a blessing. It will do all this in
                  a noiseless and natural way. It will do that which all the "Women's Rights
                  Conventions" of the world will but abortively attempt. It will do this, as it
                  fills her heart with the purity, the love and the meekness of the Saviour; as it
                  will make her a "keeper at home;" as it will attach her to all its relations and
                  duties, and as it will invest that home with ever increasing sacredness and
                  dignity. As it will lead to the higher and better education of woman, it will give
                  her the power to make that home the nursery of the Church, the paradise of earth,
                  the vestibule of heaven.
               Under the influence of a pure religion, woman is rescued from positions and work
                  that are degrading and unnatural to her sex. In every heathen country her position
                  is more or less degrading, and her work is made to correspond with it. There she
                  is despoiled of her beauty, and robbed of her true power. Generally her education
                  is not only neglected but inhibited, and her position is little, if any thing better, than that of a
                  slave. In some nominally Christian countries, it is very much the same. In such
                  countries Christianity being unnaturally wedded to the state, is so fettered and
                  corrupted that it does not exert its genuine influence upon the social relations
                  of the race. How monstrously unnatural the incident described by Horace 
                     Greely
                     Greeley
                  , when traveling in Norway, of the girl walking on foot and driving the
                  ox cart, and her brother lazily lying down on the straw in the cart. This was
                  given as a fair illustration of the condition of woman in that country. But it is
                  not her condition in this, nor in any other where Christianity exerts its true
                  power. There it draws woman away from all labour that is degrading, and from all
                  scenes and amusements that prove injurious and destructive to the purity and
                  loveliness of her womanly nature. It leads to her retirement within the privacy
                  and sacredness of home to fortify herself in virtue, and to cultivate all the
                  sweet and attractive graces of her nature. It leads to her abandonment of all
                  those public exhibitions of herself, by which the gentler and finer sensibilities
                  of her nature are so sadly blunted, and by which she becomes so extensively a
                  panderer to the lowest passions of the other sex.
               It endows her with a womanly heart, refines and beautifies her
                  entire nature, and from her high place at home, sends her out on works of mercy.
                  As the milder and lovelier part of man, she goes with noiseless foot to the abode
                  of poverty, with a gentle voice she speaks the words of sympathy to the distressed
                  and smitten, and with a soft hand she wipes away the tears of sorrow. At the bed
                  of suffering and death she is ever welcomed as a ministering angel, and a
                  messenger of good. Whatever of time and strength she can spare from the necessary
                  duties of home and the Church, she can usefully and happily employ in ways of
                  mercy and benevolence among the poor, the ignorant and the suffering. Here she may
                  find a most appropriate sphere, and can accomplish a vast amount of good to the
                  suffering of her race.

               WINTER EVENINGS AT HOME
               
                  NO. I.
                  "OH! now mother's going to have a light," said Henry, as he observed her
                     spreading the stand-covering. Emma, who had been at school through the day, and
                     had brought home a good report from her teacher, and of course, a happy heart,
                     was standing by the window with her little brother Johnny, watching in the
                     deepening twilight, to see the bright stars appear. They lingered a few moments
                     at the window, and looked up into the broad expanse, which was soon to be
                     studded with countless myriads of these beautiful gems of the night, and then
                     joined Henry, who had already taken his seat by the lamp. He had a book-mark
                     which he wished to finish before Christmas, for a dear aunt. Emma was making
                     her a nice case for her scissors, of perforated paper, with a pretty vase of
                     flowers on one side, and "To my Aunt," on the other. And even little Johnny,
                     was trying to make a book-mark. Emma was the oldest, and was very anxious that
                     her brothers should do something to show their love for their Aunt Mary; so she
                     was ready to assist them, and was very patient and gentle if they made any
                     mistake.
                  But all work, would make dull children, surely. So when Mrs.
                     Ingalls had dropped the curtains, she seated herself with her children, to
                     devote the hours of evening to the culture of their minds, as she had spent the
                     day in necessary cares for their physical comfort. They were her all—and her
                     life was bound up with them, and theirs with her. The life on
                        earth. They all realized, that there is a higher spiritual life, for
                     which this, with all its vicissitudes, is a preparation. The beloved father,
                     and four of their precious children, had already entered upon that unseen, but,
                     to the eye of faith, no less certain state of existence. And Mrs. Ingalls felt
                     that her ambition craved no higher station in life, than to be the guide of
                     these remaining lambs to the fold of the Good Shepherd. To this end she
                     endeavoured to cultivate habitual
                     cheerfulness, to make home the happiest place on earth, and to blend
                     instruction with delight.
                  The winter evenings—the long, quiet, social winter evenings. It
                     almost seems as if they were made, for the purpose of cementing in bonds of
                     enduring affection, the different members of a family. Through the busy,
                     bustling day, how much there is to wean the heart from home and from family
                     ties. The mother is busy with a thousand cares, which sometimes ruffle her
                     spirits, and make her almost feel that life is a burden—the older children are
                     away at school with their young companions—the little ones are enjoying their
                     out-door sports, and sometimes the different members of the family almost
                     forget their mutual dependence. Let there be no gathering around the domestic
                     hearth at night-fall, and how easily and surely would the young be seduced to
                     seek amusement, not from the pure fountain of home affection, but from the
                     vitiated resources of fashionable life.
               
               
                  NO. II.
                  To return to the family who had gathered around the workstand. As they were all
                     quietly seated, Mrs. Ingalls took the "Life of Isaac T. Hopper," and read to
                     them. They had heard some of the anecdotes of his boyhood and early life, and
                     they had listened in other evenings to some of the stories of his efforts in
                     behalf of suffering humanity; and now they were very eager to learn more. This
                     evening the story was one of interest, which showed his coolness and calm
                     perseverance in maintaining what he thought was right, in spite of severe
                     threats, and apparent danger. On this occasion, the angry man whom he
                     encountered, attempted to intimidate him, by presenting his gun. After this was
                     taken from him and thrown into the water, a sailor raised an axe to strike a
                     deadly blow. "Thou foolish fellow," said Friend Hopper, "dost thou think to
                     frighten me with that axe, when thy companion could not do it with his gun?"
                     They all laughed, and Mrs. Ingalls said it reminded her of those mischievous
                     lads, who, when they meet a small, timid boy in the street, will open a
                     jack-knife, and threaten to take off his ears. She told them this was only done
                     to frighten the little ones, and if they had a particle cle of Friend Hopper's
                     intrepidity, they would pass along with a manly indifference, and these
                     unmannerly boys would soon desist from teazing them. This was a timely hint for
                     Henry, who had been very much annoyed in this way, and being naturally timid
                     and sensitive, felt an extreme reluctance to going into the street alone, even
                     on an errand for his mother. He seemed to feel the force of her remarks, and as
                     he glanced a moment from his book-mark into his mother's face; she noticed an
                     unusual expression of heroism in his clear, blue eyes, which led her to hope
                     that her gentle boy would learn to treat, with the indifference it deserves,
                     the low language of the street.
                  When this story was finished, as 
                        littly
                        little
                      Johnny did not like very well to hear such stories, they made his
                     heart ache so, Mrs. Ingalls put down the book, and took Mary Howitt's sweet
                     little volume of Natural History in verse. She read to them first, about the
                     "Sparrow's Nest" blown down from an old elm tree. They were much amused to
                     think that out of such a variety of apparently worthless materials, the sparrow
                     could fashion a home for her little ones, 
                        
                           "Neat, warm, and snug, with comfort stored,
                           Where five small things may lodge and board."
                        
                     
                  
                  Then she read about the handsome Kingfisher, 
                        
                           "Who lives where the fresh sparkling waters are flowing,
                           Where the tall heavy Typha and Loose-Strife are
                              growing,
                           By the bright little streams that all joyfully run,
                           Awhile in the shadow and then in the sun."
                        
                     
                  
                  Mrs. Ingalls said she thought they had now had about reading enough for one
                     evening, and as she had some sewing to finish, she closed the book. But not so
                     thought the children. They plead earnestly for one more. So Emma took the book,
                     and read a sweet little poem on Spring—then another about the Lion, the
                     undisputed king of beasts—and lastly, a very pretty description of the innocent
                     little Wood-mouse, eating his dinner under a mushroom. And when she closed with
                     the following verses:— 
                        
                           "I wish you could have seen him there,
                           It did my spirit good,
                           
                           To see the small thing God had made,
                           Thus eating in the wood.
                        
                        
                           I saw that he regardeth them-
                           Those creatures weak and small;
                           Their table in the wild is spread
                           By Him who cares for all!"
                        
                     
                  
                  Mrs. Ingalls felt as if a spirit of love to God and all his creatures pervaded
                     the little circle.
                  And now came the time for recreation. Emma had been away from her brothers
                     through the day, and Mrs. Ingalls had been engaged in her various duties. The
                     little boys, when their lessons were done, had enjoyed their rides on the
                     rocking-horse, or their run in the garden, or their mimic railways, and
                     steamboats built with blocks. But now all these things were put away, and the
                     family were together—mother, sister, and brothers. And Mrs. Ingalls felt that
                     upon her devolved, not only the care of their work and reading, but also of
                     their amusement.
               
               
                  NO. III.
                  SEVERAL things are essential for evening entertainment. It must be of a nature
                     so simple as to please the youngest, while it calls into exercise the
                     intellectual powers, sufficiently to interest the oldest. It must also combine
                     cheerfulness with quietness. And may I not add, it should be conducted with
                     such a spirit of conciliation, as to awaken and cherish the best affections of
                     the heart? And as the children always expect their mother to join them in their
                     evening play, it must be something in which she can participate while engaged
                     with her needle.
                  So Mrs. Ingalls taxed her ingenuity to contrive something new. They had had
                     "Crambo," and "Social Game," and "Come as I Come," till they were all tired of
                     them. This evening, they wanted something else, and mother must invent it. Mrs.
                     Ingalls thought a moment, and then said, "I have a new play to propose. I will
                     think of some animal, and then mention some of its peculiar traits of
                     character, and you may tell me if you can, what its name is." This plan pleased
                     them all. So Mrs. Ingalls said, "I'm thinking of a very large quadruped that
                     can live either on land or in the water, in other words an amphibious animal."
                     Emma looked very earnestly at her mother, with her brow contracted by the
                     effort to recal the long hard name of the huge creature. But Henry, whose
                     memory always serves him as a faithful steward, said suddenly, and without any
                     apparent effort, "Hippopotamus." Emma felt a little chagrined, for she knew she
                     had the right animal in her mind; but she soon cleared her brow, and said, "you
                     may have it, Henry."
                  So Henry said, "I'm thinking of an animal that's very useful to man." As this
                     was rather indefinite, Mrs. Ingalls asked if he could not mention some
                        peculiar trait. Henry thought if he did, they would all guess
                     at once, but he finally said, "It has a hump on its back." Emma said
                     immediately, "the camel." And Mrs. Ingalls mentioned some of the most
                     remarkable traits of the camel, such as its docility and endurance of fatigue,
                     also the fact, that it can supply itself when starting on a journey, with
                     sufficient water to last a long time, which makes it exceedingly useful in
                     crossing the long, sandy deserts of tropical regions.
                  Then Emma mentioned the graceful giraffe, and little Johnny said, while he
                     laughed all over his face, "I'm thinking of an animal that the farmer wouldn't
                     like to have come into his dooryard, especially if he kept hens." Of course
                     they all knew he meant the sly fox, and joined heartily in the laugh with
                     him.
                  Then Emma said, "I'm thinking of an animal that sometimes washes his face in
                     wet lime." This puzzled them all. Mrs. Ingalls could not recollect any such
                     account in any work on natural history she had met with. So Emma was obliged to
                     explain herself. "It is the monkey," said she; "I have read somewhere, that
                     when men wish to catch wild monkeys, they prepare some lime and water in a dish
                     which they set near the monkeys, then they take another dish of water and
                     commence washing their own faces. The monkeys, to imitate them, wash their
                     faces and eyes with the lime and water, which for the time renders them blind,
                     so that they are easily caught." Mrs. Ingalls was pleased to find that her
                     little daughter remembered such facts in natural history, and particularly so
                     in this instance, as it added to her own stock of knowledge.
               
               
               
                  
                  NO. IV.
                  THUS the play went on, till Henry, who is the first to be sleepy in the
                     evening, and the first to wake bright and playful in the morning, turned to his
                     mother, saying, "Please let us say the evening hymn, for I'm very tired, and
                     wish to go to bed." Mrs. Ingalls then drew the dear image of his father near
                     her, while he rested his cheek against hers; Emma and Johnny softly repeated
                     with him the following beautiful hymn, with which they had been familiar ever
                     since they could lisp the words.
                  
                     
                        "Lord, I have passed another day,
                        And come to thank thee for thy care,
                        Forgive my faults in work and play,
                        And listen to my evening prayer.
                     
                     
                        Thy favor gives me daily bread,
                        And friends who all my wants supply;
                        And safely now I rest my head,
                        Preserved and guarded by thine eye.
                     
                     
                        Look down in pity, and forgive
                        Whatever I have done amiss,
                        And help me every day I live,
                        To serve thee better than in this.
                     
                     
                        Now while I sleep be pleased to take
                        A helpless child beneath thy care:
                        And condescend for Jesus sake,
                        To listen to my evening prayer."
                     
                  
                  Then Henry lighted the little lamp, kissed, and bade them all good night, and
                     retired to his bed. When he was in bed, his mother, as usual, went in to see
                     that all was right, to take his last kiss for the night, and to remove the
                     lamp. But the evening had been so pleasant, that the contrast of a dark room
                     made him feel lonely. He called to his mother, and desired her to come in a
                     moment; "I feel lonely," said he, as she entered the room; "I want Johnny to
                     come to bed." Mrs. Ingalls told him it was early, only seven, and Johnny was
                     not sleepy, and kissing him again, she bade him good-night. When she went out,
                     she called little Johnny to her, and told him that his dear little brother felt
                     very lonely without him, and wanted him to come to bed. "O," said he, "I don't
                     want to go to bed yet, but I'll go and stand by Henry 'till he goes to sleep."
                     Mrs. Ingalls kissed him, and called him a dear kind boy; and he went to his
                     brother to perform this office of love. But, by this time, Henry had begun to
                     feel the soothing influence of approaching sleep, and did not wish Johnny to
                     leave the family, and stand in the cold beside him. So Johnny went out, and
                     Henry was soon in a quiet sleep. At half-past seven, Johnny bade his mother and
                     sister good-night, saying to his mother, "I want to give you lots of kisses,"
                     and then in a few moments, was away in the land of dreams.
                  "Now, mother," said Emma, "I wish you would think of some town or city, and
                     describe it to me, and then see if I can tell what it is. That will help me
                     about my geography." Mrs. Ingalls felt fatigued with the cares of the day and
                     the efforts of the evening, but, by-and-by the children would all be asleep,
                     and then she could "let down her wings," and so she assented to Emma's
                     proposal. "I'm thinking," said she, "of a city, in a state which was originally
                     purchased from the Indians, by a peaceful negotiation; the person who made the
                     treaty was a Quaker, and the state bears his name. The city is laid out very
                     neatly, and is sometimes called "The city of brotherly love." Emma thought a
                     moment, and then said, "Is it Philadelphia?" "Now another," she said, "and
                     still another," till eight o'clock came, which was Emma's bed-time. She retired
                     quietly, after having committed herself to the guardianship of her heavenly
                     Father, and imprinted a warm kiss on her mother's cheek.
                  And now Mrs. Ingalls sat alone. Her thoughts were busy with the past, present,
                     and future—lingering a few moments over the graves of buried hopes—then pausing
                     to consider the present, so full of anxiety, and encouragement—and then by a
                     natural transition, passing to the unknown future. She arose, with a heart full
                     of emotion, and went into the room where her little ones were enjoying the
                     sweet and quiet sleep of innocent childhood. As she looked upon them she felt strengthened to bear
                     privation, if need be, for their sake. What, to her, at that moment, were all
                     the allurements of the world? ay! what were the nobler enjoyments of
                     intellectual society, for which she sometimes pined? what was even the
                     fellowship of kindred minds, compared to the high trust committed to her
                     charge? Would she incur the risk, of proving recreant to this trust, for the
                     sake of any of those enjoyments? Would she envy those, whose means enabled them
                     to leave their children in the care, and under the influence of hired
                     attendants, that they might enjoy the society of their friends? No! she felt
                     that from her heart of hearts, she could answer, No! Though they may have less
                     confinement, and of course more opportunity for that collision of equal minds,
                     which is necessary to awaken the latent energies of the soul, and cause those
                     scintillations of genius which the possessor sometimes has not even dreamed
                     of—yet they lose what seemed, to her, far better—the opportunity to mould the
                     characters of their children, when in that impressible state, that their minds
                     are, not unaptly, compared to wax, which may be stamped with any image, that
                     you choose to imprint upon it. And when she bowed in prayer that night, before
                     the Father of Spirits, she felt a hope almost amounting to assurance, that her
                     life was not being spent in vain—but that God would bless her efforts, and
                     would graciously fulfill his promise to the widow and the orphan.

               "SPARE US, OH GOD!"
               THE present is a momentous time! The political and moral world is all in
                  commotion. Questions involving the dearest interests and rights of nations and
                  individuals, are being agitated, and the anxious inquiry is heard on all sides,
                  "What will be the end?" Conflicting opinions are disturbing even the peace of
                  Zion, and she trembles as with the upheavings of an earthquake. Yet, by an
                  irresistible force, the world, nothing daunted, rush onward with an accelerated
                  speed, making new discoveries, devising new schemes for business and benevolence,
                  and laying bare the secrets of all past ages, as if making preparations for the
                  opening of some grand drama. And as events thicken, the inquiry rings louder
                  still, "What will be the end?" The mother looks upon her children with undefinable
                  feelings of fear and hope, as she thinks they, perhaps, will be actors in that
                  scene,—and "What will it be?" What can she, a feeble woman, do to avert its
                  terror, or enhance its glory, or prepare them to act the part that shall win the
                  prize?
               You can do much. If you do not wield the arm of state or sit in the nation's
                  councils, you can touch the arm that moves the world, and amid the lightning's
                  glare, and the boding thunders, send up that one prayer to heaven, "Spare us, oh
                  God! let not thy people perish." In your quiet unobtrusive path, at mid-noon, or
                  in the gloom of night, when storm seems leagued with storm, that prayer can reach
                  the throne of Him who is turning and overturning the nations, "Spare us, oh God!
                  let not thy people perish." Besides, it is a prayer in which every Christian
                  mother—every Christian heart, whatever the name, and whatever sectional or party
                  prejudice may control their opinions, can fervently unite, "Spare us, oh God! let
                  not thy people perish," with firm faith, assured that He who sent his Son to earth
                  to redeem to himself a people, will not let them perish.
               To this covert—this strong-hold—let us resort. Thither let us take
                  our children, to equip them for the future. The holy influences and armor obtained
                  at the mercy seat, will make them valiant in fight, and will shield them from the
                  fiery darts of the adversary.

                  "I LOVE my fader—I love my moder"—
                  Said an infant in her glee,
                  Sporting in playful innocence,
                  Upon her parent's knee.
                  'Twas the first love of childhood,
                  Gushing, and bright, and pure,
                  Fit emblem of the sweet delights
                  That round the hearth endure.
               
               
                  "I love my fader—I love my moder"—
                  How much that saying meant,
                  Breathed from a childish bosom
                  So true and innocent!
                  She gathered fondly other loves
                  Within her little fold—
                  But "I love my fader—I love my moder"—
                  Was the first her breast could hold.
               
               
                  Oh ! precious is an infant's love!
                  Through all life's fevered hours,
                  It falls upon a father's heart
                  Like dew on morning flowers;
                  It gleams within the mother's soul
                  Like vestal stars at even,
                  And mirrors in the fountains there
                  The joy and peace of Heaven.
               
            
            
               ON THE NECESSITY AND ADVANTAGES OF POPULAR INSTRUCTION IN REGARD TO THE
                  TEETH.
               BY A. HILL, D. D. S.
               EVERY member of the dental profession who has been in practice a few years, must
                  have been conscious again and again, of laboring under many disadvantages, arising
                  from the ignorance of his patients in regard to their own teeth.
               How many cases of absolute deformity resulting from the premature removal, or
                     non-removal of the temporary teeth of children at the proper
                  period, might be prevented, if parents understood a few simple principles
                  connected with this department of knowledge.
               How many cases of irregularity in the teeth, not indeed so great as to amount to
                  absolute deformity of the face, yet sufficient to induce bad habits of speaking,
                  and an unpleasant play of features, might be avoided altogether, by the same
                  means. But farther than this—if the mother could feel assured that the simple
                  washing of the gums of her infant child with a soft linen cloth dipped in
                     pure water, every day, would not only prevent that
                  common disease of infancy, termed "children's sore mouth," but
                  materially assist the healthful development of the deciduous teeth,
                  a vast amount of suffering might be prevented, which is now endured, and parental
                  solicitude and anxiety greatly relieved.
               Nor is this all. The more alarming indications which often accompany that critical
                  stage of human existence, the first dentition, would suffice the
                  watchful parent, to summon to her aid those means, which, when properly attended
                  to, would change the alarming aspect of almost every case, and annual those fatal
                  symptoms at once.
               But, for the want of such information, thousands are perishing around us. Again,
                  if parents could be made to understand that the thorough and
                     habitual use of the tooth brush, and pure water alone
                  is sufficient to preserve entire the temporary teeth of children, until nature displaces them with a new
                  and more permanent set, we would not be confronted as we now are, with such
                  sorrowful looking mouths. But, instead of denuded teeth, and swollen and inflamed
                  gums, a beautiful string of brilliant pearls would gladden every smile of infancy
                  and youth with which we are greeted.
               The premature and rapid decay of the human teeth, as presented in the children and
                  youth of this country at the present time, must be regarded as a fact of great
                  importance. And it would seem that the causes, whatever they may be, producing
                  this state of things, seriously challenge the attention, not merely of the dental
                  and medical professions, but of parents, who can but be interested in the
                  well-being of their offspring. Now, it seems obvious, that either
                     nature herself is greatly at fault, or else there is a want of
                  care, or information in regard to this matter, amounting to, or nearly approaching
                  criminality. We might as well suppose that nature would refuse to fulfill the
                  necessary conditions upon which the other parts of the osseous structure of the
                  human system depends for its completion and development, as that she should be
                  found so faulty or negligent, in regard to the teeth alone. And if
                  hers be not the fault, then we must turn our attention elsewhere for its
                  discovery.
               
                  Constitutional causes, beyond question, give to the teeth of
                  different individuals, their distinct and peculiar characteristics as related to
                  temperament or diathesis, and in a great degree govern their structure as to
                     solidity, form, and color, and thus render them less,
                  or more liable to destruction from external causes, in proportion as their
                  constitutional formation is frail or otherwise. Yet experience demonstrates that
                  even very delicate teeth—teeth of the most fragile structure, may be preserved for
                  an indefinite period by due attention to cleanliness alone, and where the care and
                  attention bestowed upon them is proportionate to the necessity of the case, such
                  care cannot fail to be rewarded in the preservation of those very delicate, yet
                  exceedingly useful appendages. Whatever the agent or agents of decay of the teeth,
                  may be, it is admitted on all hands to be external to the tooth, and
                  capable of being either removed or neutralized, and whatever may be said in favor
                  of dentifrices and gum-washes of various rious kinds, it is absolutely certain
                  that pure water is sufficient of itself, in a great majority of
                  cases, to remove the offending substance, or prevent its destructive action. These
                  facts, therefore, being admitted, it will not be necessary to protract the
                  discussion, as to the cause of dental decay, nor yet to argue the advantage of
                  popular information to any considerable length, as such advantages are obvious to
                  every reflecting mind.
               But the means of communicating such instruction, is a question demanding at least
                  a passing notice. The circulation of brief popular treatises upon these subjects,
                  by different members of the profession, in their several localities, is
                     one mode by means of which some have sought to obviate the
                  difficulties above referred to.
               It is doubtless well known, that until quite recently, physiology, as a distinct
                  branch of science, has been almost exclusively confined to our
                  medical colleges, and highest literary institutions, and that it has been deemed
                  quite improper to teach it in a popular form. But, thanks to the
                  enlightened spirit of the age, this feeling is fast giving way before the
                  indomitable and persevering energy of those who have been highly successful in
                  bringing this science, in a popular form, before the public, not only in books and
                  periodicals, but by able and interesting lectures. And these lectures have been
                  listened to, by thousands of our citizens, with the highest satisfaction, and the
                  consequence is a demand for it in our seminaries, academies, and even public
                  schools. And we certainly anticipate the time, and that not far distant, when
                  popular instruction in physiology will be considered indispensable in
                  all our educational institutions.
               But as yet this instruction has been too general to cover the ground
                  under consideration. We need, therefore, a special department in this
                  branch of physiology, which our own profession are competent to
                  supply.
               And why may we not have these lectures? Are they not essential to the welfare of
                  the present and future generations? Are they not intimately allied to the objects
                  sought in all our female seminaries and schools of popular education?
               We humbly conceive that the time has now arrived, when members of the profession
                  should take hold of this subject, and
                  popularize it, to meet the exigency of the times, and the pressing wants of the
                  community. Nothing could more successfully tend to dissipate the darkness and
                  superstition that now envelope the public mind in reference to many important
                  physiological truths, than the course here suggested. Nothing would more
                  effectually tend to elevate the standard of professional character, or indicate
                  more truly the line of distinction between the really meritorious and the unworthy
                  professors of our art.
               Nothing would so effectually expose the empirical pretensions of nostrum venders,
                  and vile, yea villainous, quack advertisements with which our newspapers are
                  constantly teeming, as to throw open the door for correct information upon this
                  subject. Let it be carried into our female seminaries and common schools. And when
                  the value of the teeth is once appreciated by the public as it should be, and
                  their intimate relation to the health, comfort, and
                     convenience of every human being, explained and enforced as it
                  should be, then our professional services will be more highly esteemed, as a
                  natural and necessary consequence, and those disgusting "tricks of
                     trade," by which the prejudices of the public are kindled against the
                  profession, will be exposed, and the merited chastisement meted out to such as
                  most evidently deserve it.
               Popular lectures on physiological subjects, to which we have occasionally
                  listened, do not meet the wants of the community in this regard. And however
                  valuable they may be in other respects, this speciality has not received that
                  attention that the subjects merit from those by whom such lectures have been
                  delivered. Indeed, they have scarcely touched upon this great theme at all. And
                  yet the amount of human suffering, to say nothing of the inconvenience and
                  discomfort arising from irregularities, and the premature loss of the teeth, can
                  scarcely be estimated.
            
            
               LITTLE THINGS.
               CHARACTER is made up mostly of small items, and individual happiness is the result
                  of a multitude of little influences conspiring to produce it. No one person ever
                  does many great things, or has his own condition materially affected by the great
                  deeds of others. In the multitude there are little vices and little virtues, and
                  it is their preponderance that determines the character. Is your friend
                  occasionally profane, especially in vulgar society? Does he sometimes warp the
                  truth to avoid censure? does he often neglect his regular employment, when it
                  suits his pleasure or natural disposition better to be idle? does he, in short,
                  practice a thousand trifling digressions from the strictest rules of morality and
                  religion? You must find the sum of all these before you estimate his
                  real worth. One crime may be outweighed by a thousand virtues, and the balance
                  still entitle the person to respect; but a thousand faults, linked to one virtue,
                  would doom him to the opposite scale. Indulgence in any act of immorality,
                  according to its importance, renders the character questionable; but there are a
                  thousand little peculiarities not perhaps entitled to public reproach, which make
                  the person disagreeable. Disagreeableness commonly springs from selfishness; it
                  may arise from bad taste. Selfishness is a strange quality; it is rarely felt, but
                  always seen. We are seldom conscious of its existence in ourselves, but quick to
                  discern it in others, and sure to recognise its odious features. Hence it is a
                  dangerous possession. It tinges all the character, and keeps out of sight the
                  better qualities, so that the individual is liable to enjoy less credit than he
                  deserves.
               Outside appearance has much to do in forming the impressions which others have of
                  us. Our friends may understand our real worth, and pardon a thousand trifling
                  faults; but the world at large will entertain us with less liberality. On the
                  other hand, courtesy and kindness are just as sure to win favor as selfishness is
                  to repel it. He who always largely manifests these virtues is certain to command universal respect, although his
                  talent does not entitle him to applause. Such a person always carries about him,
                  in his actions, a certificate of good character; for these qualities are supposed
                  to spring from a generous heart. A thousand little acts of good, will often
                  compensate for the want of a larger share of intellect, and bring the individual
                  into more favorable notice than he who has more talent lying behind a repulsive
                  exterior. Moderate ability, well used, is always respectable, when not associated
                  with too conspicuous faults. True policy, then, would lead to the careful
                  cultivation of all the pleasing and noble traits of character, and the constant
                  suppression of all the disagreeable features. Practice daily all the virtues, and
                  let the vices die out from disuse. Remember that nature makes but few great men,
                  and the multitude must base their title to respect, on something short of
                  illustrious deeds, or the claim will be invalid. Persevering labor, with ordinary
                  strength, may rear a pyramid of pebbles. Better do that, than fail altogether from
                  an overestimate of your powers.

                  THE bird that soars on highest wing
                  Builds on the ground her lowly nest;

                  Sings in the shade when all things rest:
                  —In lark and nightingale we see
                  What honor hath humility.
               
               
                  THE saint that wears heaven's brightest crown
                  In deepest adoration bends;
                  The weight of glory bows him down
                  Then most when most his soul ascends,
                  —Nearest the throne itself must be
                  The footstool of humility.

               FASHION.
               BY MRS. THOMAS P. SMITH.
               
                  FASHION! fashion! who does not bow to its dictates? Who does not yield to its
                     imperious claims? For fashion's sake, what sacrifices are daily made? From the
                     time when her husband received her at the Hymeneal altar, through all her
                     married life—the training and educating her children—regulating her household,
                     and conducting herself, how many a woman seems to make comfort, convenience,
                     health, happiness, and her peace of mind, completely subservient to the idol,
                     fashion. Her husband's purse, time, and intellect, are all taxed to
                     please—whom? Himself? No. His wife? No. His God? No. Who then? Strangers,
                        lookers-on, the world! This, or that must be bought, done, or left
                     undone, because, forsooth, "it is the fashion."
                  This truth was so plainly exhibited, in a certain family with which I became
                     acquainted in New York, I thought I would transcribe the history. Not that I
                     think the correct customs of society, or of a refined taste, should be set
                     aside, but, that the higher interests of the soul and religion should be
                     thought of first.
                  It was a beautiful morning in January; the sun shone resplendently in the
                     heavens, and the weather was that of summer in mid-winter: I was walking in
                     Broadway, when the sight of two beautiful girls in close conversation, and a
                     few words which met my ear, arrested my attention. "Pray, Maria," said one of
                     them, "why does not your mother let you go to balls and parties, as mine does?
                     "Because," said Maria, "she does not approve of them." "Oh, well, my
                        mother belongs to the church, and she says she does not approve of
                     them, but she lets us go: she goes to prayer or church-meeting, and we go to
                     the dance. Now, you teaze your mother to let you go to the ball on Monday next;
                     tell her I am going, and mother is willing, and says we never shall be thought
                     any thing of, if we don't mingle a little in the world."
                  
                  "No—good-by, Anna," answered Maria, "I might as well try to move this block of
                     granite, as to try to swerve mother from her principles"—and the young ladies
                     separated. Anna stopped and gazed in at jewellers' and other windows, where I
                     left her, and hastened to the house of a friend, with whom I was to spend the
                     coming spring.
                  Mrs. Morrell and myself were schoolmates together, and very much attached: the
                     intimacy had been kept up though we lived in distant cities; and though I had
                     not seen her for several years before, when she spent some weeks with me; yet
                     when, after the lingering sickness and death of my husband, she wrote a
                     pressing letter, and urged me to spend a few months with her, en famille, I felt no hesitation to go. She and
                     myself were made subjects of Divine grace, as we hoped, at the same time, and
                     had ever since sympathized in our joys and our sorrows. I had rejoiced in
                     hearing that she was considered one of the pillars in the church, and was
                     looked up to with great respect.
                  Not being able to recall the name of the street in which she lived, I ordered
                     the carriage to a hotel, and, finding that I was but a few steps from her
                     house, I was walking thither when I overtook the two young ladies. On the door
                     being opened, I was shown into the drawing-room, where Mrs. M. soon joined me.
                     Very glad she seemed to see me, and in a short time I felt as completely at
                     home as if I had been one of the family. Three of Mrs. M.'s children were with
                     her—all girls: she had three others, two sons at college, and another daughter
                     at school. The little girls were sweet, interesting-looking children, the
                     eldest about twelve years of age. Their clothes, I observed, were fine, yet I
                     could not help remarking a want of neatness about them, which was to me very
                     unpleasant; but I supposed something had occurred that morning to hurry their
                     toilette.
                  After taking a cup of coffee, I retired to my room to rest, and did not go down
                     till summoned by the dinner bell; when, on entering the room, great was my
                     surprise, to have the identical Anna, whom I encountered in my
                     morning walk, presented to me as the eldest daughter of Mrs. M.! Mr. Morell was
                     there also; the same pleasant, generous, gentlemanly man he ever was,—the only
                     difference of manner observable in him, was a slight petulance lance at times
                     to his family, and a sarcastic tone and expression occasionally, when on any
                     subject connected with religion; this he had not in former years, and I could
                     not account for it, when Mrs. M. was so eminent a Christian.
                  Anna and myself were soon friends: I found her a warmhearted, sensitive girl,
                     with a mind enriched by science, but whose moral training and domestic habits
                     were very deficient. Being at home, seemed to be an excuse for
                     negligence in personal appearance, and carelessness of speech and manner,
                     except when visitors were present, then, Anna was elegant in speech and
                     appearance. Her father often spoke to her about neatness; but, much to my
                     astonishment, the next breakfast would find her with the same torn frock, or
                     anything she happened to catch first. One morning, however, as I descended to
                     the breakfast-room, I overtook Anna, dressed with extraordinary neatness, and
                     looking very smiling and happy. Mr. M., as she took her seat, noticed it too,
                     and I was puzzled to perceive a slight shade of sadness pass over his face; but
                     breakfast was no sooner over than I comprehended the whole.
                  "Father," said Anna, "I want you to let me have a new set of jewels for the
                     ball,—now do, father,—will you?" And she ran on, with the unfashionableness of
                     hers—and the beauties the other girls had—and how cheap she could get a
                     particular set—and how neat and attentive she would be to his wishes, to pay
                     for them, until she really thought he would give her the jewels, and wound off
                     with, "Now, father you will, won't you?'
                  Her father spoke gently, but firmly, "Anna, I cannot afford to; the sum I gave
                     you last week, for this ball, was all I can afford to give you; and more than I
                     felt willing to take for the purpose, but I did it to gratify you; I have lost
                     a great deal of money lately, and we must economise awhile, in such things,
                     till I make it up. These ornaments are not so necessary, my dear daughter, as
                     you think just now; the good opinion of the wise and sensible does not depend
                     upon the jewels a young lady wears; a cultivated mind, and the grace and
                     refinement an education like yours should have conferred, are by far the best
                     ornaments; nevertheless, if I had the money to spare, I would give you the
                     trinkets to please you."
                  
                  Anna seemed to think the matter ended; she burst into tears, and was leaving
                     the room when her mother's voice was heard:—that mother, whose example was to
                     train her for domestic life, and whose teachings would, in a great measure, fit
                     or unfit her for the life to come—that mother's voice stopt her retreating
                     footsteps: "Now, Mr. M., I think you had better let Anna have the jewels;
                     indeed you must let her have them, for nearly all the girls have had new ones
                     since she has, and now I remember, one of her bracelets is lost, and instead of
                     replacing that she had better have a new set." A sharp retort escaped Mr. M.,
                     and after I left the room, I heard the words "beggar," and "wrong principles,"
                     uttered in quite a loud tone. I returned to my room with a sadness and
                     perplexity I could not shake off.
                  At dinner, all was moody and morose: none of the sunny smiles and gladsome
                     converse of gratified and happy hearts. Mr. Morell swallowed his dinner as
                     quick as possible, and hurried off to his business, saying, as he threw a roll
                     of money on to the table, "At the rate we go on, I shan't be able to eat at
                     all, with digging and delving; but that is a small affair so that we are in the
                     fashion."
                  When the door closed, Mrs. M. turned to me and said, "I don't know what has got
                     into Mr. M. lately; I know he is able enough to give, if he has a mind to; he
                     never used to speak so—it really worries me; he is not only cross, but he
                     almost ridicules religion itself. Alas, poor man, I wish he was a professor of
                     religion himself, then he would sympathise more with me."
                  Anna was delighted with having the money for the jewels, and she was counting
                     it out; but I perceived a scrutinizing glance of her eyes at her mother, then
                     at me, as if she thought something more "was meant than met the ear"—then
                     resumed her counting, and made arrangements with her mother to go out and
                     purchase the ornaments.
                  The next day was quarter-day; Mr. M. was a very punctual man, and required all
                     his house-hold bills to be handed in at the regular quarters. Upon looking them
                     over, he came across two or three he did not understand, and brought them to
                     Mrs. M. to explain. One enormous item of "figured velvet coverings to furniture
                     of drawing-rooms and library," (which being covered up he had not observed,)
                     was got when Rev. Dr. N.'s wife came to stay a week. "You know," said Mrs. M.,
                     "we wanted to look decent before her." Mr. M. said nothing this time, but a
                     deep-drawn sigh, which escaped him as he replaced the bills in his pocket, said
                     more, and sunk deeper in my heart, than any words would have done.
                  The Sabbath came, in all its quiet, and a lovely day it was. Anna was excused
                     from going to church in the morning, her mother saying that "to-morrow would be
                     a fatiguing day, and Anna's health was rather delicate." In the afternoon they
                     all went. As they left the house Mrs. M. remarked, "to-day is the collection
                     for the Bible Society; my dear, give the children each something to put in the
                     box: it looks pretty to see children put in, and all the children round us have
                     something to throw in—I hear it very plain." Thus instructed as to the object
                     for which the money was given them, each child received a piece of silver to
                     deposit in the box.
                  The next day was the ball. After Mr. M. went from the house, he returned for a
                     strap-button to be put on: he called up stairs for Anna. Anna answered, but did
                     not come; after waiting, he called in a more impatient tone, when his wife
                     answered, "do you want Anna very much? she is deciding with the dress-maker
                     about her trimmings." "O, I wont keep her a minute—send her down to sew me a
                     button." After a long, long delay, Anna appeared with a cross look, saying,
                     "Mother thinks you might have gone without just now, I am so busy." "Sew away,"
                     said her father; but Anna's mind was on anything but pleasing or obliging her
                     father—the button was put on in a wrong place, and would not button. After
                     detaining him to take it off, it was at last right, and he went off to his
                     business; but she had done it so grudgingly, he did not kiss her—he could not
                     thank her—he did not even look pleased with her. Alas! that love, kindness, and
                     the domestic graces should be sacrificed to the fashion of a ball-dress! But
                     enough has been said to show the influence shed in that family by a compromise
                     with fashion—in many instances, the truth itself was set aside, on
                     the score of expediency—and manœuvring and prevarication took the
                     place of openness and honesty. But we will skip over a few years, till the period of Anna's marriage, which
                     occurred in the winter of —.
                  Charles Horton, her choice, was of excellent moral character, energetic and
                     accomplished, and a member of the church; but inasmuch as he was not
                     fashionable and wealthy, was of course, not agreeable to Mrs. M., who had a
                     great deal to tell Anna about the genteel Mr. S., and the rich Mr. M., and how
                     much more she would be thought of as the wife of Mr. B. But Anna had chosen and
                     gave her hand to Charles H., saying, in her enthusiasm, she had rather have one
                     room and a crust with him, than a palace with either of the others; and even,
                     when in talking of their establishment, she found him averse to laying out all
                     they could afford, saying, "Now, Anna, let us be independent, and begin small;
                     we can easily add, and in the mean time, the pounds will be accumulating," she
                     felt perfectly satisfied. Ah! how little did she know the power of habit and
                     early training! Eighteen years of precept and example, inculcating gentility
                     and wealth as the basis of worth, could not be blotted out at once; and though
                     she had everything comfortable and tasteful, yet the syren fashion, had so long
                     sung her soul to sleep, she could not break the spell, and the marriage was
                     scarcely consummated, ere she began to sigh for what she needed, not for
                     comfort, convenience, or even luxury, but merely because it was "the
                        fashion."
               
               
                  FASHION.
                  CHAPTER II.
                  THE disastrous winter of 1837 was almost over—the year that blasted the hopes
                     and ruined the prospects of so many in mercantile life—the year, when
                     extravagance seemed to be at its height, and the rich merchant in his palace
                     to-day, was the penniless outcast to-morrow.
                  Charles Horton had not troubled his young wife about his affairs, yet his
                     care-worn look and decided answer, when she chided him for thinking so much
                     more of business than of her, "I must, Anna; it is my love for you that urges
                     me; these are troublous times, a man must be at his business early and late,"
                     spoke very plainly.
                  As I have shown before, the deficiency of Anna's domestic training was so
                     great, she could not be satisfied with domestic and social enjoyments, but
                     sighed for the blandishments of a more expensive household, and a gay equipage.
                     This became evident to her husband; first, by gentle hints that
                        such and such a change would be "delightful," then
                     by her fretting and finding fault with this, or that, and last, by her open
                     murmurs after calling upon some of her more opulent and elegantly established
                     friends; or finding that such or such a rich family, did not visit her, as when
                     at her father's more splendid home.
                  Charles said nothing upon the subject, but often commented upon the charming
                     evenings they enjoyed together, reading or with a few friends, when Anna, who
                     had really a fine mind and kind heart, would seem to be perfectly happy. But
                     the "aching void," and the ambitious worldliness would come again, nor was the
                     tender and holy influence which her infant son had upon her heart, sufficient
                     to draw her mind off, and when she, one day, told her husband she had a
                     proposition to make to him, it was no more than he expected.
                  
                  "I want, dear Charles," said she, "to have our parlor furniture changed; it is
                     all too plain. I have tried to like it, but I cannot. This vile Kidderminster
                     carpet! why there is not another among all my friends; every one has Wilton or
                     Brussels except me—and I must have a set of marble-top tables, and
                     a divan and a few ottomans to match some curtains. Now husband, I want to go
                     right about it this week; Deacon E. of Boston is coming to the convention, week
                     after next, with his wife and daughter, and mother was here to-day, and says if
                     I can spruce up and look nice, she will send them round to stop with us; but
                     she says, they are very genteel people, and live very handsomely
                     at home, and she hopes I will not disgrace the family by being mean."
                  Charles was going out to the store, but seeing the troubled state of his wife's
                     mind, and that she had no other friend to counsel her faithfully and
                     religiously, he sat down again. "Now, Anna, dear, let us talk this matter
                     over." "I don't want to talk it over," answered she, quickly, "that's the way
                     you always say; let us act now, not talk; before we
                     were married, you used to let me have my way." "Well, my dear, so
                     you shall now; I promise you carte blanche to
                     fit the house as you please, after you listen to me."
                  "Anna, I have no object in life but you, next to my God, and doing
                     right, your happiness is my aim and object; and notwithstanding your remark
                     about marriage, I love you and would make sacrifices for you tenfold more than
                     ever before marriage; but I want to explain my wishes. I have been in business
                     now four years, and notwithstanding the losses of last winter, have cleared
                     about ten thousand dollars; with this, I can now go on, and do a quicker
                     business; it will soon, with God's blessing, double and treble; I have worked
                     very hard, and I intend to do so still, until I get a substantial basis for
                     future comfort; then, dear, I hope to enjoy your society more, and allow myself
                     and you more gratifications; but even then, dear Anna, there are so many higher
                     and more glorious objects to attract the attention of a mind like yours, so
                     much suffering to relieve—so many literary and scientific objects to
                     encourage—so many, many ways to do good—and of gratifications,
                     merely, a valuable library, visiting foreign climes and many other things, are
                     much more calculated to give you lasting pleasure and advantage, than the mere
                     residence in even a palace. More than all this, my dear wife, I long very much
                     to see your immortal soul delighting itself in the revelations of a glorious
                     mansion in the upper world. A little cherub has been given to us, to prepare
                     for that world, and oh, how can we do this, unless we feel its power upon our
                     own hearts? Our dear child is dependent upon you, Anna, under God, for more of
                     his happiness here and hereafter, than upon all other earthly influences put
                     together. How animating, how ennobling the thought, that we are entrusted with
                     a precious little heart to mould and guide upward, and onward to a purer
                     existence, to the abode of the blessed."
                  Anna burst into tears, and said "Oh, Charles, I have often thought of this,
                     since the baby came—as I looked into his loving blue eyes, I have asked myself,
                     what is my duty as a mother? but it is no use—I have never been taught myself
                     these things you speak of, how can I ever hope to teach him? It is now too late
                     to form new tastes and habits. No. I am fitted for the place I am to fill, that
                     of a fashionable woman."
                  "O no, no," exclaimed Charles, "you have too sensitive a heart, and too
                     sensible a mind ever to be happy there. It is not too late—all
                     things may yet become new to you, and heavenly wisdom vouchsafed, sufficient to
                     overcome all the habits of your past life, and make you perfectly happy."
                  Anna wept afresh, and was going to reply, when a fashionable visitor was
                     announced, and although she sent word she was engaged, yet the current of
                     better thoughts which had stirred her soul, was stayed: she became calm, and
                     said, "Well Charles, all you have said is very important, but you know, a great
                     many people, who believe as you do, act just as I
                     want to."
                  "Alas! it is too true," said Charles, "Christ's nominal followers, follow
                     anything but his example, too many of them, yet this will form no excuse for
                        us." After some more conversation, Charles left the matter with
                     her, to do as she pleased, and went out.
                  Anna loved her husband; and though she had set her heart upon the new furniture
                     and determined to have it, yet now that she found him so averse to it, and so reasonable and kind, she could not
                     bear to get it. "No," said she, "I should not enjoy it, if he was not pleased,
                     so good bye to my fine hopes." So she smoothed her glossy ringlets, kissed her
                     babe, and on the return of her husband, threw her arms around his neck and
                     said, "I have concluded not to have the new furniture, Charles; you are such a
                     good husband, I love to please you; and besides, when you talk as you did
                     to-day, the furniture looks somehow unimportant, and I don't care so much about
                     it."
                  Several years passed, bringing with them many pleasant hours to Charles Horton
                     and his wife, and a baby brother for the little boy playing around the house,
                     but Anna said no more about changing the furniture. By the judicious teachings
                     and correct example of her husband, Anna had been led to the Saviour, and
                     though the world, and her own heart, made her many struggles, yet she had much
                     enjoyment with Charles in religious subjects.
                  Charles' business had prospered, and at the close of a few years he found
                     himself in the possession of what he considered a competency; and though this
                     was lent to a great extent, or in the hands of debtors, yet making all
                     allowance for bad debts, he felt quite sure he was at least independent of
                     fear; but, alas! we know not what a day may bring forth. The next week he found
                     some difficulty in getting in funds to meet some notes—the next, some heavy
                     failures drew largely upon him, and finally, a large amount of borrowed money
                     was wanting at the time promised him, and upon which he had depended, and he
                     found himself in a vortex from which he saw no escape but to place himself in
                     the hands of his creditors and begin anew. But how would Anna bear this? What
                     effect would this unexpected blow have upon her? He went home and told her
                     all—and asked her whether he should go on, or stop—face the disgrace of a
                     failure, or go on building himself up upon borrowed money and toiling to pay
                     the interest, till in years he might come out square.
                  A slight pallor overspread the countenance of Anna as she heard him, but she
                     hesitated not a moment: "No, dear Charles, do not go on—do what is right, and
                     God will bless you finally—what is the opinion of the world, so we have the
                     approbation of our own hearts and of God. Let us begin again, we have, once,
                     and have we not been happy? and can we not again? Come now, cheer up dear, and
                     be yourself again, have you not me, and the two rogues in the corner there, to
                     comfort you? This was balm to the heart of Charles; the Providence was dark,
                     but he could not help thinking good was to come out of it: lighter and happier
                     he went about his settlement while every evening brought him to a happy
                     fireside.
                  But, ah! Anna was mortal: she loved Charles, so she comforted him: she loved
                     him, so she did not tell him all her feelings, but in secret she repined—she
                     murmured against God; she thought God had dealt wrong with her husband, who had
                     worked so hard and was so devoted a Christian; she thought of the thousands he
                     had given to benevolent and religious objects, and she wanted them back—she
                     thought of all the pretty things she herself had forgone in years past, and now
                     it proved of no use, and she said in her heart "wherefore should we serve
                     him?—is he not a God afar off?"
                  But though these rebellious feelings made her unhappy, yet day by day she
                     received all the consolation she could have, in the good opinion expressed of
                     her husband by those who were most acquainted with his affairs, and who stood
                     high in the community, by the marked attention of many to herself, and what is
                     a more sure test, by the refusal of all to have an article removed from the
                     house for their benefit, and by offers of money and aid from various sources.
                     True, there were a few narrow-minded despicable people, who shook their heads
                     as Anna appeared as usual with a few ornaments; (mostly bridal gifts;) and
                     there were a few fashionable friends who immediately became near-sighted, and
                     overlooked her, but in the society she loved and respected, she was received
                     with more than usual regard. Yet these comforts were not the "true comfort
                     which cometh down from above." Anna did not fully acquiesce in the Divine will;
                     she had been tried and found wanting; early habits of thought had still their
                     sway. But an event was approaching which proved decisive.
                  Charles, in consequence of his business troubles, had been over-wrought,
                     over-excited—and neglecting a slight cold, was prostrated by typhus fever—for
                     five long days and nights, his life was despaired of—on the third night, the
                     youngest child was taken with
                     croup—the next day the little cherub was worse—the next night, the physician
                     told Anna, there must be some change before morning, and he could not tell
                     whether it would be for better or worse. Anna bent over the crib
                     of her dying boy, her heart throbbing with his every spasm, as none but a
                     mother's can; the awful respiration of the croup convulsed her very soul, and
                     as he turned his blue eyes upon her with a look which seemed to say "do help
                     me, mama," she was agonized.
                  She went to her husband, and bending over, listened to his delirious
                     ravings—she heard her own name pronounced, and a prayer ejaculated for her, and
                     as the doctor felt his pulse and gave her no encouragement, she turned and went
                     back to her child—and yet she was calm—calm in her agony; for she had given
                     herself to God. The last two days had shown her to herself, and she felt she
                     deserved all that had come upon her; the furnace of affliction was doing its
                     work, and she resigned herself into the hands of God; and as she bowed her head
                     upon the little crib, and seemed to see the eternal world opening to receive
                     her loved ones, and leave her in loneliness behind, she vowed, by the grace of
                     God, to live no longer for earth. "Not my will, but thine be done," she
                     exclaimed, and the future of my life shall be dedicated to thee. Ah! amid the
                     watches of that dismal night, the Spirit of God was hovering to bless and
                     purify his child. The morning came—the crisis was past, and the child
                     lived!
                  Mother, have you ever fretted at the care and trouble of your children? O could
                     you have the discipline of such an hour, should you ever see one of the sweet
                     little faces that has nestled so oft in your bosom, convulsed in death,
                     snatched from your love, or even apparently near its end, you would never
                     forget the lesson. Think of this then, when your little one wearies you, and
                     love will render you patient.
                  But to return to Charles—judicious treatment, and a good constitution, with the
                     blessing of heaven, finally conquered the disease; a long convalescence
                     followed, with its trials and cares to Anna, but she felt them not—she was a
                     changed woman—God had shown her the transitory nature of all earthly things—the
                     folly of placing her affections upon money or friends, or anything short of
                     himself, the fountain of true happiness; she had been shown too the difference
                     between losing riches and honors, and losing those dearer to her than life
                     itself.
                  Anna was now happy. She sighed not for the gewgaws she once coveted, but her
                     highest desire was to fit herself more fully to perform her part as a
                        Christian mother and wife. After a time, Charles again became a
                     successful merchant; they chose a residence a few miles out of the city. When I
                     saw them, they were enjoying all that human beings can enjoy. Their friends are
                     chosen ones, and valued for their piety, or their learning, or something more
                     than merely their wealth; and Anna told me, while tears of joy suffused her
                     eyes at her own escape, "God forbid I should ever bring up my
                     daughters, to set an undue value upon gentility, wealth, or the 'fashion of
                     this world,' which passeth away."
               
            
            
               AT HOME IN THE EVENING.
               ONE of the grossest neglects of a youth, producing incalculable mischief and ruin,
                  is the spending of his evenings. Darkness is temptation to misconduct; suffering
                  the youth to be out, when the light of day does not restrain them from misconduct,
                  is training them to it. We have already an abundant harvest of this seeding.
                  Riots, mobs, crimes, giving fearful foreboding, are the results of youth becoming
                  fit agents of outrage, by running, uncared for, in the evenings. What we see in
                  these respects is deplorable enough—but what is this compared with what we do not
                  see—multitudes making themselves miserable and noxious to the world, and what is
                  that to come to? Parents should look at the truth, that pleasures and recreations
                  are often dearly purchased—the price of their own impaired comfort, and the
                  blighted prospects of their offspring. Heads of families must learn that the place
                  on earth best adapted to be a blessing is home; and, by example and wholesome
                  restraint, they must teach this truth to all under them.
            
            
            
               
               PASSING AWAY.
               BY MRS. C. H. PARMELY.
               
                  WE are passing away—we are passing away
                  From the scenes that we love; passing on to decay—
                  Though we dream we may stay in their sunlight to roam,
                  Yet we haste ever on to our rest in the tomb.
               
               
                  From this beautiful earth and its soft sighing breeze,
                  From the gay birds that sing in its tall forest trees,
                  From the bright winged insects that sport in its bowers,
                  From its fountains and streamlets, its sunshine and flowers
               
               
                  We are passing away—we are passing away:—
                  Every pulse that we tell, breathes a note of decay—
                  Every sigh is a tell-tale of sorrow or care
                  That is hung round the heart, like a pall of despair.
               
               
                  We are passing away—we are passing away;
                  And the hearts' fondest loves are the first that decay;
                  Like some dear angel-form in our midst they arise,
                  And then turn them away to their own native skies.
               
               
                  As the sweet, tiny flowers, in their beauty decay—
                  As the light softly fails at the parting of day—
                  As the breeze dies away on the lullaby wave—
                  So we pass to our rest in the night of the grave.
               
               
                  But the morning will dawn, and we rise light and free,
                  Like a starry-winged bird o'er the billowy sea;
                  When we turn us from earth, with the angels to roam,
                  By the river of Life, in our lovely sweet home.
               
               
                  And the loved and the lost, shall we greet on that shore
                  Where no farewell is heard, and its tear falls no more—
                  Where no sigh heaves the bosom with grief or distress,
                  And no sin and no death reach the home of the blest.
               
            
            
               SCENE IN A RAIL CAR.
               TAKING a seat in the cars, at the city of B—, we proceeded up the way, parallel
                  with the beautiful Merrimac, till we reached one of the inland cities, without
                  anything, unusual in a rail car, transpiring. While the hostlery of our iron horse
                  was going on at the depot, passengers were leaving and entering the cars as usual,
                  the latter monopolizing the recently vacated seats, as fast as circumstances would
                  permit. About five minutes before starting on our course, a woman came in, leading
                  a little boy, who might have been six years of age. She took a seat directly in
                  front, and facing towards me. She must have been very beautiful when younger. She
                  was so still; but the cheerful buoyancy of girlhood was gone, and gave place to a
                  melancholy sweetness of countenance, which told of a heart ill at ease, and pained
                  me to look upon. She might have been thirty-five years of age, or younger; for
                  sorrow has a wonderful facility of adding the look and burden of years even to the
                  youthful. I wondered if she were a widow! but no mourning weeds were visible
                  outside of those lustrous, dark, and sorrowful eyes. Who could abuse a being so
                  gentle! My surmises were brought to an abrupt close by the sudden entrance and
                  hasty approach of a red-faced, thickset man, who threw himself upon the same seat,
                  and commenced an angry and reproachful inquiry of her, why she entered the cars
                  before he came—did he not tell her to wait?—and now he "had run about everywhere
                  searching for them in vain, till he was tired to death."
                     Selfish man! She had not been in the cars over three minutes, and
                  he had fretted himself into a fever of passion, which he was now venting upon her.
                  And for what was all this? The poor wife, in a gentle and pleading voice,
                  answered—"the cars were fast filling up, and she feared she would not be able to
                  obtain a seat." That was nothing—she should have waited for him. She made no more
                  answer to his continued ill-temper, but her fine eyes were filled with tears, and
                  the pearly drops were just escaping from the fringed lids, when she drew her thick
                  veil over her face, and shut out the too
                  earnest gaze of the intruder, to be alone with her grief. But the veil was lifted
                  from his character, and the cause of her sorrow was revealed at a
                  glance. It was no momentary weakness on her part, that caused the overflow of
                  crystal waters; but her heart was torn and lacerated by constant and long-repeated
                  unkindness, till the fountain was full to out-pouring, and needed but the smallest
                  pressure to cause them to go over all the barriers. She was wedded to a brutish,
                  selfish man, who was neither able nor desirous of appreciating her worth; who
                  trampled her under the foot of his desires, regarding her in no other light than
                  that of a slave to do his bidding. In fact, there could not be a particle of real
                  sympathy between them. They were mis-matched.
               One thing puzzled me. How such a woman could love such a man, and consent to
                  become his. I could think of but one solution. It was this: He was
                  aware of her great beauty—might perhaps often have heard it spoken of, and
                  resolved to make the prize his own; and to accomplish it, had used every art he
                  was capable of. His earnestness she might have taken for an excess of feeling, and
                  the human heart, ever ready to interpret beautiful devotion in its own favor, made
                  a mistake in this case.
               It was not all dark in her condition, however; there was a brighter shade, a light
                  spot in the darkness, an angel of consolation lent her by heaven,—"God be praised
                  for the loan,"—so that the heart was not utterly desolate: her darling boy. While
                  my thoughts were busy coming to the above conclusion, he quietly crept up under
                  his mother's veil, and placing his soft lips to hers, whispered something. Dear
                  little boy, how my heart blessed him for that kiss! She pressed him to her heart,
                  and he slid down from her arms, and whispered to the other parent, who was swaying
                  to and fro in his seat, wiping his face vigorously to remove the moisture, which
                  had now become a new source of irritation. The three arose and passed into the
                  saloon at the other end of the car, and I saw them no more; but my silent prayer
                  arose to God—"Oh, spare the lad for its mother's sake."
               The incident was a common-place one; no other one perhaps observed it but myself,
                  and it left a strong feeling of sympathy in my mind, which does not pass away. I
                  thought of the intimate relation which subsists between parent and child; that
                  this strong sympathy is in many cases mutual; but I fear parents are to blame in
                  many cases, that it is not more general. I can overlook a great many faults in a
                  child who shows a respect and consideration for his mother. It is one of the most
                  lovely traits of character a child can be possessed of. It is natural and
                  perfectly consistent for it to be so. On the contrary, I can but look with
                  loathing and disgust upon any one, however accomplished in other respects, who is
                  unkind or disrespectful to her. The child's happiness depends upon a prompt and
                  willing obedience. And oh, mothers! remember this, and so train your loved ones,
                  that "they shall rise up and call you blessed."

               THE ORPHAN'S DREAM.
               
                  MOTHER, my sleep is sweet
                  Whene'er I dream of thee,
                  When my young thoughts so fleet
                  Upward to Heaven flee.
               
               
                  Last night I dreamed that thou
                  Hadst come to earth once more;
                  I kissed thy beauteous brow,
                  As I had done before.
               
               
                  I twined thy dark brown hair
                  Around my little hands;
                  And weeping breathed my prayer,
                  "Oh stay death's dread commands!
               
               
                  I gazed into thine eye,
                  I pressed my lips to thine,
                  "O mother, do not die,
                  And leave thy Florentine!"
               
               
                  "No, I shall never die,"
                  Thy sweet voice answered me:
                  "My home is now on high,
                  And there is room for thee.
               
               
               
                  "Death never enters here
                  To take a friend away;
                  No gloomy graveyard's near
                  Filled with the damp decay.
               
               
                  "Here songs of love are sung,
                  In strains that swell divine;
                  Here golden harps are strung
                  To Heavenly music's chime."
               
               
                  Thy story makes me glad,
                  Dear Mother, up in Heaven,
                  I'll never more be sad,
                  When a harp to me is given.
               
               
                  O Mother, when I wake,
                  My spirit longs to come;
                  Ask Jesus Christ to take
                  His little wanderer Home.
               
               
                  Then I will be with thee,
                  In that bright, happy land;
                  And my dear Father see,
                  A blest, unbroken band.

               HUMAN HOPES.
               BY HENRY C. FORD.
               THE gloomy darkness of night is fading before the advancing dawn, and gray beams
                  of light steal gradually into a narrow apartment, where a fond mother reposes by
                  the side of a lovely child. Brighter and brighter glance the rays through the
                  half-drawn curtain, till a sudden burst of golden sunlight pierces even the closed
                  eyelids of the sleeper.
               The mother, roused from her repose, for a moment gazes affectionately on the
                  confiding countenance of her little one, and imprinting a kiss on the passive lips
                  of her sleeping child, breathes a prayer of thankfulness to Heaven for the
                  protection of herself and only son. Alas for the sunrise of human
                  hopes!
               The orb of day has long since passed the meridian, and the crimson hue of the
                  western clouds already betokens his departure to be near at hand. His fading rays
                  illumine the same small room; but the dim chamber no longer echoes to the ringing
                  laugh of the noisy prattler. Stillness is there; the solemn hush of living ones,
                  hiding their grief, lest any unwonted sound disturb the uneasy rest of the dying
                  child.
               The mother bends anxiously over her boy, as if seeking to obtain some glance of
                  recognition. In vain she listens; her ear catches no sound save the short gasping
                  for breath, and the suppressed moan. With painful gaze she strives to read the
                  thoughts concealed in the deep recesses of those mild blue eyes. The dull, vacant
                  stare of unconsciousnesss, is returned for the intense glance of affection.
               The breath grows weaker with the receding light. Darkness comes rapidly on. Reason
                  returns to the wandering eye of the sufferer. One glance, one faint ray of
                  light—the soul and the sun have taken their flight together. It is
                     sunset, and a night of darkness and gloom overshadows all.
               
               Kind and sympathizing friends condole with the bereaved mourner; they tell of a
                  land where her child dwells in eternal happiness. Their words are unheeded—she
                  hears them not.
               Opening the door, she passes into the garden—and seats herself within a rustic
                  arbor. She gives way to her pent-up agony—the silence of the evening air is broken
                  by the low wailings of deep sorrow. She bends the knee, and gazing upwards, a ray
                  of light rivets her attention—it is a star shining through the crevice of the
                  roof.
               The mourner hopes; she believes it to be a token from God, that her boy is an
                  inhabitant of the shining realm above. Adoring Him for His mercy, she rises calm
                  and subdued in spirit, and treads the path leading to her lonely home, rejoicing
                  that she, by submission to her Father's will on earth, may hereafter meet her lost
                  one in Heaven! And the faint, though steady glimmering of starlight
                  whispers hope to the mourner's soul.
            
            
            
               
               ONLY A PENNY, MOTHER.
               CHARLIE OSMAND is an active little boy, ten years old. He has an affectionate
                  heart, and loves his parents and all his friends dearly, and his playmates and
                  schoolfellows too. He sometimes is out of humor and gets angry; but smiles and
                  laughs more than he frowns, and really seems to pick up enjoyment almost
                  everywhere. He learns rapidly, loves to read, and is generally able to give his
                  parents and others a very correct idea of the contents of every book he reads.
               But he does love fun and play; and if by any means he can get permission for an
                  hour to join a group of boys on the sidewalk or in the open field, he is
                  delighted. And he has withal such a coaxing, persuasive manner, that his mother
                  sometimes thinks he has a little extra affection laid up in store, to manifest
                  toward her, when he has some favorite point to gain.
               The other day he came bounding home from school, with his history, arithmetic,
                  speller and definer, closely buckled, and hanging at the end of a little strap,
                  which his father had succeeded in convincing him would answer about as well
                  (especially in these hard times) as a satchel, which would cost fifty cents or a
                  dollar; and, carrying them into his mother's room, laid them down, saying with a
                  tone of satisfaction, "I was all perfect to-day, mother!" Then putting his arms
                  around her neck, said, "Mother, will you please let me go around to Mr. Burke's,
                  and buy me a gungeon?—It will cost only a penny, mother."
               Hark! do I hear a little boy in the country asking, "What can a
                  gungeon be?" Just so Charlie's mother asked, and he replied, "Why, to play shinny
                  with."
               "And I would like to know what shinny is," asks another little fellow; and as
                  neither gungeon nor shinny are to be found in Webster, we must tell him what we
                  have learned from seeing the play. A "gungeon" is a hard ball, and playing
                  "shinny" is beating this ball about on the ground. We suppose this play has some
                  rules by which it is done, and that there is a victory won in some way; at any
                  rate, the boys seem to enjoy it wonderfully for a while. Now Charlie's mother had
                  seen him for days, during his play hour, beating a little bit of brick, a block,
                  or an old shoe about the yard, and had been somewhat annoyed with the clinking of
                  an old tin dipper, on the brick pavement, as it had in turn been made to serve in
                  place of a ball, so she granted his request, as "it would cost only a
                     penny."
               Off he ran, as brisk as a deer, and soon returned with his ball; and many an antic
                  did that little ball cut about the yard. First, nestling in the grass, then
                  rolling into the gutter, next hiding in a corner under the rose bush, and again
                  stealing through a sly opening under the fence, making him give a close hunt for
                  it every now and then. But what if it should be entirely lost? "Oh, it cost
                     only a penny?" Happy, thoughtless child! How many are starving,
                  who would call blessings on your head for a penny's worth of bread! and how many
                  children are shivering with the cold, that the price of your ball, and a few other
                  boys' balls might make warm and comfortable!
               But we will track Charlie and his ball a few days longer, and see whether it cost
                  him "only a penny." Not long after its purchase, he was, as usual
                  after school, tossing and knocking his ball about the yard, when, in his glee, he
                  unwittingly drove it through a pane of glass in the parlor window. Chink, chink,
                  went the pieces of glass, inside on to the floor, and outside on to the pavement:
                  and down went Charlie's face to its soberest length; for the panes of glass were
                  large, and he knew that it would cost a good many pennies to get it replaced. His
                  mother observed him from her window above, as he stood looking at the destruction
                  his sport had made. He had been cautioned about the windows, and as soon as he saw
                  his mother, said, as if that would make full reparation for the injury, "I'll pay
                  for it, mother, out of my own money."
               But do you not think that the settlement of the bill would have made Charlie a
                  bankrupt, and obliged him to have made an assignment of his property as men do?
                  for the glazier called for fifty cents when he had put in the new glass. Little
                  did Charlie think how much his ball would cost somebody, and as little do men and
                  women think how much their coveted pleasures and acquisitions will finally cost them! Happy would it be for many
                  if the desolation they cause could be repaired for money.
               But we have not done with the boy and his ball yet. The danger of breaking another
                  window, if he continued to play shinny in the yard, added to a strong desire he
                  had to play with a few other boys, (who, he assured his mother, were good boys,
                  for they had a rule, to play with no boy who was bad or said wicked words,) in an
                  unoccupied lot near by, no doubt prompted him to ask, "Please let me go in the old
                  lumber yard and play shinny a little while." As it was in full view of her window,
                  and within call, his mother granted the request. When called to supper, Charlie
                  appeared at the table, with a very large bunch swollen on his forehead and around
                  one eye, and when asked the cause, replied, mournfully, "I was looking for my ball
                  along by the fence, and fell over a stick of timber, and my head came on to a
                  great rough stone." That night his head ached badly, and so it did for two or
                  three days, beside making him look as if deformed, for the ugly bunch remained a
                  long time, and after a little it grew black, and when the Sabbath came, he was
                  ashamed to go to church, lest people would think he had been fighting. And when we
                  saw him the other day, the bruise had turned green all around the eye, and his
                     ball, which had first cost one penny, then
                     fifty pennies, then a bruised and painful head, had been taken by
                  a larger boy, and knocked so hard with a club, that it burst open and was good for
                  nothing.
               Now, children, do you suppose that Charlie enjoyed pleasure enough in those few
                  days to pay him for all he lost and suffered? Remember this story, when you ask
                  for some toy or plaything, and plead that it "costs only a penny, or a sixpence,
                  or a shilling." And remember it, too, when you become large children, when you
                  plead with your parents and consciences for a little indulgence in pleasure and
                  sin: remember, it may cost you more than the first
                  price. It may cost your health—your happiness—your reputation—your life—your
                  soul.

                        WHERE wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare if thou
                           hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof? or who hath
                           stretched the line upon it?
                        Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner
                           stone thereof?

               The constructions of human genius and ingenuity, challenge our admiration and
                  praise. Our children hear with eager astonishment of the pyramids of Egypt; of the
                  magnificent ruins of Greece and Rome; and of our own Central America. They trace
                  with minutest care the halls and temples of Nineveh and Babylon which a Layard has
                  disentombed, and gaze with delight on the representations of castles and turrets,
                  which were reared for glory and defence, amid the chivalry and national strifes of
                  past generations in Great Britain, and on the continent of Europe. Their eyes run
                  from base to pinnacle of Westminster Abbey, St. Peter's at Rome, and the monument
                  on Bunker Hill; and expand with wonder as they calculate their height from some
                  human figures, or common building, shown in the picture.
               The subject of our engraving is a rocky castle, reared by the Great Architect of
                  the universe; which has withstood for ages the leagued forces of the elements.
                  From its lofty battlements nature has looked down upon her undisputed broad domain
                  of rock, and plain and river, calmly bidding defiance to art in her proudest
                  structures, to equal her in grandeur and stability.
               It is situated on the bank of the upper Missouri, near the Rocky Mountains, in a
                  region where none but the wildest tribes of Indians rove during the game season,
                  and where only a few trappers, and an occasional adventurer have ever explored.
                  But there it stands in that wilderness, a monument of the handiwork of God,
                  defying the elements and the wasting hand of time. A few stunted pines and shrubs
                  have vegetated in the fissures of the rocks, and some grass grows in the deep
                  ravines and gorges, to give food to the few buffaloes and antelopes that may
                  chance to stray thither in summer; and
                  some delicate vines creep up the sides, and hang pendant from those rugged rocks,
                  at whose base flows the softly gliding river:—so strangely mingled are the
                  beautiful and the awfully grand in nature's works. There, as everywhere, they show
                  forth the attributes of Jehovah—terrible power and infinite goodness. "He
                  thundereth with his voice," and "maketh the earth to tremble," yet notices the
                  falling sparrow, and "speaketh peace to his people:"—"Heaven is his throne, and
                  earth is his footstool," yet he listens to the breath of prayer, and dwells with
                  the contrite sinner, and calls him his son.
               
                  
                     "His smile gives beauty to the flower,
                     His anger to the tempest power."
                  
               
               This range of rocky battlements on the Missouri, between the Yellow Stone and
                  Marias rivers are called "Stone Walls," by the mountain men. They present every
                  variety of shape and aspect, often sublimely beautiful, and then wildly terrific.
                  The highest point of the castle is about six hundred feet above the river. The
                  rock is a species of sandstone, of various colors in the same cliff, and appears
                  to have been formed of earthy substance. The snows and rains of past ages have
                  washed away all the loose portions, leaving the harder part, in the fantastic
                  shapes of towers, ruined castles, and lofty spires in which they now appear.
               Further down the slope of the mountains, interspersed among the peaks, are tracts
                  of undulating land, of thin soil, which might furnish support for a population,
                  which preferred pure mountain air and strength, to the wealth and unhealthiness of
                  a richer soil. Or, those mountain fastnesses may yet prove the Piedmont of
                  America, the wilderness to which the church shall be driven to hide from the last
                  pursuit of her enemy.
               But of the purpose for which they were reared, it is vain to search. In their
                  lonely, desolate grandeur, like the gems in ocean's caves, they testify of a
                  "Great First Cause." Who can look at them and not adore that Power, which "piled
                  the mountains high!" Who so vain and impious as to ascribe such wondrous work to
                  chance?
               
                  MRS. M. G. CLARKE.
               
            
            
               THE WIFE OF SAMUEL PEARCE.
               BY REV. DR. BELCHER.
               
                  TENS of thousands of Christians in this country have read the Memoirs of "the
                     seraphic Samuel Pearce," of England, written by Andrew Fuller, more than half a
                     century ago; and little doubt can exist that they will be useful to thousands
                     more, for generations yet to come. But who knows any thing of his "beloved
                     Sarah," the wife of his early love, the mother of his children? She who made
                     his home happy, who sympathized in his sorrows and joys, and who was united
                     with him in desire to serve Christ in the Missionary Vineyard. She was worthy
                     of the love fixed on her by very many of the followers of Christ. The writer of
                     this page can well remember, though fifty-four years ago, the visit of this
                     lovely woman, to his dying mother, but a few weeks after Mr. Pearce's removal,
                     and the sweet words of comfort she uttered, and the tears of tenderness she
                     shed, as she took him and his sister, with her own two children who accompanied
                     her—William and Hannah, both of whom went in after life to labor in the
                     missionary field of India—into another room, apart from the dying mother, to
                     offer prayer to the Father of mercies for their happiness. Nor can it be
                     doubted that those prayers were answered.
                  The excellent lady of whom I am now about to write, was distinguished for
                     devotional piety, amiable disposition, and constant discharge of the duties of
                     retired life. Like the lonely lily of the valley, the fragrance of her
                     character diffused itself where she was not seen. If to appear as president
                     over public meetings, to address crowded assemblies, and constantly to appear
                     before the eye of her husband's church, had been the expectation of the people
                     of whom her devoted husband was pastor, then would they have been disappointed;
                     but if tender regard to the interests of her husband and family, deep
                     sympathizing spirit with the afflicted, and attractive and affectionate
                     conversation with all with whom she came into contact, might be considered her
                     duty, then was she a model pastor's
                     wife. It is certain that her holy example effected much good while she lived,
                     and has made her name fragrant even till now.
                  Sarah Hopkins was the daughter of eminently pious parents at Alcester, about
                     twenty miles from Birmingham, where both her husband and herself died. Her
                     early life was lovely and retiring, and her extreme jealousy of her heart
                     caused her long hesitation before she could venture on the solemnly important
                     duty of professing her faith in Christ,—a duty, indeed, which was not
                     discharged till after her marriage. With trembling anxiety she ventured to
                     accept an offer of marriage from Mr. Pearce; candidly expressing her fears that
                     she was unfit to be the wife of such a minister. Happily no one thought so but
                     herself, and delightful indeed to the whole church was the day which witnessed,
                     a few months after her marriage, the public dedication of herself to Christ and
                     his people. Her heart most cordially embraced the truths of the Gospel;
                     ardently did she love the revealed character of God, and constantly did she
                     cherish the doctrines which humbled the sinner before God, and promoted
                     holiness of heart and life. Whatever she could do to promote the prosperity of
                     the church to which she belonged, or to extend the kingdom of Christ abroad,
                     was most cheerfully accomplished.
                  What heart does not beat quicker in reading a passage like this, in a letter
                     from Mr. Pearce to an intimate friend, but a few weeks before marriage:—"The
                     last morning that I spent at Alcester, was the most pleasant by far. We entered
                     on the useful subject of experimental heart-religion. I was joyfully satisfied
                     that Miss H. was no stranger to it. That half-hour's converse added tenfold
                     strength to the bands of my attachment, and sent me from Alcester, forgetting
                     the pains of parting, in ardent gratitude to my heavenly Father." Nor is our
                     interest lessened,—even though the event occurred sixty-three years ago, and
                     the parties have long passed from earth,—as we read another line to the same
                     friend:—"The occasion of my writing is a source of joy inexpressible to
                     myself—a joy in which I know you will participate. I am no longer a bachelor.
                     Your amiable friend permitted me to call her my own yesterday. One dwelling now
                     contains us both, and Paul's Square contains that dwelling."
                  All who have read Mr. Pearce's Memoirs, must have been delighted with the
                     letter he wrote to her when he was absent from home; in which may be seen how
                     entirely as one with him in devotion and piety, he was assured she felt. Here
                     is one short specimen:—"From a pew in the house of God, at Kettering, with my
                     cup of joy running over, I address my beloved Sarah, by the hands of brother
                     Simmons. Had it pleased Divine Providence to have permitted your accompanying
                     me, my pleasures would have had no small addition; because I should have hoped
                     that you would have been filled with similar consolation, and have received
                     equal edification by the means of grace on which I have attended. Indeed, I
                     never remember to have enjoyed a public meeting to such a high degree since I
                     have been in the habit of attending upon them. Oh that I may return to you, and
                     the church of God, in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ! I
                     hope, my beloved, that you are not without the enjoyment of the sweetness and
                     the supports of the blessed gospel. Oh that you may get and keep near to God,
                     and in Him find infinitely more than you can possibly lose by your husband's
                     absence! Mr. (Robert) Hall preached last evening from 1 Pet. i. 8. A most
                     evangelical and experimental season! I was charmed and warmed. Oh that Jesus
                     may go on to reveal himself to us as altogether lovely! I am unable to write
                     more now. To-day I set off for Northampton, and preach there to-night. The Lord
                     bless you."
                  My readers will remember, that in less than eight years after marriage, Mr.
                     Pearce was removed by the hand of death. Consumption had long marked him for
                     its victim, and October 10th, 1799, was his last day on earth. Standing by his
                     bedside, Mrs. Pearce repeated:— 
                        
                           "Since all that I meet shall work for my good,
                           The bitter is sweet, the medicine is food;
                           Though painful at present, 'twill cease before long,
                           And then, oh, how pleasant the conqueror's song!"
                        
                     
                  
                  He repeated, with an inexpressible smile, the last words, "The conqueror's
                     song!"
                  He said once, "Oh, my dear! What shall I do? But why do I complain? He makes all my bed in my sickness."
                     She then repeated the lines:— 
                        
                           'Jesus can make a dying bed
                           Feel soft as downy pillows are."
                        
                     
                  
                  "Yes," he replied, "he can, he does, I feel it."
                  The reader will not be surprised that eleven weeks after this sad event, Mrs.
                     Pearce thus wrote to a lady Christian friend, at Bristol:—"In vain, alas! in
                     vain, I seek him whose presence gave a zest to every enjoyment! I wander about
                     the house as one bereft of her better half. I go into the study—I say to
                     myself, 'there is the chair he occupied, there are the books he read; but
                     where, oh where is the owner?' I come into the parlor—there my
                     tenderest feelings are awakened by four fatherless children. The loss of him
                     with whom I have been accustomed to go up to the house of God diminishes, ah, I
                     may say too frequently deprives me of my enjoyment while there.
                        Ichabod, Ichabod, seems written upon all my former pleasures!
                     But let me no longer sadden you by dwelling upon a subject too interesting to
                     my tender feelings ever to be forgotten by me. Nor would I arraign that
                     all-wise and benevolent Being, who has a right to do what he will. No, my dear
                     friend, I wish to love, adore, and praise, though I cannot discover his
                     designs, or suppress painful feelings at his dispensations towards me. Oh that
                     I may indeed 'know him' in all his ways, and feel my mind more immediately
                     devoted to him, and resigned to his will! I desire to be thankful I have not
                     been altogether without those consolations which true religion affords."
                  The reader will have observed that Mrs. Pearce speaks in this letter of her
                        four children. She had, indeed, five, but William,
                     the eldest, afterwards an excellent missionary, had been taken into the family
                     of a valued minister, who sustained him for many years. Death soon again
                     visited the widow and fatherless.
               
               
                  THE WIFE OF SAMUEL PEARCE.
                  CHAPTER II.
                  OUR first paper relating to this admirable Christian lady, closed with an
                     intimation that death, not long after Mr. Pearce's removal, again visited the
                     mourning family. Mrs. Pearce shall herself furnish an account of the sad event,
                     in a letter to her dear friend, the wife of the late Rev. F. Franklin, of
                     Coventry. The reader will kindly remember that the writer was now from home,
                     visiting her relatives, and that the letter was written just nine months after
                     the death of her husband:—"After an illness of a few days, it hath pleased the
                     great Arbiter of life and death to bereave me of my dear little boy, aged one
                     year and six months; and thus again to convince me of the uncertainty of all
                     earthly joys; and bring to remembrance my past sorrows. He was in my fond eyes
                     one of the fairest flowers human nature ever exhibited; but ah! he is dropt at
                     an early period. Yet the hope of his being transplanted into a more congenial
                     clime, there to re-bloom in everlasting vigor; and the reflection that if he
                     had lived, he had unavoidably been exposed to innumerable temptations, from
                     which, if my life were spared, I should yet be unable to guard him, make me
                     still. Though I feel as a parent, and I hope as a Christian, yet I can resign
                     him. Oh, could I feel but half the resignation respecting the loss of my
                     beloved Pearce! But I cannot. Still bleeds the deep, deep wound; and a return
                     to Birmingham is a return to the most poignant feelings. I wish,
                     however, to resign him to the hand that gave, and that had an unquestionable
                     right to take away. Be still then, every tumultuous passion, and know that he
                     who hath inflicted these repeated strokes, is GOD; that God whom I desire to
                     reverence under every painful dispensation, being persuaded that what I know
                     not now, I shall know hereafter.'
                  Who can be surprised that feelings like these long continued? Five months after
                     this she again writes to the same friend, and though the letter is long, yet there is so much
                     that will interest and instruct the reader, that I will transcribe it:
                  "My dear children gone to bed, a clean hearth, a cheerful fire, but a dejected
                     mind,—what will have a greater tendency to dissipate that dejection than to
                     converse awhile with my dear friend Mrs. F.? Yet she must prepare herself for
                     Ezekiel's roll. You will not wonder at this, when I tell you, that within the
                     last half hour I have been comparing my present evenings with those two years
                     ago, when my beloved Pearce and myself were accustomed to sit together, and
                     talk over the events of the past day, and look forward to the probable ones of
                     the next; and when he would give the gentle caution where necessary, and direct
                     me when in difficulty. But now, alas, a sad reverse succeeds! A solitary
                     fire-place, and a necessity of acting alone; and whatever difficulties arise,
                     there is no one to direct me. But God is just; and let me not repine, though I
                     must needs feel the change.
                  
                     
                        'Why sinks my weak, desponding mind;
                        Why heaves my heart the anxious sigh?
                        Can sovereign goodness be unkind;
                        Am I not safe if GOD be nigh?'
                     
                  
                  "Oh yes, if he be nigh, I want no more. This storm, though violent, will be but
                     short. A few more blasts, a few more sighs, and I hope to arrive where sighing,
                     sinning, and parting from those we love, shall be done away. Oh glorious
                     anticipation! 'Tis this, 'tis this supports thy friend while steering the
                     tempestuous ocean of widowhood.
                  "I was glad to hear that your dear babe was nearly recovered. May you long
                     enjoy it, and may it be an increasing comfort to you. But do not do as I
                     did—love it too well to part with it with cheerfulness when God calls. Oh, that
                     dear loved name, Samuel,—how many pangs has it since cost me!
                     There is no SAMUEL PEARCE now! But why do I thus complain? Oh, my rebellious
                     passions! Often do I exclaim, 
                        
                           'You who love the Lord indeed,
                           Tell me, is it thus with you?'
                        
                     
                  
                  "Since I saw you my heart has been rent with passions that are indescribable,
                     and which I shudder to reflect upon. But let me speak it with unfeigned
                     gratitude; I have felt for this last week, a degree of resignation, to which,
                     ever since I lost my beloved Pearce, I was before a stranger. From comparing my
                     own insignificance with the greatness of the hand that has visited me, and who,
                     though he smote me, as I fear, in wrath, yet hath remembered mercy, my spirit
                     has bowed to his sovereign will. I have also felt that it is of the Lord's
                     mercies I am not consumed. I had said, by my thoughts and actions, 'Let all go:
                     there is nothing worth keeping.' Why then was I not deprived of every comfort,
                     seeing I made so light of what was left? To what a state should I have been
                     reduced, had the Lord taken me at my word! But oh, cheering thought! He is a
                     God full of compassion, who does not afflict willingly; and I believe I shall
                     see, in the end, that all which has befallen me is for my profit!"
                  In 1794, during an absence from home, Mr. Pearce wrote to his wife in reference
                     to one of his children:—"I long to know how our dear Louisa's pulse beats: I
                     fear still feverish. We must not, however, suffer ourselves to be infected with
                     a mental fever on this account. Is she ill? It is right. Is she very ill . . .
                     . . dying? It is still right. Is she gone to join the heavenly choristers? It
                     is all right, notwithstanding our repinings. Repinings! No; we will not
                     repine." The dear child then recovered, but alas! not to attain to maturity. In
                     April, 1801, Mrs. Pearce thus wrote to Mrs. Franklin:—"My dear Louisa is so
                     ill, that I have many fears on her account. Oh, my dear friend, a prospect the
                     most distant of another bereavement, involves my mind in gloom. Pray for us,
                     that my heart may be fortified for the worst. She has been to me an interesting
                     child; and my fond heart has been pleasing itself, that in a few years I should
                     find in her a companion. Are you not astonished, that after so many
                     disappointments, I should still be cleaving to creatures? Yet so it is. No
                     sooner am I deprived of one comfort, than I grow insensibly to another,—till
                     disappointed again of this, I am compelled to feel the vanity of all below. I
                     want to have my will entirely absorbed in the will of my heavenly Father; and
                     at times it is my most earnest prayer, that he would not remove his chastising
                     hand till the end is accomplished for which it is laid upon me; and that he
                     would give me strength to endure his
                     will. But surely I must be an untoward child to need such repeated and severe
                     discipline. Pray for me."
                  But I fear I am extending this memoir beyond its due limits, and so will leave
                     several letters untouched. An extract from one more, however, may be permitted.
                     Its date was October 12, 1801, two years and two days after the death of her
                     husband, and just at the period of proclaiming what was afterwards called the
                     short peace between England and France, which was followed, soon after, by many
                     years of sanguinary war:—"No doubt you have joined in the general joy
                     occasioned by the sound of peace. Never did I experience such
                     sensations as on last Saturday and Sabbath day. You may perhaps recollect that
                     Saturday, October 10, is an ever memorable day to me. I do not know that ever I
                     spent a day more devoted to sadness. My situation is retired—no friend came
                     near me—every painful feeling was again recalled—I indulged it, and my whole
                     heart took its fill of grief. You may suppose I was ill prepared for attending
                     the service of the sanctuary next day; and for awhile I felt a desire of
                     staying at home, but did not think it right to indulge it. At length I summoned
                     resolution and went. While on the road, 'peace! peace!' was
                     sounded in my ears. Every eye beamed gladness; but my poor harp was hung upon
                     the willows. Oh, how I wished to hide myself in a corner, where no eye could
                     see me. I was, however, considerably relieved in the morning, from a sermon by
                     Mr. Giles, of Dartmouth, on our light affliction, which is but for a moment,
                     working out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. My burden
                     was in some measure removed."
                  Such was the general state of the mind of this estimable woman, who gradually,
                     however, became more resigned to the afflictions she suffered. She found, as
                     she said, that "time and reverence for the divine character does that for us
                     which no human power can effect." Early in the month of May, 1804, she became
                     somewhat ill; for eight or nine days, however, no apprehension of danger seems
                     to have been entertained either on the part of herself or her friends. But on
                     the 20th of that month, the fever increased to such a degree, as to induce
                     delirium, which continued till the 25th, when she gently passed to heaven to
                     rejoin her husband before the throne of God and the Lamb; where also she has
                     since met nearly the whole of her family. She died in the thirty-fourth year of
                     her age.
                  One or two sentences relating to her character shall close our sketch. She was
                     remarkable for her warm Christian attachments, in which she was a fit companion
                     for the devoted man who was a few years her husband. Nor was she less devoted
                     to the house of her God; where, in all weathers, though she lived a mile from
                     the meeting-house, and never enjoyed robust health, was she always found. But
                     the most prominent feature of her character was love to the cause of God in
                     connection with Missions. When her husband was seriously contemplating entrance
                     on the Missionary field, she rejoiced his heart by saying, "I hope you will be
                     no more uneasy on my account. For the last two or three days I have been more
                     comfortable than ever in the thought of going. I have considered the steps you
                     are pursuing to know the mind of God, and I think you cannot take more proper
                     ones. When you consult the ministers, you should represent your obstacles as
                     strongly as your inducements; and then, if they advise your going, though the
                     parting from my friends will be almost insupportable, yet I will make myself as
                     happy as I can, and God can make me happy anywhere." The Missionary field was
                     never blessed with their labors, but as long as she lived, she was often able
                     to write passages like this:—"I am just returned from hearing two more of our
                     friends declare, before the church, what God hath done for their souls; and my
                     dear Pearce was the instrument of bringing them out of darkness into marvellous
                     light. Rejoice with me, that the seed so long sown, springs up. Gratitude
                     excites a desire to praise my God, the gracious Giver of every mercy."
               
            
            
            
               
               THE INDIAN MISSIONARY'S WIFE.
               
                  
                     
                        "THE graves of Harriet Newell and Mrs. Judson are hallowed as the shrines
                           of saints, and their memory made a watchword among Christians; yet the
                           Western Valley is full of green and nameless graves, where patient,
                           long-enduring wives and mothers have laid down, worn out by the
                           privations of as severe a missionary field, and 'no man knoweth their
                           sepulchre.'"
                     
                     MRS. H. B. STOWE.
                  
               
               
                  IN the far away West, in the land of the stranger,
                  Where the wolf has its den, and the panther its
                        lair
                  
                  Where the shout of the red man, the wild forest range
                  
                  Exulting in carnage, is borne on the air.
               
               
                  Where the car of the storm-king by whirlwinds is driven,
                  And is heard from afar the loud cataract's roar;
                  Where the pride of the forest by tempest is riven,
                  And the floods roll their tribute to old ocean's shore.
               
               
                  To this gloomy region of deep moral blindness,
                  A messenger, heaven-sent, wended his way,
                  Constrained by His love who, in mercy and kindness,
                  Came to light up our darkness with heaven's bright ray,
               
               
                  With him too was one who her friends had forsaken,
                  Who shared in his toils, wiped the tear from his eye,
                  Who whispered hope's cheer when his courage seemed shaken,
                  Spoke of faith's final conquest, of glory on high.
               
               
                  E'en the heart of the savage was tamed by her sweetness,
                  When she talked about heaven and a dear Saviour's love,
                  And, forgetful of earth, and time's gliding fleetness,
                  Sat enchained by an eloquence warmed from above.
               
               
                  The fallow ground broken, 'gan to spring Eden's flowers,
                  Where lately the thorn and the briar appeared,
                  And the song of Redemption to rise from wild bowers,
                  Where the song of the war-dance, and the revel was heard.
               
               
                  But to this happy circle came sorrow and anguish;
                  For this herald of mercy, with disease was laid low,
                  On a bed of affliction, oh! long did she languish,
                  And the tear of affection down her cheek oft did flow.
               
               
                  Her husband, her children, behind she was leaving,
                  For heaven, sweet heaven, her mansion above;
                  And while for these loved ones, her bosom was heaving,
                  She gave them to God, and died, singing his love.
               
               
                  Far, far from the land of her fond recollection,
                  Her friends dropped the last tear of grief o'er her tomb;
                  But in the great day of the saint's resurrection,
                  Bright convoys of angels will carry her home.
               
               
                  Inscribed on no marble, and unknown in story,
                  Are the deeds which thy "patient endurance" has done;
                  But around thee shall blazon a halo of glory,—
                  When the warfare is ended, the battle is won.
               
               
                  ELPIS.
               
            
            
               BEHIND THE CURTAIN.
               BY MRS. A. M. EDMOND.
               I PASSED my childhood in an old-fashioned house, amply furnished with wide halls
                  and staircases, but quite limited in those convenient resources so highly prized
                  by house-keepers, good closets. But necessity leads to invention. To remedy the
                  deficiency, and meet the wants of a growing family, my mother hung a large curtain
                  across the remote extremity of the upper front hall, and thus provided a
                  substitute.
               She originally intended it should serve as a kind of wardrobe where clothing could
                  be kept safe and secure from dust. But in a very short time the ever ready wit of
                  childhood discovered that behind the
                  curtain was a very nice receptacle for various odd treasures; and accordingly,
                  apples, books, nuts and toys were gradually insinuated, and slyly deposited at
                  intervals, in the boxes and baskets and bundles stored away in this unique
                  wardrobe, to the frequent annoyance of the maternal power. Soon, if anything was
                  lost or mislaid by the young people, the question was asked, "Have you looked
                  behind the curtain, you will find it there?" and the advice followed, was almost
                  sure to be rewarded. The old curtain was continued in its useful office until I
                  had outgrown my childhood, and I had seen the mourning garments which I had put on
                  for my dear father and mother hung up behind its ample folds. I was young when
                  they died; when the curtain of their life was dropped, and they were obscured from
                  my earthly vision forever; but often in my thoughtful moods, as I gazed upon the
                  old faded drapery, a crowd of reflections would force themselves upon my mind,
                  until I seemed to behold in it no longer a simple, homely, but useful receptacle
                  for domestic articles, but a type of the various ways in which things are
                  concealed from human eyes.
               Behind the curtain; the vail of the human soul. What strange mysterious workings
                  are there, where no eye but God's can penetrate. Good deeds and evil are there
                  conceived, checked, strengthened, destroyed, perfected, and brought forth in
                  accordance with the desires of the will. Deeds truly noble and pure in their
                  nature, and deeds also whose controlling motives, unseen, like the hidden wires of
                  a puppet-show, behind the curtain, are selfish and unworthy. Too true it is man is
                  not always what he seems, the vail of his spiritual nature shrouds his internal
                  sense in an impenetrable fold, and only by that which is outward may we esteem or
                  condemn. But saith the Scripture, "There is nothing covered that shall not be
                  revealed, neither hid that shall not be known;" the day will come when the great
                  Searcher of the human hearts will lay bare the secrets of the soul and test its
                  inmost workings by his written word.
               Much, very much of life is artificial and assumed. Smiles hide tears, and the
                  outward semblance of joy conceals grief, as bright gilding and tinsel hide often
                  that which is mean and worthless. "Every heart knoweth its own bitterness." Could
                  the vail of many a gay and careless spirit be lifted, the eye would fall upon some
                  secret grief or trouble, that like a consuming power would be preying upon the
                  very strings of the harp that was delighting the ear with bursts of light-hearted
                  music. But he who has the grace of God strengthening him inwardly, need never know
                  the pangs of such internal conflict. The grace that is sufficient for us all in
                  life's darkest day, will enable us to rise above the severest trials, and like the
                  flow of a calm, deep river, the channels of the soul will be pervaded by a
                  heavenly serenity.
               But equally mysterious with the curtain that veils the human soul, is that which
                  is lifted when we enter upon our earthly existence, and falls when the sands of
                  life are spent, and the vital spark extinguished forever. The great curtain of
                  life! behind which death ever stands, and stretches it across our pathway in the
                  hour of his triumph. Loved ones vanish behind its dark folds and are seen no more.
                  No voice comes back—no sound is heard, but oftentimes a bright light, as of some
                  unseen glory, flashes upon us when mortality lifts the veil, and the freed spirit
                  is borne heavenward by invisible hands.
               But if death is behind the curtain of human life, heaven is there also. For the
                  righteous, joy unspeakable and full of glory. There shall we find those who
                  disappeared from our longing eyes, that, blinded with tears, vainly strove to
                  pierce the darkness of death and the grave. There too shall we see the faces of
                  angels, and above all, the precious countenance of Him on whom no earthly eye
                  could look and live; and who once wore the crown of thorns and the martyr's robe,
                  and bore the cross for our redemption. We shall see him as he is. Glorious
                  thought! O, how the trifles, the cares, the troubles, the vanities of life, that
                  so enchain us like enchanter's spells, dissolve, fade, and become powerless, when
                  faith imparts to the soul one heavenly glimpse of those transcendent joys which
                  shall be ours when the curtain of death divides us from the living, and we enter
                  upon the true life of the soul.
            
            
               
               A PIOUS MOTHER'S REWARD.
               A FEELING of discouragement too often steals over the heart of the Christian
                  mother, as she views the magnitude and importance of the work before her. Precious
                  souls are entrusted to her care. How much depends on her instruction and
                  influence! She remembers those encouraging words: "Train up a child in the way he
                  should go; and when he is old he will not depart from it." But she looks around
                  her, and she sees many children of pious parents swelling the ranks of the
                  ungodly. She sees many whom she believes to have been early trained to walk in
                  wisdom's ways, treading the path of the transgressor. Her heart sinks within her,
                  and she exclaims—"Who is sufficient for these things?"
               We might urge many considerations, drawn from God's holy word, to encourage, to
                  strengthen, and to cheer. But the power of example has often proved more effectual
                  to incite and encourage, than either precept or exhortation. We look "to them who
                  by patient continuance in well doing" have obtained the reward; and as we gaze, we
                  become fixed with holy emulation, and strive to imitate their bright example.
               We offer the following brief sketch of the life and labors of a Christian mother,
                  with the hope and the earnest prayer, that many a mother may be incited by her
                  example to "go and do likewise."
               Mrs. W. was the daughter of pious parents. She was early led to feel her need of
                  the Saviour, and to put all her trust in Him. At the age of nine, she publicly
                  professed her faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and united with the people of God.
                  Her subsequent life bore witness to the sincerity of the profession she had made,
                  and to the ardor of her love to Christ and to His cause. Her memory is respected
                  and cherished by all who came within the sphere of her influence. And who can
                  estimate the power and extent of the influence exerted by an earnest, faithful
                  Christian woman? But it is of her efforts at home—among her children—that we would
                  now speak. Faithfully and perseveringly she trained her children in the ways of
                  the Lord, and bright and glorious was her reward.
               Before she was called to enter on her eternal rest, this devoted mother had the
                  unspeakable joy of seeing her nine children, and her beloved husband, members of
                  the church of Christ, and rejoicing in a hope full of immortality.
               What were the means which, by God's grace, led to this blessed result?
               
                  Earnest, unceasing prayer. She laid hold by faith on the promise,
                  "Ask and ye shall receive;" and she asked of the Lord the conversion of those whom
                  she so ardently loved. And this was not merely an occasional prayer, or an
                  evanescent anxiety. The salvation of her children was, amid all the turmoil and
                  cares of life, the chief object of her anxiety. She felt that this was "the one
                  thing needful;" and continually her "heart's desire and her prayer to God" was,
                  that her children might be saved. The children knew and felt this. They saw that
                  their mother considered their eternal salvation as an object of the highest
                  importance. And thus, even in childhood, their young minds became impressed with
                  the reality of religion, and its superiority to every earthly blessing and every
                  worldly attainment.
               
                  Religious instruction. This wise and pious mother embraced every
                  suitable opportunity of impressing the minds of her children with religious truth.
                  Her instructions were not confined merely to set and formal lessons. Every passing
                  event—many an occurrence apparently trifling, was made a means of leading their
                  youthful minds up to their Creator and their God. Her own heart was so deeply
                  imbued with the love of Christ, and her desires for the salvation of her children
                  were so ardent and intense, that it was often impossible for her to
                  restrain the expression of these feelings. Her children saw and felt—(children are
                  quick observers)—that she spoke to them of their eternal interest, not merely
                  because she considered it her duty to do so, but because her heart
                  was filled with such longing desires for their salvation that she could not keep
                  silence. They saw that their mother felt that it was of infinite importance that
                  they should have "peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." They knew that it
                  was the continual feeling of her heart that all earthly good was trifling, indeed,
                  compared with this inestimable blessing. And how can children lightly esteem an
                  object which they know and feel that their mother considers as of priceless value!
                  Ah, do we not too often err, and err greatly, in this respect? Do we not by our conduct and conversation, too often
                  impress our children's minds with the conviction, that dress, or social position,
                  or domestic cares and comforts, are of higher importance in our estimation than
                  the vast concerns of eternity? And need we then be surprised if we see them
                  following our example, rather than our precepts?
               This faithful mother lived, as well as prayed, for her children's conversion. They
                  often heard her prayers; they were the constant witnesses of her daily home-life.
                  And the blessing of God descended, and this gentle, holy influence was made the
                  means of leading these children of many prayers unto the cross of Christ.
               
                  Punctual attendance on the worship of God in the sanctuary. The
                  return of each Lord's-day morning found this faithful mother busied in preparing
                  herself and her children to appear in the house of God. No frivolous excuse, or
                  fancied indisposition, was allowed to detain any member of the family at home.
                  When the house of God was open for prayer and praise, and for the proclamation of
                  the blessed truths of the Gospel, thither she went, and thither she conducted her
                  children. Thus, under the guidance of this loving and judicious mother, the
                  children early learnt to love the house of God, and to love and reverence His holy
                  day. And the influence of their departed mother's example and precept yet remains.
                  Three of that happy band of young Christians have been called away from earth, to
                  join in the song of the redeemed above, and unite in the praises of the upper
                  sanctuary. But those who yet continue here on earth, are found in their places in
                  the house of God on each returning Lord's-day. No trifling excuse can ever detain
                  them from the worship which their mother loved, and which she early taught them to
                  love also.
               And when the earnest desire of her heart was granted, and she was permitted to see
                  one after another of her children repenting of sin and trusting in Christ our
                  Saviour, she encouraged them to offer themselves to the church, and to make that
                  public profession of religion which the Saviour has enjoined on all who truly
                  believe on Him. She never would hold back a child on the plea of youth, from
                  devoting himself publicly to the service of his Lord. The evidence of true
                  conversion once obtained, she rejoiced with exceeding joy, and her encouraging
                  language was, "Go forward, and may God's blessing go with thee, my child."
               Her nine children all professed their faith in Christ in early youth; two of them,
                  like their mother, when only nine years of age. Often, now that years have passed
                  away, do their thoughts revert to a mother's example, and a mother's prayers.
                  Ardent and unceasing are their thanks to God who gave them "a praying mother;" and
                  in the last great day they will "rise up and call her blessed."

               OH! GIVE ME BACK MY FLOWERS.
               BY H. J. CROSS.
               
                  THE day was bright and lovely,
                  The air was soft and mild,
                  When by a streamlet lonely
                  Reclined a darling child.
                  Her lap was filled with roses,
                  Of every varied hue,
                  And all the mountain mosses,
                  Still wet with pearly dew.
               
               
                  Her gentle hands were twining
                  A wreath of buds and flowers,
                  While, on the bank reclining,
                  She passed her joyous hours;
                  And dreaming not how swiftly
                  The moments passed away,
                  Reclining there so sweetly,
                  She passed the sunny day.
               
               
                  Just as the sun was sinking
                  Below the distant hill,
                  She started from her dreaming,
                  To view the sparkling rill;
                  When one by one her flowers
                  She threw into the tide,
                  And, like her joyous hours,
                  Away she saw them glide.
               
               
                  The stream, so gently gliding,
                  Bore all the flowers along;
                  She heeded not their passing,
                  Until they all were gone.
                  "Oh! give me back my flowers,"
                  In accents strange and wild,
                  "Oh! give me back my flowers,"
                  Exclaimed the darling child.
               
            
            
            
               
               THE PLATE AND BREAKFAST-CUP.
               
                  M.
                  WHAT nations were famous for "pottery?"
               
               
                  Ion.
                  I remember them, mamma. The Egyptians, Greeks, Rom— no, Etruscans, Romans, Peruvians and Mexicans, and the
                        Chinese.
               
               
                  W.
                  And I suppose that the English come next.
               
               
                  M.
                  Yes—to-day we will talk of the English pottery; but you must understand that
                     earthenware plates and cups have only lately been generally used in England. In
                     the olden time wooden plates, (some of them curiously carved,)
                     and bowls, and spoons, were used; pewter plates also were much used; even last
                     month I saw in the kitchen of a farm, a bright row of pewter plates.
               
               
                  Ion.
                  Well, they would not break, that is one good thing.
               
               
                  M.
                  And as for cups—our ancestors' cups and jugs were made of horn and leather. I
                     have seen many an old drinking-horn, and a black-jack made of
                     leather for holding the beer.
               
               
                  W.
                  And now we are going back to the old times again, for I have seen jugs, bowls,
                     and cups made of gutta percha.
               
               
                  Ion.
                  Yes; papa says that everything is to be made of gutta percha now. He bought
                     baby a gutta percha bib yesterday, and a gutta percha apron for mamma.
               
               
                  W.
                  They can't make gutta percha meat—that would be a failure.
               
               
                  M.
                  Come, let us proceed with the lesson—"English earthenware."
                  Here is the map of England—the two counties we shall notice are this one, Staffordshire, and this one below it, Worcestershire. If you travel to the north of the first county until you
                     reach this town, Newcastle-under-Lyne, you will then be at the
                     beginning of a district ten miles long, called "the Staffordshire potteries."
                     This district is divided into many villages or towns, such as Bruslem, Etruria, and others—but really the rows of houses are so near to
                     each other that the towns seem to be all joined together, and they form one
                     long street.
                  You would soon distinguish the manufactories from the dwelling-houses by "the
                     large, lofty, dark-colored buildings, of a shape something like a sugar-loaf or
                     a bee-hive." These buildings contain the kilns where the earthenware is
                     baked—they are called hovels.
                  You would next notice, perhaps, the Grand Trunk Canal, opened
                     about seventy years ago, for the purpose of conveying the goods to the two
                     northern ports—Hull and Liverpool, but this was
                     before the time of the railways. And again, you may observe on the banks of the
                     canal, and around the buildings, 1st, Heaps of flints, which have
                     been brought in barges from Gravesend, &c.; 2ndly, Clays and stones from
                     Dorsetshire, Devonshire, and Cornwall; 3rdly, Coarser clay from another part of
                     Staffordshire, to make baking cases for the earthenware; 4thly,
                     Plaster-of-Paris to make moulds for the different shapes; and 5thly, Heaps of
                     coals for the baking fires.
                  Now, let us see what is done with these things. The flints are taken to a kiln
                     and burned until they are quite white; they then break more easily, and are
                     taken to a flint mill, where they are broken into a coarse powder by a machine
                     with heavy hammers, called stampers. The powdered flint is then mixed with
                     water, and with some of the Dorsetshire clay. It is next ground in a number of
                     mills, each of which grinds it finer than it was before, and strains it through
                     a fine silk sieve. After a time the powdered flint and clay become so fine,
                     that, with the water, they form a thick smooth paste like cream, which is
                     called slip.
                  This slip is heated until the water evaporates, so that it becomes stiff again
                     like dough. It is then passed on to the throwing-room, where men
                     shape it into plates, cups, dishes, &c., upon a wheel called the "throwing
                     wheel." You could not, by any description, well understand how quickly and well
                     these men work; you must see them do it.
                  These articles, when made, are in a soft state; they are then called "green ware."
                  The green ware is placed in cases of the shape of a drum, and carried to "the
                     biscuit kiln," where it is baked until it is very dry and crisp. It is then
                     called "biscuit ware."
                  The biscuit ware must next be colored. Look, Willie, at your blue plate. Plates could not be bought so cheap
                     if each one had to be painted. See how much work there is on the surface.
               
               
                  W.
                  How is it done, mamma?
               
               
                  M.
                  It is taken to a woman who knows how to do it. In the next room to hers is a
                     man printing patterns for blue plates on thin paper, from a copperplate press.
                     Directly he has printed a pattern, she takes it from him, and turns it over
                     with the printed surface on the plate. After fixing it on to the edge and
                     middle of the plate, she takes a round-headed rubber and rubs it violently;
                     then, as the "biscuit ware" is absorbent, the rubbing makes it absorb the wet
                     ink from the paper.
                  The plate is then passed over to a younger girl, who dips it in cold water,
                     rubs off the paper, and finds that the pattern on the paper has been transferred to the plate's surface.
                  After being sent to a kiln, for the oil to be dried out of the ink, the plate
                     is then glazed with a preparation of salt, and is ready for use.
               
               
                  Ion.
                  Ah, mamma, it would not be so useful without the glazing.
               
               
                  M.
                  No, the plates could not be washed so well. The use of salt was discovered
                     accidentally. A servant in the pottery neighborhood, who was boiling in an
                     earthen pot some very strong brine for salting pork, happened to leave it on
                     the fire for a few minutes. When she returned, she found that great part of it
                     had boiled over the vessel, and covered it with a hard shining substance,
                     which, when it was cold, she could not rub off; and a potter to whom it was
                     shown immediately saw its great use.
                  At one time, only brown and coarse red earthenware was made at Staffordshire.
                     The improvements which have been made are owing to the discovery of the use of
                     flints, which was also accidental, and to the great skill of a gentleman named
                        Wedgewood.
                  The finer kinds of earthenware are called porcelain, or China, much of which is made at Worcester.

               "THY WILL BE DONE."
               
                  I WOULD not forget thee, my Saviour, my friend;
                  Whose mercy so often I prove,
                  But receive thy rebukes, and submissively bend,
                  To the chastening rod of thy love.
               
               
                  In all the afflictions thy mercy has sent,
                  Thy promise has still been redeemed;
                  And thy grace has prepared me for every event,
                  That, to sense, overwhelming has seemed.
               
               
                  Amid the loud tempest thy voice have I heard,
                  Saying—"Fear not, my presence is here,
                  Oh be not dismayed; for you I have cared,
                  In your sadness, and sorrow, and fear."
               
               
                  My idol is taken—in mercy I know—
                  That my love may all centre on Thee;
                  And though my heart bleeds, and fond hopes are laid low,
                  My Father, in all I can see.
               
               
                  How sweet are afflictions when thus they divide
                  Our hearts from the idols they love;
                  And raise our affections, that they may abide
                  On our Saviour and portion above.

               LOVE'S YEARNING.
               BY MRS. M. A. DENISON.
               "ARE they all here?"
               "Yes, all but one, and she has just waked up from a nap—she will be down
                  soon."
               "Isn't it a beautiful sight?" exclaimed a fashionably dressed woman, sinking
                  languidly into a seat—and smoothing the folds of her thick satin.
               "Beautiful, but exceedingly sad," replied another, whose lip trembled, and in
                  whose eyes stood unrestrained tears—"the little darlings are motherless."
               "Yes, but how well they are provided for! Just look at that sweet little thing
                  with the auburn curls. Isn't she pretty?"
               Pretty she was, indeed; nay beautiful, with her little round limbs full of
                  dimples—the short frock hanging archly over the plump ankles. A sight worth seeing
                  was that band of motherless children. There was one they called Matty, with
                  bright, crisp curls and dancing eyes—another who answered to the name of Lilly,
                  with eyes as blue as heaven, and brow as fair as unstained snow. Some were plain
                  and sickly, but most had the rosy glow—the smile unconscious, yet happy, of
                  confiding infancy.
               "Many years ago," said Mrs. Eastman, turning to the matron, "I promised a dear
                  friend that in the event of her death—if she left daughters, they should be taken
                  to my heart and home. She was unfortunate after that, I heard—though I lost sight
                  of her—and died miserably poor. I traced her to this city, and here they tell me
                  is her only child—a girl.
               "The name?" asked the matron.
               "A plain one—Mary Harson; her mother was beautiful," she added, running her eye
                  along the group, and among the sparkling faces and curly heads.
               "Bring Mary Harson down," said the matron to an assistant, and Mrs. Eastman,
                  startled from her composure, uttered an exclamation of surprise as the child
                  entered.
               She was a little odd figure, with large eyes almost preternaturally bright, thin
                  in form, neither elastic in limb nor rosy of cheek. She came forward with painful
                  timidity, and laid that small, shrunken hand in the gloved hand of the lady,
                  holding it there as if it were not a part of herself—but something she was obliged
                  to offer.
               "She's a strange child," said the matron, reading the glance of her visitor, "but
                  intelligent. Her great fault is her sensitive temperament; she never ceases
                  mourning for her mother—that for so little a child is singular, you know—and she
                  dead so long."
               Mrs. Eastman had fully expected that one of the most beautiful of that little
                  group was the child of her early friend. Much she was disappointed at the
                  diminutive figure and plain features of this little stranger, and her looks showed
                  her regret. She strove to master it, however, as she gazed at the downcast
                  child—the weak frame so eager to shrink out of notice.
               "Will you be my little girl?" she said.
               The pale under lip quivered, and the diminutive thumb sought shelter in her mouth,
                  while her eyes were cast towards the floor; but she answered not a word.
               "Certainly you will like to go with this lady," said the matron,
                  encouragingly—"you will love to live in a fine house, and have plenty of dolly
                  babies, plenty to eat, and every body to love you. Say yes to the lady—she is
                  going to be your mother."
               That word broke the loosed fountain—a long drawn convulsive sigh, that must nearly
                  have broken her little heart, dilated the child's whole figure—then the tears fell
                  fast and copiously, and she sobbed so violently that Mrs. Eastman exclaimed,
                  pettishly—"why, what a queer child it is"—at which the little one sobbed harder
                  than ever—and the matron led her from the room.
               
               "Tiney, my love, be quiet, and get your lesson—Christmas is coming, you know—and
                  you must do your best. Mary, your eyes are constantly wandering—why
                     will you not heed what I say? Are you dreaming?"
               
               The little one started, cast a long, mournful look in the face bent above hers,
                  and with a deep, oldish sigh, gathered her brows and resolutely applied herself to
                  her book.
               The parlor was beautiful, and well supplied with luxuries. The rich red of the
                  coal glow brought out innumerable pictures of rosewood carving, and struck into
                  vivid light the rare pictures on the walls. Tiney, a girl with bright black eyes,
                  set in a roguish face, held in her hand a little silver pencil, with which, though
                  her mother did not see her, she was making pictures on the margin of her books.
                  She was the child of wealth—any one might have known that, for the garments
                  folding over those polished limbs were of fine and dainty material. A rich
                  necklace of coral with golden clasps circled her neck, and her little shoes,
                  neatly laced, shone in a casing of the brightest kid. The little girl at her side
                  was not a whit the less beautifully attired; but from her brow the innocent joys
                  and loves, and sweet surprises of childhood seemed permanently banished. Even the
                  rose-light of health looked only dimly through the transparent cheeks, and her
                  large, sad eyes always made one think of something mournful. A chubby babe, almost
                  ready for the nursery, laid quietly upon the lounge, drowsily playing with his
                  blocks, and crowing in an undertone.
               "How now"—that voice was all heart—"how long have you been dumb—all of you—come;
                  I'm for a game—rouse up—look something like life"—and Mr. Eastman threw his great
                  frame into an easy chair, holding out his arms for the now wide-awake baby.
               "Tiney, do you know your lesson?"
               "Yes, mamma," answered the child, hastily concealing the pencil she had made her
                  plaything.
               "And you, Mary?"
               "No, mamma," timidly replied the more conscientious Mary.
               "Then you must not expect to play," said Mrs. Eastman, sharper than was wont.
                  "There, no crying—I'm tired of it."
               "Don't be harsh to her," exclaimed Mr. Eastman, softly, "perhaps she isn't
                  well."
               "Then if she isn't well, she may go to bed," added the lady, impatiently; "but I
                  know better, she is well—and she will be well—and she will look like a funeral all
                  the time, 
                     notwitstanding
                     notwithstanding
                   all I have done for her—I hate ingratitude."
               "Never mind, Molly, you'll try harder to study to-morrow—won't you?" But the child
                  shrieked convulsively, as his kind voice touched her heart, and laying her head
                  low on her hands, sobbed as she had not for many days.
               A bitter look crossed Mrs. Eastman's face. Just then a servant came in. "Take Miss
                  Mary to her room—where she can stay till she feels better;" she said sternly, and
                  her husband, who could think of no cause for such strange conduct, silently
                  acquiesced.
               "I shall dislike her by and by, I fear," said the lady, half communing with
                  herself, "I don't see what it is—she has every comfort. I'm sure poor Mary, her
                  mother, was one of the most amiable beings that ever lived. How little her child
                  takes after her. She is forever weeping, notwithstanding all I can do. I've loaded
                  her with toys, and anticipated all her wishes, yet she will be sad
                  and miserable. I don't understand it. I'm out of all patience."
               Ah! kind mother and gentle friend, you know not that little tender heart. You
                  could not touch its quivering strings but to wake discordant notes. The spirit so
                  sensitive, shrinking if a breath brushed it too harshly, needed at least something
                  akin to a mother's love. It yearned for the good-night kiss; for the arm placed
                  involuntarily about the slight form; for the gentle pressure sometimes given when
                  least expected. This, that little sensitive one longed for—in the far dark
                  distance she looked back, remembering how it had been with her.
               Tiney and Mary slept in two small, adjoining chambers. Twice, before bed-time did
                  Mrs. Eastman send up to know if Mary could come to her supper; but the servant
                  returned, saying she was still "in the sulks," she called it—but she did not know.
                  So the babe was laid sweetly sleeping in its cradle Tiney was carefully disrobed
                  before the warm, shining fire—her snowy night dress put on—and kneeling, with her
                  white hands raised, and clasped in those of her mother—her little body swaying to
                  the measure of her good-night hymn, she happily prepared for slumber.
               
               "O! dear, oh! dear, dear, dear," sobbed a small, childish voice, "will God please
                  take me home to heaven?"
               Mrs. Eastman paused in absolute astonishment before she entered Mary's room. The
                  door was slightly ajar—the full moon laid lovingly over little Mary, its beams
                  brightening the white objects about the bed, and making her, with her grieved,
                  upturned face, clasped hands, and streaming eyes, seem like an angel sorrowing
                  over some mortal's untimely sin.
               "O! I am so lonely," sighed the little thing, still talking to her
                  father in heaven—"this mother don't love me—I know she don't—she loves her own
                  little girl, for she kisses her a great deal, and she looks at her
                     happy; but, oh! dear God, she don't love me like her—please take me
                  right to heaven."
               Mrs. Eastman swallowed her emotion—pity swelled at her heart—she remembered how
                  quick the rebuking word sprang forth at any of her faults—how often
                  she called her "lazy little thing," because she turned dreamily away from her
                  book—and how frequently she sent her to her slumbers without one word of praise,
                  while she almost smothered her own child with caresses.
               All this while the child was sobbing as she prayed—"don't let me cry so much, dear
                  God, because, because they say I'm cross and wicked—oh, God! do let
                  me think of my own dear mamma, without feeling so very bad—and don't let me think
                  what nice times we used to have when little Willy was alive, and mamma used to
                  smile on us so sweetly—oh! dear, good God, if I might only go to heaven with my
                  dear mother, I never could want to cry again."
               Mrs. Eastman hurried down stairs, and, going by herself, bitterly wept. She saw
                  all her error, and how sorrowful she was making that young life. Drying her tears,
                  after a prayer for guidance, she hastened up stairs. Little Mary had undressed,
                  and with all a woman's precision, had laid her clothes carefully aside.
               "Mary," said Mrs. Eastman, in a soft voice.
               The child looked round, alarmed.
               "Mary, sha'n't I hear your prayers, love?"
               Not a word said the child; but with her great eyes wide open, she came slowly
                  towards her foster-mother, and dropped on her knees; nor did she take her
                  wondering glance from that gentle face till she had repeated the last amen.
               "Now kiss me, darling," said Mrs. Eastman, with trembling voice.
               There was the pause of a moment—the child caught her breath—then flung her arms
                  passionately about the neck of her mother, kissing her again and again. With a new
                  impulse the foster-mother strained her to her bosom, and so held her, while the
                  hot tears fell like rain down her cheeks.
               "And do you think you can love me?" she murmured, disengaging herself from the
                  rapturous embrace.
               "O! yes, I do love you; I love you like my own dear
                  mamma—oh! you never were so good to me before."
               "And you will not cry so much, my darling, and make me sad."
               "No, I will never cry, for I think my own mamma has come back from heaven—my
                     sorry has all gone—how kind you are, mamma!" and the beautiful
                  head reposed lovingly, and without rebuke, against the heart beating with such new
                  and sweet tenderness; and when Mrs. Eastman again looked down, the child was
                  sleeping, with an angelic happiness playing over her serene countenance.
               From that time little Mary was like a new creature. It was love she
                  yearned for; her tender nature, like the flower for the dew, pined for its sweet
                  nourishment. Never more she wept without cause—never went alone to her Father, and
                  in agony, cried—"dear God, please take me home to heaven."
            
            
               
                  I HAVE not wept for many a week—
                  'Tis almost wrong to weep;
                  But there's one fountain in my heart,
                  Cold reason cannot keep!
                  Sometimes a book unlocks the seal—
                  Sometimes a cradle song—
                  Sometimes a single tender tone
                  Upon a mother's tongue.

               HOME EDUCATION.
               WHERE can our children be best educated? How can they be shielded from temptation?
                  How escape the influences of evil associates, and be secure from imbibing bad
                  habits, and wicked principles? These are questions which all judicious,
                  affectionate parents are constantly revolving in their minds; and are objects, for
                  the attainment of which they are ready to sacrifice themselves and all their
                  possessions. They study every proposed plan, and resort to one expedient after
                  another in the hope of attaining the desired end.
               There are some parents who resolve that they will educate their children
                  themselves at home. They have the qualifications and the means to do so; and what
                  place can be better for the proper training and development of the mental and
                  physical powers of a child than home? The parents can give just such instruction
                  as they wish their children to receive; they can cultivate and prune the native
                  propensities as they are developed, and give direction to each aspiration of heart
                  and genius. They can choose for them just such amusements and recreations as they
                  please, and say when and where they shall be enjoyed. They can 
                     induge
                     indulge
                   or restrain, caress or punish, just as their own judgments dictate ought
                  to be done; as well as decide in respect to books and associates. Thus the whole
                  physical, mental, and moral education can be under their control and guidance.
                  Surrounded by such favorable circumstances, it hardly seems possible that there
                  can be a loophole for error to insinuate a seed into the heart; or for a tainted
                  vapor to breathe upon a single faculty of the mind. What plan more feasible can be
                  devised for the right education of children than this? The harvest from such seed
                  and such cultivation, certainly promises to be rich. "My child will be all I can
                  desire," says the careful mother, as day after day she instructs, chides, guards
                  and counsels. And does she realize her fond anticipations? In some instances she
                  may. This theory has its bright side full of hope and promise; and, carried into
                  effect with some few children, who would be model children under any
                  circumstances, it works well. But such children are few, and "their names," as a
                  late writer says, "are almost always on grave stones." The mass of children, in
                  order to be qualified to live and act their part in the world, must be educated
                  with the world. If they are to be in sympathy with the world when they come into
                  active life, their feelings must be educated for it in childhood. Their estimates
                  of character—their principles—their habits of intercourse should commence (we had
                  well nigh said,) with life, and should be made a part of their education as much
                  as reading and writing: all, it is true, as far as possible under the eye and
                  control of the parents. Every power and faculty which will be called into
                  requisition in after life, to meet its high and important duties, should now
                  receive their proper discipline and cultivation. If the little world of home—of
                  father and mother, perhaps of brother and sister, of uncles and aunts, of
                  grandfather and grandmother, and a few cousins, and fewer prejudiced friends, were
                  to constitute all their future life-world, then by all means give them the home
                  education; but the real world on whose stage they are soon to be ushered, will be
                  divested of all these loving eyes, and forgiving hearts, and will subject them to
                  an ordeal, to pass which will require the experimental preparation of all their
                  previous years.
               Says one mother, "I detest the school airs and school phrases which children
                  acquire."
               But, I ask, which will be likely to prove the most deleterious to your child, the
                  school airs and school phrases which your own counsels and example can modify and
                  overcome, or the contaminating words and manners which will come like an avalanche
                  upon your inexperienced child, when it may be far removed from home, or you
                  perhaps have ceased to speak? And, again, after all the care and pains-taking, the
                  child that is unaccustomed to mingling with others, often appears, even in the
                  eyes of its doating parents, less agreeable in behavior and disposition, than many
                  who have seemingly had much fewer advantages. Children will assimilate in manners
                  and words to those with whom they associate. Their childish intellects will put on
                  the garb of maturity, and their ways
                  and expressions will be as much out of place, as if rigged in father's boots, with
                  his hat and cane, or with mamma's long dress, and grandmother's cap and
                  spectacles. The simplicity of childhood, and its unstudied language, almost
                  entirely hidden under unnatural drapery. They may improve faster in some respects,
                  if those premature developments can be called improvement; but it is not a
                  symmetrical improvement of all the faculties, necessary to form a perfect
                  character. They will become selfish, and regard every child that occasionally
                  comes into their circle, as a marauder who will rob them of their privileges; or
                  otherwise, in the exuberance of joy at the idea of a little foreign companionship,
                  they will leap over all bounds, and be entirely unmanageable, to the great
                  annoyance of all concerned, besides affecting seriously, not unfrequently, their
                  nervous systems.
               Then half the pleasure of childhood is lost, if the associations of school days
                  are not formed. The sympathy of kindred minds is just as sweet in childhood as in
                  maturer years. And there is an inspiration in the struggle together, to master the
                  abs, and to show on the black board how many are four times twelve, which urges
                  them on to the accomplishment of what would be to them a hard task when alone.
                  Competition is just as necessary to success in the attainment of a good education,
                  as it is to life in business. True, a person alone may pick up gold when it lies
                  in his path; but if there is no one to dispute his right, or claim a share, he
                  will soon become indolent and careless. So very few make any considerable
                  proficiency in education, unless brought in contact with other minds which are
                  laboring for the same result.
               But, ask some, is it not our duty to shield our children from temptation, and keep
                  them from evil influences, just as long as possible? Certainly, so far as is
                  consistent for their good; but how are they to be prepared to resist the
                  temptations and allurements of sin, if their power of resistance is not tested,
                  until brought to some severe trial? Because the atmosphere often becomes the
                  vehicle of infection for disease, do we exclude our children entirely from it, and
                  expect they will become strong and vigorous? Because a child in its first attempts
                  to walk is liable to fall and injure itself, or will at least make very uncertain
                  steps, do we keep it lying in the cradle, where its feet can have no chance for
                  exercise in that direction, and expect that its muscles will grow strong, and that
                  by-and-by, when its judgment is matured, and its ingenuity trained, it will walk
                  of course? As well may we expect the oak to attain its giant growth, striking deep
                  its roots in the earth, and assume its hardy nature, whereby it can resist the
                  blasts of the wintry wind and the tornado, in a hot house, as to expect that
                  children can be fully prepared in the nursery, to withstand the evil influences
                  that must inevitably gather around them in every walk of mature life. How can they
                  acquire wisdom and fortitude, to discharge well its duties, and bear its
                  vicissitudes, while shielded by the cloistered walls of home from every chilling
                  breath, and borne in loving arms to the very door that is to usher them into the
                  public arena amidst its glaring blandishments, its appalling scenes, and its
                  jargon of business?
               We would not be understood as wishing to lessen the influence of home. No, rather,
                  we would, if possible, increase its power; but we would not make it a juvenile
                  hermitage. We would let it be as a harbor into which the frail vessels, when
                  launched on the ocean of life, might run for shelter from storms—a place of
                  refuge—a beacon light, ever burning, to warn of the reefs and quicksands—the
                  storehouse of counsel and comfort.
               Nor yet would we advocate in the least that indiscriminate association with
                  others, which would only tend to make vice and loose habits familiar, without any
                  just perceptions of their ruinous tendencies; but we would let the book of human
                  nature, like that of science, be unfolded before them, under the vigilant eye of
                  the parent, who can teach them to discriminate between its beauties and
                  deformities, and point out its dangerous principles and intrigues.
               It is often said that children learn error fast enough, therefore keep them from
                  any knowledge of its existence until they are obliged to meet it. But would it be
                  wise policy to send out troops to meet an enemy, of whose numbers, manner of
                  warfare, and point of attack they are not informed? A case, in illustration of
                  this idea came under our observation some years ago. An only son grew up and was
                  educated, under the kind and genial influence ence of his pious mother and two older sisters.
                  They resolved that he should be a model man. That his mind and heart should
                  receive no taint from the out-door world. Every avenue at which bad principles or
                  knowledge of any error might enter, was closely guarded. And while the pulpit and
                  the Word of God gave him theoretical ideas of depravity, yet he knew nothing of
                  its depths and secret workings. His few associates were carefully chosen, and his
                  books inculcated, as they should, the purest morality and doctrine. He scarcely
                  knew the name, much less the creed, of any denomination but the one in whose faith
                  he was reared. He knew none of the arguments by which others sustained their
                  belief, or the subterfuges to which error resorts to gain its conquests; and was,
                  consequently, as ignorant of the strength and means of defence of his own
                  position.
               A change came over this happy family in their quiet village home, just as the
                  brother was ripening into manhood; and he obtained a business situation in a city
                  of his native state. He went there, to all appearance a model young man, with a
                  cultivated mind, amiable disposition, graceful manners, and unsullied morality.
                  His employer was an active, business man, with a noble, generous heart, but a
                  zealous leader in a church, which labored to strew the path of sin with flowers of
                  paradise, and soothe the troubled conscience with hopes not founded on the Word of
                  God.
               The young man was bewildered by the show, the gayety, and the temptations which
                  surrounded him; and entranced by the syren which whispered in his ears as he
                  hesitated to put forth his hand to some forbidden fruit, "Thou shalt not surely
                  die." He had never proved his armor, and knew little of its use, or value. The
                  world in which he was an actor, was all new, entirely different from that in which
                  he had been reared; and its novelties so charmed him, that he was led a willing
                  captive to frivolity, sinful indulgence, and the delusions of Satan. And this no
                  doubt tells the story of the fall and utter ruin of thousands of inexperienced
                  youth.

               HOME.
               
                  THERE is a magic in the name of home,
                  A charm which ev'n the callous bosom knows,
                  And oh, when from its precincts far we roam,
                  How brightly each loved scene in memory glows.
               
               
                  When wandering in a scene of strife and cares,
                  Mid those, alas, we may not deem our friends,
                  How fair a form each scene of childhood bears—
                  How warmly each dear distant object blends.
               
               
                  Sweet home! loved dwelling-place of peace and rest,
                  When chill the blasts of scorn around us blow,
                  To thee as hies the turtle to her nest,
                  We speed, to taste thy joys of peaceful flow.
               
               
                  Mary Lundie Duncan.
               
            
            
            
               
               THE DEMANDS OF THE AGE.
               NEVER since the ascension of our Lord was there an age so fraught with thrilling
                  and stirring events as the present, and never was there a generation on which were
                  suspended such fearful responsibilities. Already, it would seem, the children are
                  born which may fight the great and decisive battle of the Lord, giving victory to
                  the Prince of Peace, or, to an earthly potentate whose tender mercies are the
                  dungeon, the rack, and the screws. Already the iron may be preparing for the arms,
                  and the highway being cast up for the ransomed of the Lord to return to Zion; or
                  for the man of sin to march through with his legions and take possession of the
                  world.
               Who has not heard the distant roar of cannon and the rumbling of chariot wheels?
                  We need no prophet's ken, to see the shadows which coming events are casting
                  before us. We can see them lower and blacken on the brow of the future; and almost
                  see the sabres flash in the sunlight. The jarring elements of earth, all seem
                  verging towards a common centre. The scattered rays of light are coming to a
                  focus. The myriads of earth are being marshaled. The enemy, like the savages of
                  old, are lurking in our very midst, ready to be arrayed at a moment's warning. And
                  are we prepared for the fearful onset? Do we understand the enemy's position and
                  mode of warfare? Are the children now in process of education being prepared for
                  it? Many no doubt are, whose parents clearly understand the signs of the time, and
                  are nobly preparing themselves and their children for it. But many do not
                  understand, and they and their children are being prepared only for the ranks of
                  sin, and finally to be utterly destroyed.
               Can an infidel race, educated without the Bible and without prayer, having no fear
                  of God before their eyes, be the one to fight his battles and rout the enemy of
                  all righteousness? Certainly not. It was faith in the God of Jacob, and lifting up
                  hands to Him that nerved the sacramental host in the days of Joshua, and gave them
                  victory in the day of battle. In the strength of the Lord they destroyed, and
                  drove out their enemies, and planted themselves in the land of Canaan. It was the
                  same faith that led the puritan host in the time of Cromwell to the victories they
                  achieved. Others it led to cross the mighty deep and buffet the stormy sea, to
                  find a home in the waste howling wilderness of the new world. It strengthened them
                  to endure cold, hunger, and fatigues; and gave them power over wild beasts and
                  savage men. It nerved them to unequal contest with the father-land, and gave them
                  victory in the doubtful strife. They trusted in God. They knew that he could save
                  by many, or by few. Therefore, in his name they lifted up their standard, and took
                  possession of the land, and a place among the nations of the earth: securing to
                  themselves a habitation where they could worship their God, and none to molest or
                  make them afraid.
               Can a voluptuous, and consequently effeminate race perform these mighty
                  achievements? A race nursed and dandled in the lap of ease and luxury, knowing
                  nothing of toil, of effort, of self-denial and hardship, be good soldiers of the
                  cross of Christ? No, no,—all such must fade away as a leaf, and wither in the
                  chill of winter, or the scorching rays of the noonday sun. The generation that
                  took the promised land were not of this class. They were not only taught the fear
                  of God at the foot of Horeb, and from the lips of the great lawgiver, but their
                  tiny feet were inured to tread in rough pathways, and press the burning sands of
                  the arid desert. Their hands were taught to labor and disciplined to arms.
               I need not speak of the Spartans, trained to hardiness and bravery under the rigor
                  of the Grecian lawgiver, nor of the power it gave them as a people; nor of the
                  hardy discipline of the Roman soldiery which made their nation mistress of the
                  world; nor how the luxury of prosperity in after years made them weak; and being
                  powerless to resist invasion, they fell into the hands of the Vandal hordes who
                  rushed upon them like wild beasts of the forest, making their country, for a time,
                  the scene of confusion, anarchy and blood: for the victories we are to gain are
                  higher and more noble than Greece or Rome ever thought of, and to usher in a more
                  glorious day.
               
               Those in the early settlement of our own country, who had been reared in ease and
                  affluence at home, soon fell victims to the hardships they had to encounter; and
                  it was reserved for their children and those who had been differently trained, to
                  do the deeds of noble daring. Such were the heroes of the revolution. With their
                  own hands they had leveled the sturdy forest, and reared their humble dwellings.
                  They had taken long and tedious marches through the wilderness against the
                  numerous enemies that had invaded them. Their feet never pressed upon velvet
                  carpets, but they brushed the dew from the greensward, and trod among the standing
                  corn. Their bones and sinews were not made of costly and delicate viands, but of
                  the coarse products of their own soil. In the sweat of their faces they gained it,
                  and their daughters ate not the bread of idleness. They and their fathers were
                  clothed in the fabrics their own hands had wrought, and not unfrequently had they
                  to secure the crops, and reap down the fields, while their husbands and brothers
                  had gone to the war. This was the generation that sent the lead like hail through
                  the British legions, and drove them from our shores; and such, in iron strength,
                  is the generation demanded for the coming conflict.
               Can an ignorant and unenlightened race be the one to usher in the blessed age of
                  light and love? Can they manage skillfully the great controversy, and establish
                  the universal reign of peace? Certainly not. The generation to do this must be
                  intelligent. They must have knowledge and mental discipline. They must know and
                  realize what it is that does, and ever has truly exalted a nation,
                  and what it is that debases it. They must understand the nature and fitness of
                  things, be able at a glance to search into the hidden springs of thought and
                  action. They must be rigid in analysis, and able at once to trace effect to cause
                  and cause to effect. They must be mighty in the Scriptures, and learned in the
                  history of the world. They must understand its geography, for the world has been
                  the theatre of action in past ages, and is the field of their present and future
                  labor.
               They must understand thoroughly its philosophy and its mathematics: or how can
                  they devise, construct and operate the vast and complicated machinery, necessary
                  to carry forward these mighty enterprises. They must understand the language of
                  the world in all its parts and ramifications, for this is the vehicle of thought,
                  and the grand medium through which the world of thought is to be addressed. Let it
                  then be thoroughly understood.
               Our fathers, in the days of their conflicts and their triumph, were not ignorant
                  men. Their fathers had built their log school-houses by the side of their
                  log-houses, and very early founded colleges. The children and youth went to school
                  whenever they could be spared from necessary toil. They studied their lessons,
                  read history and law by the light of pine knots, or the dim light of a burning
                  fagot in the open fire-place; and then reflected upon what they had read, and
                  analyzed and arranged their thoughts while following the plough, or chopping wood.
                  This made them strong men, thinking men, and wise men. Their wives and daughters
                  studied and read in the same way, and thought by their spinning-wheels. Their
                  disciplined minds understood fully the bearing which action, even in small
                  matters, might have upon their future destiny.
               Such were the leading spirits in that age. They knew full well how to manage the
                  controversy, and gain the victory. Such, too, and more, in wisdom and in knowledge
                  must be the generation engaged in the coming strife with the powers of
                  darkness.
               The generation then which the exigency of the age demands, and which may soon be
                  summoned to the field, is one of physical strength, intelligent—practical—full of
                  faith and the Holy Ghost. And how is such a generation to be reared? This is the
                  great—the fearful question.

               A BIRD SONG.
               BY MRS. E. C. JUDSON.
               
                  NEVER had a birdy small,
                  Half so dear a cage as I,
                  So I do not care at all,
                  With the rovers gay to fly.
               
               
                  Bob-o-links may follow free,
                  Southern wind and summer gleam;
                  Robins through the orchard tree;
                  Lazy hang-birds swing and dream.
               
               
                  Hummers 'mid the flowers and dew,
                  Their bright wings may spread or fold.
                  Larks go mounting to the blue,
                  On their dainty cars of gold.
               
               
                  But my darling cage is more,
                  Far more beautiful to me,
                  Fastened by a rosy door,
                  Sweet, I think, as sweet can be.
               
               
                  Not to waste another word,
                  Let me whisper, ere we part
                  I'm a little lady-bird,
                  And my cage, mamma's warm heart.
               
            
            
               THE GRAMMAR OF LIFE.
               BY B. F. TAYLOR.
               "LONG time ago," some day this month—you and I should remember exactly—a man was
                  born, whose name has been to the juvenile world "a household word;" sometimes a
                  word of terror, but now, as I remember it, a word to conjure with; to
                  wave up scenes and forms long faded and crumbled. LINDLEY MURRAY! Did you ever
                  hear of him? And do you not remember his little book, that like another "little
                  book," was "bitter," and never sweet at all? And don't you recollect
                  how firmly it was bound, old Iron-sides that it was, and what was on the
                  fly-leaf—John, or James, or David Somebody, "his book," and that Lochiel-like
                  couplet: 
                     
                        "Steal not this book, my honest friend,
                        For fear the gallows shall be your end."
                     
                   And who printed it, "H. & E. Phinney," and the year, 18— and
                  something?
               Shut your eyes now, and you can see every page of that old Grammar; just where the
                  noun began, and the "verb, to be," and Syntax, with its terrible code of
                  twenty-two, exactly twenty-two rules.
               And how like quarter horses, we plunged through the moods and tenses of the verb,
                  "Love!" Who has forgotten, or who ever can forget, how it went, and we went? "I
                  love, loved, have loved, had loved, shall or will love, shall have loved." On we
                  darted, through the cans, and the coulds, and the mights, of the potential, and
                  the mysterious contingencies of the subjunctive, till we rounded to on the trio of
                  participles that brought up the rear of this marvelous cavalcade of deeds,
                  probable and possible, present, past and future, in the great art and action of
                  loving.
               And then, when you came to prepositions, how they puzzled you—how they puzzled us
                  all! Don't you remember the definition
                  tion? Right hand page, four lines from the top, just before conjunctions, on the
                  threshold of Syntax?
               Thus it ran: "Prepositions are words used to connect words, and show the relation
                  between them;" or, to give little Joe Miller's, or some other little fellow's
                  version, "Pep'sition word used c'nect words show 'lation 'tween 'em." Showed
                  "relation" did they? And what relation? Blood relation, or relation
                  by marriage? And so we puzzled and pondered, and passed it over, and learned "the
                  list," that went like a flock of sheep over a wall, "of, to, for, by, with,
                  in."
               And who has forgotten those queer contrivances of conjunctions, that connected and
                     didn't connect; and what a god-send the interjection was, in the
                  midst of the fog, with oh! ah! and alas! Often had we employed it; we understood,
                  felt, appreciated it.
               Then the wonderful process they called "Parsing"—wonder if they do it yet; when we
                  used to take couplets from the prince of English rhyme, and, a row of little
                  cannibals that we were, there we stood, beneath the unwinking optics of our
                  teacher, and "transposed," alias mutilated,
                  "paraphrased," alias butchered, and every thing
                  but devoured, his immortal lines!
               Do you not recollect how we disposed of 
                     
                        "In spite of pride, in erring reason's spite,
                        One truth is clear—whatever is, is right?"
                     
                  
               
               After much science and little sense, the light used to burst upon our bedazzled
                  intellects, about once a winter, that Pope meant to say, and did say,
                  "whatever is right, is right!" Do they dream in the grave? Does the
                  bard sleep peaceful yet?
               And where's the boy that sat next in the grammar class? And the bright-eyed girl,
                  that used to whisper the answer so softly to us, and save our juvenile palms many
                  an acquaintance with the oaken ferule—where is she? Does she whisper hope and
                  happiness to any body still? Are her eyes as bright and her steps as light as of
                  old? Or has Death, that great bailiff, closed her eyes and set a seal upon her
                  lips? Who knows? Who can tell?
               And the old schoolmaster, gray, "as long ago as we can remember"—gray before
                  that—does he teach Grammar still? Is his step as firm, and his eye as steel-like
                  gray as it was wont to be then?
               And the ancient schoolma'am, old Miss E., who lived in the yellow house next to
                  the village green, and taught us spelling and etymology; she too is
                  conjured up by the spell of "Old Murray," and we see her looking over those
                  spectacles, as she used to do when she meant to be "awful." One day she "put out"
                  celibacy, and though 'twas the name of her lonely state—poor old lady!—that
                  circumstance didn't let her into the pronunciation, and "sillybossy," for so she
                  gave it, threw the class into convulsions. Great was her wrath on that memorable
                  day. Two of us were imprisoned beneath the stairs; two were sentenced to stand
                  upon one foot, one held in extended hand Walker's Dictionary—decidedly a
                     great work was that dictionary; and a lad who was desperately
                  "afraid of the girls," was set between a bouncing brace of them.
               But it wouldn't do. "Sillybossy" wouldn't down, and smothered sounds, chokings,
                  outright laughter, broke forth from every corner, around the perplexed and angry
                  schoolma'am. Years have fled; the tenant of the old yellow house is doubtless
                  borne away, and "the places that once knew her, shall know her no more for
                  ever."
               So much for "old Murray," and the memories it has awakened; and beautified by
                  time, I can almost wish myself back again, in the midst of the days when Murray
                  was a terror, and his pages a mystery.
               But why didn't "the master" hint, sometime, that we should never be
                  done with the tenses until we were done with time? That the world is full of them?
                  That the world is made of them? That, for the sturdy, iron present tense, full of
                  facts and figures, knocks and knowledge, we must look among the men in
                  middle-life—the diggers and workers of the world; the men who, of all others, have
                  discovered, for the very first time, at forty or forty-five, that the present
                  tense is now; that in the shop, the store, the warehouse, the
                  field—on docks and decks, the real, living present, reigns supreme? That, for the
                  bright, golden, joyous future—full of the tones of silver bells and beating
                  hearts, merry tongues and merry feet, you must look in our swarming schools, peep
                  beneath little soft blankets, in cradles at firesides, or examine small bundles of
                  white dimity? That we should find the future astride of the rocking-horse;
                     lullabying a wax baby; flying kites,
                  trundling hoops, or blowing penny-whistles? Why didn't he tell us—or did he leave
                  that for the poets?—that they who wear the silver livery of Time; that linger
                  tremblingly amid the din and jar of life; whose voices, like a failing fountain,
                  are not musical as of old; that they are the melancholy past?
               Why didn't he teach us—or did he leave that for the preachers?—that "cold
                  obstruction" claims all times for its own: glowing action, the
                  present; hope, the future; and memory, the past?
               "One pluperfect!" Ah! we have had that to unlearn since. "One
                  future!" Who does not thank God, that, in this world of ours, there are a
                  myriad?
               "I shall be," and "I might have been!" The former the music of youth, sweet as the
                  sound of silver bells; fresh as 
                     "The breezy call of incense-breathing morn;"
                   the latter, the plaint of age, the dirge of hope, the inscription for a tomb.
                  The one trembles upon thin, pale lips, parched with "life's fitful fever;" the
                  other swells from strong young hearts, to lips rounded and dewy, with the
                  sweetness of hope and the fulness of strength. The one is timed by a heart that
                  flutters, intermits, flutters and wears out; while that of the other beats right
                  on, in the bold, stern march of life.
               "I shall be," and "I might have been!" What toil and trouble, time and tears, are
                  recorded in those little words—the very stenography of life. How like
                  a bugle-call is that "I shall be," from a young soul, strong in prophecy! "I shall
                  be—great, honored, affluent, good."
               "I shall be," whispers the glad girl to herself, as with one foot upon the
                  threshold of womanhood, she catches the breath from the summer-fields of life, "I
                  shall be—loved by-and-by!" That is her aspiration; for
                  to be loved is to be happy.
               "I shall be," says the struggling boy, "I shall be the possessor of a little home
                  of my own, and a little wife, some day, and the home shall be "ours,"
                  and the wife shall be mine, and then—and then—" Who can fill out
                  those "thens?" Who, but the painter that has dipped his pen in sunset? Who, but
                  the poet whose lips have been touched with a coal fresh from the altar of
                  inspiration?
               "I shall be—victorious yet," murmurs the man in the middle watch, who had been
                  battling with foes till night fell, and is praying, like the Greek, for dawn
                  again, that "he may see to fight."
               "I shall be," faintly breathes the languishing upon her couch of pain—"I shall be
                  better to-morrow, or to-morrow;" and she lives on, because she hopes on, and she
                  grows strong with the "shall be" she has uttered.
               And the strong man armed, who has "fought the good fight," and has "kept the
                  faith," when they that sustained his extended hands through the battle are
                  departing, and no Joshua to bid the declining sun "stand still," as he looks
                  beyond the rugged hills of the world, and sees a window opened in heaven, and a
                  wounded hand put forth in welcome, lays aside the armor he has worn so long and
                  well, and going down into the dark river, he utters, with a hope glorified to
                  faith, "I shall be over the Jordan to-morrow!"
               Before the memory has a tomb in it—before it becomes the cemetery, the "Greenwood"
                  of the soul—"I shall be" is beautiful as an old ballad. When graves are digged
                  therein, and willows are planted, and hopes are buried, and no light breaks out of
                  the cloud, then "I shall be" is as grand as an old pæan. When 
                     
                        The battle is done, the harp unstrung,
                        Its music trembling, dying,
                     
                   Then "I shall be" is as sublime as an old prophecy!
               But there is another tense in this Grammar of Life it were well to remember; the
                  sparkling moment that dances out from the ripening hours, like golden grain,
                  beneath the flails of Time, as we write, and even as we write, is gathered into
                  the great garner of the Past.
               There is an injunction it were well to remember: 
                     
                        "Trust no Future, howe'er pleasant;
                        Let the dead Past bury its dead;
                        Act, act in the living Present—
                        Heart within and God o'erhead!"
                     
                  
               
               
                  From "January and June."
               
            
            
            
               
               WE SHALL MEET AGAIN.
               BY MRS. LYDIA BAXTER.
               Written after Receiving a Visit from a Long Absent Brother.
               
                  WE have met and we have parted;
                  Joy, by tears is chased away,—
                  Golden hours, too soon departed,
                  Oh, how transient pleasure's sway!
               
               
                  I have lived my childhood over,
                  Chased the butterflies again;
                  Been with thee a happy rover,
                  On the mountain and the plain.
               
               
                  I have pillow'd on my bosom,
                  Joyfully thy infant head;
                  Plucked again the fragrant blossom
                  To adorn thy sleeping bed.
               
               
                  Childhood's happy hours sped sweetly,
                  Youth's bright days were quickly passed,—
                  Manhood's prime is passing fleetly,
                  We shall reach the goal at last.
               
               
                  Sorrow's blight has crushed our ardor;
                  Sad afflictions wrung the heart;
                  Buds have opened in love's arbor,
                  But to cheer us and depart.
               
               
                  Ah, my dear and much loved brother,
                  Earth is not our place of rest;
                  Glorious hope points to another—
                  'Tis the mansions of the blest.
               
               
                  Oh, that we may clasp each other,
                  On those verdant hills above;
                  When earth's parting scenes are over,
                  Filled with holier, sweeter love.
               
            
            
               THE FATAL CHOICE.
               BY A PASTOR'S WIFE.
               SOME years since, while accompanying my husband on a round of pastoral visits, I
                  first became acquainted with the beautiful Mrs. Temple. She welcomed us with great
                  cordiality to her home, and conversed with much interest upon general topics, but
                  when the subject of personal religion was introduced, we found with sorrow that
                  "God was not in all her thoughts." It was a time of more than usual religious
                  interest in the place, but she was even then wasting her precious time, taking
                  lessons in dancing. She was earnestly and affectionately entreated to consider the
                  danger of the course she was pursuing, but her reply was—"Oh, I cannot convert my
                  own soul,—God must do the work, and He can do it as easily in the
                  dancing hall as in the prayer-meeting; and you know He did do so in
                  the case of Mrs. S.," (referring to a lady in the village, who, while engaged in
                  the dance, was convinced of her folly, and led to humble herself at the Saviour's
                  feet.) "She did not seek the Lord," continued Mrs. Temple, "but the Lord sought
                     her, and converted her soul. This is the religion I
                  wish for, and I am willing to wait God's time." She said this with a determined
                  air, which plainly indicated that she wished to have no further conversation on
                  the subject. As we left the house, my husband said with a tone of sadness—"The
                  spirit is striving with that heart; poor deluded creature—this may be her last
                  call."
               The work of grace went on—some even from the dancing-school were led to forsake
                  all for Christ; but the heart of poor Mrs. T. arose in opposition, and the light
                  jest, and bitter sarcasm were often her replies to the faithful warning of
                  friends.
               One pleasant morning in spring, we gathered around the baptismal waters; and while
                  many a Christian wept for joy as a band of young disciples followed the footsteps
                  of the blessed Saviour, the unhappy Mrs. Temple said to one near her, in a
                     scornful manner—"these are not the
                  Lord's converts, but Mr. —'s," (referring to him who was then performing the
                  sacred rite.)
               A year had not passed away, before we again visited the subject of this sketch,
                  but under what different circumstances! Within a darkly curtained room, pale and
                  emaciated, lay the once blooming Helen Temple. Scarcely had she been permitted to
                  clasp with all a mother's tenderness her first-born to her bosom, ere the hand of
                  disease was laid heavily upon her, and the angel of death seemed ready to summon
                  her away from earth. She eagerly seized the hand of her pastor, as he seated
                  himself by her bedside, and exclaimed, "Oh! Mr. —, I turned from your kind
                  invitations and warnings while in health, and scorned the religion of Jesus—now I
                  must die without it; I have sinned away the day of grace; there is no hope for
                  me." Deep grief was depicted upon her countenance, as she uttered these
                  expressions of bitter self-condemnation.
               Her pastor endeavored to soothe her excited feelings, and said in a quiet tone—"It
                  is true, Mrs. Temple, too true, that you have despised and rejected your
                     best friend, but you need not despair. If you sincerely repent of
                  your sins, the arms of forgiving love are even now extended to receive you." "Oh,
                  no," she said, interrupting him; "God will not forgive me, for I cannot repent. My
                  judgment is convinced, but my heart is like the flinty rock,—I cannot feel. I know
                  I am a sinner, and I knew it," she continued with deep solemnity of manner—"I knew
                  it the last winter, when God was in this place by His Holy Spirit. I was convinced
                  of my sin,—but I would not repent. You and other faithful friends warned me of my
                  danger, but I closed my ears—hardened my heart, and drowned my feelings in the
                  excitement of the dance. Now the day of grace has forever fled."
               Overcome by the intensity of her emotions, she sank back exhausted, upon her
                  pillow, and after entreating her to look to the Saviour as her only hope, we again
                  with saddened feelings took leave of our friend. Within a few days my husband was
                  summoned to the dying bed of Mrs. Temple. A serious indisposition prevented him
                  from complying with the request; and I took his place beside the sufferer. As I
                  clasped her hand within my own, I wept. "Oh, that I could weep," she said, in
                  feeble accents, "but my heart is stone." I spoke to her of the tenderness of the
                     sinner's friend, and begged her to lay hold of the precious
                  promises in the Word of God. I read to her some of the Saviour's own words of
                  consolation to the humble, contrite soul. She listened earnestly for a while, and
                  then exclaimed, "This does not apply to me—I am not an humble, contrite soul, I am
                  only fearful of dying in my sins." "God knows the heart," I commenced to say;
                  "Yes," interrupted she—and never shall I forget the expression of her countenance,
                  as with eyes and hands raised upward, she went on,—"Yes, God's all-searching eye
                  is looking directly into my heart, and He sees that I wish to be reconciled to Him
                     now, only because I fear to meet Him at the judgment unprepared;
                  but if I knew that I should live, I could not give up the pleasures
                  of the world."
               My spirit sunk within me at these words,—I feared she had been given over to
                  hardness of heart; and thus she died. No cheering ray of hope penetrated her
                  gloom—her light went out in darkness—a warning to those who trifle with the
                  Spirit's gentle influences,—reject the kind admonitions of Christian friends, and
                  choose the way that leadeth to the chambers of death.
            
            
               EVENING.
               How admirably is this portion of time adapted to contemplation. When the cares and
                  labors of the day are over, and the sable mantle of night is thrown around the
                  earth, all nature is hushed to rest; it is then we call to mind scenes of pleasure
                  which we have enjoyed, or of pain which we have experienced. And how often in the
                  lone hour of evening, do our thoughts wander back to the days of our childhood,
                  and perchance to the old school-house where we had many a hard task to perform,
                  and to the social gatherings, which seemed like so many bright spots in our
                  pathway. But O, how soon the scene is changed, some that were active and gay, have
                  been laid beneath the clods of the valley, and the wintry winds sigh a requiem
                  over the graves of those we loved;
                  others have sought a home in the far west, and are toiling amid privations, which
                  none but those who have experienced them can know. How few there are in this wide
                  world, who, if they turn aside from the noise and bustle of life, ere they are
                  aware, will not find themselves thinking of some friend that has gone to the
                  spirit land; it may be a dear mother, or a kind and indulgent father who provided
                  for their wants, or a sweet and idolized child, whom they have watched over with
                  all a parent's solicitude. Amid such reflections, how appropriate are the lines of
                  Cox: 
                     
                        "Silently the shades of evening,"
                        Gather round my lonely door,
                        Silently they bring before me,
                        Faces I shall see no more."
                     
                  
               
               But again, we not only reflect upon scenes that are past, but we form plans for
                  the future; and if our hearts have been renewed by divine grace, our thoughts will
                  not be confined to things of earth, but in the stillness of the evening, while we
                  may be admiring the "Heavens as declaring the glory of God, and the firmament as
                  showing forth his handy work," we shall by faith view the star of Bethlehem as
                  infinitely surpassing in splendor the starry orbs which we behold with our natural
                  eyes. And happy are we if its blessed light is shining upon our pathway through
                  this dark world, and leading us to adore that Being who made all worlds, and keeps
                  them in existence, and to think of that one above all others, where they need not
                  the light of the sun or of the moon; and where not one thought of separation from
                  friends shall disturb the peace, or mar the enjoyment of those who are at rest, in
                  that world of bliss which has no evening, but where the inhabitants experience one
                  eternal day.

               A FEW THINGS ABOUT THE MOTHERS OF TOUNGOO.
               TO MOTHERS IN AMERICA.
               BY MRS. ELLEN H. B. MASON.
               TOUNGOO is a very Tadmor, having in, and close around it, about two thousand palm
                  trees, some fifteen hundred of which are coryphas, or flowering palms. The Burmans
                  there affirm that these do not blossom until two hundred years old, and yet I saw
                  five or six hundred in blossom together. It was under the shadow of these palms
                  that we spent our first Sabbath in Toungoo; and a more interesting day I never
                  enjoyed. The house we occupied was formerly the seat of the Myusahya, or City
                  Recorder; and a good sized hall in the centre was the Myusahya-kadan's drawing
                  room. Here I took possession, and invited the women to listen. I had a good
                  interpreter, by whom I could readily communicate through the Pwo; and they
                  appeared different from any Burman women I had ever met. Generally they are very
                  curious about our clothes, food, and color; but the assembly on this Sabbath day
                  seemed only anxious to hear about our religion; and I never in America saw deeper
                  interest depicted on human countenances, than these women exhibited during this
                  interview. The Sahya-kadan was herself there, and a very nice, lady-like person
                  she was, too. Among orientals she would have been called a charming woman; and she
                  was really fair. Her hands were covered with costly rings, but in other things her
                  attire was of the common sort, except the distinctive mark of rank, a rich silk
                  mantle drawn over her shoulders.
               I encouraged the company each to speak about herself, and,
               "Ah! me," says one, "I am the mother of five children, and am now childless."
               "I am the mother of nine," says another, "and of all, but one remains to me;" and
                  so it went round, from one to another, each telling her own heart-burthens, many
                  of them with tearful eyes.
               
               "But, Jesus, when on earth, loved poor, sorrowing woman, and—
               "Did He?" questioned the Kadan.
               "Yes; and what do you think He said to them?"
               "We don't know—we never heard of Him before."
               Here I tried to tell them of those "mansions," which Jesus said he was going to
                  prepare; adding that their little children were undoubtedly up in those beautiful
                  rooms, waiting for them.
               "Our children up in beautiful rooms? Do you think they are?"
               "Yes."
               "With whom?—what's the name?" and here they tried to pronounce the new name of
                  Christ, but made it sound so oddly, that they all burst out laughing.
               "Yes, yes," trying to reassure them, "that's right, Yashoo-Kraik;
                  and he has promised something to all who become his followers."
               "What? What is't?"
               "He says he'll wipe away all their tears."
               "Does He? Can he, if we cry very much?" smiling.
               "Yes; and that's not all."
               "What more? Do tell, for we never heard of such a man before.—What's the
                  name?"
               "Yashoo-Kraik."
               "Ya, ya, Yashoo-Kraik, Yashoo-Kraik;" and all repeated the name,
                  trying to learn it.
               "Yashoo-Kraik says he will give you something better than rings or dresses, better
                  than children or husbands;" explaining to them their own sinful state, and need of
                  a Saviour.
               "Ya, ya, we are all sinners—great sinners; we get angry, we fret, we
                  repine, we talk bad, and we do bad."
               "Yes, at such times Naht-so (the evil spirit) comes to the
                  verandah of your hearts, and says, 'May I come in?' 'Hoga,' you
                  say, and in he comes, and begins to blow and blow, until he has filled your hearts
                  with anger and wretchedness."
               "True! True!" all responded, with interest, "but Naht-so is
                     tai-sothe, (very bad,) and will come in."
               "Hear this," spoke up a young Karen disciple, near us, who had been for some
                  minutes turning his Karen Testament.
               "What is it, Moung?" questions the Sahya-kadan.
               "Hear this;" and he read to them the 4th of Luke, how the devils at Christ's
                  command came out of many, crying out that he was the Son of God; adding that
                  Christ had conquered all the Nahts more than a thousand years ago, and exhorted
                  them to believe in Him.
               "We do believe," exclaimed several voices at once," and hereafter we'll worship
                  Jesus Christ."
               "Do you say true? Will you surely worship God's Son?"
               "Hoga."
               And so we dismissed them, they saying, "We'll come, and hear more to-morrow."
               The next morning they did come again, filling our room full, and more than full.
                  So I began by inquiring if they remembered what was said to them the day before.
                  Some few tried to tell, but the most they could say was, that we must worship one
                  Jesus Christ.
               "But who is Jesus Christ?" inquired a very sensible looking woman, who was not in
                  the day before. "Where can I find him? Is he in Maulmain, or in Bengala? Where did
                  he die? Will he ever come again?" she continued eagerly, and when satisfied on
                  these points, "Why," she exclaimed, "have I never heard this before? I believe in
                  this Jesus Christ. My heart seems to light up a little."
               "And mine, too," joined in the lady of one of the chiefs. "How is this?" she
                  continued. "You see me an old woman. I began to look for Areemataya when so high,"
                  pointing to a child some seven or eight years old. "I have been looking ever
                  since, and haven't found him yet. It is of no use to look any longer. I'll worship
                  Jesus Christ."
               This woman's case was particularly interesting. She was so eager to learn of
                  Christ, it was not enough for her to sit in the circle, but she bent forward as
                  far as possible amidst the crowd, as if she would devour every word; and when the
                  company retired, still there she sat, as party after party came and went, until
                  nearly night. Several times her children had come and called her, but she would
                  reply:
               "Let me alone. I must hear. I am old. What is this world to me?"
               
               At last she vanished away, unseen, and I never heard of her again. But she
                  reminded me strongly of a convert in Dong-yahn. A woman who had been all her
                  lifetime a Buddhist, until her conversion to Christianity; and after that she had
                  once fallen into idolatry. But she had also truly repented. One day I had been
                  telling the sisters something about the Saviour and heaven, which this old lady
                  did not perfectly understand; so she left her seat, and came and sat down beside
                  me.
               "What is it, teacheress?" she inquired. "Tell it again, please."
               I repeated.
               "Again, mama, I don't quite understand;" putting her hand to her forehead as if
                  trying to concentrate her thoughts. Slowly I again explained in the simplest
                  manner possible; and now light seemed to burst in upon her understanding.
               "O, I see it! I see it!" she cried, her eyes and hands uplifted towards heaven,
                  while the tears coursed down her cheeks. "I see it! I see it!" and there she sat,
                  gazing upward, until her whole face shone with an unearthly radiance. What she saw
                  I know not; but undoubtedly the angels whispered her precious things.
               I assure you, my dear sisters, when I think of these scenes, of the beloved
                  disciples, and the poor heathen women groping for light, my spirit goes back to
                  Burmah, with longings inexpressible.

                  As Israel's desert Guide;
                  Thy radiant wings, with mystic fold,
                  Both light and shade supplied.
               
               
                  Symbol of Heavenly Providence,

                  And see thy radiant lustre rise,

                  O guide their children still!

               HE IS YOUR BROTHER.
               HAS he fallen in an evil hour? Has the Tempter gained the victory, and the young
                  and hopeful one yielded to his power? Suppose he has.—He is your brother. Do you
                  not remember, long years ago, when you were a child, how faithfully he shielded
                  you from the dangers which lurked around your pathway—how like a guardian angel he
                  protected you, while hand in hand you wandered through the forest, or plucked
                  bright flowers in the meadow? Who led you to and from school, and carried your
                  satchel? Who was ever ready to share your little trials, and plead your cause when
                  you were in disgrace? This very brother—was it not? Then turn not your back upon
                  him now. Upbraid him not; but take him kindly by the hand—whisper gently in his
                  ear the words of love and affection;—tell him how he may return to the path of
                  virtue;—encourage him by your smile, your sympathy, and example. Gain his
                  confidence—get at his heart, and lead him back to hope and happiness. Who can tell
                  the mighty influence of a sister's love?
               He is your brother.—Yes, that boy sitting over his lessons, is your brother.
                  Tired, discouraged, and almost ready to give up in despair. Go to him, sit down by
                  his side—assist him in his perplexities—help him out of his difficulties. It may
                  be a few words of explanation from you, will lead him through the whole lesson,
                  and for pay, he will give you smiles and blessings, which will more than
                  compensate you for the assistance rendered, and you will feel that it is
                  infinitely "more blessed to give than to receive."
               He is your brother.—Could you follow him through the mazes of business for one
                  day, you would not wonder that he came home crushed and overwhelmed with care and
                  anxiety—you would not wonder that he seemed wrapped in his own thoughts, and
                  scarcely noticed what was passing—that he had little interest in the social
                  gathering, or the circle of gayety. He is your brother, and perchance is toiling
                  for you. Then strive to make home a place of rest for him. Be careful
                  not to intrude; and yet if possible, divert him from his business perplexities.
                  Make your plans through the day have reference to his comfort and happiness; prove
                  to him by your self-denial and consideration that you appreciate his toilsome
                  days, and that you desire to do all in your power to make his evenings cheerful
                  and happy.
               He is your brother.—How his eyes follow you, and his ears listen to catch the
                  sound of your voice or footstep. Ah, could you look far down in the deep recesses
                  of his heart, and know the unutterable love he bears you, you would never weary of
                  his complainings, as you sometimes call them. Leave him not, he will need your
                  care but a little while; that pale cheek and marble brow, will soon lie cold and
                  silent in the fresh earth, and the green turf will cover his dreamless bed! Be
                  gentle to the lovely invalid, soothe his feverish brow with the kiss of
                  affection—bathe his throbbing temples with the dew of a sister's love—talk to him,
                  read to him, sing to him,—oh! he will bless you a thousand times, though he may
                  not be able to tell you so;—you can read his thanks in his dewy eyes, as they look
                  so earnestly into yours; and long after those eyes are closed in the sleep that
                  "knows no waking," and that feeble voice is hushed forever upon earth, will the
                  sweet memory of his love send forth its fragrance into your lonely bosom.
               He is your brother.—Does he weary your patience and cause the tears of sorrow to
                  flow afresh? Do you sometimes feel that the care of such a child is too great for
                  one like you? Stop a moment, hear the voice of your dying mother; "My daughter! I
                  leave my choicest earthly treasure with you. Take care of your little
                     brother." Did you promise?—Then be faithful, be true,—he is your
                  brother, and upon you in a great measure depends his future character. Shelter him
                  with your sisterly devotion from blasts of worldly influence—make him feel that he
                  has a warm place in your heart, a bosom that is ever ready to sympathize in his
                  boyish griefs, an adviser on every subject, and when years have passed away, and
                  the tender plant shall have become as the "green bay tree," you will bless God
                  that you were permitted to watch over the early life of such a brother.

               THE MISSIONARY MARTYR.
               Suggested by reading the Memoir of Mrs. Eliza Grew Jones.
               BY C. H. M.
               
                  BRAVE woman, thine it was to bear the word
                  Of life to pagan lands afar! In days
                  Of girlhood, faint thoughts of holy heaven
                  Thy soul oft visited, like sweetest strains
                  From angel's harp. With maiden years, and mind
                  Of rarest gifts, thou mad'st a firm resolve
                  To give thy life to Christ alone, and bear
                  His sacred cross. Thy matron prime was given
                  To mission toil, in foreign climes; and though
                  Nor stake, nor rack, brought thee a cruel doom,
                  Thine was a martyr's death!
               
               
                  With ivory brow,
                  Where sits bright thought enthroned, and gentle eye
                  Downcast in studious mood, we see a gifted girl
                  Intently bending o'er the classic page.
                  Not in a summer's noontide breathless calm
                  Does placid lake reflect the mottled sky,
                  With varying light and shades, more perfectly
                  Than her fair features the studied spirit
                  Of Grecian lore, or Hebrew text within
                  The book of inspiration. Reading, thus,
                  Of crime with purple dagger drawn, a frown
                  Obscures her brow; at pageantry of pride,
                  Her lip with scorn is curled; where scenes of peace
                  Smile blooming in the sunny light of love,
                  Her features are the mirror; dewy tears
                  Brim o'er the lid, in sympathy for woe.
                  Thus taught, her pious heart intently yearns
                  For perfect consecration. Her free mind
                  Disdains to droop its stainless snowy wing
                  Beneath its native skies. Above the world,
                  Through boundless space it soars, till, bathed in light,
                  It nears the eternal gates of heav'n: thence views
                  The earth, dim rolling through the burning stars,
                  And sees, diminished to a mimic show,
                  Its pompous vanity. Its beauty gone—
                  Its pride laid low in dust—its worshiped shrines
                  With ashes strewn, it seems a loathsome corpse,
                  Enshrouded in a dusky pall of sin,
                  And hearsed in tenfold blacker doom, or borne
                  Six thousand years unto a fiery grave!
                  With thoughts like these, her fervent spirit thrills
                  Like harmony in music. Christian faith
                  
                  Now fires her soul to bravely act a part,
                  In the world's redemption.
               
               
                  Her spirit grew
                  In superhuman strength. From home, at length,
                  With all its joyous scenes, and cherished ones
                  In holy love enshrined, her pious heart,
                  Bleeding for those who never hear of Christ,
                  Itself exiled: she sailed o'er broad, deep seas,
                  To Siam's burning strand.
               
               
                  Aslant the beams
                  Of rising sun fall on pagoda'd heights,
                  And pilgrims flocking to an idol shrine
                  With num'rous off'rings: there a tawny priest,
                  In yellow robe, performs some pagan rites,
                  And every devotee kneels gloomily
                  Before a graven image; and the sun,
                  As though also a worshiper, slow creeps
                  Adown the marble spire, and fretted dome
                  Of gold, and gilds the altar's snowy wreath
                  Of incense with his homage rays. Lo! now,
                  Among the dusky throng, appears a form
                  Almost angelic: in her gentle eye
                  Soft bliss swims solemnly, her mien is kind,
                  And Christian armor glitters on her limbs.
                  A group around her gather. She, of Christ,
                  And life through faith in Him, speaks touchingly.
                  Though in the fetters of a foreign tongue,
                  Her speech is made with plainness. On their minds,
                  Like northern lights quick streaming o'er the vault
                  Of midnight sky, break bright'ning thoughts of heav'n,
                  And true salvation.
               
               
                  Sweet's the dew that falls
                  Upon the lily's silver bell—full glorious
                  
                  The starry host at night—sublime the roar
                  Of ocean surge, fierce tempest dashed against
                  A rocky coast; but sweeter, stronger far,
                  More glorious, and more sublime the love
                  Of her, who, consecrating all to Christ,
                  Through eight long years toil'd in a pagan land,
                  And very life itself thus sacrificed,
                  To bear to sinful souls the Word of God,
                  And life eternal. Blessed woman, she has,
                  Trampling beneath her feet all worldly things
                  As steps upleading, to her heav'nly home
                  Gloriously ascended! No proud tomb
                  With monumental shaft, or storied urn,
                  May mark her lonely grave 'neath Asia's sun;
                  Gold ne'er did float its treasures to her feet,
                  Nor chaplet, woven of immortal bloom,
                  May wreathe with fame her memory. Yet more
                  Than pomp, or wealth, or fame is her high boon;
                  For her angelic brow a crown shall wear,
                  All gemmed, like stars ineffable, with souls
                  As her reward.
               
            
            
               THE LITTLE BEAVER.
               THE instinct of the beaver approaches the bounds of reason. Their dexterity in
                  constructing habitations, and rearing mounds to repel the watery element,
                  surpasses that of all other animals. A gentleman who resided where they abound
                  wished to ascertain whether this was inherent, or the effect of imitation. He
                  took, therefore, to his house, an infant beaver, ere its eyes were opened. It was
                  an inmate of his kitchen, where one day, from a leaky pail, a small stream of
                  water oozed upon the floor. Out ran the little beaver, and collected sticks and
                  clay, with which it built a dam to stop the passage of the tiny brook.

               DREAMS OF YOUTH.
               BRIGHT dreams they are, yet who would disturb them? Who would break the short
                  sleep in which young hearts are gathering strength for life's weary day, by the
                  clangor of its coming cares? Who would lift his hand to bring a shadow across that
                  opening vista, so fair and beautiful? Who would stay that bubbling fountain, or
                  turn its waters to bitterness? You who have drank the cup of earth's sorrows and
                  disappointments to its very dregs, would you have these dreamy days of youth 
                     substracted
                     subtracted
                   from your sum of life? Would you not fain at times dream them again, to
                  give some tints of light to the dark picture with which your eye now wearies? Ah!
                  the dark shadows come soon enough. Cankering cares, and the blights of
                  disappointed hope settle full soon enough on the fair scene, when the bright
                  fountain becomes bitterness to the taste.
               
                  Life is joyous, and it is given us in a world full of beauty; then why not enjoy both? Why not rejoice in
                  the bliss of the one before it becomes earth-fettered, and crippled by infirmity;
                  and revel amid the charms of the other, as they glitter in the firmament, and
                  smile in varied hues and forms on every side, perfect from the Creator's hand.
                  Yes, let childhood and youth be happy in their buoyant natures, their gushing
                  affections, and light hearts; and as you participate in their joy, point them to a
                  scene fairer, to pleasures more satisfying, to joys enduring, at the right hand of
                  Him who garnished the Heavens, who fashioned their curious frames, and attuned
                  their powers to such relish for happiness.
               Life's morning—life's spring-time is bright, it is the only vestige left since the
                  fall, of the wreck of guileless innocence and human happiness. It is the type of
                     restored innocence, and eternal beauty, which will clothe those
                  who are born into the image of God, and who, from the depths of sorrow, and the
                  infirmities of flesh, shall burst the bands of death, and flourish in immortal
                  youth.
               As we write, our eye rests on that inimitable picture of human life, "The Weaver,"
                  written by the late Mrs. E. C. Judson, and though it presents all the dark shades
                  which sorrow throws over our lagging day-dreams, it is nevertheless to our
                  purpose, for it displays the gleamings of those bright threads with which youth is
                  busy, and the visions of the robe and the crown which await the faithful. It was
                  written years ago, but it seems almost prophetic of her own eventful and
                  sorrow-stained path.
               Perhaps no heart was ever more keenly alive to the deliciousness of life, and its
                  attendant joys, than hers. She fully appreciated all its pleasures and
                  friendships, and her nature was as susceptible to its disappointments and sorrows.
                  But the throbbings of her heart have ceased, and we trust her disenthralled spirit
                  is enjoying that bliss which knows no termination or alloy.
               
                  MRS. M. G. CLARKE.
               
            
            
               
                  A weaver sat by the side of his loom,
                  A flinging the shuttle fast;
                  And a thread that would wear till the hour of doom,
                  Was added at every cast.
               
               
                  His warp had been by the angels spun,
                  And his weft was bright and new,
                  Like threads which the morning unbraids from the sun,
                  All jewelled over with dew.
               
               
                  And fresh-lipped, bright-eyed, beautiful flowers
                  In the rich soft web were bedded:
                  And blithe to the weaver sped onward the hours—
                  
                     Not yet were Time's feet leaded!
               
               
                  But something there came slow stealing by,
                  And a shade on the fabric fell;
                  And I saw that the shuttle less blithely did fly—
                  For thought hath a wearisome spell!
               
               
                  And a thread that next o'er the warp was lain,
                  Was of melancholy gray;
                  And anon I marked there a tear-drop's stain,
                  Where the flowers had fallen away.
               
               
                  But still the weaver kept weaving on,
                  Though the fabric all was gray;
                  And the flowers, and the buds, and the leaves were gone.
                  And the gold threads cankered lay.
               
               
                  And dark—and still darker—and darker grew
                  Each newly woven thread;
                  And some there were of a death-mocking hue—
                  And some of a bloody red.
               
               
                  And things all strange were woven in,
                  Sighs, down-crushed hopes and fears;
                  And the web was broken, and poor, and thin,
                  And it dripped with living tears.
               
               
                  And the weaver fain would have flung it aside,
                  But he knew it would be a sin;
                  So in light and in gloom the shuttle he plied,
                  A weaving these life-cords in.
               
               
                  And as he wove, and, weeping, still wove,
                  A tempter stole him nigh;
                  And, with glozing words, he to win him strove—
                  But the weaver turned his eye.
               
               
                  He upward turned his eye to heaven,
                  And still wove on—on—on!
                  Till the last, last cord from his heart was riven,
                  And the tissue strange was done.
               
               
                  Then he threw it about his shoulders bowed,
                  And about his grizzled head,
                  And gathering close the folds of his shroud,
                  Lay him down among the dead.
               
               
               
                  And I after saw, in a robe of light.
                  The weaver in the sky;
                  The angels' wings were not more bright,
                  And the stars grew pale it nigh.
               
               
                  And I saw 'mid the folds, all the Iris-hued flowers,
                  That beneath his touch had sprung;
                  More beautiful far than these stray ones of ours,
                  Which the angels have to us flung.
               
               
                  And wherever a tear had fallen down,
                  Gleamed out a diamond rare;
                  And jewels befitting a monarch's crown,
                  Were the foot-prints left by Care.
               
               
                  And wherever had swept the breath of a sigh,
                  Was left a rich perfume;
                  And with light from the fountain of bliss in the sky,
                  Shone the labor of Sorrow and Gloom.
               
               
                  And then I prayed, when my last work is done,
                  And the silver life-cord riven,
                  Be the stain of Sorrow the deepest one
                  That I bear with me to heaven!

               THE CHRISTIAN'S CROWN.
               THAT ye may close with Christ, remember there is a sixfold crown which shall be
                  put upon your head. Would ye have a long life? Then come to Christ, and ye shall
                  have a crown of eternal life. Would ye have glory? Then come to Christ, and ye
                  shall have a crown of glory. Would ye have knowledge of the mysteries of God? Then
                  come to Christ, and he shall crown you with knowledge. Would you have eternal
                  felicity and an uninterrupted happiness? Then come to Christ, and ye shall have an
                  immortal crown. Would ye have holiness and sanctification? Then come to Christ,
                  and ye shall have a crown of righteousness; yea he shall put a royal crown upon
                  your head, a crown of pure gold. O, what a day, think ye, it will be, when Christ
                  shall hold your crowns in his hand, and shall put them upon those heads, never to
                  be removed again.

               CHRISTIAN EDUCATION, INTERMINABLE.
               BY PROF. T. F. CURTIS.
               A FEW years ago, while perusing some manuscript remarks of a venerable friend on
                  female education, I noticed this among other profound reflections: "Civilization
                  must advance just as far as the female character advances—it cannot rise above
                  that point—it cannot fall below it. All experience shows that society must come to
                  her level, and can by no artifice or effort be made to deviate from it." It is
                  astonishing that Guizot, while detailing all the other elements of our modern
                  civilization, should have quite omitted any fair mention of this—esteemed by
                  Napoleon the most important of them all—maternal influence. He has
                  spoken of barbarism as introducing personal independence, one prime element of our
                  civilization, of the feudal system, the Buccaniers—the Crusaders—the Christian
                  Religion—but not a word is said of the female sex as a cause of our present
                  civilization. And yet it will be found that maternal influence is the great
                  conservator for succeeding generations, of all that is valuable which we possess;
                  and it is the day-star of all our brightest future prospects. Indeed I have quoted
                  from the manuscript of the venerable divine alluded to, chiefly for the sake of
                  carrying it a little further, and remarking that the Christian
                     character of a community must advance just as far as maternal influence
                  carries it—that it cannot permanently rise above that point, and will not long
                  remain below. Education, in the hands of pious mothers, is the great hope of the
                  church and of the world. Christian education, indeed, exhibits itself as the
                  perfection of all true education, by its embracing these two great principles. It
                  is interminable, and all-embracing.
               It is interminable, for it is a drawing forth of the mind, begun, indeed, by the
                  parent, but where successful, never to stop. It is a line, the course of which you
                  indeed begin to mark out, but which is to be protracted on and on forever.
               
               There is not a more ambiguous, nor, as it is commonly used, a more mischievous
                  phrase in the English language than that most common one—a finished
                     education. It is at best like the cloudy pillar between the Israelites
                  and the Egyptians, a cloud of darkness on the one side, and of light on the other.
                  As we sometimes speak of a finished picture, so to the deep thinking it may and
                  perhaps does convey the idea of an accurate, symmetrical, and polished education.
                  To such, the chosen few, the true Israelites of knowledge, journeying to their
                  promised land, it may be a pillar of light, but to the many who understand by a
                  finished education, an education finished, terminated, it is a cloud of
                  darkness.
               Some years ago, I remember it became my duty to address a young ladies school at
                  the close of its session. I was afterwards informed of a pupil who, just before
                  finally quitting the institution, in the presence of all her young companions,
                  gathered together her school books, tore them all to pieces, and made a bonfire of
                  the fragments. Then, as if she had performed an achievement equal to Cæsar when he
                  burned his ships, she sat down and coolly watched the smoke as it wreathed, and
                  the flame as it curled—exclaiming, "Now I have done with books—now for parties and
                     pleasure—now I've finished my education."
               The error that I would here in a few words combat, belongs not only to
                     religious, but to all education—the error of
                  supposing that it ever can be rightly finished, or indeed suspended, 
                     
                        "While life, or thought, or being last,
                        Or immortality endures."
                     
                  
               
               For what is education? Is it not, as already hinted, the leading
                  forth or drawing out of the mind in a particular direction? The word educo from which it comes, shows us the true idea.
                  Instruction then, and education are by no means the same thing. The one is limited
                  and partial, the other boundless. They rather present the two opposite poles of
                  the same general thought—the two great processes by which all mental and moral
                  improvement is carried on. Instruction is the pouring of knowledge
                  into the mind from without—education is the drawing out of the soul
                  itself to appropriate, to feed upon and assimilate the knowledge. Two precisely
                  similar conditions are necessary to the growth of the body—there must be food, but
                  there must be also the putting forth of the vital force in digestion, to
                  assimilate that food, or it will lie a dead weight of inert irritating matter. All
                  instruction then, is from without; all true education is from within. You may
                  teach a child a number of facts, and you thus instruct it in those
                  facts. But unless that knowledge is met by a corresponding activity of the mind
                  within; unless it stimulates and rouses up the soul itself to develop and combine
                  ideas from these facts, to feed on knowledge, to expand and grow in power and in
                  force, there is no education. You may instruct a parrot to talk, or a
                  monkey to imitate, but you cannot educate either to argue or to think. Or the mind
                  may be compared to a plant in this respect, that all its real growth must be by a
                  vital force in the soul itself; an expansion from within of its own. As with the
                  ivy or the jessamine, the hand of man may dig about and water it, and train it by
                  a gentle guidance, but it must grow of itself by its own vital power. For us by
                  force to draw out the tendrils of the vine, might make them longer, but could not
                  make them grow. Yea, it would destroy the hope of all future growth. So in
                  education. By a forbearingly exercised authority, and gentle guidance, the mind
                  may in early life be trained and led out into various forms of beauty and of
                  grace, but still the vital forces of all mental and moral growth lie within, in
                  each faculty, given and quickened by God. All true education is but the
                  development, the uncovering, so to speak, one by one, of those latent forces; yea,
                  it must all be conducted in the faith of those forces being there in a latent
                  state; in the high faith of a continual Divine presence and energy working in the
                  mind, and giving efficiency to instruction.
               But if this is true of education generally, how much more is it true of
                  religious—of Christian education. "Paul may plant and Apollos may water, but
                     God giveth the increase." We may give religious instruction, but
                  it must be in the lofty, earnest, daily faith of a direct Divine influence, both
                  to rectify the disorders of the heart in its present state, and to quicken and
                  vivify the soul anew, to appropriate the nutriment of all instruction given, by a
                  holy assimilation, that so the heart and affections, religiously expanded panded, the buds, the blossoms, and the
                  ripened fruits of grace, may each in due time appear.
               Such being the nature of all education, we must then suppose every faculty of the
                  soul to have received the utmost of possible development and expansion, before the
                  work of education is completed, finished. But can this take place in the present
                  life? No. It will not take place even throughout eternity; for the soul of man,
                  whether for good or evil, happiness or woe, starts here on its great mission, but
                  is impelled onwards forever by the great law of progress. When a tree ceases to
                  put forth new leaves and new branches in spring, it is because it has ceased to
                  live. But the soul never ceasing to exist, is ever growing. Even the body daily
                  grows, as it daily wastes, and incorporates new matter as it throws off the
                  decayed. So the soul, from its own nature, must be continually growing, educating
                  in some direction; parting with husks of old knowledge that have been assimilated
                  by loss of memory, but supplying the waste by a constant progress.
               Every new fact, every new principle, appeals to some faculty, which, if ready to
                  assimilate it, is thus nourished and expanded; and not until every possible
                  combination of ideas has been exhausted, can limits be set to the expansion of the
                  mind; or, in other words, can its education be considered as complete.
               All this is especially true of man, considered as a moral and religious being.
                  Every year changes and enlarges his relations to other beings, in proportion to
                  the expansion of his mind, just as every age changes the relations of this nation
                  to other nations of the globe, as knowledge and intercourse increase. But new
                  moral obligations ever spring up with new relations, stimulating and expanding the
                  moral sense; thus the mental and moral powers of man will go on expanding and
                  strengthening each other mutually throughout futurity, as new worlds, new
                  relations, and new duties ever unfold themselves. Thus all existence, all
                  eternity, will but develop one vast scheme of spiritual progress and
                     expansion—education.
               Once more, if we wish to know when education is to terminate, let us inquire when
                  it begins. If it commences with life itself, as we shall find it does, then can it
                  only be supposed to terminate with existence. It is not, we assert, a thing of
                  period at all. It does not begin at two, to end at twenty, but belongs to life, as
                  life begins with existence, and continues as long as existence endures.
               There are, indeed, as we shall see, two great and widely distinct periods in
                  education, that of the involuntary, and that of the voluntary expansion of our
                  powers—of instinctive and of self-education.
               The instinctive thirst after knowledge is born in a child, as much so as the
                  aptitude and desire to receive sustenance from its mother; and it has with truth
                  been observed, that a child learns more the first year of its life than any year
                  afterwards. But how? Not from any conscious duty of self-improvement, or from any
                  settled purpose to acquire information. But it is an instinct. With its eye it
                  learns to measure distances. With its little hands it feels about, ascertains the
                  solidity and touch of various substances; moves all its tiny limbs with a
                  perpetual restlessness, and thus learns practically the laws of motion and of
                  gravitation. It cries and it laughs, and tries the power and the workings of its
                  puny temper; spells out authority from a father's frown, and learns affection from
                  a mother's look. It copies the action, and what is more important, it imbibes the
                  very spirit of those around it, and is thus, all involuntarily and unconsciously,
                  educating itself from the hour of its birth. And it will too, I think, be found,
                  that the beginnings of moral education are traceable quite as early
                  and distinctly as those of intellectual. Indeed it is only through
                  the child's inclination to love, and its disposition to obey its
                  parents, that you usually first discover that it perceives them. Now, here, in
                  these two principles of love and obedience, lie the deep foundations of all piety.
                  The Latin word pietas was applied anciently as
                  properly to this love and reverence towards parents you know, as towards the
                  Supreme Being, because I apprehend, it is a part of the same great feeling of
                  love, veneration and obedience, first excited by parental care, that educated and
                  trained by grace arises, and twines itself around the Throne of the Heavenly
                  Parent. So that the earliest infant lispings of a child's affection, discover to
                  him a germ of the same emotion to his parent, to which the aged and profoundest
                  theologian comes round, as the highest of all religious thought or feeling, when
                     he bends in prayer before the Most
                  High, and says, "Our Father who art in heaven." Here then is the germ of its
                  future religious character beginning to develop itself under parental guidance, in
                  the infant of three months old. Thus early is the young soul pushing forth its
                  tendrils. Parents and teachers prune or nip some of these tendrils in the bud, and
                  stimulate and train the rest; and we then aim to establish a regular action and
                  healthy habit, until the individual will, that most powerful agent in
                  nature, gradually assumes a sufficient force to regulate the matter itself. Thus
                  by degrees is matured and separated the germ of an independent character, as the
                  ripened seed with a principle of life of its own established within, drops easily
                  and naturally from the parent capsule, to commence life on its own account. Then
                  begins the great work of voluntary education, the most important, because that to
                  which attaches the responsibility of the individual. And now the instinctive
                  thirst for knowledge, as knowledge greatly dies out in man, or rather is
                  superseded by the more ardent desire of knowledge, as the means to an
                     end. The activity of the reflective powers overcomes in measure that of
                  the perceptive, and at length the moral rises higher than the whole range of the
                  intellectual. And thus we go on through time, educating all the while for
                  eternity.
               All, therefore, which is commonly called education, even a finished
                  education, relates only in fact to the preparatory stage, the formation of a
                  character, a principle and habit of that great self-education which is to go on
                  eternally.
               Intellectually speaking, the most thoroughly educated young person is not always
                  the one who has the most knowledge of facts, but the one who most loves and
                  thirsts for knowledge, from a deep insight of the relations of all truth; even so
                  viewed from the Christian stand-point. The young person upon whom a religious
                  education has proved most successful, is not always the one of greatest placidity
                  and amiability of temper, or even activity in outwardly good actions, but who most
                  thirsts after, and loves holiness. This is then to be the great end and aim of all
                  parental religious training, during the first or involuntary period of education,
                  to establish the steady love and thirst for holiness, chosen as the supreme
                  principle and great foundation of all voluntary education.
               This very distinction that I have pointed out between a mere instinctive and a
                  chosen piety, an instructed and voluntary religious character, is expressed in the
                  Christian system in the great doctrine of conversion. It is alluded to in the book
                  of Proverbs, where its author speaks of that marked period in the lives of the
                  wise and good, "When wisdom enters into the heart, and knowledge becomes pleasant
                  to the soul." Prov. 2, 10. It is not then until this conscious love, choice, and
                  effort after a life of heavenly wisdom is established, that Christian education in
                  the highest, that is the voluntary sense, is begun, and if so, where short of
                  eternity can it find its full development?
               Thus, then, have we considered one great principle of education—that it is rightly
                  considered interminable.
            
            
               
                  "A peopled home is the ocean bed;
                  The mother and child are there:
                  The fervent youth and the hoary head,
                  The maid with her floating locks outspread,
                  The babe with its silken hair;
                  As the water moveth they lightly sway
                  And the tranquil lights on their features play:
                  And there is each cherished and beautiful form,
                  Away from decay and away from the storm."
               
            
            
            
               
               CHRISTIAN EDUCATION, ALL-EMBRACING.
               BY PROF. T. F. CURTIS.
               TURN we now then to the other great principle, that it should be
                     all-embracing.
               What has been the history of all education apart from Christianity thus far, and
                  what has been its greatest curse?
               That it has been so one-sided. It has cultivated one part of our
                  being at the expense of another, cherished one set of faculties, until it has
                  thereby stunted the rest.
               The first and rudest notions of education that men had, led them to cultivate the
                  body at the expense both of the mind and the morals. This has been the education
                  of all barbarous nations from the days of Tubal-cain to those of the North
                  American Indians. The Spartan laws were the embodiment of this kind of training.
                  The tendency of all has been to make men strong in war: educated so far as
                  physical strength and animal power and passion is concerned, but destitute of
                  wisdom and of piety. In such a state of society a Samson will be made judge
                  because he is the strongest, and Saul made king because he is the tallest.
               As the world waxes older men find the folly of this idolatry of brute force, and
                  they now educate the intellect. Saul gives place upon the throne to Solomon, and
                  the renown of the Spartan fades before that of the polished and intellectual
                  Athenian.
               But men soon find that mere intellectual cultivation is not the education that can
                  make man happy; that it may co-exist with the greatest moral depravity, and
                  creates as many miseries as it cures, and they sigh for something better.
               Now men begin to perceive the power of moral cultivation, now the wisest gives
                  place upon the throne to the holiest, and the glory of the Grecian fades before
                  that of the Christian. This is the natural history of education. Christianity
                  becomes perverted for a while by superstition—hermits retire to their cells and
                  grottos, and celibacy is extolled, and a life of idleness: popes put their feet
                  upon the necks of kings, and a one-sided religion, a life of idleness under
                  pretence of communion with God, and of ignorance under the pretext of piety,
                  carries the day. But this is essentially anti-Christ and a false religion; in this
                  especially that is a one-sided view of the true and proper education
                  of man for the glory of God.
               True Christianity is all-embracing. It does not neglect the body for
                  the sake of the intellect, nor the intellect for the sake of the heart. But it
                  lays hold of the heart, and through it enlarges and stimulates the intellect—and
                  through that directs and excites the activities in a thousand new forms of
                  practical usefulness. Thus, in proportion as a pure piety enters a community—every
                  activity, physical, mental, moral, will increase; liberty will become a necessity,
                  since the inward energy cannot be pent up, and will be best directed usually by
                  conscience within.
               This is indeed the radical idea of all true holiness of character; for it is
                  nothing more or less than wholeness of character in its highest sense. It is a
                  character in harmony with all the relations it sustains to God, to man, and to
                  self.
               And here I cannot help admiring and blessing God for that arrangement which
                  commits the earlier education of the young to the mother rather than the father.
                  For as the strength of some one or two features of his character is the glory of
                  man, so a great symmetry, harmony, piety, and holiness is unquestionably as a
                  whole the characteristic of woman.
               If what I have said be true, there can be no such thing as true
                  education—education in the highest sense of the term, of which religion is not the
                  basis. For young persons to grow up with an acute and stimulated intellect—but an
                  untrained heart, is the most fatal barrier against their ever after becoming truly
                  well educated persons, in any true sense.
               A Christian parent cannot omit to teach a child to regulate itself by decidedly
                  Christian principles and motives from its earlier years, without cutting at the
                  root, as it were, of all mental, moral, and physical discipline; for "the
                     fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." So far from a parent being
                  satisfied for a child to grow up out of
                  Christ—to begin life a sinner, and trust that he will come round to religion when
                  settled in life, we ought rather to feel that until communion with God be
                  established as the habit and ruling principle of the soul, though continued
                     instruction may be most useful, as it is certainly a duty, yet its
                  education is not begun upon a proper basis. For as a watch of most perfect
                  mechanism, but from which the main-spring or the balance wheel had been extracted,
                  would inevitably be useless for the purpose for which it was designed, and could
                  at most but wear itself out in violent but useless motions; so with the elastic
                  and noble spirits of the young. Unless piety regulate them as the balance wheel,
                  or move them as the impelling power, they will fail to accomplish the great object
                  of their creation; and even the most brilliant intellect, unless under the control
                  of a sanctified heart, will work but with the erratic, exhausting, and useless
                  violence of a watch without a balance wheel. On the other hand, nothing will
                  secure such a depth of understanding, such an insight into the reason and
                  profoundest causes of all things, 
                     physicial
                     physical
                   and spiritual—nothing will give such a clearness and penetration to the
                  intellect, as a high sense of duty to God—as daily communion with the Creator and
                  Father of all things. "The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the
                     eyes." "The entrance of thy word giveth light, it giveth understanding
                  to the simple." There is then a divine element at the basis of all true and
                  perfect education, as there is in all life, and it is in proportion as we look for
                  and have faith in a spiritual energy to strengthen, enlighten, and direct the mind
                  that we can best succeed in making any valuable progress.
               It follows, from what has been said, that Christian education must not only be
                  what the Germans would call many sided, but proportionate. And that
                  before the great period when self-education can properly and perfectly begin,
                  piety must for its true proportion be the supreme regulator in order to the
                  harmonious and most beautiful development of the whole soul. For any of the
                  activities of our being to be disproportionately prominent or obscure, is as bad
                  as for any feature of the countenance or limb of the body to be too large or too
                  small for the rest of the frame. A perfectly well balanced or beautiful soul is a
                  spectacle even more rare than a perfectly beautiful countenance. Socrates used to
                  speak much of the two Venuses, one the representative of bodily beauty, which the
                  vulgar worshipped, the other of the beauty of the soul, which the wise and good
                  alone adored. Christian education, rightly conceived, tends ultimately to the only
                  possible blending of both in one.
               This proportionate development both of soul and body, of which an earnest piety is
                  the all-pervading vital principle, is the highest aim of Christian education.
               I know not how better to illustrate this than by comparing the characters of some
                  of earth's most celebrated women, for it is in woman, as I have said, that we
                  expect and find the most numerous examples of harmony and proportionate
                  beauty.
               Take first the character of Cleopatra, who educated her personal
                  charms, her bodily beauty, to a singular perfection. She was indeed highly
                  intellectual, and would converse with ease and grace with the ambassadors of many
                  courts in their own tongues. Her manners too were polished with every refinement.
                  But after all, these were only adjuncts, like the silken sails with which she
                  navigated the Nile, to set off her own charms. To fascinate and please by personal
                  beauty was her highest aim. And now the proud Cæsar, and now the voluptuous Antony
                  experienced her extraordinary powers. In what lay the great error and misery of
                  her education? That she made the cultivation of personal beauty the most prominent
                  end and aim of her life. Her graces, her intellect, her moral principles were all
                  subservient to this. Hence she murders her brother, divorces her husband, deserts
                  Antony, and ends her days a suicide, to exhibit throughout all history the
                  wretched effects of the disproportionate cultivation and reliance on mere personal
                  charms.
               In the life of the beautiful but unfortunate Mary, Queen of Scots,
                  we have another exhibition of the same truth. Great indeed was the cultivation of
                  her intellect. But impartial history must admit that this was in her but secondary
                  to her beauty, at least until the period of her heavy misfortunes. Then indeed,
                  purified in the fires of affliction, she was led to cherish the higher and nobler
                  powers of the soul, and she came forth as gold. The soul became as beautiful in
                  solitude and sorrow, as the person had
                  been at the gay court of France. Her early fault was the disproportionate
                  cultivation of personal charms. The pity she excites is from her subsequently
                  cherishing her higher and more spiritual affections; the first made her life
                  unhappy, the second made her death so touching and triumphant.
               Take now another of earth's famous women,—famous for the disproportionate
                  prominence of her intellectual powers; one who ruled a kingdom by the force of
                  mind, without the graces either of person or of heart—Queen
                  Elizabeth. Never was a kingdom governed with more ability. Never was more
                  substantial progress made. Never were greater dangers averted. Never did a woman
                  do so much for a people as she. The nation became respected and independent
                  abroad, and peaceful and happy at home. The English language was brought to its
                  highest purity and refinement. Colonies of immense historical importance were
                  planted, and the Protestant religion firmly established.
               But go to court, and see who sits upon the throne of England. A woman with no
                  charms of person or of manner, yet inordinately vain: nor merely inviting, but
                     demanding compliments and flattery the most fulsome,—in short, an
                  utterly disgusting woman. One who can curse and swear in her imperious rage, and
                  even murder a rival queen under the forms of law from envy of her beauty and her
                  graces. One who dies a loathsome spectacle of pride and haughtiness and the fear
                  of death, endangering even the succession of a kingdom. What Christian mother
                  would have her daughter sit on such a throne if she must be such a character. Yet
                  such is the natural history of a merely intellectual education.
               Mark now another celebrated woman of a nobler stamp of character by far. All heart
                  she—Joan d' Arc, the maid of Orleans. One whose high soul swelled with a religious
                  and patriotic enthusiasm the most lofty. One who brooded over the invasion of her
                  native land, till, like a second Deborah, she headed the armies of her country, to
                  free it from the hoof of the oppressor. Of heated imagination and ardent faith,
                  this rude peasant girl had no cultivated charms to win men, nothing but
                  truthfulness and simplicity; no education of the intellect. But her soul was drawn
                  out by a religious fervor. And this it is, that has won the adoration of the great
                  heart of the world.
               True, her zeal was disproportioned, and her fervors ill grounded. Hence the
                  reaction that left her weak and shorn of her spiritual strength. But she has left
                  the world a rare, though fragmentary specimen of the controlling power and majesty
                  of the religious affections—showed us that there is something more admirable than
                  mere beauty, and more powerful than mere intellect in a soul filled with pious
                  affections.
               Turn we now, then, to a character that more fully exhibits the harmonious and
                  proportionate cultivation of the whole nature—a truly beautiful soul—Hannah Moore.
               Without distinguished birth or fortune, to push her forward, she appears in London
                  with good sense, a highly cultivated mind, engaging manners and powers of
                  conversation. Johnson and Garrick are attracted by her, and she becomes the life
                  of intellectual society. But gradually, and without losing any of this power,
                  Christianity develops itself more and more prominently, until it becomes,
                  obviously, the supreme and ruling principle of her soul, and she does more to
                  promote the moral and religious education of her country than any woman in
                  England. With the same pen she writes tracts for the poor, treatises on education
                  for the only daughter and heir of the blood royal, and arguments in defence of
                  Christianity, that win the admiration of bishops and divines. Here you see the
                  moral and religious feelings gradually assuming their natural and proper
                  supremacy. Not destroying, but controlling, refining, and elevating all the other
                  powers.
               Take but one character more, and we have done, one that exhibits more completely,
                  and in still higher power, true beauty developed by Christian education. I am
                  about to speak of Mrs. Judson. Brought up in one of the retired, but
                  religious communities of New England, where an uncompromising and all-pervading
                  piety impregnated the whole atmosphere she breathed from earliest infancy; she
                  from a child appears intellectual and amiable, in a high degree. At sixteen she
                  makes a profession of religion. Thus commences the great period of
                     self-education with her, and the first lesson she learns is to be
                  the pioneer of female missionary life, to consecrate herself to Christ by being
                  bound with him in Christian baptism. Henceforth beneath a torrid zone is the great
                  work carried on, in ministering, if it be but with a cup of cold water to a
                  husband sick and in prison for Christ's sake, and in binding ing up the broken-hearted, till her own heart is
                  broken. But she can turn easily from the dungeon to the palace, with singular
                  propriety receive the honors, and with equal wisdom discharge the duties of an 
                     ambsssador
                     ambassador
                  , write elegant dispatches in Burmese, negociate a treaty—a treaty of
                  deliverance for a husband, of peace for Burmah and for Britain, of prosperity for
                  the mission that lies nearest to her heart. And having thus won from the proudest
                  courts, barbarian and Christian, unbounded admiration by the spiritual
                     all-pervading beauty of her presence;—the harmony and perfection
                  of her education, having roused in her native land an enthusiasm for
                  her great cause, and begun a work the glory of the age, she lies down under the
                  Hopia tree, that her body may rest from its long fatigues, while the spirit rises,
                  to bathe in the sea of light and glory round the eternal throne, and carry on the
                  great work of its education, as a ministering spirit, or in the company of
                  cherubim and seraphim.
               The freshness and perfection of this great character—what a British officer who
                  once saw her, well termed the spiritual, the un-earthly beauty of her
                  presence—is that it is the beauty of holiness. You see not here as in
                  Hannah Moore, religion as the highest point of knowledge, but as the beginning of
                  her wisdom.* Not
                  education terminating in piety as its natural goal. But an elevated
                  piety as it were the great starting point, and main-spring of the life-work of
                  self-education; the source of its untiring energies, and its loftiest triumphs.
                  Hers was no earth-born education climbing upwards to the light above, but a
                  Heaven-born principle, easily and gracefully descending alike to the meanest and
                  to the highest duties of the present state.
               
                  *Compare closely Prov. 1 : 7, and Prov. 9 : 10,
                     in the Hebrew for the illustration of the distinction here alluded to.
               
               Here lies the peculiar beauty and perfection of her character, one that
                  Christianity alone can give, and give when possessed, at the same time, by parents
                  and by children. In her, education was 
                     
                        "Not soiled
                        And worn, as if from earth it labored up;
                        But as some bird of heavenly plumage fair,
                        It seemed, that down from higher regions came,
                        And perched it there, to see what lay beneath."
                     
                  
               
               Thus, then, have we considered these two great features of Christian education—its
                  interminable extent, and its all-embracing and proportionate characteristics—and
                  we have seen that it develops the whole being with a perfection, that nothing else
                  can approach.
               The results which follow from this are so obvious, and so encouraging to your
                  great work, that I need hardly allude to them. For to you, as Christian mothers,
                  is especially committed of God this highest of all tasks. Be assured, then, that
                  those things for which you pray for your dear children, concern their highest
                  welfare, both for time and eternity; that the earlier they give themselves to God
                  in a true conversion, the more complete will be their education and their
                  happiness; because of their conformity to the very highest laws of their being.
                  Learn not to despise the day of small things, but to remember that the kingdom of
                  heaven begins in the heart as a grain of mustard seed, and that if the seed be
                  only right, little as it may be distinguishable in its earliest stages, it will
                  soon assume its native supremacy, under whose shadow every bird of heaven may
                  repose.
               Mark, too, the importance this subject gives to all the instructions 
                     of of
                     of
                   the Sabbath school. Let us also hope that the day is not far distant
                  when Christianity will be more fully recognized even than it is, as the basis of
                  all education, even in the daily school, and that denominations and
                  churches, will aim to extend their usefulness by new Christian schools of the very
                  highest character. "That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; and
                  our daughters as corner stones polished after the similitude of a palace."
               And now, my dear young friends, children of many prayers, let me close these
                  remarks by beseeching you, while pursuing your education, to remember the
                  throbbing anxious hearts of your mothers. You little know how your conduct affects
                  them. They gradually forsake and wean themselves from most of the friends of their
                  youth, to devote themselves more and more to your welfare, and in it all they look
                  for no other joy and satisfaction, than that of seeing you do well in life. The
                  hope of your future piety, happiness and distinction is all that supports them, as
                  they watch by your bed at night, and provide for your wants by day. In you they hope to live over again; to have their old
                  age cheered, and their eyes closed in death by children, wiser and more honorable
                  than themselves. You will not disappoint them, nor bring down their gray hairs
                  with sorrow to the grave.
               Oh, that mother is indeed unhappy, who is afflicted with worthless or undutiful
                  children. No sorrow is like her sorrow. Disease and death are blessings compared
                  with the anguish that rends her heart. She soon grows old, and the afflictions of
                  age are doubled upon her. There is a figure in one of the prophets by which
                  Rachel, the mother of some of the tribes of Israel, is represented as disturbed in
                  her very grave, and rising from it to weep over her degenerated and destroyed
                  children. "A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping, Rachel
                  weeping for her children, and refusing to be comforted." The heaviest
                  grief in all nature, is that occasioned by evil children.
               But, on the other hand, if you are what, from the prayers that have consecrated
                  you, and the instructions you are receiving, there is every hope you may
                  become—pious, holy young persons, then bereavements may come, and poverty may
                  come, and lands, and property, and riches, make to themselves wings and fly away,
                  but your mothers will turn on you the eye of affection—and say exultingly, like
                  that Roman mother—"These, these are our jewels." Your conduct will
                  whisper those consoling words to her heart. "Thus saith the Lord, refrain thy
                  voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears, for thy work shall be rewarded, and
                  there is hope of thine end, and thy children shall come again to
                  their own border."
            
            
               
                  Wasted!
                  Precious pearls of time, moments rich as diadems!
                  One by one they came unnoted; one by one afar they floated!
                  One by one! till myriads sped far away to join the dead.
               
            
            
            
               
               
                  
               
               A JAUNT TO THE WHITE MOUNTAINS.
               WHERE shall we go to spend the sultry days of July and August? We have for many
                  months been shut up within the enclosure of high brick walls, and in our rambles
                  confined to dusty streets, till the increasing heat of summer inclines us to go
                  abroad, where we can refresh ourselves with the breath of green fields, and stroll
                  or rest beneath their cooling shades. Some will go to the sea side, bathe in the
                  ocean wave, and feast upon its dainties. Some will go to the springs to quaff the
                  healing waters, and mingle with the gay and fashionable whom they will there meet;
                  while others will fly to Niagara, where they may gaze for once on that mighty
                  stream, which pours the waters of a chain of inland seas over a precipice of more
                  than a hundred and sixty feet into another sea, from which, in a broad and
                  majestic river, it makes its way to the ocean.
               For ourselves, we have decided to take a trip to the White Mountains of the "old
                  Granite State." From the foot of Walnut street, we take the "Camden and Amboy"
                  route to New York. A splendid steamboat bears us on over the bosom of the Delaware
                  river to Bordentown, where we take the cars across the state of New Jersey to
                  South Amboy, where we again resume the boat on the Raritan river, nor pause till
                  the great commercial mart looms up before us, with its forest of masts and
                  beautiful green Battery in the foreground. The spire of old Trinity points high
                  above them, and the immense dome of the custom house relieves the eye.
               We care not to stop long in this city, for we have often been there, and the
                  country is what we are now seeking. Being somewhat fatigued with a morning's
                  travel of nearly a hundred miles, and a stroll about the city of some two or three
                  hours, till our eyes are tired of seeing 
                     and and
                     and
                   our ears of hearing, we decide to avail ourselves of the ease and
                  amplitude of boat travel, when we can have it, rather than a day's pent up, and
                  straight up ride in railroad car on the morrow.
               We soon find ourselves in a spacious and richly furnished cabin for we take the route via Hartford, through Long
                  Island Sound, and up the Connecticut river, where we are always sure to find one
                  of the finest boats afloat on American waters. We first look out our resting
                  places for the night, and find them in neatly furnished state-rooms, or in berths
                  behind the ample folds of rich damask curtains. Having disposed of our carpet
                  bags, brushed a little of the dust from our raiment, and taken a short doze, we go
                  again on deck to take leave of the city in due form, when the boat leaves the
                  wharf. This is generally done by bowing, kissing hands, &c., to friends on
                  shore, or idly gazing on the multitude.
               As we leave the city, and pass through the trembling waters of what is called "the
                  gate," our attention is arrested by the splendid mansions of wealthy citizens, who
                  have retired from business, built them houses, and planted them vineyards on the
                  shores of Long Island. Here their mansions repose in stately magnificence,
                  embowered in trees and shrubbery, for the noble purpose of sheltering those who,
                  perchance, live only to enjoy the pleasures of ease and affluence. Have such never
                  heard that they "who live in pleasure, are dead while they live." We doubt whether
                  a Christian should ever retire from business, so long as there is a single tribe
                  unblessed with a preached gospel, or the blessing of Christian homes.
               Having supped on viands, and at a table which might well suffice for kings and
                  princes, and sat, or promenaded on deck, till the golden twilight has long been
                  hid in the west, we are sensibly admonished by the state of our entire natures
                  corporeal, that it is indeed time to lay ourselves away for the night. We breathe
                  our gratitude to the Father of mercies for his care through the day, and commit
                  ourselves to his faithful keeping for the night. We are soon lost in sleep, and
                  dream of crowded streets, green hills, placid and perturbed waters, mirroring blue
                  and golden skies, with a retinue of confused objects, we scarcely remember what,
                  till we awake and find the boat at rest near one of the most interesting cities in
                  New England. It is not one of those mushroom towns that sprang up in a night, but
                  it is one of a more staid and certain growth. Its foundation was laid, more than
                  two hundred years ago, in prayers, in tears, in blood, by some Puritans from
                  Boston, who cut their way through the wilderness, subsisting sisting on the milk
                  of their cows, with the nuts and wild fruits they found in the woods, after a
                  journey of fourteen days, the same that is now performed in less then as many
                  hours. Such was the origin of Hartford, the beautiful city now before us.
               Here we must stop over one day, at least, for here we have friends—friends that we
                  loved in "days of auld lang syne"—and we love them still. We mention one whom we
                  highly esteem in love for his work's sake, on whose lips we hung for instruction
                  in days of our girlhood, and from whose hand we often received the symbols of a
                  Saviour's dying love.
               Having found our friends and received the welcome greeting, and being refreshed
                  with the good things of this life, we are now prepared for a stroll. The Athenæum
                  first attracts our notice. Here we are introduced to a very kind old gentleman,
                  who desires us to write our names in a large book spread out on a table before
                  him. We are next introduced to the Saltonstalls, the Huntingtons, the Trumbulls,
                  in portraiture, with other distinguished dignitaries of a former age. To be
                  sure—and there is ex-governor Cleveland, in a half portrait, as large as life,
                  with his lofty brow and sparkling black eyes, staring us full in the face! We did
                  not expect to be gazed at with such eyes as these. We move on, and a little to the
                  right we see some of the cooking utensils and furniture that actually came over in
                  the May Flower. Among them is an old chest on which, by the sea-side, it is said
                  our pilgrim fathers spread their cooked fowl, their broiled fish and roasted
                  clams, when all their corn was exhausted, and they had nought else to eat, and
                  over which they lifted their hands, and praised the Giver of all good for "the
                  fowl of the air, the fish of the sea, and the treasure hid in the sand." Blessed,
                  thrice blessed is the memory of those holy men, who pioneered for us in the waste
                  howling wilderness, freely toiling and suffering, to gain for us so "goodly a
                  heritage." May we ever prove ourselves worthy the rich legacy, nor allow it to be
                  contaminated by deeds of oppression and cruelty, or wrested from us by the "man of
                  sin."
               We next visit the state house, and are introduced to some of the honorable state
                  functionaries. There hangs the old charter of Connecticut, signed and sealed by
                  his majesty Charles II., king of England, dated April 2d, 1662, which continued to
                  be the constitution stitution of this
                  state till 1818, when a new one was formed. This is the identical instrument which
                  Mr. Wadsworth seized from the table, in the midst of the darkened and confused
                  assembly, with which he ran, fled, and hid it in the old oak, now known as "The
                  Charter Oak." It is now framed with wood of the same tree, that so long and so
                  faithfully concealed the sacred deposit.
               Having passed another night with our friends in H., we take passage on the
                  railway, "en route," for Springfield, Mass., following the course of the river,
                  through a tract of country which, for richness of soil, and beauty of scenery, is
                  not excelled, except by that anciently watered by the river of Eden.
               A tremendous and almost deafening blast of the car whistle, announces our near
                  approach to Springfield. Here we must also stop for a short time at least, for
                  here, too, are friends of precious and hallowed memory, and we cannot pass them
                  by. We love to dwell on "by-gone days," when we sat with them in the same
                  sanctuary, or held with them sweet intercourse at our several homes. The
                  excellent, and well furnished hotels in this place, strongly tempt us to become
                  their guests, but we seek a more private home with those we love, though none we
                  love more than some we have visited at the "Massasoit." We remember three or four
                  sweet little girls there, that were once our pupils. But time and nature, faithful
                  to her task, has nearly transformed them into young ladies, we hardly know them
                  now, though we love them still.
               The broad streets of this little city, embowered with elms and maples of gigantic
                  growth, its snug and comfortable homes, with their spacious and beautiful grounds,
                  its rural public squares, and sparkling fountains, conspire to make it a most
                  charming place. Then there is the United States Armory, its buildings and
                  complicated machinery, its public grounds, the old and new arsenal, the top of
                  which commands a most magnificent view of the town and surrounding country. On the
                  south and west you see the river, as it were lying placidly embedded in verdant
                  meadows, skirted by green hills, stretching far away in the distance. On the
                  north, Mount Tom and Holyoke tower up in the far-off heavens, like two pillars of
                  cloud, and on the east the everlasting hills stand sentinel, to repel the invasion
                  of storms and chilling blasts, from the boisterous Atlantic.
               Having finished our stay at Springfield, we repair to the depot, and, as the
                  caution directs, "look out for the engine while the bell rings." This is what the
                  people in Philadelphia call the locomotive, but I suppose the busy New Englander
                  cannot afford time to pronounce so long a word.
               We are now dashing forward over the "Vermont Central Railroad," with a speed far
                  outdoing Mazeppa in his famous ride upon a wild horse, through the country of the
                  Don Cossacks. This road is laid through what is really the valley of the
                  Connecticut. Lofty ranges of hills are on either side, nearly the whole distance.
                  Sometimes they rise abruptly from the road side—at others they take their stand at
                  a distance to make way for the bending stream that chooses, with most commendable
                  taste, to make its bed by the side of luxuriant meadows, fringed with trees of the
                  richest verdure. We soon come to Holyoke. Here a dam has been thrown across the
                  river, and its waters turned into a canal, where they are made use of to turn the
                  machinery of a city of factories. This is truly a place of an evening's growth. We
                  were there, and it did not exist. Again we were there, and its city-like houses
                  seemed to have sprung up, as it were, along the newly graded streets, without a
                  single tree to shelter them from the scorching rays of the sun. Here we are in the
                  immediate presence of Mount Tom and Holyoke, those giant elevations which awe you
                  into silence whenever you approach them, and give unspeakable grandeur to the
                  scene.
               We soon pass Northampton, Hatfield, Deerfield, and Greenfield, which, as one
                  writer observes, "could not be prettier if the poets and painters had combined to
                  construct a country after their most cherished rural ideas." We pass on, and soon
                  have occasion to compare these villages with Brattleboro and Bellows Falls. At
                  last Windsor takes you by surprise, as it rises so finely before you on the slope
                  of the Ascutney mountains, giving you at once the ideas of grandeur and
                  repose.
               The railway terminates at St. Johnsbury, near the headwaters of the Passumsic. As
                  you advance, "the scenery becomes grander and more sublime;" the track crossing
                  the river several times, winding
                  through deep gorges and along the base of vast rocky precipices, or seeming to
                  leap from thicket to thicket of deep verdure.
               Here the coaches leave for the White Notch, the Franconia Notch, and lake
                  Willoughby; the three great attractions of this region. The road, winding round
                  one hill after another, is in good condition, and easy of ascent. There is little
                  or no dust in the way, and for a great part of the distance, as you advance, the
                  scene grows wilder and more exciting. Mount Lafayette first rises before you some
                  five thousand feet; next the tall cone called the hay-stack looms in the distance;
                  then the Franconia range emerges from nothingness, and finally the White hills
                  appear across a vast waving scene of pine forests, which they bound, or rather
                  carry up, till they are lost in the clouds. Here words cease. We pause, and in the
                  profoundest depths of emotion, bow while those stupendous battlements of the
                  Eternal, lift up their stately heads, and are veiled in the heavens.
               Now look at the engraving, and see if you do not decide with us, to take a trip to
                  the White Mountains, where you can behold in detail the sublimity and beauty of
                  scenes which our pen and pencil have failed to portray.

               TOWN, with its myriad of cares, must at times be left behind, and peace of mind
                  sought for in the repose of country life. All men cannot take the luxury of a long
                  vacation; but most can allow themselves a few days of rustication, and all can
                  avail themselves of a boat or rail car to sniff for a day the bracing
                     breeze.—Tilt.
               
            
            
               DEPARTURE.
               BY MRS. A. M. EDMOND.
               
                  MOUNT, my soul, from earth and time,
                  To thy mansion in the skies,
                  Longing for those realms sublime,
                  Break thy fetters, upward rise.
                  Guardian angels hover nigh,
                  Whispering oft in gentle tone,
                  Fearless with thine escort fly,
                  They shall lead thee to the throne.
               
               
                  Cling not to these mortal shores,
                  Doomed to darkness and decay,
                  While upon thy vision pours
                  Light from Heaven's eternal day.
                  Thou shalt tread you golden streets,
                  To the ransomed freely given,
                  Joyful, quaff ten thousand sweets,
                  From the blissful streams of heaven.
               
               
                  Art thou shrinking from the tomb,
                  Shuddering in its chilling air,
                  Once, regardless of its gloom,
                  Christ, thy Saviour slumbered there
                  He hath risen, so thou shalt rise,
                  When the vale of death is trod;
                  Soar triumphant to the skies,
                  And the presence of thy God.
               
            
            
            
               
               A MOTHER IN HEAVEN.
               MY dear young reader, have you ever been called to part with that beloved earthly
                  friend,—she, who gave you being, who nursed you, cared for and loved you, from the
                  time those bright eyes first beheld the light of this sinful world, and has
                  watched by your little cradle in hours of suffering and distress.
               Oh! who on earth can love like a mother? who so patient, so kind, so ready to
                  excuse and feel for you in all your troubles and trials, whether great or small?
                  You know not what a treasure you possess, until it is snatched from you by the
                  rude hand of the fell destroyer who invades the home circle, and plucks a bud or
                  flower and leaves you to mourn their loss.
               Can you look back and think of the time when that fond Christian mother folded
                  those little hands of yours and taught you to lisp, "Our Father, who art in
                  Heaven," or, "Now I lay me down to sleep," or when perhaps she knelt by your side,
                  and asked a Father's blessing on the child of her love? such a mother was once my
                  treasure, but she is mine no longer, for the messenger came, and her weary spirit
                  joyfully responded to the call, and she is now in Heaven, singing praises to him
                  who is Lord over all. But can I repine? Ah! no, for far better is it for you to
                  know that you have a mother in Heaven, the mansion prepared for the children of
                  God, where the weary are at rest and the wicked cannot come, than to enjoy her
                  society here in a world of wickedness and sin.
               Be kind to thy mother. Not every one knows the depth of a fond parent's love.
                  Listen to her teachings, be guided by her counsel, for no earthly friend will be
                  half as true to your temporal or eternal welfare. May the God of the fatherless
                  and orphan watch over you all, and especially those who have mourned by the grave
                  of a mother. May the bereavement have been sanctified to the conviction and
                  conversion of all such, so as they may hope for a blissful reunion at a future
                  day.

               A DAY WITHOUT PRAYER.
               MRS. HARDING had retired late to rest, but she woke at peep of day, saying to
                  herself, "Ah, Henry is to leave to-day, to be absent a whole week, how I
                     shall miss him,"—and imprinting a kiss on his forehead, she
                  hastened to rise, in order to make preparations for his departure.
               She was scarcely dressed when she saw baby's dimpled hand stretching above the
                  counterpane. In a moment it was nestled in the dark locks of his sleeping
                  father.
               "Oh, Charlie, Charlie," said the mother, softly, "he cannot sleep
                  to-night," and the little one, hearing his mother's voice, stretched up both hands
                  to her, and threw off the bed-clothes with his chubby little foot. His mother
                  caught him in her arms, and said loving words, while the little fellow threw his
                  arms round her neck, and pressing his open mouth to her cheek, gave her sweet,
                  baby kisses.
               "Ah, no! mother must not loiter this morning," said she, disengaging herself from
                  his twining arms; and arranging his clothes, she set him in his cradle, and filled
                  both his hands with playthings. "Ho, hum!" said she, pressing her hands for a
                  moment to her forehead, and then stepped into the kitchen, where Ellen was just
                  kindling a fire, and gave some directions respecting breakfast.
               Presently she heard a little voice calling, "Mother, mother!"
               She stepped hastily to the door, and saw the black eyes and curly head of little
                  Willie, who had scrambled out of his crib, and stood peeping from the door of the
                  bedroom.
               "Hush, Willie dear, hush," said the mother, "you will waken father."
               "Father is already awake," said Mr. Harding; "good morning; good morning,
                  Willie."
               "Good morning, Father," answered Willie.
               "And where is Charlie?" said Mr. Harding, looking at his vacant place.
               
               "He has been up some time, but I have not yet dressed him," answered the mother,
                  and she hastened to prepare both the little boys for breakfast.
               After breakfast, Mrs. Harding commenced examining and packing Mr. Harding's
                  wardrobe. Little Charlie had been very worrisome for several days, and she had
                  been obliged to leave him more than usual to the care of Ellen. It was therefore
                  with some misgivings that she proceeded. She found many stitches to take. Buttons
                  were missing, strings torn off, and the coat which she supposed was hung away in
                  good order, had several fringed button holes.
               Now Ellen, though willing and capable, while following the usual routine of labor,
                  had no tact for the emergencies that are constantly occurring in a family. Mrs.
                  Harding was obliged to exert all her energies to have her task accomplished in
                  season, and what with nursing Charlie, trying to keep Willie out of mischief, and
                  giving directions about dinner, her time was fully occupied. Two o'clock came, and
                  by dint of uncommon exertion all was ready.
               Mrs. Harding stood with Charlie in her arms, and Willie was beside her, when her
                  husband started for the depot. He pressed both mother and little one to his bosom,
                  and, notwithstanding her efforts to prevent it, tears stood in her eyes as she
                  bade him adieu.
               Willie caught his father's hand, accompanied him to the gate, and came back,
                  shouting, "I had two kisses, mother; father kissed me at the gate!" while Charlie
                  stretched out his hands to his brother, and sprang almost from his mother's
                  arms.
               Mrs. Harding watched her husband till he was out of sight, and then returned to
                  the sitting room. What a scene of confusion presented itself! While she had been
                  at work, little fingers had been busy too. There were spools ravelled, boxes of
                  buttons emptied, and pins and needles scattered over the carpet.
               "Oh, Willie," said she, "you have made mother a great deal of work."
               "I sorry," said Willie, "I'll help mother;" and he stooped down and picked up a
                  handful of spools, and dropping half of them as he endeavored to put them in the
                  box, they rolled away in a worse condition than before. One dropped in Charlie's
                  lap, and before the mother could recover it, the outside was completely soiled by
                  his fingers, and the prints of his two little teeth were all round it.
               "Oh, Willie," said the mother, impatiently, "what a troublesome child you are, you
                  are enough to weary"—she checked herself, and said mentally, as she was in the
                  habit of doing when she felt irritated, "Did I not pray this morning that I might
                  be meek and patient?" Then flashed upon her the sad truth that, amid all her
                  cares, she had that morning forgotten her devotions. "Ah," thought she, "it is not
                  strange that I feel fretful. I did not ask my heavenly Father to keep me this
                  day," and she hastened to put the room in order, intending to call Ellen in, and
                  retire to her closet. But Charlie had gone past the usual time of his afternoon
                  nap, and none but his mother could soothe him to rest.
               Mrs. Harding had just laid the babe in the cradle when her friend Mrs. May came
                  in. At any other time she would have been happy to see her, but hers was not a
                  seared conscience, and feeling as she did, burdened with guilt, it required an
                  effort to appear tolerably cheerful. Mrs. May made a long call, and she had but
                  just left when Charlie awoke. He had taken his nap in the wrong part of the day,
                  and he was very fretful, and would sit with no one but his mother.
               The sun had set, and the evening was considerably advanced, when Mrs. Harding,
                  recollecting that Willie had not spoken to her for some time, withdrew her
                  attention from the little one in her lap, and observed that the older boy was
                  lying on the carpet. It was a very unusual position for him to be in, who was so
                  full of fun and frolic, and it excited her alarm.
               "Willie, dear, Willie!" said she, hastily.
               The little boy arose, and came slowly towards her, saying, "Willie is very cold;
                  Willie wants to go to sleep."
               His mother took his hand in hers; it was burning hot. She directed Ellen to bring
                  some warm water, and bathing his feet, she gave him some simple remedy, and placed
                  him in his crib. He had dropped to sleep in her arms, and when she kissed his
                  parched lips, he did not waken.
               "Ah," thought she, "how gayly he scrambled out of his crib, this morning—perhaps he will never do it again, and
                  I, oh wicked mother! I have not prayed for him to-day."
               Charlie was screaming violently, and, placing Willie in as comfortable a position
                  as possible, she hastened to take him. The child was in the worst of humors, and
                  for a long time not even the sweet lullaby of his mother could soothe him to
                  quiet. It was ten o'clock ere the little fellow dropt asleep, and his weary mother
                  laid him carefully in bed, and bent over Willie.
               He was still asleep, but his breathing was quick, and the distressed mother could
                  see by the rapid pulsations in the blue 
                     viens
                     veins
                   in his full forehead, that he was burning with fever.
               "Dear Willie," said the mother, wringing her hands, "how I wish his father was
                  here, and oh how I wish I could pray. But I cannot, I dare not! It
                  will be insulting the Almighty to call upon him in my distress, when I forgot him
                  while I was happy—he would not hear me now!"
               Sadly and slowly undressing herself, she laid down beside the slumbering Charlie,
                  but she could not sleep. The feverish state of her little boy, and the burden upon
                  her conscience, kept her wakeful. Often did she raise her head to distinguish the
                  breath of the sleeper in the crib from that of the sleeper by her side, or to
                  place her hand carefully on Willie's burning brow.
               "Thank God," ejaculated she, as she felt that there was a slight moisture
                  perceptible, "how little did I deserve this." This was her last conscious thought
                  ere sleep overpowered her.
               It was light when she awoke. The little sleepers by her side both breathed
                  tranquilly, yet there was a weight upon her heart.
               Sadly came the remembrance of yesterday's neglect, and then for the first time she
                  noticed that a storm had arisen during the night, and the wind was blowing
                  heavily. She shuddered when she reflected that her husband was on the water, and
                  perhaps even then struggling with the waves.
               The thought was agonizing. She endeavored to banish it, but in vain. Her excited
                  fancy saw the rich locks of the husband mingled with the dripping seaweed of the
                  rocky shore, his forehead chill and pale, and his smiling mouth distended and
                  ghastly. "Perhaps he is dead," said she, "and I, I who love him so much, never
                  prayed that he might be protected by Him who holds the waves in the hollow of His
                  hand."
               Humble and fervent were the prayers she offered that morning, and many were the
                  penitential tears she shed, as she plead with God for forgiveness and acceptance.
                  She left her retirement calm, but sad. All day she trembled if she heard a coming
                  footstep. In vain she repeated to herself, He that trusteth in God shall not fear
                  evil tidings; for her sinfulness seemed to deserve a heavy punishment.
               "Ah, my dear Henry," said Mrs. Harding, on the evening of her husband's return,
                  after they had joined their hearts and voices in thanksgiving, while Willie and
                  Charlie were sweetly sleeping with the roses of health upon their cheeks, "our
                  kind Heavenly Father has blessed me beyond my fears, beyond my deserts; but oh,
                  never again do I wish to spend a day without prayer.

               BAD COMPANY.
               SAPHRON, a wise teacher of his people, would even not permit his older sons and
                  daughters to associate with such whose moral character and daily conduct was not
                  pure and undefiled. "Father," said one day the mild Eulalia to him, when he would
                  not permit her to visit in company with her brother, the 
                     thoughtlesss
                     thoughtless
                   Lucinde; "Father, you must consider us very childish, because you think
                  this visit might harm us." But the father took silently a dead coal from the
                  fire-place and handed it to the daughter. "There is no fire in it, child," said
                  he, "take it." Eulalia did, and lo, the tender white hand was soiled,
                  and also the pure white garment which adorned her lovely figure. "One cannot
                     be careful enough," said Eulalia, rather vexed, "when touching coals."
                  "So it is," said the father. "You see, my child, that the coal, even when
                     not burning, will soil. So will the society of the
                     impure."

               CHILDREN'S BOOKS.
               WHO that is interested in the intellectual advancement of children, but has felt
                  deeply the want and the necessity of a pure literature, adapted particularly to
                  the wants of their early years?
               With the dawning of intellect, comes a mental craving, which, if not supplied with
                  proper aliment, will seek to supply itself from some source. In this age, when a
                  deluge of juvenile books is pouring from the press, there are always good books to
                  be obtained, but the difficulty lies in the mistaken opinion so prevalent, that in
                  providing books for very young children, it is necessary to procure something
                  comic, striking, or entirely different in character from what older children
                  require, and therefore are placed in their hands books glaring in gaudy colors,
                  hideous caricatures, and rhymes destitute of melody or meaning. Little children
                  not having learned to read, receive abiding impressions from the pictures at which
                  they gaze, and the rhymes and stories to which they listen.
               Does any one say a child of three years is incapable of distinguishing or
                  appreciating in these things? Let the experiment be made, of placing in the little
                  hands books containing engravings which have a meaning and use, whether wood or
                  steel, colored or plain, give the clue to their meaning, and the pains taken will
                  be rewarded by an intensity of curiosity and delight, not yet elicited by "Puss in
                  Boots," or any of her contemporaries.
               And this rule will apply equally to the poetry and stories which are read to this
                  class of little seekers after knowledge. Whoever compiled and gave to the public
                  the "Songs for the Little Ones at Home," has done an essential service to those
                  who would amuse and interest young children.
               A child whose taste, from these early periods, has been cultivated and gratified
                  by choice fiction, elevating poetry, interesting selections from
                  history and biography being added with his increasing years, will prefer and seek
                  these, above any of the trash contained in the "yellow covered literature" of
                  babyhood. The parent or teacher who will gather around him a group of children of
                  average age and capacity, and read well to them, genuine poetry of
                  musical cadence, or extracts from the lives of the great and good, or relate to
                  them interesting discoveries in science or art, will find as interested and
                  attentive an audience as ever listened to, or read "Mother Goose's Melodies," or
                  "Old Mother Hubbard."
               Carefully selected reading may often be made a medium of awakening a new and keen
                  interest in study, and creating a desire to know the contents of valuable books,
                  even after a wrong bias having been given in infancy, has made the task a
                  laborious one. That learning is infinitely more valuable which is sought, or at
                  least received willingly, than that which is forced into the mind by a cramming
                  process, after a perverted taste, or no taste at all, has made the search for
                  knowledge a dreaded or unwelcome task.
               It is to be hoped that more attention will be paid to this matter of cultivating
                  the taste, both by parents and teachers. The latter may urge that it is not within
                  their pale of duty, or that they cannot command the time to attend to it, but no
                  one having made a fair trial, will be willing to abandon it, and lose the
                  gratification afforded by the improvement of his youthful charge.

               LYING IN BED WITH THE HEAD HIGH.
               IT is often a question among people who are unacquainted with the anatomy and
                  physiology of man, whether lying with the head exalted, or even with the body, was
                  the most wholesome. Most, consulting their own ease on this point, argue in favor
                  of that which they prefer. Now, although many delight in bolstering up their
                  heads, and sleep soundly without injury, yet we declare it to be a dangerous
                  habit. The vessels through which the blood passes from the heart to the head are
                  always lessened in their cavities when the head is resting in bed higher than the
                  body.
               Therefore, in all diseases attended with fever, the head should be pretty near on
                  a level with the body; and people ought to accustom themselves to sleep thus to
                  avoid danger.

                  WE miss thee at home—we miss thee,
                  And oh, we wish thou wert here,
                  To linger with us 'round the fire-side,
                  And share in the evening's cheer;
                  To list to the voices of loved ones,
                  And the wish that thou never wouldst roam;
                  Oh, yes, 'twould be joy without measure,
                  Dearest brother, if thou wouldst come home.
               
               
                  We miss thee at home—we miss thee,
                  When the pleasures of evening are nigh,
                  When the sun hath retired in splendor,
                  To his home in the western sky;
                  And the moon is shining so brightly,
                  On the family circle at home;
                  Oh, then, we miss thee, we miss thee,
                  And sigh that thou still dost roam.
               
               
                  We miss thee at home—we miss thee,
                  When we all kneel down to pray,
                  And the tears start from our eye-lids,
                  As we wonder how long thou wilt stay;
                  If before the winter is over,
                  And the cold snow leaveth the earth,
                  Thou wilt not meet in our circle,
                  And cheer our desolate hearth.
               
               
                  But, oh! when the spring time cometh;
                  And the birds from a distant shore,
                  Then, may we not hope to fold thee,
                  At home, in our arms once more:
                  To kneel with us in the grave-yard,
                  O'er that dear little, sacred tomb,
                  And mingle thy tears, dearest brother,
                  With those thou hast left at home.
               
            
            
               A MOTHER'S INFLUENCE.
               JOHN B. GOUGH, in a recent speech in London, thus eloquently alludes to the
                  influence of his mother:
               I know myself the results of my own Sabbath school instruction, and I remember the
                  teachings of a praying mother. That mother taught me to pray in early life—gave me
                  the habit of praying; the teacher at the school strengthened it; they stored my
                  mind with passages of Scripture; and these things, I tell you, young men, we do
                  not entirely forget. They may be buried, they may be hid away for a time in some
                  obscure corner of the heart, but by and by, circumstances will show that we know
                  much more than we thought. After that mother's death, I went out into the world,
                  exposed to its manifold temptations: I fell. I acquired bad habits. For seven
                  years of my life I wandered over God's beautiful earth like an unblessed spirit
                  wandering over a barren desert, digging deep wells to quench my thirst, and
                  bringing up the dry hot sand. The livery of my master had been a garment of
                  burning poison.
               Bound with the fetters of evil habits, habits like an iron net encircling me in
                  its folds—fascinated with my bondage, and yet with a desire, O how fervent! to
                  stand where I once hoped to stand. Seven years of darkness, seven years of sin!
                  There I stood. "Ah," said one, "what is the effect of a mother's teaching, and of
                  a mother's prayers, of the Sunday school and of early good habits?" O! I stood
                  there, I remember it well, feeling my own weakness, and thinking that the way of
                  the transgressor is hard; knowing that the wages of sin is death; feeling in my
                  heart of hearts all the bitterness that arises from the consciousness of powers
                  wasted and opportunities lost; conscious that I had been chasing mere bubbles and
                  gained nothing. There I stood.
               That mother had passed to heaven, but her words came back to my mind. I
                  remembered, when one night in our garret the candle was failing, that she said,
                  "John, I am growing blind, and don't
                  mind it much. But you are young; it is hard for you. But never mind, John, where I
                  am going there is no night. There is no need of any candle there, the Lamb is the
                  light thereof." She has changed the dark, gloomy garret to bask in the sunshine of
                  her Saviour's smiles. But her influence was not lost. As I stood feeling my own
                  weakness, knowing that I could not resist temptation, it seemed as if the very
                  light she left as she passed, had spanned the dark gap of seven years of sin and
                  dissipation, and struck the heart and opened it. I felt utterly my own weakness;
                  and the passages of Scripture, that were stowed away in my mind, came as if
                  whispered again by the loving lips of that mother into my ear. This was the
                  influence of a mother's teaching.
            
            
               THE MANAGER IS DEAD.
               'THE Manager is dead" said a lad to me as I passed the Bowery theatre this
                  morning. The walls, the pillars, the arches, the log cabin, the old arm chairs of
                  Uncle Tom and Aunt Chloe, the bulletin boards, the handbills and the doorway to
                  the pit, were all deeply draped in black, for the Manager was dead.
               A theatre in mourning—a place made for mirth in mourning—oh, it was a sad sight.
                  Even the Bowery boys seemed all subdued because death had been there and called
                  for the manager.
               There have been frequent deaths there before, and sadder deaths, living deaths,
                  and yet no sign of woe appeared. The young have often entered those walls alive,
                  but when they came out the leprosy of death was upon them. A great school for the
                  youth was kept there, and the manager who is now dead was the principal of that
                  school. He had apt scholars and he taught them whatsoever he pleased, and never
                  had he a sleepy uninterested scholar; all were wide awake. Was that favorable
                  moment improved to teach noble and exalted things? Say, manager, how does it all
                  look from your present standing point? A man who can manage a theatre well has
                  gifts of no ordinary character. A man of mean talents could not do it. Were those
                  gifts and talents well improved for the best good of mankind and the
                  accomplishment of all life's great objects? How does thy work compare with the
                  work of the noiseless faithful Sabbath school teacher, who "approaches a home
                  where a child dwells, with blessings on his lips," and who "watches bland moments
                  to speak to that child 
                     samewhat
                     somewhat
                   of the delicious narrative of Christ's love." Said a good man to me
                  once, "Of all the places in the world I would love best to die in the Sabbath
                  school," but to go from a theatre to the grave is a mournful passage.
               There is no harmony between the theatre and the grave. Oh, then, let the theatre
                  remain in mourning. Forever let its walls be shrouded in black. It is a fit place
                  for mourning, not for mirth. Its Alpha and Omega is death. Then let the death
                  token hang as a beacon to every passing traveler.

               FAMILIAR THOUGHTS FROM A MOTHER.
               "TRAIN up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart
                  from it." Mothers, if we wish to train our children in the way they should go; we
                  must first learn that way ourselves; for it is impossible for us to teach our
                  children what we do not know. Mothers, read your Bibles prayerfully, and
                  carefully, and he who has promised to hear and answer prayer, will teach you that
                  way, Pray often; teach your little ones to pray; pray with and for them; it is
                  necessary that they should often be with you when you pray; they learn lessons
                  there, never to be forgotten; the knowledge that a mother prays for her children,
                  makes a great impression on their minds.
               We must teach them both by precept and example. If we fret and scowl among our
                  children, they will fret and scowl among themselves; if we are pleasant and
                  agreeable among our children, they will be so among themselves.
               Mother! when you look on that sweet little babe, and see and know that it is yours, your own sweet little babe;
                  what are your feelings? do you not feel as if he was given you for some wise
                  purpose? and that when you come to the bar of the Allwise Being, you will have to
                  render to Him an account of the manner in which you have trained that child? And
                  if he becomes wicked, you will cast reflections on yourself in this life. How
                  important it is, then, for mothers to study the will of God, search the
                  Scriptures, and pray daily. As your babe grows, and his mind develops, you
                  discover that he is capable of learning; and that his little mind will catch at
                  everything it comes in contact with; now is the time to teach him; he may forget
                  the words you tell him, but the impression remains. Never look on him with a
                  frown, to show a friend how quick he will cry; mothers know that a child perceives
                  the difference between a frown and a smile very young. Never give your child
                  anything but pleasant looks and fond caressings while he is very young; when he
                  grows old enough to commit disobedient acts designedly, then is the time to show
                  displeasure; but go about your duty in a very mild manner, take him in your arms,
                  and tell him of his fault kindly, and act towards him as God has commanded you. If
                  you study the Lord's will each day, I do believe you will know when and how to
                  correct your children. Children often commit disobedient acts, which amuse us; be
                  careful, mother, about laughing or speaking of them in their presence, for such
                  things have a great influence on their minds. Never deceive your children, for if
                  you do, they will most assuredly imitate you in that respect; but teach them to
                  abhor deceit in all its colors. Do not allow them to shake their fists, or strike
                  at any person or thing—this and many other little things, that appear smart in
                  children to some, are in my eyes very great sins, for they inculcate a principle
                  that will never be eradicated.
               I know there are many mothers who suffer their children to do a great many things
                  when they are small, that they do not intend they shall do when they grow older;
                  but remember, mother, it will be very hard to overcome a habit formed in
                  childhood. Be very careful in regard to the conduct of your children. Temptations
                  are numerous. Take advantage of every suitable occasion to teach them their duty.
                  I do not mean that you should be constantly stantly watching and talking to them
                  about their faults, that would render you and them unhappy.
               When you give a command, act in a manner that will give the child to understand
                  that he must obey you, of course. That is the only way to begin to teach little
                  ones obedience. If you train in this way with love, you will have an obedient
                  child; but if you give him to understand, that his will is your pleasure, you will
                  have a lost and ruined child. Just say, "now, my child, come; won't you do thus,
                  and so:" see how quick he hesitates!—Then speak to another, with "well, you will
                  wait on mother; won't you:" you have surely made another failure. Now, reader, how
                  do you view such commands as these, given from parents to children? Is it teaching
                  disobedience directly or indirectly? It may be indirect, but I would as soon tell
                  my children to disobey me, as to speak to them in that manner. Teach your child
                  obedience. Your commands should not be unreasonable; but if you can succeed in
                  building a wall of obedience around each of your children's hearts, you will be
                  apt to have a happy family—the older ones will rule the younger in a great
                  degree.

               THE END OF FEMALE EDUCATION.
               THE chief end to be proposed in cultivating the understanding of women is to
                  qualify them for the practical purposes of life. Their knowledge is not often,
                  like the learning of men, to be reproduced in some literary composition, and never
                  in any learned profession; but it is to come out in conduct; it is to be exhibited
                  in life and manners. A lady studies, not that she may qualify herself to become an
                  orator or a pleader; not that she may learn to debate, but to act. She is to read
                  the best books, not so much to enable her to talk of them, as to bring the
                  improvement which they furnish to the rectification of her principles, and the
                  formation of her habits. The great uses of study to a woman are to enable her to
                  regulate her own mind, and to be instrumental to the good of others.

               EMMA MOORE.
               BY "AXIE ALLEN."
               ANOTHER human sacrifice! I have mentally exclaimed, for years, as I have seen
                  professing Christians entering the bonds of matrimony with unbelievers. While I
                  have hesitated to speak on the subject, victim after victim has fallen; the
                  bright, the innocent and unsuspecting have rushed onward to the vortex of earthly
                  despair. A wish to rouse the young to ponder on the truth, "Be ye not unequally
                  yoked together with unbelievers," has prompted me to write the following story,
                  the facts of which have fallen under my own observation.
               Emma S. was my friend from childhood; we were inseparable playmates and classmates
                  in school; and in the dreamy days of girlhood we gazed on the stars together, or
                  loitered by murmuring brooks, plucking wild flowers, or listening to the woodland
                  songsters. We walked in company to the house of God, and both became personally
                  interested in the subject of religion, and united with the same church within
                  three months of each other. Emma's beauty was not of the brilliant, dazzling kind,
                  that ever recedes upon close acquaintance, but a calm, graceful dignity; a dark
                  eye and a fair brow, which indicated depth of thought, and a pure lofty spirit
                  were hers, and while you felt an awe in her presence, one word, or a smile from
                  her would assure you that she felt no superiority, but meekness and gentleness
                  were combinations of her nature.
               In saying that Emma was a Christian, more is meant than that she was
                  merely a professor of religion. A living faith produced a corresponding life of
                  activity in works of charity and love. But days of trial and temptation awaited
                  her. Arthur Moore, a young man, had lived in the village about two years; he had
                  watched her with increasing interest, until she became interested in the subject
                  of religion, when he looked upon her as lost to him for ever. Time, the great
                  modifier of all human passions sions, calmed the bitter opposition which he felt
                  at first, and a few months of close observation, told him she was more lovely than
                  ever, with religion's sacred charm thrown around her; though he discerned not,
                  that the very thing he esteemed a fault in her, (religion,) was the source of her
                  increased loveliness. Arthur knew no higher good than earth bestows; almost an
                  infidel, an avowed opposer and unbeliever in the great truths of revealed
                  religion. The ties which bound him to the gay world around him, were strong; he
                  was of fine person, high-spirited, free-hearted, and his powers of sociability and
                  wit were unequalled by his companions; making his presence very essential in the
                  convivial meetings of his associates, yet out of the jolly club of which he was a
                  member, he was known only as a fine young man, a little mirthful of course, but
                  active in his business.
               His eye had long rested on Emma, and he knew a good character was the only
                  passport to her favor, and no doubt this acted as a powerful restraint over him
                  when the eye of the public was on him. At length he sought Emma for his bride.
                  Long she hesitated;—"were he only a Christian," she would say to herself. Her
                  friends, who only looked on the outward appearance, urged her acceptance—called
                  her bigoted, over-much righteous, pointed to many church members as happy
                  examples. But through the deep recesses of her soul, like a guardian angel's
                  voice, came the words, "Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers; for
                  what fellowship hath light with darkness," &c. Arthur was in earnest, and
                  hesitated not to comply with any condition she proposed; one was he should
                  accompany her to church regularly; but in his heart he thought that once his, he
                  could easily eradicate all her religious whims.
               Emma yielded her principles to the opinion of others; a gray-haired man pronounced
                  the words the law requires; her own name became a nonentity, and Arthur Moore's
                  was written in its stead. I saw her a bride, and not whiter were her snowy robes
                  than herself, as she took upon her the vows of a wife. There was an indefinable
                  fear which rested on her spirit with a mountain's weight, that she might be drawn
                  down the whirlpool of pleasure by Arthur, and bring a reproach upon the cause she
                  esteemed above all others, and ruin upon her own eternal interests ests. Here at the marriage altar her heart seemed
                  divided. God claimed the "holiest of holies," she had given Him in public
                  consecration, herself—all she was—time, talents, body and spirit, yet now did she
                  publicly vow to honor, love, and obey her husband; one who acknowledged no God to
                  call him to account, and whose very nature was opposed to the government of God,
                  and in whose eyes judgment, mercy, and truth, were things lightly esteemed. She
                  was the subject of both, yet they were opposites. Strange that weak woman should
                  undertake the task, yet how often it is done! Arthur read not her heart at that
                  time, he was far too happy. There was an air of triumph about him, and he bore his
                  manly form with a proud, exulting step. He had sought and won a prize of which any
                  man might have been proud. But there was a single thought that intruded
                  itself—even at this time—one thought that dimmed the lustre of his
                     heart-gem—she was a Christian. Yet if one with a prophet's eye had
                  told him the future, he would have answered scornfully, as did Hazael of old, "Am
                  I a dog, to do these things."
               Emma commenced housekeeping in a pleasant location, surrounded by professed
                  friends. The gay and fashionable called on Arthur's account, and often did she
                  hear profane language, or a vulgar jest uttered by his admitted equals; though his
                  deportment in her presence had always been unexceptionable, and she hoped after
                  the usual congratulations were over, he would drop that kind of company. In this
                  she was mistaken. It was Arthur's unexpressed purpose to assimilate his wife's
                  views to his own; and he spared no pains or money, to initiate her into the
                  mysteries of pride and luxury, well knowing that they were deadly enemies to true
                  piety. Sunday rides were proposed, and company invited, purposely to do away the
                  influence which keeping the day holy might have upon them. Emma wished to treat
                  her husband's guests with politeness, and for a few times joined in their
                  merriment, but could not enjoy it. Her closet witnessed her sighs of repentance
                  for profaned Sabbaths, and resolutions of future amendment. For a while Arthur
                  visited the house of God half of the Sabbath, then ceased entirely, and was seldom
                  seen by her Christian friends when they called on her, giving her as his reason
                  that she would not join his company, and it was but fair he did not join hers. He
                  tried all the arts of which he was master, to seduce her from the path of
                  Christian duty, and used all his array of argument and ridicule, to shake her
                  faith. But she was firm; there was something more than a whim, a mere fancy, which
                  he had vainly thought he could overturn. He felt piqued that she had heard all his
                  arguments unmoved, and thought she must be wilful; principle he called obstinacy,
                  and as the hope of winning her back to the ways of sin grew less, so a harsh
                  dictatorial manner increased. As he threw off restraint, a coarse vulgarity
                  appeared as an element of his character, which she little expected, and when his
                  plans were the least thwarted, profanity was his usual resort. If Emma attended an
                  evening prayer meeting, she went alone, and returned but to meet a company of
                  Arthur's own selection at her fireside, or meet his sullen frown. She looked from
                  her own home to the home of him who bows morning and evening at the family altar,
                  a priest in his own house, a counsellor to his wife, a worthy pattern for his
                  children, and felt a destitution of spirit indescribable.
               It cannot be supposed that Emma was an unmoved observer of the imperfections of
                  character Arthur exhibited. She was a firm believer in woman's unbounded
                  influence, and felt that an important work was laid upon her, and attempted to
                  perform her mission with a hopeful, trusting heart. She felt that when she
                  committed her cause to her Heavenly Father, and prayed for guidance, she could not
                  fail. She argued with Arthur from the importance of an unspotted character, from
                  the uncertainty of life, and the consequences of time misspent, from his own
                  plighted vows, and her wounded feelings, from virtue's inherent reward, and the
                  sure misery of vice, and every other motive woman's fertile fancy could present:
                  she knelt beside him, and with his hands clasped in hers, pleaded with God for him
                  until she was invariably met with a harsh retort, or coarse jest. Then she ceased
                  pleading with him, as it seemed only to rouse the baser passions, but visited her
                  closet as a sure refuge, with a full belief in the efficacy of prayer.
               Emma became the mother of a son, and looked on her babe as a Christian mother only
                  can, not that he might become great among men was her only wish, but that he might
                  be good,—to be fitted for a blessed
                  eternity was more in her eyes than any earthly honor, and possessing the first she
                  felt no anxiety for the last. Not so did the father look at his child, he would
                  rather see him almost anything else than a "whining, praying Christian," and he
                  waited impatiently the time when his little tongue could master big words, and
                  already in fancy he saw him with cigar in mouth, sporting a cane with rowdy strut.
                  Emma knew the highest aim of her husband was but earthly, and felt a sickening
                  sensation when she thought of the time when the child should go forth under his
                  father's influence. He had seemed to her too pure for earth's polluting touch, and
                  her greatest fear was that he would lose his innocence by contact with the world.
                  Her fears were groundless—at two years of age he was removed beyond parental
                  anxiety, or the contaminating influences of earth. Emma mourned as one whom a
                  Father chasteneth, but murmured not, Arthur had doated passionately on the child,
                  and felt no submission; he bore his loss in sullen silence, or opened his mouth to
                  accuse the Almighty, if there was one, of injustice. Emma felt there was no
                  congeniality of mind or feeling between herself and husband, and that the position
                  they held to each other was only in name. She could not conscientiously resort
                  with him to amusements to drown grief, and he scorned the believer's consolation.
                  She felt that her husband was not what she expected he would have been, but had
                  never spoken the words to any person, and her most intimate friends, from motives
                  of delicacy, never attempted to gain the secret of her heart, though it was
                  evident to an observing eye, that their paths were daily diverging; their likes
                  and dislikes were for things of opposite character, and as each received no
                  sympathy from the other, they each acted independently.
               Emma spent most of her time at home, books and writing were her chief amusements,
                  her garden was a favorite resort, where were many beautiful, as well as useful
                  plants, cultivated by her own hand. Arthur's occupation was profitable, and had
                  been more than sufficient for a 
                     maintainance
                     maintenance
                  , but somehow it did not yield the income of former years. There were
                  whisperings that his evening games consumed the avails of the day, and the wine
                  cup was indispensable to his evening entertainment. Amidst declining clining
                  prospects, foreboding sorrows, and dying hopes, a daughter was added to the
                  family. With this accession, all the mother's interests were awakened anew, and
                  she hoped Arthur would rouse himself from the indifference he had shown since the
                  death of their boy. But her anguish can only be imagined when she heard him say,
                  "no! he would not love it, for if he did it would die, and what was a
                  daughter, it would not be anything to him," and the little helpless being was
                  treated as an unwelcome guest by her father. Here was a new trial which entered
                  the mother's heart like the barbed steel, and its legitimate fruit was a double
                  portion of a mother's love, and a double interest in all that concerned her
                  child.
               Sorrow concealed, year after year, meditated on day and night, eats on the human
                  system like canker. Thus it was with Emma. While Arthur suffered her to plead with
                  him, she hoped he might be won from his evil habits; when he refused to hear a
                  word from her, she fled to her closet, and trusted in the hearer and answerer of
                  prayer, until she saw him seemingly given over to every evil device. Then hope
                  grew faint, and faith was weak, and a gloom pervaded her whole soul. She seemed
                  enveloped in mental darkness which no ray of light could penetrate. She questioned
                  with herself if God could deny his promise of "Ask and ye shall receive." It
                  seemed to her if the one great thing for which she had lived, and labored and
                  prayed, were denied, her belief in Christianity would be shaken, and she should
                  yield to doubt and despair. But gradually light seemed to disperse the darkness,
                  and the question was revolved in her mind, "can the Almighty change? When he says
                  the disobedient shall be punished, can he bless? Can his word be broken to indulge
                  mortal caprice? 'Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers,' is his
                  command. How can one break the command and prosper? 'Whatsoever you sow that also
                  shall you reap.'" Now could she see clearly why her earthly hopes had all been
                  blasted—why she had never experienced the sympathy which constitutes the golden
                  chain of conjugal happiness. By the immutability of God, his justice and truth,
                  she saw nothing to hope for in future but adversity. Despair for Arthur settled in
                  her heart, and she ceased to plead for, or remonstrate with him, and seemed
                  waiting in daily expectation of some
                  great and unprecedented evil to befal them. To her his destiny appeared sealed for
                  time and eternity, yet she could not divest herself of anxiety for him. Brooding
                  over his case in hopeless despair, impaired her health; day by day the light faded
                  from her eye, and a smile seldom pervaded her features. Gradually a calm
                  submission to the will of God, pervaded her mind, and she resigned herself and
                  family to his mercy.
               She mourned not for herself, though she knew her symptoms were premonitory of
                  consumption; for herself all was well, she felt that God had forgiven her for her
                  great error, that she no longer had a controversy with him, but could rejoice in
                  Him as an unchangeable being. Her little daughter was now nearly five years old, a
                  lovely, gentle child. Her father's stubborn indifference had somewhat subsided,
                  but all her sympathies were with her mother, which, while it was a consolation to
                  her, made the prospect of a separation by death peculiarly trying. Emma's disease
                  proved consumption, yet it came so gradually that she was able to walk out until a
                  few days before her death. It had become necessary to have an attendant, and she
                  selected me, as I was accustomed to the service of a sick room. She gave her
                  little daughter, with Arthur's full consent, to a sister of hers, who was to
                  receive her at the mother's death, as her own child.
               It was the lovely month of June. Emma had been more cheerful than for many days,
                  the little girl had gathered a handful of flowers, fresh and beautiful, and placed
                  them in a vase, and twined some in the dark brown hair of her mother, as she sat
                  in her easy-chair. She had often done so when her mother was in health, but now
                  they contrasted strangely with her emaciated face and pale brow. She raised her
                  dark eye, which shone with the brightness of consumption's seal, and met her image
                  reflected in a mirror which hung opposite her. "O take them away, my child!" she
                  exclaimed, "take these bright ones away, and place the withered ones in my hair if
                  any, for they are like me."
               
                  
                     "For you pale bud, its petals dead,
                     A leaf from the cypress tree,
                     Those flowerets crushed, their beauty fled,
                     Are a fitter wreath for me.
                  
                  
                     "Sweet flowers of hope around me grew,
                     Alas! they're withered now—
                     Once brightly bloomed those flowerets too,
                     Then bind them on my brow."
                  
               
               "Kiss me, my daughter," said she, "then go down to aunt Sarah's and stay two
                  hours." The child obeyed, and we were left alone. Those two hours were improved by
                  Emma to unburthen her heart. They revealed much of woe and bitter regret, remorse
                  and repentings, while the eye had sparkled with apparent pleasure, and the lip had
                  been wreathed in smiles.
               "O," said she, "I could have loved Arthur with all the devotion of my nature, if
                  his character had been based on truth. I could not conscientiously mingle with his
                  company, or join their sports, and he found not the excitement at his own fireside
                  which his heart craved, and he sought it elsewhere. I have robbed him of a
                  congenial home, by consenting to be his; I have lost heaven's best gift to woman—a
                  husband's arm, heart, counsel and sympathy—by accepting one whom I knew had no
                  tastes in common with me. I have loaded myself with a guilty conscience, and at
                  times have felt that I was perhaps guilty for the course of conduct he has
                  pursued, since the first four years of our marriage. But all my earthly sorrow and
                  disappointment are nothing to the agony I have felt concerning his future
                  happiness or misery. For years I had a controversy with God. I felt that I could
                  not be denied the conversion of my husband: that God had promised if we 'ask we
                  shall receive.' I searched the Scriptures to know wherein I failed, that God could
                  not answer my prayer, and I found it was only the obedient, that
                  enjoyed His favor. That God could not, consistent with his attributes, prosper
                  those who went contrary to his commands. I had presumed to love one who was
                  opposed to Him; my chosen friend was His enemy, I was condemned by
                  His word on almost every page. I felt that I must endure the chastisement which my
                  Heavenly Father saw fit to lay upon me, and could only say 'I deserve it all—even
                  to the eternal separation from my husband, the father of my children.' If I had
                  been the only one guilty of this peculiar offence, I could have died without
                  opening my mouth, except to confess to Him against whom I have sinned. But there
                  are many every year doing as I have
                  done, and if there is one thing above all others I would say to young professing
                  Christians, it is this, 'Be ye not unequally yoked together with
                  unbelievers.'"
               Two days after this Emma ceased to breathe, and I trust sleeps in Jesus. There was
                  no permanent change in Arthur while life lasted. Within three years after the
                  death of his wife, he too was consigned to the tomb, there to await the
                  "resurrection of the just and unjust."
            
            
               "HOPE."
               
                  E'EN at the grave of those we love
                  Hope still would cheer us on;
                  She points beyond, and bids us see,
                  The Resurrection morn.
                  When those dear cherished forms redeemed,
                  The grave's dominion o'er,
                  Though sown in weakness, shall be raised
                  In glory and in power.
               
               
                  And then to brighter scenes she points,
                  To hearts no longer riven;
                  A meeting with our loved and lost,
                  In yonder peaceful Heaven!
                  No painful partings there to dread;
                  No storms our joys to shiver;
                  No lonely pathway there to tread;
                  No death, loved ones to sever!
               
               
                  Blessed Hope! Lend now thy brilliant rays
                  To light our darkened way,
                  And when the "joys of sense" are gone,
                  Be thou our guide and stay!
                  Be thou our Anchor to the soul,
                  When here by tempests driven:
                  In death still hover near our side,
                  And whisper, then, of Heaven!
               
            
            
               
                  
               
               GATHERING FLOWERS
               YES, gather the flowers of June, dear children—seek the brightest and the
                  sweetest. What if you do find thorns with the eglantine? Secure the flower—its
                  delicate beauty and odor will more than make amends for the sting. It is said that
                  the season of flowers is short—that the cold blasts of autumn, and the frosts of
                  winter, blight and destroy them. But no, you may gather flowers in autumn, and
                  even cold winter; but they must be cultivated, nourished,
                  sheltered.
               Take the lesson to your hearts, and remember that flowers may be cultivated and
                  made to bloom all along life's pathway, even into the winter of age, and shed
                  their fragrance over the tomb. Cultivate the flowers of affection, of kindness, of
                  peace, of love, and if the thorns of care, and envy, and sorrow will grow, nurse
                  into being, between them, the roses, the jessamines and the lilies, that their
                  beauty may charm and their odor soothe you; and they will whisper to your troubled
                  spirit of His care, who arrays them and clothes them in such delicate hues, and of
                  that clime where 
                     "Fadeless flowers immortal bloom."

               EVELINE.
               BY W. G. BROWN.
               
                  GOLDEN haired and starry eyed,
                  Was a little sister mine;
                  Beauteous as a summer morn;
                  And all loved my Eveline.
               
               
                  Ever on her cheek a smile,
                  Mingled with her blushes sweet,
                  As the sun and silver clouds,
                  In an April morning meet.
               
               
                  Ever flying from her mates,
                  Shy as is the bounding fawn,
                  When, in vain, it tries to fly
                  Its own shadow on the lawn.
               
               
                  Golden haired and starry eyed
                  Was that little sister mine,
                  With a soul so beautiful
                  Angels loved my Eveline.
               
               
                  So when evening's shadows fell
                  On a forest, dark and deep,
                  White wings on a bed of leaves
                  Lulled that sister dear asleep.
               
               
                  All night long beneath the stars,
                  Watched that child, the angels nigh;
                  Human footsteps searched in vain,
                  Till the morning's sun was high.
               
               
                  Then she sickened, day by day,
                  Sadder grew her merry eye,
                  And the rose-leaf on her cheek
                  Told too true that she must die!
               
               
                  Mournful sighed the Autumn winds
                  Round the cottage where she lay,
                  And the sun was going down,
                  When they sung her soul away!
               
               
                  Ever since my heart hath lain
                  By a little grave of flowers;
                  And I only pray to go
                  Up with her to angel-bowers.
               
            
            
               A PAGE FROM A TEACHER'S EXPERIENCE.
               WHO among all the various classes in the community, has a deeper personal interest
                  in the home training of childhood than the teacher—the female teacher, as from the
                  nursery, the next step for the child is into her more numerous and
                  multifarious family; and she is to take up the teaching and disciplining, which
                  was commenced at home, and begin to build in her own way on the foundation of
                  another.
               The little one committed to her care may be an entire stranger to her; she knows
                  nothing of his disposition, or the management he has heretofore received. She only
                  knows that parents have entrusted to her influence and instruction that precious
                  child in whom are centred their fondest hopes, and brightest expectations for the
                  future of this life; and that God, in the arrangements of Providence has given her
                  the responsibility of a large share in the influence which will mould the
                  character of this immortal being, for good or ill during the endless ages of
                  another life. She observes the intelligent countenance, and independent bearing of
                  the boy, and says to herself, this is a duty of no trifling account, and how very,
                  very much depends on the work already done,—the very first inclining of the twig!
                  What can I do with such a boy, if he has been taught to know nothing of
                  subordination? A few weeks, it may be a few days, will enable her to decide,
                  whether she is to follow out a work well begun, and to cooperate operate with parents in training the child in the
                  way he should go; or, whether she must give him all the discipline he ever has,
                  and find her efforts constantly thwarted, and rendered ineffectual by the
                  indulgence and neglect of parents at home.
               All agree that the school must be well governed. Order and quietness must be
                  preserved, and at the same time uniform progress be made in the studies. The best
                  good of all must be sought, and no one be allowed to infringe on the rights of
                  others, or to set an example which they may not safely follow. Is this the place
                  where the spoiled and petted child can claim his indulgences? Can his selfish
                  domineering spirit be allowed to reign here? This must not be. And what a task is
                  thrown upon the teacher who has such a child to govern!
               To illustrate this subject, we will here introduce two instances of discipline in
                  school which occurred a few days since.
               Frederic D., and Augustus N., are small boys, each perhaps in his eighth year. The
                  former has always been the pet of the household, and his own will and choice he
                  has found to be the controlling power in the circle in which he has moved before
                  attending school. The latter is the youngest darling of a widowed mother, but he
                  is blessed with a mother who feels the importance of eradicating in childhood the
                  baneful seeds of selfishness, and training the will to submit to wholesome
                  discipline. One day a scholar complained to the teacher that Frederic had given
                  him a severe blow with his thick boot. When called to an account F. did not deny
                  the fact, but made it a very light matter, a thing which he had a right to do if
                  he chose. The teacher saw the action, and observed the manner and spirit which
                  accompanied it. She had before noticed his cruel, reckless bearing toward his
                  companions, and felt that it must be restrained.
               After expostulating with the boy to no purpose, she concluded he must be punished.
                  To this he had been wholly unaccustomed, and he became greatly incensed, and used
                  the most insolent language. Then, as soon as he was allowed to go to his desk, he
                  began to pack up his books, saying, "I'll never come to this school another day.
                  You see if I do."
               "I cannot have you take your books now," said the teacher. "I do not allow
                  scholars to leave in such a way as this. Sit down and talk with me. Did you not
                  kick George?"
               "Yes; that was nothing."
               "I call it something, and so does George; and his father and mother will call it
                  something. You hurt George, but if you had not hurt him at all, you treated him as
                  I cannot have one scholar treat another. It is my duty to see that one scholar
                  does not injure another. Why, if one man abuses another he is taken
                  up. Did you not tell me the other day that you saw a police officer taking a man
                  along to put him in prison, because he had struck another man?"
               "He was drunk?"
               "But he would have been taken up if he had struck a man when he was not drunk. The
                  people in the state and city are under the control of laws which were made for the
                  good of all. My scholars are under the control of laws, and you have broken one of
                  those laws, just as that man had broken one of the laws of the State."
               "I don't care anything about laws."
               "I perceive that, and I am very sorry; for you must always be under laws, and if
                  you do not submit to them you will be very unhappy yourself, and make others
                  unhappy. All good laws in a school are taken from God's laws, and all men, and
                  women, and children, must obey his laws or they will be forever miserable."
               These remarks seemed to make very little impression on the child. He was not
                  subdued. That will was too strong to yield to reason or correction. It had not
                  been subjected to discipline when it first began to develop, and even in childhood
                  it had become violent and stubborn. The teacher felt that her efforts had been
                  nearly useless.
               A few days after this, Augustus N., while in the yard at recess, was accused of
                  the same cruel act, and his case was more aggravated because
                  repeated. The teacher was distressed by the intelligence, and brought by so many,
                  and such witnesses that she could not doubt its correctness. It was the first
                  offence of the kind of which A. had been guilty. She knew he had a strong will,
                  and she was afraid he would not readily acknowledge his fault; if not, he must be
                  corrected; and this she dreaded exceedingly ingly. But in the few moments which she had for
                  reflection, the consoling thought came to her mind, he is accustomed to discipline
                  at home.
               She said to him, "Augustus, you got very much excited just now, and did very
                  wrong. You abused your playmates. I cannot allow that. It is my duty to see that
                  my scholars treat each other well. This is one of the laws of the school. Do you
                  think it 
                     is is
                     is
                   right to have laws in school?"
               "Yes, ma'am."
               "But you have broken the laws."
               "I am sorry," and as he said this his eyes filled with tears, and his chin began
                  to quiver. The teacher was encouraged to talk further with him. He did not seem
                  angry with the scholars who had informed against him, nor with the teacher who
                  called him to an account. His whole 
                     apperance
                     appearance
                   betokened penitence, and a willingness to submit to discipline. Said the
                  teacher, "is there anything you can do to prove to your schoolmates that you are
                  sorry you hurt them?"
               "I don't know," said he.
               "You can ask them to forgive you. Are you willing to do this?"
               "Yes, ma'am."
               "Well, if you are willing to ask forgiveness, I hope you will not do such a thing
                  again."
               "I don't think I shall."
               "Then I shall not have to punish you."
               This conversation took place in an ante-room, and the teacher now opened the
                  school-room door, and A. walked in, and with a sober and meek countenance went to
                  the seats of three different schoolmates, each of whom in the excitement of
                  violent play he had injured, and asked their forgiveness. All promptly forgave
                  him, and the teacher proceeded in the work of instruction, rejoicing that in the
                  midst of her arduous duties, while offences must come, some of her pupils were so
                  disciplined that it was comparatively easy to adjust and settle them. How
                  different her feelings in the other case! Are not these strong contrasts to be met
                  with in every community of adults, as well as children, and may they not generally
                  be traced to the same cause—the differences in early discipline?
            
            
               DAILY DUTIES.
               BY M. F. A.
               DAILY duties are too often regarded in a very erroneous point of view. We refer to
                  those home duties and domestic cares which fill up a large part of the every-day
                  life of most of the mothers of our land. These duties are, by too many, considered
                  as the clogs, the hindrances which impede them from making advances in the divine
                  life, whereas they are, in truth, the appointed steps in which our Heavenly Father
                  designs us to tread, in order to advance in that life; they form the path which,
                  if pursued in humility, faith, and love, will conduct us onward and upward to the
                  City of God.
               The great sacrifice—the overwhelming trial—meets us at rare and infrequent
                  intervals. These form not the true tests of character. They prove, often, it is
                  true, the turning point in our destiny. God is pleased to use such as instruments
                  for weaning the heart from the world, and bringing it to a decision to yield to
                  His gracious sway. But after the decision has been made, the world given up, then
                  comes the regular chain of daily duties, link joined in link, leading us onward in
                  a course of holy living, useful to man and well pleasing to God. Humble and
                  obscure these duties may be, but they escape not the scrutiny of the all-seeing
                  Eye; and the manner and the spirit in which they are performed are not beneath the
                  notice of Him whom we serve. If we would remember this, and learn to look on every
                  circumstance in our daily life as marked out for us by one who knows exactly the
                  kind of discipline which we need, we could more easily subdue every restless
                  feeling, and go forward to the discharge of duty with a quiet mind and a contented
                  spirit. Instead of longing to do some great thing we should feel that 
                     
                        "The trivial round, the common task,
                        Would furnish all we ought to ask;
                        Room to deny ourselves; a road
                        To bring us, daily, nearer God."
                     
                  
               
               
               And freely interspersed with these daily duties are many petty trials and cares,
                  which too often depress our spirits, and sadden our hearts. This ought not to be,
                  for these also form part of the wise and gracious discipline to which we are
                  subjected; and our chief object should be to make the right improvement of them.
                  Like the patient oft-repeated filings wherewith the lapidary polishes the diamond,
                  these trials will thus serve to polish and smooth away all the angles and
                  asperities which too often disfigure our Christian character. Let us then, instead
                  of allowing such cares and trials to fret and vex us, use them for the high
                  purpose for which they were designed—our advancement and improvement—and accustom
                  ourselves to regard our daily duties as necessary steps in our heavenward course.
                  If we have felt weary and depressed, this view would raise our sinking spirits,
                  and cause our life to wear a new aspect. A celestial radiance would illumine many
                  a pathway, which now looks gloomy and cheerless.
               
                  
                     "If, on our daily course, our mind
                     Be set to hallow all we find,
                     Some softening gleam of love and prayer
                     Shall dawn on every cross and care."
                  
               
            
            
               "RELIGION is the final centre of repose; the goal to which all things tend, apart
                  from which man is a shadow, his very existence a riddle, and stupendous scenes of
                  nature which surround him as unmeaning as the leaves of the sibyl scattered in the
                  wind."
               WE make the world, and the world makes us. We dress the world in the drapery of
                  our own thoughts and feelings, and then the light from the world comes back to us,
                  transmitted and colored through that drapery, so that, after a while, the world is
                  only a reflection of ourselves.
            
            
               MY UNCLE'S BLESSING.
               IT is now more than twenty-two years since I received it, and it is as fresh in my
                  memory as a thing of yesterday. I shall never forget it, and by the grace of God
                  shall never cease to be thankful to Him for it. May I never prove unworthy of it,
                  and may I never lose the hallowed and hallowing influence of that sweet and
                  precious benediction. May it ever remain and abide upon my soul as the dew of God,
                  and as the breath of the Almighty. It was the blessing of a good man; one who had
                  long walked with God and lived by faith on his Son Jesus Christ.
               My uncle had been led to confess Christ as his Saviour in his youth, and was
                  baptized into one of the oldest and most flourishing churches in the principality
                  of Wales. Believing that God called him to the ministry of his word, he had, after
                  being licensed by the church, pursued his studies preparatory to his entering more
                  fully on the work, first under the Rev. Micah Thomas, at Abergavenny, and
                  subsequently under the excellent and sainted Dr. Ryland, at Bristol. His mind was
                  richly stored with reminiscences of those good men, and many others of the
                  religious worthies of Britain. He knew and had heard that giant among the great
                  theologians of the Christian world, Andrew Fuller, and I have heard him say that
                  in hearing him preach, nothing would strike you more forcibly than the wonder you
                  had not previously observed in the text everything he brought out of it, all was
                  so simple and natural, as the unfolding of the real meaning and wealth of the
                  passage.
               My uncle's first settlement in the ministry was in the beautiful town of C—, on
                  the picturesque and romantic Wye. Here he succeeded in gathering a small church
                  and in erecting a very neat and substantial "chapel." For sixteen years he
                  preached the gospel and administered its ordinances in this place, and chiefly at
                  his own charges. In his congregation were two worthy ladies, twin sisters, who
                  were engaged in mercantile business. Both of these were given to him as seals of
                  his ministry, and became truly pious
                  and useful members of his church. Both became in time the worthy companions of
                  ministers; one giving her heart and hand to the pastor, and the other to a
                  minister of the Independent denomination. Thus the pastor became a merchant or
                  "shopkeeper," and without neglecting his pulpit duties, conducted the business for
                  several years successfully. My uncle had no children, while one of his sisters, my
                  very dear good mother, who, though his junior, had married much earlier, was
                  plentifully blessed with the "poor man's riches." I was her first-born, and when
                  about eleven was taken by my uncle to be a "shop-boy." I was a wild mountain boy,
                  and with my dog and staff had been accustomed to something of a shepherd's life.
                  The confinement of the store, and the rigid government of my uncle, rested like a
                  galling yoke upon my neck, and though he did much to have me improve my mind and
                  manners, in about three years I was truly glad to cast off this terrible yoke.
                  Like many other boys, I failed to properly appreciate what was done for my best
                  good. Restive and unhappy as I was at times under my excellent uncle and aunt's
                  government, I received many lessons of instruction, and witnessed much of what was
                  pure and consistent in their Christian lives, that have been of great use to me
                  since, and for which I can never be sufficiently thankful to the Father of
                  mercies. The Sabbath was most carefully and scrupulously observed, and the worship
                  of God around the family altar never neglected, either morning or evening. I left
                  this place of blessing, however, with such feelings of hostility to one of my best
                  earthly friends, as to care but little whether I ever saw him again.
               Time passed on, and I was apprenticed in a large store or "shop," dealing in
                  provisions, dry goods, &c., connected with an iron works on my native hills.
                  After being wild and thoughtless enough, in my third year at this place, a
                  gracious and long suffering God led me to think on my ways, and to feel the
                  importance of turning my feet to his testimonies. Previous to this I had not
                  written a line to my uncle—my real benefactor. An ungrateful and disobedient boy I
                  had been; but now, as my heart began to relent under the mellowing and blessed
                  influence of the Holy Spirit, it at once turned to the too much forgotten and
                  hated friend of my boyhood. I wrote to him, and many were the heartfelt
                  confessions my letters contained. From that day to this, that hated
                  uncle has been of all earthly friends one of those I loved the best and 
                     estemeed
                     esteemed
                   the highest. Rich and varied has been the freight of counsel and
                  instruction his letters have borne to his "dear boy." My reader, do you know the
                  worth of a wise counsellor? Have you good sense enough to really value a true
                  friend, who will kindly, but faithfully point out your faults, and endeavor to
                  help you in correcting them? Let me tell you that such a friend is worth more than
                  gold, and if you have no such friend, secure one at once, and see you never cast
                  him or her off. "Open rebuke is better than secret love. Faithful are the wounds
                  of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful."
               Four years after I made a Christian profession, the providence of God seemed to
                  direct my steps to this good land of the noble free. After determining that it was
                  my duty to make this my adopted country, I went to take my leave of a numerous
                  circle of friends and relatives, whom I very dearly loved, and among others my
                  uncle and aunt. They had retired from business, and were at that time residing in
                  a delightful part of the country with the widowed twin-sister. My stay was short.
                  I arrived in the afternoon of one day, and left early on the morning of the next.
                  Many good things did I hear during that short stay, and deeply affecting was the
                  scene I there witnessed. After breakfast, my uncle, as usual, brought forward that
                  best treasure of the individual and of the family, the precious Bible. The chapter
                  he selected was highly appropriate, the third of Proverbs. He commenced the
                  reading as usual, but after reading a few verses, there was quite a change in his
                  utterance, and soon it became entirely choked. His bosom heaved and swelled, and
                  his eyes filled with tears. My good aunt sat near, and coming to his relief, took
                  the blessed volume from his hands. She had not proceeded far in the reading before
                  she also had to make a full surrender of herself to the overpowering feelings of a
                  kind and loving heart. She handed the book to her good sister, who finished the
                  reading. Then we all knelt before God—the God of our fathers—and from a full,
                  believing heart, my ever dear uncle led us to the mercy seat, and commended me in
                  a special manner to his gracious care and blessing. He, the God of all grace, who
                  has led me all the way thus far, and
                  whose goodness and mercy have followed me all the days of my life, alone knows how
                  much I am indebted to that prayer.
               Christian reader, do you know what it is to hate and despise and loathe yourself,
                  because under deeply affecting circumstances you could not feel nor shed a tear.
                  When your heart was like a stone, and your eyes like a dried spring? Have you ever
                  felt that you would give almost anything in the world if you could only
                     feel? Yes, feel as you were conscious you ought to feel? If you have,
                  then you have some idea how I felt that morning. I was out of all conceit with
                  myself. It did seem to me that my heart had become perfectly hardened, and utterly
                  destitute of everything holding any affinity to a tender emotion. So it was. I was
                  a wonder to myself, and I assure you in no very enviable light.
               Immediately after this morning service, I took leave of my aunt, her sister and
                  the other members of the family—and without a tear—worse than all, without an
                  emotion, except the one of indignation I felt at myself for being so much a stoic.
                  I had some distance to walk that day, and started on my journey across the country
                  by foot-paths. My uncle accompanied me for two or three miles, and continued to
                  give me good instruction and wise counsel. At last the time came for us to bid the
                  last adieu. It was in a pleasant little meadow, quite retired among trees, and
                  situated in a beautiful valley not very far from the river Usk. My uncle was much
                  taller than myself. We halted. He looked down into the windows of my soul, and I
                  looked up into his. There were buckets of water in them. His were emptied upon me,
                  and mine upon the meadow. He took my hand—he held it long—he fell on my neck and
                  kissed me, and there and then he blessed me. With quivering lip he said, "The Lord
                  bless thee, my dear boy." "Yr Argleoydd a'th fendithio fy maehgen anwyl." I felt
                  it in my inmost soul. I feel it now. That was the last time I looked upon his
                  manly form, and felt his warm embrace, and the pent up waters of my poor strange
                  heart burst forth in streams. Reader, have you ever felt in such a melting mood,
                  as if it would be a kind of melancholy pleasure to weep and sob, and melt away out
                  of this into another life? It was thus I felt in parting with one whom I have
                  longed a thousand times since to see, and whose blessing from God has ever
                  followed me to the present moment, though the mighty deep has for twenty-two years
                  rolled between us. We may not meet here. God only knows. But there is a better
                  land than even this goodly heritage, where the children of God shall meet, and no
                  more taste the bitterness of parting. In that land may we meet. In that land I
                  trust we shall meet, to renew a sweet and happy personal intercourse of love, and
                  to east our crowns at his feet, who loved us and washed us from all our sins in
                  his own blood.
               
                  I. B.
               
            
            
               TWO-FOLD AFFLICTION.
               I WAS called, not long since, to participate in one of the most solemn and
                  affecting scenes it has ever been my lot to witness. It was two corpses in one
                  house, one a child of six years, the other of but two summers. I had been with the
                  mother in her period of intense suffering, as she watched over them, both
                  trembling upon the confines of the tomb, and I looked with interest, as I do ever
                  upon the exhibitions of human feeling, at the unutterable sympathies which were
                  aroused in her heart, first for one, and then the other, as fear for either
                  predominated. The one was her first-born, who had opened in her heart that
                  fountain of feeling, whose waters were "never more to rest." Until his birth she
                  knew not that joy which a mother's heart alone can comprehend, of holding in her
                  arms a darling all her own. Alas, for our suffering hearts, that we should fondly
                  deem them so, and then see them suddenly snatched from our embrace by the
                  resistless hand of death. His name endeared him to her, the name of the husband
                  almost adored, a name given in the early years of their companionship, when the
                  halo of youth hung around their intercourse, and no cloud of sorrow had cast its
                  shadow over their love. Beside this he was their only son. What
                  depths of tenderness does this word convey!
               Then for the other one, there were sufficient reasons why she should be equally dear; she was the youngest, the
                  pet, and pride, and plaything of the whole house, and she had ever been a feeble
                  infant. They had watched over her with solicitude from the hour of her birth, and
                  to lose her would be like severing her heart strings. It is ever thus with our
                  poor fallen natures. We are so prone to think we could have borne trouble better
                  in some other shape than the one in which it comes to us. The home of the bereaved
                  parents was in a country village, where there was no undertaker to come with
                  softly tread and length of face assumed from habit, not produced by sympathy; but
                  kind friends stepped forward to perform the last sad offices of affection, to
                  prepare their little bodies for the grave, friends who had stood round the bed of
                  the dying ones, and who had enticed the mother away ere the second one breathed
                  its last, and carried her to the home of her sister, fearing the shock would be
                  too much for her already enfeebled and exhausted frame.
               They were shrouded and coffined with care, and looked as calm and sweet in their
                  last repose as if they had never known aught of suffering. The prayer was said by
                  the side of their remains, and then we left the desolated home, to deposit them in
                  the family burial ground, six miles off, where some of their kindred slept.
               The sun was just shedding his last rays upon the earth, as we stood around the
                  open grave, where the bodies of the dead had been deposited, and as the father
                  stood there with quivering lip and tearful, earnest gaze, looking for the last
                  time upon the coffins which contained his children, the voice of the good old man
                  of God broke forth in the comforting and elevating language of the Saviour, "I am
                  the resurrection and the life, he that believeth in me, though he were dead yet
                  shall he live, and he that liveth and believeth shall never die."
               Oh, of what priceless worth are the consolations of the Bible to us at a time like
                  this, how does the heart of the Christian cling to them and feed on them in the
                  hour of trial.
               The master whom we serve causes his face to shine on us more graciously then, and
                  his love proves to us an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast. How
                  comforting to feel, as we lay away our darlings in the tomb with its dismal
                  surroundings, that we put them there in the sure and certain hope of a glorious
                  resurrection, that even now their higher, better natures are not confined in the
                  clay we look upon: 
                     
                        "Their faces may be hid
                        Under the coffin lid;
                        Closed be their eyes, and cold their foreheads fair,
                        Our hands that marble feel,
                        O'er it in prayer we kneel,
                        Yet our hearts whisper that they are not there."

               THE LAST OF THREE.
               
                  THERE were three! a lovely trio;
                  One, a fair and gentle girl,
                  With her hair so bright and golden,
                  All her snowy neck enfolding;
                  Twined in many a wavy curl.
               
               
                  With her ways so sweet and graceful,
                  With her deep and loving heart,—
                  With her merry gush of laughter,
                  And her sweet voice trilling after,—
                  Could we think she would depart?
               
               
                  Yet she faded, drooped, and perished,
                  In the early, chilly spring,
                  While the dark gray clouds were scudding,—
                  Ere a single leaf was budding,—
                  Ere the birds began to sing.
               
               
                  Where the steady rain is dripping,
                  Dripping from the leaden skies,
                  With the cold sods arched above her,—
                  Though so dearly we did love her,—
                  There our faded blossom lies.
               
               
                  Then her noble, bright-eyed brother,
                  In the home that was bereft,
                  When the wintry winds were sweeping,
                  Lay in marble stillness, sleeping!
                  Now there's only Willie left!
               
               
               
                  When the golden days of summer
                  Light the earth with beauty rare,
                  Willow boughs are o'er them bending,—
                  Bird-notes are to heaven ascending,—
                  Flowers are nodding o'er them there.
               
               
                  But, not there, the beauteous spirits
                  That we loved and cherished here!
                  They have passed to Jesus' keeping,
                  Where no sorrow comes, nor weeping,
                  Where are known no sin or fear.
               
               
                  So there's one yet dwelling with us,—
                  And a gentle boy is he;
                  We would seek for him the blessing
                  Of each heart's warm love-caressing,
                  For he is the last of three!
                  
               
               
                  And we pray the Heavenly Father,
                  Watching little children o'er,—
                  That he may be kept pure-hearted,
                  Till he joins the dear departed,
                  Where is joy forevermore.

               PLEASURE.
               BLESSED be the hand that prepares a pleasure for a child! for there is no saying
                  when it may again bloom forth. Does not almost everybody remember some
                  kind-hearted man who showed him a kindness in the quiet days of his childhood? The
                  writer of this remembers himself at this moment a barefooted lad, standing at the
                  wooden fence of a poor little garden in his native village. With longing eyes he
                  gazed on the flowers which were blooming there quietly in the brightness of a
                  Sunday morning. The possessor came into his garden to gather flowers to stick in
                  his coat when he went to church. He saw the boy, and breaking off the most
                  beautiful of his carnations, gave it to him. Neither the giver nor the receiver
                  spoke a word, and with bounding steps the boy ran home; and now here, at a vast
                  distance from home, after so many years, the feeling of gratitude which agitated
                  the breast of the boy, expresses itself on paper. The carnation has long since
                  withered, but now it blooms fresh.

               CHANGES OF FORTUNE.
               MY grandmother has seen more than seventy summers, and in the course of her long
                  and eventful life, has learned many useful lessons, some of which she tries, at
                  times, to teach her grandchildren. I have often been gratified and instructed by
                  her stories from real life, but never more than with one which I should like to
                  relate for the young readers of "Sunshine and Shadow." I was about setting out on
                  a long journey, and we felt that this parting might be our last. I took a seat by
                  her side, for I saw, by her looks, that she had something to tell me.
               "When I was very young," she began, "my father lived in the country, not many
                  miles from the city of B. Our nearest neighbor was a sea-captain, who had retired
                  from business, and who was able to furnish for his family every luxury that money
                  could obtain. He had two daughters who went to the same school with my sister and
                  myself. They were lovely girls, almost their father's idols. For them he spared no
                  expense, and thought no sacrifice which he could make too great, if it would give
                  them a moment's gratification. My father was always kind, and I knew that he loved
                  his children with the same fond affection that Capt. F. felt for his daughters.
                  But one thing about them troubled me exceedingly; they dressed so
                     beautifully. I used to think, in my childish folly, that, if I could do
                  as I pleased, and dress like my more favored neighbors, I should be perfectly
                  happy.
               "Time passed on. My father's whole family had found homes in the city, and, for
                  more than fifty years, we knew nothing more of Capt. F. and his beautiful
                  daughters. But, on one of the coldest mornings in Dec., 1852, a friend of mine was
                  sent in behalf of some benevolent institution, to visit several poor families who
                  were likely to need assistance during the cold weather. In all her visits her
                  sympathies were aroused, but especially in the case of one old lady, whose manners
                  and conversation indicated that she had seen better days, that she was unused to a
                  life of toil. My friend induced my sister to go with her to see the old lady, and, on listening to her tale of
                  sorrow, what was their astonishment to find in the object of their pity, Capt.
                  F.'s oldest daughter! Her story was brief; her husband had died in the prime of
                  life, her children had been one by one taken away, and she was left alone, a
                  widow, poor and childless. Gladly we hastened to her relief, thankful that it was
                  in our power to contribute in any degree towards making her comfortable in the
                  evening of her life. We were rejoiced to find that, though she had none of this
                  world's goods, she had a treasure laid up in heaven. She had learned to trust in
                  the God of the widow, and He did not now in her old age forsake her. We were
                  permitted to watch by her side in her last sickness, and to witness the comfort
                  she found in those long days and nights of pain, from Him who was a man of
                  sorrows, and who 'can be touched with a feeling of our infirmities.'"
               "And what," I asked, "became of the younger sister?"
               "Her husband left our shores as captain of a vessel bound for the East Indies, and
                  was never heard from afterwards. Of seven children, three have been spared to her,
                  all of whom are ready to administer to her wants in her declining years. With her
                  youngest daughter she has found a home in the far west, but for twenty years she
                  has been entirely blind. She is, however, looking forward eagerly to the time when
                  her spirit, released from its earthly prison-house, shall take its flight to that
                  better land, where all eyes shall be opened, and where she may join in singing
                  ceaseless praises to the Lamb who has, she trusts, washed her in His own precious
                  blood, and made her 'meet for the inheritance of the saints in light.'"
               The story of my aged friend was finished, but I thought that it would bear a
                  repetition, and that, perhaps, others might learn from it a lesson of trust in
                  God. If any of you, my young friends, are ever tempted to repine at what an
                  all-wise Providence has seen fit to provide for you, think of my grandmother and
                  her rich neighbors. When she was envying them, and breaking the tenth commandment,
                  she knew not what was best for her. Could she have seen the end from the
                  beginning, think you she would have sought to change places with them? And so it
                  will ever be. Often, when we are earnestly wishing for what is not within our
                  reach, our kind Heavenly Father is preparing for us better things than we had
                  asked; while, if our vain wishes were to be gratified, they would bring in their
                  train nought but trouble and sorrow. Seek then at all times, and in whatsoever
                  state you are, "therewith to be content;" assured that He who provides for the
                  sparrow a home, and clothes the lily of the field in beauty, will much more take
                  care of all His children who put their trust in Him.
            
            
               IS THE WIFE TO BLAME?
               THERE is an evil under the sun, great and increasing. It is said by money-wise men
                  that financial affairs are in a sad condition, and there is no sign of
                  improvement. Business men say it is hard times, and the poor laborers feel in
                  their very hearts that the times are hard, when the price of bread for their
                  dependent families, is double the price of their labor. Business firms are failing
                  for thousands, and men of accredited integrity turn out defaulters and
                  runaways.
               "But what can a lady writer have to do with monetary matters? She abjures politics
                  and controversies of every sort, and professes to keep on the feminine side of the
                  domestic circle." Yet she must be social with the liege lords and young princes of
                  homedom, or they will think her scornful and a prude. And then we are so singular,
                  or so selfish that we cannot help appropriating some share of these pecuniary
                  concerns to our own side. We are not willing that the men should have all the
                  glory of bankruptcy alone. To be sure, we have too much to do in our own peculiar
                  sphere, to study commercial interests, to examine the price of stocks, to compare
                  exports and imports, and trace the effects of foreign wars upon American trade,
                  manufactures, and agriculture, or even to appreciate the comparative mining
                  interests of California and Pennsylvania. But then have not the mothers, the wives
                  and daughters, a hand on the wheel that turns all this business machinery, the
                  pressure of which propels or retards it very essentially?
               
               We had occasion, the other afternoon, when the thermometer stood among the
                  nineties, to walk through one of our thoroughfares, along which are ranged sundry
                  foundries, machine-shops, car manufactories, &c., the whiz and clang of whose
                  engines, hammers, files, and saws, were almost deafening; and the dusty
                  atmosphere, heated seven times hotter by the furnaces, forges, and melted ore,
                  pressing through the open windows, was suffocating. If ever, we did not then feel
                  any desire to claim equal rights and privileges with the men. We were content to
                  be the weaker part of humanity, and bear its obloquy. But this is a
                  digression.
               There were fathers, husbands, and brothers, and our fancy started off for their
                  homes. Some were well ordered and disposed—the responsibilities felt by the
                  family, in equal poise with the toils of him who was bearing the burden and heat
                  of the day. But in another the wife seemed perfectly regardless of everything but
                  to gratify and please herself. She seemed determined to live in too extravagant a
                  manner for their limited income. She complained of her husband because he would
                  not afford her this and that, and he was so stingy that he was not willing the
                  children should be dressed like other people's.
               Their daughter, a pert miss of sixteen, was fingering the piano, (of course we did
                  not learn whether it was hired.) She declared it was entirely too warm weather to
                  work, and she thought it was too bad that her father would not let her go to the
                  "Cape," with some acquaintance who started that morning. As for sewing, "she
                  disliked it," and her whole appearance indicated that she disliked everything
                  called work,—except that she showed us "a love of a collar" she had
                     crocheted, and a splendid ottoman cover that she "had spent full
                  three months in working; but then it would never do her any good, for father would
                  say he could not afford to buy the ottoman." "Oh," said she, "I do love fancy
                  work, but plain sewing I detest. I make mother do that." A young friend present
                  intimated that herself had been very busy making shirts for her brother, who was
                  just leaving home. "I will not make shirts," responded the other: "I don't know
                  how, and I wont learn; and so mother puts father's all out to be made, for she has
                  enough sewing without them."
               Time passes on, and the daughter, by her pretty face and pleasing ing manners,
                  wins the heart of some admirer and becomes a wife. He, perchance, like herself,
                  has false views of life, and feels that, to be respected, they must dress and live
                     genteely. They take board at some fashionable boarding-house or
                  hotel, and dash like millionaires. He has fine business talents, and is receiving
                  a handsome salary, full enough to give them comfort and a competence, if wisely
                  used. But the young wife has nothing to do, but lounge, dress, promenade, make and
                  receive calls, study fashions, and ape those who she thinks are one step higher on
                  the ladder of popularity than themselves. She would blush to be recognized as the
                  daughter of a mechanic, and so she speaks of her father as a manufacturer up town.
                  The ten, fifteen, twenty, thirty (?) dollars a week for board, the expensive
                  apparel, the jewelry, the embroidery, the carriage rides, a trip to Nahant, or
                  Newport, one summer, and the tour of the lakes and White Mountains another, and it
                  is published in the city papers that A. B., clerk of — bank, has proved a
                  defaulter for a very large amount, and cannot be found. Rumor says that he went
                  off in a vessel bound for Australia. Was the wife to blame?
               Though returned from our walk, and in the quiet of our own room, yet our thoughts
                  pursue the same train. There was Simon Brent and his young wife, who, soon after
                  their marriage, came into the city and commenced life in a very modest unassuming
                  way. They rented a small house containing four rooms, and made it serve for a
                  dwelling and shop. Katy Brent had been raised in the country, and knew well how to
                  wash and bake, all which labor she shunned not to perform in her new home. And if
                  on an afternoon, when all her drudgery was done, she dressed herself in a neat
                  gingham or de-laine, she was well enough, even though occasion should call her
                  into the street. Her snug parlor, with its ingrain carpet and cane-seat maple
                  chairs, was a palace in her eyes, for contentment reigned in her heart.
               But after becoming familiar with city scenes and habits, she began to assimilate
                  in taste and feelings. Its excitements and gayeties took hold on her affections.
                  Her husband's business prospered. He began to be recognized as a citizen, and an
                  ambition for distinction arose in their hearts, which, as they sought it with
                  avidity, became an unholy ambition. The simple attire and furniture had been doffed for something more
                  expensive, and the snug cottage exchanged for a more respectable residence, all
                  which in their turn, as circumstances bade, were set aside for the habiliments and
                  trappings of wealth and fashion. A full tide of worldliness and pride swept away
                  the feeble barriers of principle which were opposed against them, and Mr. and Mrs.
                  Brent glittered on the top of every wave of extravagant show. Magnificent
                  entertainments were given; their children sent to the most expensive boarding
                  schools, and indulged in everything their pampered desires craved. Their religion
                  was a mere form, and the choice friends of the days of their simplicity, and whom
                  they had made to serve as stepping stones in their upward climbings, were
                  recognized only with a patronizing air, if recognized at all.
               "Simon Brent has done a splendid business," was reiterated among brokers and
                  bankers; "he will retire from it soon, independent. Why, it is only a
                  few years since he commenced the cabinet business in a very small way; but his
                  speculations in real estate, and railroad stock, are what has given him his wealth
                  after all."
               Like a peal of thunder from a clear sky, the next morning's paper announced that
                  "Simon Brent had forged notes on banks and individuals for more than a hundred
                  thousand, and fled, no one knew whither, to escape justice." Ought the wife to
                  bear any of the blame? Did she ever throw a preponderating weight into the scales,
                  against reckless extravagance? True, there were whispers of wine and gambling, but
                  we hazard little in guessing, that she looked with complacency upon the checker
                  and back-gammon boards, when purchased as a necessary appendage to their parlors
                  for the amusement of their friends, or that she made no serious objections to the
                  champagne and sherry being bought for the dinner given to Governor Lex and
                  Commodore Lefever. She now sighs in vain for her home of innocence and domestic
                  love. She sowed the wind and reaps the whirlwind. "They that will be rich fall
                  into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown
                  men in destruction and perdition."
               The large importing house of Huntley, Cook & Co., have failed for—we have
                  forgotten how much, but an enormous sum. Very likely they have saved enough for
                  themselves, but it will be the ruin of hundreds of others. But their
                  wives are surely not to blame. Let us look at one, who is a fair representation of
                  the others. Mrs. Cook was the pet of wealth, the daughter of the celebrated Dr.
                  Iveson;—dandled in the lap of luxury, and handed up to womanhood by ease and
                  affluence. The dress and surroundings of her infantile years were like those of a
                  princess, which, of course, must increase in richness and variety, with increasing
                  years, and the young wife of Edward Cook, of the firm 
                     of of
                     of
                   Huntley, Cook & Co., must outshine the daughter of Dr. Iveson, or
                  how would she show that she was in the ascending scale of popularity. Her parlors,
                  with their mirrored and pictured walls, their windows draped with damask and
                  embroidery of the most exquisite richness, their carpet, like the softest down to
                  the tread, the furniture of luxurious ease and finish, all interspersed with
                  ornaments of rare magnificence;—her person, it hardly befits a plain pen to
                  attempt the description of her costly changes of attire, her gold and jewels.
               But what of that? her husband's successful business warrants the outlay, and she
                  must vie with those whose society she courts, in all the arrangements of her house
                  and family;—their wealth and ability is not for a moment questionable. Yet five
                  hundred dollar shawls, dresses of brocade, one hundred dollar bonnets, bracelets
                  of gold, with pins and rings beset with diamonds and pearls the price of a snug
                  farm in each, pocket handkerchiefs and collars, at fifty dollars each, all to be
                  thrown aside and replaced by others of increased splendor and expense at every
                  caprice of fashion, are no inconsiderable chippings from a mountain of gold; and
                  when are added the chippings for household expenses, the parties and levees, the
                  gilded carriages, the liveried servants, the country seat, the tours to Europe—the
                  entire stock of Huntley, Cook & Co., is in the hands of assignees. The extreme
                  pressure in the money market—the tariff, or some foreign monied policy, is charged
                  with all the responsibility.
               Now let no 
                     tyranical
                     tyrannical
                   churl of a husband seek for a palliation of his course in what we have
                  said, for not one word has been written for him. Nor yet the spendthrift,
                  dissolute ruiner of himself and his family; him we leave with the officer of
                  justice and the preacher.
               
                  MRS. M. G. CLARKE.
               
            
            
            
               
               POWER OF AN ENDLESS LIFE.
               WHAT heart can conceive, what mind can measure, even in
                  imagination, the infinitude of the riches of creative wisdom and love! But when
                  you add to that the riches of God's grace, and superadd to that the riches of his
                  glory, the kingdoms of creation, redemption and reward, piled one above another,
                  in every direction an absolutely incomprehensible infinitude, you are confounded
                  by the very attempt, and can only humbly cry out with the enraptured and yet
                  baffled apostle, Oh the depths! the infinite depths! infinite on infinite!
               And in view of such glimpses of God's glory, the heart that has been taught by His
                  Spirit, the heart that has begun to know, in feeling and experience, the power of
                  His love, is ready to exclaim, My God it is enough! Thou art my all in all. Whom
                  have I in heaven but Thee? and there is none upon the earth that I desire beside
                  Thee. Oh! if I may but be made to know God, if I may but be taught to love Him, I
                  want nothing else. My happiness is secure in Him. The power of an endless life is
                  power to me, because it will let me study and love God to all eternity. The power
                  of an endless life is glory to me, because it absorbs me in the glory of God,
                  unfathomable, unsearchable, inconceivable, adorable, eternal. This is life
                  eternal, this is the power of an endless life, to know Thee, the only true God,
                  and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.
               And thus, again, that life is eternally progressive in enjoyment, in delight, in
                  happiness inconceivable, unutterable. Forever increasing with the increase of the
                  knowledge of God in Christ, ages on ages shall witness an undiminished freshness
                  and novelty in the glory still to be revealed, a capacity of bliss forever
                  enlarging, and a reality of bliss forever accumulating. The bliss arising from the
                  knowledge and the love of God not only never can have any limit, but, in the
                  nature of things, must be positively and infinitely progressive.
               —Cheever.
               
            
            
               MY MOTHER'S FEARS.
               MY mother! how much there is in these words. How suggestive of all that is sweet,
                  endearing, pure and good in the tenderest and gentlest of earth's relations. How
                  mingled and conflicting the character of the recollections they crowd before the
                  mind. Many are pleasing—as the virtues and kindnesses of a worthy and beloved
                  parent are revivified and made to pass before us in forms of beauty and
                  loveliness. Many are painful—as they cause us again to possess the sins of
                  childhood and youth, and make us look upon forms that are at once hateful and
                  accusing, because of their ingratitude and disobedience. My mother! There is power
                  in these words—a resurrection and loving power. They bring up from the dark
                  domains of the grave one who has but recently joined the great throng of its
                  inhabitants. One called to move in humble life, but one whom a grateful son (and
                  now himself a parent) will ever delight to think of as among the best of mothers.
                  A mother, whose unsullied virtue and many excellencies of character he will ever
                  regard as of far greater worth than wealth or worldly position and
                  accomplishments. My kind, my dear old mother, shall I ever fail to bless God for
                  the rich legacy of good for both worlds, He gave to me in the purity of thy life,
                  the sweetness and strength of thy endearing love, the wisdom of thy teaching and
                  the piety of thy example? No, never. My gracious Heavenly Father shall ever
                  receive from the depths of my heart the tribute of grateful and adoring praise,
                  for the precious and priceless gifts of parents, of whom, because of their worth
                  and true excellence I shall never need be ashamed. Lowly they were as to the
                  things and honors of this world, but high in the sentiments of right, of goodness
                  and truth, which they possessed, and which they taught by precept, and illustrated
                  by example to their children. Humble among the rich and great of earth, but
                  ennobled and exalted by the fear of God, and their life of faith on his Son Jesus
                     Christ. And now that their career on
                  earth is ended, and the place that knew them here shall know them no more, I think
                  of them as reigning with the Saviour in heaven, and richly sharing in its unfading
                  glories.
               My mother! It is well for a son to think much of his mother; yes, even when he is
                  no longer under her immediate care, and when she has been removed to another
                  sphere of existence. To the end of life, the recollections of her virtues and
                  influence should be green and fresh in the garden of his soul. He will ever find
                  them to be increasingly redolent and beautiful, and that they will never fail to
                  constitute a power for good, to strengthen him in virtue and integrity, to fortify
                  him against temptation, and to encourage him always to continue in well-doing. It
                  is not unfrequently said that some men do not know how rich they are. They are not
                  fully aware of the amount or value of their possessions. Be this as it may, it is
                  very certain that few of us ever come fully to know how rich we have been, or are,
                  in the blessings conferred upon us by a benevolent God through the wisdom, the
                  piety, and faithfulness of a worthy parent. How few even of the pious, fully and
                  gratefully appreciate the wealth of good they possess in the every day blessings
                  of life. The elements—air, water, light and heat; the endless variety of objects
                  of utility and beauty that surround us; the organs of sight, hearing, &c.; the
                  noble faculties of the soul—understanding, reason, memory and conscience; home,
                  with all its endearments; food, clothing, books, friends and a thousand other
                  things. These are all sources of happiness—but how imperfectly valued as such and
                  as the gifts of God, because so little the subjects of pleasing and grateful
                  thought. We are denied some real or fancied good; we suffer some serious or
                  trifling inconvenience; an object we prize perishes from our sight, and we are
                  very easily made unhappy. One unguarded word from lips that have spoken to us a
                  thousand kind and loving ones makes us sullen and morose for days. One little
                  disappointment clouds with gloom and darkness our entire horizon. And why is this?
                  It is because we are so lavish in the bestowment of thought upon these. These for
                  the time have a kind of demoniac possession of our thinking faculties, and
                  successfully cast out all thoughts of the good we yet inherit. This is a sad and
                  criminal infirmity of our fallen natures, against which we cannot be too much on
                  our guard.
               My mother's tears! These should never be forgotten. Those of mine never shall be,
                  I trust, for God only knows how great is the debt I owe Him for those tears. The
                  destinies of our being are frequently swayed and determined by incidents and
                  agencies that to us appear trifling or unimportant. It may be by the influence of
                  tears which a fond and faithful mother shed over us upon some special occasion,
                  and at some eventful period. My mother's tears! He who knoweth all the sorrows and
                  solicitudes of his children, and who bottleth up their tears, knows how many my
                  mother shed for me. Reader, how do you honor your mother, and what price do you
                  place upon her tears? Do you possess a mother among the spared and cherished
                  blessings of life? If you do, bethink yourself of the tears you may have cost her
                  already, and be chary and frugal of them for the future. That affectionate and
                  devoted form may, before you are aware of it, be removed out of your sight and
                  beyond the reach of your filial attentions or penitent confessions. See to it that
                  your appreciation of your mother's tears does not come too late. Through the mercy
                  of God I was led to place a higher value upon those of mine than upon gold for
                  full twenty-four years before the grave closed upon all that was mortal of her
                  being. There was eloquence in those tears upon an occasion that will ever be to me
                  a memorable one. They reached my heart, and secured to my affectionate and
                  faithful mother a triumph, the happy fruits of which I am to this day reaping.
               Gwenllian Llawdeg was a girl about my age, modest and of pleasing manners. She was
                  the daughter of pious parents. Her father was an excellent man, filling well and
                  faithfully the office of an agent in the employ of a worthy "iron master" on the
                  "Welsh hills," and a licensed preacher in the church of which he was an esteemed
                  member. The mother was a fine looking woman, of dignified and respectable bearing,
                  and possessed some (perhaps many) excellent qualities—but there were some things
                  in which she was greatly deficient. She would not so manage her domestic affairs
                  with prudent economy as to live within her plain, hardworking husband's income.
                  She was extravagant in dress and
                  living: and so brought up and pampered her children to their great and lasting
                  injury. The consequence was that Gwenllian's father was always embarrassed with
                  debt, and obliged to borrow money of Iago to pay Joan, and of Iorwerth to pay
                  Iago. All this was well known by my beloved parents, who were religiously
                  scrupulous to live within their very slender means, and faithfully to pay every
                  person what they owed. For this I shall ever respect their memory.
               Gwenllian and myself, when young, became members of the same church, and soon
                  formed an acquaintance, that in due time ripened into a warm and loving
                  attachment. My discriminating and ever-watchful parents became alarmed as they at
                  once saw what might in all probability be the result of the early friendship and
                  ardent youthful love—an alliance for life "for better or for worse," between my
                  young friend and myself. They thought of the mother's example, and the indulgence
                  and indolence in which she had brought up her nice little daughter. Well they
                  remonstrated and cautioned and counselled, but for a time to little good purpose.
                  I received all they said with affectionate respect, for I greatly loved and
                  revered my parents, and much more after God had taught and renewed me by his
                  Spirit. But I thought I knew something too. Was I not getting to be a young man
                  seventeen or eighteen years old? Surely I could make my own choices, and guide my
                  own ways. Then I respectfully thought my parents might be mistaken in their
                  judgment about the object of my too fond and foolish affection. I was a good deal
                  wise and knowing as the most of young gentlemen are apt to be at that
                  very self-important age. My good father spoke to me kindly but with more sternness
                  than my dear mother. Things went on this way for some time, and my parents' loving
                  hearts were daily agitated with anxious and painful solicitude for their son,
                  fearing he might in the haste of youthful folly form a matrimonial connection that
                  they felt assured would prove fatal to his usefulness and happiness for life. Much
                  and earnestly did they seek for the wisdom that cometh from above to guide them
                  and him. They sought it not in vain.
               I was at this time residing some six miles from my parents, and was engaged as a
                  clerk managing a branch store for a large merchant chant connected with an iron
                  works. The way from the residence of my parents to mine was by no means an
                  inviting and agreeable one, as it was in part dreary and lonely, over barren and
                  heathy mountains, and then past black and dirty coal pits, smoking furnaces, and
                  noisy rolling mills and forges. Over this mountain road my mother came to make me
                  a visit of undying love, and to do all her duty as an ever-faithful parent. Shall
                  I ever forget that wearisome journey undertaken for my special benefit? Never! I
                  think I now see her fine form and comely beautiful countenance. No mother could be
                  more gentle or cautious, or more loving and faithful than she was with me that
                  day. She calmly and intelligently reasoned the case with me as to my youth, and
                  the dangers which beset me. She showed me how my cup of enjoyment for life might
                  by an injudicious choice be filled with bitter ingredients. She gave a history of
                  her own experience, and the happy result of exercising judgment as well as
                  affection. All she said was wisely and carefully said. The time came for her to
                  leave. I escorted her part of the way home. She still talked to me with great
                  tenderness and fidelity. Her heart was full. She felt that she was trying to save
                  her first-born from one of the greatest evils of life, for such is an injudicious
                  and unhappy matrimonial alliance, as is seen in the every-day experience of a
                  large part of the human race. I said her heart was full, as we for a time were
                  about to separate. Tears came to her relief. They were my mother's—my loving
                  mother's tears, who had taken all these pains for my good. It was enough. I was
                  conquered. In accordance with her wishes I promised to look to God anew for
                  guidance, and to give myself to prayer and careful consideration in regard to the
                  whole subject. A sweet kiss, worth more than gold, from my dear mother, and for
                  that time we parted.
               I kept my promise, and soon the result was such as fond parents had wished. Before
                  I had entered into any kind of entangling engagements or promises with Gwenllian,
                  my attentions were discontinued, and we parted good friends. Subsequent history
                  proved that I was laid under everlasting obligations to God for my mother's tears.
                  And now if my simple story is only the means of exciting in the hearts of my
                  readers a more grateful and respectful
                  appreciation of parental affection, solicitude and fidelity;—and if it only
                  influences any of the youthful readers of the Journal, to be more disposed to
                  receive the counsels of wisdom, from parents, and judicious friends, in regard to
                  the most serious affairs of life, I shall be satisfied.

               MATERNAL LOVE.
               
                  WHAT pen can paint or tongue can tell,
                  How pure and deep her love?
                  No sounding line or works of art,
                  Can e'er that problem prove.
               
               
                  'Tis broader than the spreading sea;
                  Yes! that hath shore and bound:
                  But where's the shore to mother's love,
                  Or who can mete its bound.
               
               
                  Not like the moon that wanes, nor sun,
                  That sets 'neath yonder skies;
                  Her love ne'er wanes, nor sets her sun,
                  'Till pale in death she lies.
               
               
                  She lists to infant's softest moan,
                  Wipes childhood's tears away;
                  And leads the youth that cluster round,
                  Pointing to blissful day.

                  Breathes soothing words in accents sweet,
                  Brings balm for every woe.
               
               
                  Mysterious union! none but he,
                  Whose skill formed every part,
                  Can tell what close affinity,
                  'Tween child and mother's heart.

                  To us fond mothers given;
                  Teach us with riches of thy grace,
                  To train this charge for Heaven.

               MY SISTER.
               
                  My loved, my cherished sister,
                  They tell me thou art gone;
                  That far from me 'neath the cold ground,
                  They long since laid thee down,
                  In distant grave-yard, where the pine
                  And balm of Gilead spread:
                  The weeping willow too, and vine,
                  Hang drooping o'er the dead.
               
               
                  The maple lends her pleasant shade,
                  The sumach scents the air,
                  And all within that hallowed spot
                  Is beautiful and fair!
                  The white, the blush, the damask rose,
                  Mark many a treasured spot;
                  The dahlia too, the violet blue,
                  And the sweet forget-me-not.
               
               
                  Oh, sacred spot, how should I love,
                  At this still hour of eve,
                  To visit thee, and twine sweet flowers
                  Round one loved grave to wreathe.
                  The boon I crave cannot be mine,
                  For other hands the prize
                  To plant fresh flowers upon the mound,
                  'Neath which my Sister lies.
               
               
                  Sweet Sister mine, could'st thou look down
                  From thy bright home above,
                  And see the heart of her who mourns
                  The loss of thy pure love,
                  Thou'dst see on memory's tablet there,
                  Thy name in diamonds set,
                  Which brighter grow from year to year
                  Encased in pure love's cabinet.
               
               
                  But Sister dear, I will not wish
                  That thou mayst come to me,
                  For thou hast ended all thy pain,
                  And art from sorrow free.
                  I know that thou art happy now,
                  In that bright world above,
                  
                  For Angels bore thee on their wings
                  To thy Redeemer—God.
                  And I will strive to meet me there,
                  When all my toils are o'er,
                  And join with thee in praise to Him
                  
                  On Canaan's blissful shore!

               THE SICK MOTHER.
               A Story for Little Girls.
               MRS. LANE was sick in her chamber. She turned wearily from side to side, and
                  looked at her disordered room, till the sight made her nervous. The table was half
                  covered with vials, spoons, and glasses, and the cold water she wanted so much,
                  was just beyond her reach. The fire had gone nearly out, and the ashes and
                  smothered coals, looked grimly enough in the grate. It was rather chilly, too,
                  with the fire so low, and George and Willie, who had been playing in the room,
                  till they had tired their mother so that she could not bear their noise, had gone
                  down into the sitting-room, leaving all the doors open, and the floor littered
                  with the papers they had cut, and the books they had played with. Mrs. Lane could
                  hear their voices, as they were amusing themselves down stairs, and at last their
                  amusement ended in a dispute. The sick mother called as loudly as she could, with
                  her feeble voice, but they did not hear her, and she had vainly tried in many ways
                  to call Margaret, the Irish girl, who was down in the kitchen, to come up and make
                  her room more comfortable. But Margaret was ironing, and singing as she worked;
                  she did not hear Mrs. Lane's voice, nor the chair which she rattled upon the
                  floor, by reaching from the bed; though Mrs. Lane could hear her singing, and the
                  heavy jar of the iron, every time it touched the table. "Oh! if I only had a
                  bell," thought the poor sick mother, "but I must wait till Ellen comes home from
                  school, and perhaps things will go on better then," but she sighed as though she
                  did not believe Ellen's coming would make much difference after all, and said half
                  aloud, "Oh, if Lizzie were only at home."
               By and by, she heard footsteps in the room adjoining hers; and she heard the
                  drawer of the bureau open and shut again; the door was partly open and so she
                  called, "Ellen." She called two or three times before Ellen answered; but
                  presently she made her appearance at the open door, with her hair all about her
                  shoulders, and a comb in her hand. "Ellen, dear," said the "sick mother," "cannot
                  you arrange my room a little, and ask Margaret to bring up some kindlings and
                  coal, for I am quite chilly?"
               "There," muttered Ellen, "that's always the way; I've just got my hair all down to
                  curl it for singing school to-night. It's almost tea time now, and I sha'n't have
                  time afterwards, to get ready;" and she walked, scolding as she went, to the top
                  of the stairs, where she stood and called "Margaret," in a loud, sharp tone, which
                  rang through and through her mother's aching head. After a while Margaret made her
                  appearance; and Ellen directed her to bring up fuel and make a fire; while she
                  ungraciously gathered up the books and papers from the middle of the floor, threw
                  them into a rocking chair, and then going back to her room, went on curling her
                  hair. Margaret took down the coals and ashes, making a great dust and noise. "I've
                  a dress half-ironed, ma'am," said she, "and as soon as it's finished I'll be
                  makin' yer fire," and she went down. Before the dress was finished she had
                  forgotten all about the fire, and having at last hurried away the ironing, she
                  began to prepare the tea, lest Mr. Lane should come in from his store, before it
                  was ready. Ellen did not finish her preparations for singing school till called
                  down to tea, and when tea was over, her young companions called for her and she
                  hurried away, without once going to her mother's room, or seeing her little
                  brothers' wants cared for.
               Mr. Lane had but a moment to spare, to speak to his wife after tea, for his
                  business obliged him to return immediately to the store, and as Mrs. Lane heard
                  the door close after him, she buried her face in the pillow, and the tears stole
                  down her cheeks.
               There was a ring at the door bell. Margaret's slow and heavy
                     tread was heard along the front entry, and the pattering of
                  the little boys' feet as they ran after her to see who had come. The door opened,
                  and "it's Lizzie, it's Lizzie!" was the exclamation of the little boys, and merry
                  greetings from Lizzie were followed by
                  the inquiry, "How is mother?" She did not wait to hear, however, but ran up
                  stairs, followed by the boys. "Why, Lizzie," exclaimed her mother, as she extended
                  her arms to welcome her, "what has brought you home so suddenly? has the news of
                  my sickness reached you and spoiled your visit?" "Not spoiled it, mother,"
                  answered the little girl, "but I heard this morning that you were sick, and I knew
                  you would need me; and I told Aunt Mary I would come another time and finish my
                  visit, and so I came home as soon as I could." "You are a dear child," said her
                  mother, kindly, "I need you very much; Ellen has gone to the singing school, and
                  Margaret is belated about her work, I suppose, and very busy, and the children
                  ought to have been put to bed long ago."
               "Don't think any more about it, mother," said Lizzie, as she took off her bonnet
                  and cloak, and laid them away in the bed-room. "It is really cold here, and we'll
                  have a fire first of all." She ran lightly down stairs, and taking the basket of
                  kindlings, while Margaret took the coal, she hastened back to her mother's room.
                  and soon a bright flame was curling up in the grate among the black lumps of coal,
                  that hissed and crackled cheerily.
               Lizzie was but eleven years old, but she had much more influence over her little
                  brothers than Ellen had, though Ellen was three years older, for Lizzie seemed
                  always to think of others, while Ellen thought only of herself. As soon as Lizzie
                  saw the fire well burning, she called the little boys, and by a little kind
                  persuasion, induced them to be undressed and go to bed quietly. She heard them say
                  their prayers, and talked pleasantly with them while she prepared them for bed,
                  and then bidding them "good-night," she went back to her mother's room; she then
                  came to the bedside to inquire about her mother's sickness, and to know what she
                  could do for her.
               Mrs. Lane said she did not think she should be sick many days, else they should
                  have tried to get a nurse, and that she should soon be better, if she had any one
                  to take a little care of her, and make her comfortable. She then told Lizzie how
                  to prepare a warm drink for her, which was soon ready, and then the little girl
                  began to put the room in order. She carried down all the glasses and spoons that
                  were not wanted; and, after spreading a clean white cloth over the table, she
                  arranged the things neatly upon it. She picked up all the things that were about
                  the floor—stepping softly as she did so—took all the books out of the rocking
                  chair, and put them away; threw the pieces of paper into the fire, brushed up the
                  hearth, and putting the lamp where it would not shine in her mother's face, she
                  came and sat down by the bedside.
               Mrs. Lane opened her eyes, and looked at the pleasant fire, the pleasant looking
                  room, and the still pleasanter face of her dear little daughter; and then drawing
                  her towards her, she kissed her affectionately, and then closed her eyes
                  again.
               Pretty soon Lizzie knew by her mother's breathing that she was asleep; so she sat
                  very still, that she might not disturb her. She was quite tired after her ride of
                  several miles and all that she had done since she came home; and she, too, fell
                  asleep in the rocking chair. In about an hour Mrs. Lane awoke, quite refreshed by
                  the sleep she had had, and asked Lizzie to call Margaret, to assist her in getting
                  up to have her bed made, that she might be more comfortable through the night.
               In half an hour it was all done; and just as they had got everything arranged in
                  order again, Mr. Lane came home. He looked anxious and troubled as he came into
                  the chamber, but his face brightened into a cheerful smile as he saw Lizzie.
               "Ah, my dear! so you have come," said he; "I should have sent for you to-morrow;
                  we cannot get along without you, when mother is sick."
               There was a sound of footsteps upon the side walk, and young voices laughing and
                  chatting; and presently the front door opened and slammed to, heavily. Ellen had
                  come from the singing school. She ran up to her room, and soon after came and
                  looked into her mother's chamber.
               "Well, I'm glad you've got home, Lizzie," said she, "for mother needs you. I can't
                  stay at home from school without losing my place in the class, and I think you
                  ought to be here;" and the selfish girl went back to her room.
               "You should have insisted on Ellen's staying at home with you all the week," said
                  Mr. Lane to his wife.
               "I had rather not have her at all," replied Mrs. Lane, "if she does not stay
                  willingly, for she would do everything in such a disagreeable manner that her presence would do me
                  more harm than good; but Lizzie is like a ray of sunshine in the house."
               "Do not sit up any longer, my dear," she continued, turning to Lizzie. The little
                  girl came to her parents for the good night kiss, and retired to her room with a
                  sweet smile upon her face, and the sweeter satisfaction in her loving heart, of
                  having done her duty without expectation or desire of other reward than the
                  approval of her earthly parents, and her Father in Heaven.

               A THRILLING SCENE.
               BY REV. JOHN BERG.
               THE place where the incident occurred which I am about to relate, was in the midst
                  of the deep, wide Atlantic. The sky was beautifully clear, and a fresh breeze was
                  blowing from SSW. Our vessel—the City of Manchester—a fine, noble, iron steamer,
                  with Archimedian screw, and more than two thousand tons burden, was majestically
                  ploughing the waves, making good headway towards the port of Philadelphia. It was
                  her first trip across the Atlantic, for she was quite new, and every available
                  berth was occupied. Amongst the crowd of passengers there were six clergymen,
                  belonging to different sections of the one universal church of Christ on earth.
                  The officers, nearly all of whom appeared to be from the land of Caledonia, were
                  highly respectable, gentlemanly men—entirely devoted to their duty, feeling that
                  the safety and lives of that large freight of human beings were in their hands. We
                  had proceeded more than half way of the voyage, and nothing particularly had
                  occurred to mar the peace and harmony of all on board except a few sea troubles,
                  which all who sail on the ocean are acquainted with.
               I think it was about two o'clock in the afternoon of a charming day, when many
                  were promenading the deck, to change the monotony attendant on a sea voyage, and
                  inhale the salubrious breezes—while others were in the saloons, or reclining in
                  their berths. All appeared cheerful and hopeful, and not in the slightest degree
                  anticipating danger, when suddenly, as if by an electric shock, a piercing cry was
                  heard, which echoed and re-echoed through the ship, causing all faces to gather
                  blackness. "A man overboard—a man overboard." Instantly all rushed to the after
                  part of the vessel, to catch a sight of the drowning man, who turned out to be the
                  third officer—a fine young man, whose politeness and gentlemanly manners had
                  enlisted the good feelings of all on board who were acquainted with him. The
                  sonorous voice of the captain was immediately heard: "Stop her!—lower
                  boat!" The orders were promptly obeyed, and the ship was brought to; and as quick
                  almost as thought a number of brave fellows were seen pulling as for their own
                  lives, towards the young officer, who was manfully battling with the waves.
               Oh! thank Heaven! there is something beautiful and noble, after all, left in our
                  common humanity! Never can I forget the intense agony depicted on the countenances
                  of all who were witnesses of that exciting spectacle; and never do I wish again to
                  participate in the same harrowing feelings of agony and gladness which prevailed
                  during the effort put forth to save that young man. Let the reader suppose the
                  drowning man a few hundred feet in the rear of the ship, struggling for life; the
                  boat sent for his relief approaching him, and the agonized passengers witnesses of
                  the scene. Exclamations like the following are heard: There—O my God! he is
                  gone—gone—lost—lost! No—there, he is not lost yet!—see, he has risen again! How he
                  struggles! O! merciful Father in heaven, save him! Poor fellow! perhaps he has a
                  young wife, whose love follows him all across the ruffled ocean! perhaps at this
                  very time she is praying for his safety! or, it may be, an aged mother leans on
                  him for her only support! Now, see, they are near him!—oh! alas! he has
                  disappeared again! They do not know where to look for him!—oh! now again he rises!
                  see, they have hold of him! God be praised! Noble fellows! A mother's blessing and
                  prayers, and a wife's tears of joy, shall be your reward! He is now in the boat.
                  The acclamations of joy are boundless, while silent gratitude and praise are
                  wafted to heaven from many Christian hearts on board that noble ship. In the
                  evening, when all were gathered together for divine worship, public thanksgiving was offered to Almighty God, by the
                  clergyman who officiated. In the course of a few hours the officer was restored to
                  consciousness, and on the following day was able to resume his duties.
               From witnessing the above thrilling scene, I was instinctively led to reflect on
                  the solemn and momentous truth, that human life is a great sea, in which many of
                  our fellow beings, of all ages, are "overboard," struggling with the waves. They
                  are without the ark of safety, and are nigh unto destruction; a few more
                  struggles, and they sink to rise no more. Oh! why is it that we, who have found
                  refuge in Jesus, have not a more vivid sense of the fearful condition, and danger
                  to which so many are exposed. Why should we not possess, to a greater extent,
                  those generous feelings to save the soul from death, which prompts to save the
                  life of a fellow creature. Why should the Christian mind remain so apathetic with
                  regard to perishing humanity, all around. In this fearful ocean of imminent
                  danger, are the youthful, the aged, the rich, and the poor, the learned and the
                  illiterate. And yet, how unconcerned we glide along in the vessel on which we have
                  embarked safely, as we hope, for the port of eternity. Oh, God! waken all thy
                  saints to more tender solicitude, that they may employ more efforts for rescuing
                  those deathless spirits who are sinking beneath the overwhelming flood to rise no
                  more.
            
            
               THE FORMATION OF CHARACTER.
               "I LOVE," said a tender, affectionate mother, "to watch the opening of my child's
                  mind. It seems to me like the unfolding of the tiny bud, and as one pretty word
                  after another escapes from her little lips, I can almost imagine the uplifting of
                  the fragrant petals, which have within them the inherent beauty of the full-blown
                  flower. 'Tis to me, as a sweet index of the character, now hidden, but which will
                  soon be the perfection of all I could wish."
               How many, many times has this language found utterance from a mother's heart, as
                  she sits alone with her little charge, and peers into its futurity. And we are
                  glad that there are some who are inclined thus to consider, for it is but too
                  evident, that many tender buds are nurtured by hands that are not guided by the
                  feelings of true affection. How fearful is the responsibility of that mother who
                  dares to delegate her duty, as such, to another. The work of forming a character,
                  or in other words, directing the intellectual, social, and moral condition of a
                  being, whose existence is to be perfected through the ages of eternity, is
                  certainly not a secondary task. Talent and skill of the highest order are here
                  called into action, and in no other sphere will their influence be so decided and
                  effectual. The satisfaction that follows the faithful performance of parental
                  duty, cannot be exceeded, from its very nature, by that of any other to which it
                  is possible to attain. Although a child may be characterized by nature, in a
                  degree, still it is well understood that the moulding hand is essential to its
                  proper development, and, that this is the prerogative of the parent, none will
                  deny. The authority of the instructor is only delegated immediately from the
                  parent. For the time being, he is in the place of the parent, and hence the
                  relation is similar; but the teacher being responsible to the parent, as his
                  agent, the relation should be sustained only so long as they are united in their
                  views concerning the end to be attained, that is, the child's best interest and
                  benefit. Sincerity, then, would seem to demand, on the part of the parent, whose
                  sympathy is awakened by the helpless cradling, by its innocence and dependence,
                  that this watchfulness should not only continue, but increase. The necessity for
                  guidance should be met by the kindest instruction, and the noblest powers of the
                  heart and mind be centred in the accomplishment of the desire so fondly
                  anticipated. To accumulate power to bear on this point, and to simplify great
                  principles for present use, is an object worthy of the attention of every
                  Christian parent.

               THE TELESCOPE.
               "MAMMA, what are those children doing with that long stick with joints in it,
                  leaning on a table with no table on it?"
               That long stick, my child, with joints in it, is a telescope, and the little girl
                  is looking through it at the stars. You know, when your grandma wishes to read in
                  your small print Bible, she puts on her spectacles, and when she wishes to do some
                  very fine sewing, she puts on two pairs of spectacles. This enables her to see
                  still better. The reason of this is because the rays of light, in passing from the
                  thing looked at through the glasses to the eye, are stretched more widely apart
                  than usual, and this makes things look larger, and seem nearer.
               The telescope is a long tube with glasses placed in it at different distances, in
                  such a manner as to make objects very distant seem near and large. The first who
                  discovered that putting two glasses together made things appear so, was a little
                  boy, the son of a spectacle maker in Holland. He was one day playing with the
                  glasses in his father's shop, and he found that by putting two together between
                  his fingers, and looking through them, the church steeple looked larger and seemed
                  nearer. The father then tried the same experiment, and found that it was even so.
                  Galileo, a philosopher in Tuscany in Italy, hearing of these things, set his mind
                  to work to bring the invention to perfection. He fixed his glasses at the end of
                  long organ 
                     pipies
                     pipes
                   of different sizes, and so constructed a telescope. This was near the
                  beginning of the seventeenth century, or about two hundred and fifty years ago.
                  Since that time telescopes have been greatly improved. Mitchell's telescope at the
                  observatory in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Lord Rosse's great telescope, are the largest
                  in the world, and are constructed on a plan somewhat different from Galileo's. Of
                  the construction of these telescopes, I shall not tell you at this time. I shall
                  speak only of the wonders they reveal in the far-off heavens.
               They show that the stars you see every evening sparkling in the blue sky, and
                  which appear no larger than the diamonds in a lady's breast-pin, are really mighty
                  worlds, which God, the Creator, has hung there upon nothing, and holds there by
                  his almighty power. Around the sun which gives us light by day, are seen eight
                  great planets or worlds; some of them nearly as large, and others much larger than
                  the earth on which we live. Some of them you can see without a telescope, and they
                  look like the other stars, except that they shine with a milder and steadier
                  light. They fly around the sun at different distances, with a speed much more
                  rapid than the swiftest locomotive, or a ball discharged from the mouth of a
                  cannon. "They never tire or stop to rest," but on they go from age to age, round
                  and round the sun, producing in many of them, the delightful changes of spring,
                  summer, autumn, and winter. The order of the planets in regard to their distance
                  from the sun, is as follows:—
               Mercury, the least of the planets, stands nearest, and next to the sun. As the
                  smallest child seeks a place nearest its mother, so this little planet nestles so
                  closely to the sun, that you can seldom
                  or never see him. To the inhabitants of Mercury, the sun appears seven times as
                  large as it does to us, and it is seven times as brilliant. "O what a bright and
                  beautiful place that must be, mamma, so near the sun, maybe that is really and
                  truly heaven."
               I think not, my child, for of heaven it is said there is no need of the sun, or of
                  the moon, to shine in it, for the glory of God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is
                  the light thereof. That must be a much more glorious place, which has the maker of
                  the sun, moon, and all the stars, for its light, and Him who is the light and joy
                  of the whole earth for its glory.
               The next in order is Venus, that sweet and gem-like star, that sometimes 
                     
                        You see in the west,
                        On the evening's breast,
                        Which shines so bright,
                        With its golden light.
                     
                  
               
               At other times, if you are up in the morning before the sun, you will see the same
                  golden star rising in the east, to tell the weary watcher that the sun is near,
                  and it will soon be day. In ancient times, before it was known that the planets
                  moved round the sun, it was supposed that this planet was two; and when it rose in
                  the morning before the sun, they called it the morning star or Phosphorus and
                  Lucifer, and when it set in the evening after the sun, they called it the evening
                  star or Hesperus and Vesper.
               Next to Venus is the earth on which we live. It is a little larger than that
                  planet, and has one moon moving around itself once in twenty-nine days, which
                  makes some of its evenings very light and pleasant. By the telescope it is seen
                  that the moon is a large body, having upon its surface very lofty mountains, some
                  of which are volcanoes. Some have supposed they could see buildings upon the moon,
                  and inhabitants, but this is not true, no such thing can ever be seen without a
                  telescope thousands of times more powerful than any now in use.
               And now comes Mars, which the ancients called the god of war on account of his red
                  fiery color. He was supposed by them to have a very evil disposition, inciting men
                  to make war with each other, and delighting in bloodshed and carnage, burning of
                  houses, cities, &c. But this is proved to be a very gross slander upon a
                  peaceable well-behaved planet, that has never done any harm in his life, except it
                  is sometimes to presume to dress himself up in a garb of light, nearly equal in
                  brilliance to that of Venus, and to take his stand far above her in the heavens;
                  and he is thought occasionally to have disputed the palm of splendor with Jupiter.
                  But I do not think either of these planets have ever envied him on that account,
                  or been jealous of his glory. I think, therefore, the libel must have originated
                  in the hearts of ignorant and superstitious men.
               Next in order are nine small planets, called Asteroids. These, it is supposed,
                  were once united, forming one planet. And it is thought they were blown asunder by
                  some convulsion of nature, an occurrence similar, perhaps, to what will take place
                  with our earth, when the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll, and it
                  shall pass away with a great noise. But we are encouraged to look for new heavens
                  and a new earth to take the place of the present when that shall have passed
                  away.
               Next in order is Jupiter, the largest of all the planets. It is seen in the
                  celestial concave as one of the brightest stars, sometimes on the meridian, or
                  declining westward. At other times he may be seen rising in the east, and riding
                  full royally through the heavens, making the tour of the sky in a single night,
                  till he is lost in the west in the blaze of the morning sun. Jupiter is found, by
                  the aid of the telescope, to be a vast globe thirteen hundred times as large as
                  the earth, travelling in his journey round the sun at the rate of twenty-nine
                  thousand miles an hour, a thousand times as fast as a pretty swift locomotive, and
                  it spins on its axis like a top, performing an entire revolution in ten hours,
                  carrying each point on his equator at the rate of twenty-six thousand miles in an
                  hour. Jupiter has four moons, the largest of which revolves around it once in
                  forty-two hours.
               The next planet in order is Saturn. It appears to us a pale feeble star of a
                  bluish color, but the telescope reveals it an immense globe, nine hundred times as
                  large as our world, and the most remarkable and fascinating of all the planets. It
                  is not so swift a traveller as Jupiter, neither does it turn as rapidly on its
                  axis, though in both of these motions he is much more rapid than the earth. Saturn appears to us to move very slowly
                  indeed, and that is owing to its great distance from us. If a railroad car,
                  traveling at the rate of twenty miles an hour, had been started from Saturn on the
                  day of Noah's sacrifice after the flood, it would not have reached us yet. Saturn
                  is so distant from the sun, that it takes thirty of our years to perform its
                  journey around him, so that a person to be eighty years old in Saturn, must have
                  been born when the Jews were in Babylon. Saturn has no less than eight moons, and
                  is surrounded by two immense rings. If you can imagine our evening sky spanned
                  with two shining rings, one of them as wide as a hundred of our moons, another a
                  little less, one moon ten times as large as ours, and seven others; one rising
                  perhaps, another setting, one full and round, another a half moon, and another
                  like a new moon, and the stars shining in different degrees of splendor, you can
                  have some idea of a night in Saturn.
               Next we come to Herschel, that far-off planet of which we know very little, except
                  that it is the third planet in size, has six moons, which revolve around him in a
                  different direction from the moons belonging to other planets. It is one hundred
                  and eighty millions of miles from the sun, and its year is equal to eighty-four of
                  ours. And then, as far away in the distant space beyond Herschel as it is from us
                  to the sun, is still another great planet called Neptune or Leverrier, with one
                  moon and perhaps more. It is so distant from the sun that its year is equal to one
                  hundred and sixty-four of ours, and it would seem that it could enjoy but very
                  little of its light and heat; but the Creator, if he chose, could give it an
                  atmosphere that would so magnify the sun, as to make it appear as large to its
                  inhabitants as the sun does to us, and engender as much heat.
               Now, children, I have given you one peep through the telescope, at the sun and the
                  great planets moving around it, which is only a part of what is called the solar
                  system. The view I have given of this system, compared with the universe of
                  systems which may be seen around us in the great concave of heaven, is something
                  like looking through the key-hole into a small closet of a single house of all the
                  houses in the world.

               HOME AGAIN.
               WHAT pleasure to hear these words: the country is beautiful, all places have their
                  charms and delight us for awhile, but nothing meets the deep, full response of the
                  soul, as does the idea of home. We are excited and eager in the anticipations of
                  pleasures, and arrangements are gladly planned and executed, that all may be in
                  readiness to hasten departure. The future fills the mind, and not a thought, by
                  way of regret, is bestowed on the scenes and friends we leave, to seek for those
                  which to us will be new and interesting.
               Feelings like these were ours a few short weeks since, and the welcome pleasures
                  came, but now they are past.
               The beautiful rolling country, clad in verdure so inviting, has met our delighted
                  gaze from the window. We have seen, too, the innocent flocks on the hill-side, and
                  by the quiet water the cattle found their full enjoyment. These, with the many
                  excursions for pleasure and recreation, of boating, fishing or berrying, and the
                  friends with whom we enjoyed them, rise now before our minds as a dream. But there
                  is solid satisfaction in being again at home; it is here we find the unchanging
                  charms, for it is in one sense always the same—'tis home. The pleasure of coming
                  home:—who has not felt it? What other is like it? Is it not a kind of foretaste of
                  that fullness of joy, that awaits those who have a home beyond the skies? This
                  life is, really, only a kind of visit or journey from its sacred bounds, the great
                  object of which is to prepare to return. Our labors, pleasures and sorrows, all
                  hasten away the time, which brings us nearer and nearer there. Mothers and
                  sisters, what makes Heaven so sweet a home? Is it not the influence of the law of
                  love? This law is, in a great measure, at your entire command here. If you would
                  have those dear to you happy in the anticipations of a future bliss, throw around
                  them all the endearments of home. The cultivation of the social feeling well
                  repays the noblest efforts. The heart affections once secured, the moulding of the character will be so influenced,
                  that it can but be in the order of love.
               We sometimes think more of making a stranger happy and at home, than we do those
                  immediately dependent upon us. We think more of making ourselves agreeable, and
                  pleasing those we meet when away from home, than those who mingle with us in the
                  every day walks of life. While these are equally important, and should each
                  receive due attention, the deepest, truest feeling, is that which binds us close
                  to home. 'Tis the enlargement of this feeling that will most richly increase our
                  happiness.
               With this in view as we change the scenes of life, we may influence those we meet,
                  and feel, as we draw near our journey's end, that some will thus secure a welcome
                  home, to pleasures that are lasting, to mansions in the skies.
               We met with Mrs. F. this summer, and we are now reminded of her, as she so happily
                  illustrates the secret of right influence on society. Well remembered is the time,
                  when the impression was made, that she was one of the lovely, gentle spirits with
                  whom we delight to associate.
               'Twas evening, the social circle was formed, and the subject of the different
                  styles of furnishing fashionable mansions was being freely discussed. One
                  mentioned what would be her taste, another how she would arrange; when my friend,
                  Mrs. F., quietly remarked, "I seek no mansion here, but a preparation for one
                  above." Thus, without apparent intention, a very judicious turn of the
                  conversation was effected, and its continuance was profitable to all interested.
                  For days we were together, and I found a constant desire of preparation for the
                  future pervaded her manner. 'Twas affliction that had thus drawn her whole soul
                  heavenward, and the promise of reunion with dear, departed friends, was her star
                  of hope. She exemplified the Christian character, among the gay and wealthy, with
                  such sweet simplicity, that all could but love to be with her.
               Those who feel that reserve in society is most consistent, would from her learn
                  that thus a large sphere of usefulness was abandoned.
               Many here find that talent is required in a measure of no mean proportion to the
                  success which may be attained, and the extended influence of one gentle spirit,
                  who can tell?
               Wherever we are, an influence may be exerted; and as we meet, at home and abroad,
                  those who are lovely in character, and example, but feel we too soon are called to
                  part, how delightful to anticipate the time, when all the congenial spirits of
                  earth, shall meet, and join the universal song of Home for ever.

                  Brighten, never more to shade;

               I MUSTN'T HIT LITTLE HARRY.
               BY ELIHU BURRITT.
               Now, dear children, come and let us have a little chat. I want to talk to you
                  about love, and about loving one another. You all know what love means; for the
                  very least of you can tell how nice it is to be loved, and how uncomfortable you
                  feel when any one is angry with you. Now, I want you always to remember that you
                  should love one another. I will tell you a little story.
               I was looking out one fine evening in May, when the trees were just coming out,
                  and looking so bright and green, and I was listening to the birds singing their
                  evening hymn; and I thought how beautiful all things are upon it. Don't you love
                  May, with its green fields and trees, and its sweet singing birds, the cuckoos,
                  and the blackbirds, and the nightingales; and its pretty flowers, the cowslips,
                  and the lilies of the valley, and the May blossoms?
               As I was standing, and looking, and thinking, I saw three little boys at play, and
                  I listened to hear what they were saying. Two of them were brothers, and the other
                  was a little neighbor, and they seemed to be playing at knocking each other with
                  sticks. I don't think that a very pretty game, do you? Now, George, the elder of
                  the brothers, was patting his little brother very gently, so that it did not hurt
                  him, when their little playfellow said, "Hit him hard, George, like that," at the
                  same time striking hard on a post.—"No," said George, "I musn't hit little
                  Harry."
               I dare say his mother had told him not to hurt his dear little brother, and, like
                  a good boy, he did as he was bid: besides—I expect he loved him too much to do
                  anything that would hurt him.
               I should like you to think of this little story, when you feel inclined to be
                  angry with your little brothers and sisters, and schoolfellows; for it is a sad
                  thing to see little children fighting. And when you grow up to be great men and
                  women—and great and good I hope many of you
                  will some day be—I trust you will still remember that you "musn't hit little
                  Harry."
               You have been told, no doubt, that our blessed Saviour, when he was on earth, was
                  very meek and gentle, and we ought to endeavor to be like him. He said we are to
                  "love our enemies," to be good and kind to others, even if they are not kind to
                  us.
               Now, all the people who live on the earth are of one great family. The English and
                  the French, the Russians and Turks, are all brothers and sisters. Is it not, then,
                  a sad thing to see these fighting, and to hear of nations going to war, as they
                  call it, when we know that all the men who do so are acting contrary to the
                  commands of their Saviour.
               I hope you will try to do as he told you, and then you will never fight while you
                  are boys, and never be at all likely to become soldiers, and fight when you are
                  men.
               I think if all mothers had always taught their little children that they must not
                  fight—that they "musn't hit little Harry"—there would not have been so much
                  suffering in this beautiful world, but a great deal more happiness in it.
            
            
               DOMESTIC DUTIES.—The most minute details of household economy become elegant and
                  refined, when they are ennobled by sentiment. To furnish a room is no longer a
                  common-place affair, shared with upholsterers and cabinet-makers; it is decorating
                  a place where I am to meet a friend or a lover. To order dinner is not merely
                  arranging a meal with my cook; it is preparing refreshments for him whom you love.
                  These, necessary occupations, viewed in this light by a person capable of strong
                  attachments, are so many pleasures, and afford her far more delight than the games
                  and shows which constitute the amusements of the world.—

               HUDSON AND THE CATSKILLS.
               THE city of Hudson derived its name, as did the noble river on which it lies, from
                  Hendrick Hudson, a bold European discoverer, who, on the 16th of September, 1609,
                  anchored at this spot. In 1783, a company of men from Nantucket and Rhode Island,
                  among whose names we find Jenkins, Coffin, Minturn, Thurston and Greene, bought
                  the site of the town, and two families commenced the settlement. With such energy
                  was it carried on, that, three years after, it contained fifteen hundred
                  inhabitants, and could boast of a charter, and all the rights and privileges of an
                  incorporated city. For many years its prosperity was increasing, but the embargo
                  and war of 1813 completed the work of stagnation, which the British orders and
                  French decrees commenced.
               The site of Hudson is naturally one of the most beautiful on the eastern shore of
                  Hudson river. In front of the principal street is a promontory projecting into the
                  river in a bold cliff, whose summit reaches more than fifty feet above the surface
                  of the water. It has been formed into an agreeable promenade commanding a charming
                  view of the town of Athens and the country on the opposite shore, bounded by the
                  distant Catskills, which blend with the nearer hills of Rorabuch or Mount Morino;
                  while at your feet is seen the Hudson River Railroad, winding its way along on
                  either bay which surrounds the promontory. On a summer night this is an enchanting
                  spot. The mountains stand grey and shadowy in the moonlight, the river swollen
                  into a lovely expanse or bay, bearing silently along the white sails of numberless
                  vessels, or gracefully yielding to the more noisy impetuous steamer, while the
                  city of Hudson behind you, lies wrapped in a profound slumber.
               The Kaatsbergs, Catskills, or Cat River mountains, seen in the back ground of our
                  picture, are so called from the great numbers of catamounts which formerly
                  infested them, and which even now are found in some parts of the interior, with
                  the bear, the wolf, and the deer. These
                  mountains form a part of the Appalachian range that extend from Maine to
                  Georgia.
               Near the summit of the "Middle mountain," on a large table rock, stands the
                  "Mountain House," a spacious and magnificent hotel, nearly one hundred and fifty
                  feet in length. A few feet in front of this house yawns a frightful precipice,
                  reaching far down among crags and rocks, shaded by the richest verdure. The view
                  from this spot is most enchantingly beautiful. An immense landscape is spread out
                  before you. the Hudson is seen in the picture winding its silvery stream through
                  hill and dale, while on either side you discover an endless variety of forests,
                  cities, farms, lakes and rivers, bounded on the right by the highlands of
                  Connecticut and Massachusetts, and on the left by the Green mountains of
                  Vermont.
               At sunrise the spectacle is awfully grand and imposing. The entire landscape is
                  enveloped in a dense white vapor, which, as the sun ascends, assumes every variety
                  of shape and color, and gradually arising reveals the fascinating loveliness which
                  it had so completely eclipsed. Here the pen fails to give any adequate
                  description. One must witness it, to appreciate the magnificent grandeur of such a
                  scene! Nature must make her own impression. When our words of delight are
                  exhausted, and we have even coined new ones, we fail to convey to the
                  most lively imagination any just conception of its beauties.
               About two miles from the Mountain House, over a circuitous road of Nature's own
                  paving, are the Kauterskill Falls. The Kauterskill is a small stream formed by the
                  outlet of two lakes, which lie basking in the sunshine on the top of this huge
                  mountain. The scenery here is picturesque and wild in the highest degree. The
                  stream descends a steep ledge of rocks one hundred and eighty feet, and then
                  glides along in numerous rills to a second fall of eighty feet, only to rush on,
                  on, on, over rock and crag into the deep ravine below. After descending by several
                  flights of steps to the foot of the first fall you enter a vast natural
                  amphitheatre. A huge rocky shelf projects from the mountain seventy feet above
                  your head, under which you may sit and refresh yourself beneath its grateful
                  shade. While standing there one is reminded of the prophecy in reference to our
                  Saviour, where he is represented as "the shadow of a great rock in a weary land,"
                  and can fully realize the great beauty of the analogy. Far above your head extends
                  the smooth rock; before you, leaping from the immense height, you see the sheet of
                  white foam glittering in the sunshine, as it breaks into innumerable sparkles
                  before reaching the rocks at your feet, while far beneath, the deep ravine, with
                  its rugged clefts, teems with magnificent vegetation. Descending still farther,
                  you reach a moss-covered rock on the opposite side of the stream, which you have
                  crossed the third time, leaping from rock to rock over the panting waters. Here
                  you sit and wonder and admire, in full view of the entire cascade. You are in a
                  kind of dream-land—a sort of half twilight, with here and there a sunbeam,
                  catching a glimpse of the streamlet, which, like yourself, is awed into silence by
                  a look at the giddy height from which it has just fallen. On either side huge
                  rocky walls seem to reach the very heavens, covered with the wildest
                  shrubbery.
               In this dell is laid the scene of Irving's legend of Rip Van Winkle, the
                  indentation of the stone on which his head is said to have rested during his
                  twenty years' sleep, is shown to visitors, as well as the tree which, in its
                  growth during that time, had lifted his gun far above his head.
               In winter, this spot is said to be one of rare beauty. From the top of overhanging
                  rocks and precipices, immense icicles reach to their base like so many marble
                  columns, while the leafless shrubbery and luxuriant evergreens become crystalized
                  with the frozen spray, and sparkling and glistening in the sunshine, present a
                  scene of surpassing splendor. Bryant, who had the rare fortune to visit these
                  falls in winter, wrote an interesting legend, of which the following is the
                  preface.
               
                  
                     "'Midst greens and shades the Kauterskill leaps,
                     From cliffs where the wood-flower clings;
                     All summer he moistens his verdant steeps,
                     With the sweet bright spray of the mountain springs;
                     And he shakes the woods on the mountain side
                     When they drip with the rain of autumn tide.
                  
                  
                     "But when in the forest bare and old,
                     The blast of December calls,
                     
                     He builds in the starlight clear and cold,
                     A palace of ice where his torrent falls,
                     With turret and arch, and fret-work fair,
                     And pillars blue as the summer air.
                  
                  
                     "For whom are those glorious chambers wrought
                     In the cold and cloudless night?
                     Is there neither spirit, nor motion of thought,
                     In forms so lovely and hues so bright?
                     Hear what the gray-haired woodmen tell,
                     Of this wild stream and its rocky dell."
                  
               
               There are many other points about these mountains which present the choicest
                  scenery, filling the soul with profound adoration, as with the Psalmist we
                  exclaim, "Oh! that men would praise the Lord for his wonderful works." The route
                  through the "Clove" or "Cleft Cloof" as the Dutch call it, is prolific with the
                  most charmingly variegated landscape that can possibly be imagined. Very few of
                  the numerous visitors either ascend or descend by this route, it being longer and
                  very steep, but the road is good, and rendered perfectly safe by well regulated
                  coaches and experienced drivers. No one should fail to take this route one way. A
                  narrow road winds along the base of towering cliffs on one side, while on the
                  other side are seen deep and fearful abysses, whose silence has never been broken
                  by the sound of human footsteps. There, in the impenetrable shade of the most
                  luxuriant foliage, the deepest evergreens, the mountain stream leaps from rock to
                  rock, or expands at leisure into a smooth, quiet lake, undisturbed by the oar,
                  untamed by the mill dam.
               It is in vain to attempt a description of this "Fairy land of the Hudson," one
                  only becomes discouraged, and lays down the pen to sigh over the poverty of
                  language. To go and see for yourself, is the only way to get a true conception of
                  these Appenines of America.

               WHICH SHOULD RULE?
               BY MRS. S. E. PHELPS.
               I THINK it is impossible for any one but a parent, to realize the intense and
                  unutterable depths of love that we mothers feel for our children. It is a very
                  trite saying, and like most such, a very true one, that it is wisely ordered by
                  Divine Providence that the maternal instinct should be so powerful, lest
                  otherwise, the great care and fatigue, and wear of the mind and body which their
                  needs require of us, would be insupportable.
               A vast deal is said in poetry of a mother's love, and we see the most timid
                  creatures among the lower order of animals, become brave in defence of their
                  young; the most ferocious, tender and gentle in their care. But what pen could
                  ever begin to portray the searchless oceans of yearning love, that surge up in the
                  Christian mother's heart! These bewitching little prattlers! How is it that they
                  manage to entwine themselves so inextricably in the innermost fibres of our souls?
                  The philosophy of maternal love! Can anybody analyze its wonders? To me it is a
                  perpetual mystery. All other attachments require time for their growth and
                  development, but how many hours' acquaintance does it take to render this love
                  stronger than death?
               And yet there is one way in which this intense attachment creates evil and danger,
                  if not sedulously watched. Such affection, of course, produces intense desire for
                  the happiness of the little one, and an earnest longing to avert from it every
                  possible suffering. If this feeling be not wisely regulated, it is the origin of
                  immense peril.
               The child is guilty of some act, which the mother is conscious merits punishment.
                  But it wrings her heart to inflict it. How can she bear to witness its distress,
                  its sobs and tears, and chase all the joyousness from its little heart? So she
                  reproves a little, so very gently that no effect whatever is produced upon the
                  child. The same thing is repeated over and over again. Sometimes the little treasure is not altogether well,
                  or children of her acquaintance are taken by the angel of death. The poor mother
                  realizes with unusual clearness by how uncertain a tenure these little lives
                  hang—lives that are more precious to her than her own. The bare thought of such
                  desolation in her happy nest, is utterly insupportable, and as she gazes on the
                  tender forms and reflects upon the fearful possibility encompassing them, oh, how
                  sombre are the shadows that dim her loving eyes! Then the just exertion of
                  authority seems too harsh, and the infliction of needed chastisement plunges an
                  arrow in her own quivering heart.
               Perhaps grave correction is called for just as the little one is going to rest.
                  Conscience and reason both demand that it be done. But she recollects often
                  hearing or reading of children being seized with sudden and fatal disease in the
                  night, and never recognizing the parents again. Why may not that unechoing tread
                  be directed to her door as well as to others? How dreadful to have
                  the last memories associated with punishment! There may be wisdom enough in her
                  head to subdue this morbid weakness, but there is not firmness enough in her
                  heart, and so the child conquers. Is not all this a temptation of the devil?
                  Certain it is that multitudes of children in Christian families grow up with their
                  evil nature unsubdued, the will unbroken, despising the weak show of parental
                  authority, selfish, useless and unlovely, if no more. No one of ordinary
                  observation will pretend to dispute this, or to deny that it is a tremendous evil,
                  involving the most serious consequences to the church and to the world.
               Now is there no remedy for all this? What indurating process shall we mothers
                  undergo? God forbid that we should love these little ones any less than we do; but
                  oh! let this love be held in abeyance to the great Parent, and let reason and
                  sound judgment sit at the helm.
               Excessive scrutiny with a child is unspeakably to be deprecated, but we all know
                  that however the case might have stood formerly, the tendencies of the present are
                  altogether of an opposite character. If such cases exist at all in Christian
                  families, they are of so very rare occurrence as to be accounted a curiosity.
               Let us suggest a few thoughts as remedies for the evil.
               The first ought to be all sufficient, without any other consideration. It is
                     the express command of Jehovah, repeatedly enforced, that we should
                  maintain our authority over our children, and when needful, inflict punishment.
                  This is as unequivocally enjoined upon us as the practice of any other Christian
                  duty. Therefore we disobey at our peril. What if it is painful to our feelings?
                  Are we not expressly forewarned that religion often requires self-denial and
                  cross-bearing? Undoubtedly this is one of the instances. What right have we to set
                  up our blind love for our children in defiance of the infinite Parent?
               The child early taught submission to its human parents is far more likely to yield
                  to the great Father of spirits, and thus be rendered safe and happy forever. How
                  inconsistent to intreat God to subdue that stubborn will, which we have only
                  fostered and strengthened!
               It is also cruelty to the children's happiness in this world to
                  abdicate the seat of authority in which God and nature have placed us. They will
                  not always be brooded under our sheltering wings, nor their faults pass under our
                  gentle censorship. A harsh world is before them. Shall they be sent out vulnerable
                  at every point?
               If we would possess the love of our children it is indispensable to
                  gain their respect. We never love the great Father until we have learned to fear
                  him and recognize his just authority over us. Those parents who are tenderly
                  beloved by their children, are not the weakly indulgent, who have taught their
                  little ones to trample on their commands with impunity.
               God has revealed himself to us as our Father, and assured us that his love to us
                  poor wayward children, is infinitely tenderer and stronger than we can possibly
                  conceive of. Does he, therefore, suffer us to go on altogether in our own way
                  without chastisement or denial? Does he ever abate one iota of his just authority
                  towards the children he loves with illimitable tenderness? Let us strive to
                  imitate him.
            
            
            
               
               OLD-FASHIONED EDUCATION.
               IT will never do to give up religion as a part of education. There is too intimate
                  a relation between the two, to separate them. Of what use would be the hills and
                  mountain ranges, if there were no streams and creeks and rivers springing from
                  their sides, and watering all parts of our fertile country? And of what use would
                  be learning, even though it towered up and reached the most sublime elevation to
                  which man can ascend, if it were not blessed with the fountains of living water,
                  and the streams which gladden the vale of our pilgrimage.
               Another principle of education, well tested by experience, is the necessity of
                     thoroughness in the whole work. This is a principle, in the
                  carrying out of which "the old folks" were "at home." Drilling, memorizing rules,
                  short lessons, frequent reviews, hard studying, &c., were the methods approved
                  in the sending forth of many a fine scholar. The grammar was the secular Bible of
                  good old times. Orthography, Etymology, Syntax, and Prosody, meant something in
                  those days. The new analytical method of Ollendorff & Co., is very popular in
                  the market just now; and although it professes great achievements at the
                  beginning, it is found to be rather superficial at the end. There is, in fact, no
                  substitute for the patient mastering of the rudiments.
               Education demands time. The modern promise of mastering a language in six or eight
                  lessons is as great a practical lie as a reformer ever told without knowing it.
                  The thing is an impossibility. The learning of a language requires a knowledge of
                  its elements, its principles, its radical parts; and this knowledge cannot be the
                  work of a day. Parents often expect too much. An apparently rapid progress is apt
                  to be at the expense of substantial acquisition. And besides, the new method of
                  acquiring languages supersedes, in a measure, that excellent mental discipline,
                  which is often the best part of the whole work. We cannot expect oaks to grow up
                  in a season; they must root themselves thoroughly; then shoot up in modest
                  progress; and, disciplined year after year by rain, rude wind, frost, and
                  sunshine, they finally become majestic with branch and shade.
               The natural difficulties in a thorough course of education are of great use. The
                  modern way of explaining everything in the classics by notes and special
                  dictionaries, is debilitating. The more you indulge a child, the less can you
                  commonly make of him. It is a well known principle that adversity strengthens
                  character. The adversity of a hard lesson has been blessed to many a scholar, who
                  was, doubtless, ignorant of its use at the time. Easy textbooks make shallow
                  students. Smooth roads on a dead level, tire and wear out horses much sooner than
                  the hills on your national road; and therefore a sensible driver prefers a hilly
                  route, out of mercy to his team. Can he be a sensible teacher, who gives his
                  scholars no severe drilling, no hard tasks, no steep ascents? Education, as I
                  intimated, must be perfected amidst the trials and discouragements and blessedness
                  of labor. It must have time. It must be thorough in its methods in order to
                  produce thorough scholars. And who would give up thoroughness in the training of
                  the rising generation?

               A DREAM.
               
                  
                     "I had a dream, it was not all a dream."
                  
               
               I STOOD by a broad sheet of water. Gay and sparkling were the blue waves, kissed
                  by the beams of the clear sun, as, with gentle undulations, they wafted
                  innumerable barques that lay upon their bosom. Entranced with the beautiful sight,
                  I stood gazing with delight upon the fairy boats and their happy occupants. I
                  stretched not my gaze beyond, or looked to either side; but my enraptured vision
                  revelled in the scene before me. Suddenly a bright angel stood beside me, with
                  most benignant aspect. "Mortal," said he, "why gazest thou alone upon the scene
                  before thee? Knowest thou that this beautiful bay is but the inlet of a vast and
                  fathomless ocean beyond?" I followed the glance of my companion, and perceived
                  that the sheet of water before me was
                  but a large bay, emptying into a dark ocean, whose mad surges swallowed up every
                  little barque that came within their power. Then I perceived that many, who were
                  sporting upon the bosom of the bay, with music and mirth, ere they were aware,
                  were borne on its placid waves to the ocean beyond, and buried amid the angry
                  waters, and few indeed ever regained the bay. Everything before me now wore a new
                  aspect. Instead of revelling in the beauty of the scene, I gazed in unutterable
                  agony and suspense on the gay throng of happy beings before me. Then I closed my
                  eyes, as if to shut out the terrible danger that threatened them; then turning
                  wildly to my companion, I said:
               "Can nothing be done to save them? Must they all inevitably perish?"
               "Form not a rash judgment," said my guide, "look again, and examine more
                  closely."
               Then I saw that some of the barques were attached to small, but strong cords,
                  which extended in an opposite direction from the frightful ocean; and, turning, I
                  perceived at my right hand a pier, to which the cords were fastened.
               "Is this a sufficient security?" said I, turning to my friend, with a cold
                  shudder.
               "Firm as the Rock of Ages," he replied; "but look again."
               Then I saw that of all the boats, few had not some slight cord, which appeared to
                     them as a security, and I discovered that all round the shore were
                  innumerable piers, with a fair outward seeming, but underneath they were crumbling
                  to atoms; and although some of them might appear to afford sufficient security
                  while the frail vessels lingered near them, as they neared the ocean, and the
                  tension of the cord became great, it suddenly snapped asunder, and they were
                  precipitated with awful velocity into the floods.
               Overwhelmed with the sight of so many immortal beings recklessly rushing to ruin,
                  I turned to examine the ancient pier, which had stood the accumulated wrath of so
                  many storms, and the fury of so many tempests, and by each shock had become but
                  more firmly imbedded in the rocks of its foundation.
               As I looked I perceived a beautiful boat, bearing two lovely children. Smiles and
                  dimples wreathed their faces, and their sunny locks were waved from their fair
                  temples by every passing breeze. Their hearts seemed filled with joy, as they
                  caressed each other, and sang in sweet harmony, "Little children, love one
                  another." One hand of the little sylph was dipped in the blue water, with the
                  other she clung confidingly to her brother. It was a sight for angels to look
                  upon. With inexpressible delight I saw that their fragile boat was fastened to the
                  ancient pier, and I thought I saw floating above them, in the azure distance, a
                  form of angelic beauty.
               Then I perceived a mystic looking man, who was moored close by them, and I saw the
                  little ones stretching out their arms to him, and sending kisses to him over the
                  laughing waters, and I knew that he was their father. By his gaze of earnest
                  affection, and his eager smile, as they sung in their joy, I knew his love for
                  them was intense. I looked to see if he too was securely fastened to the pier.
                  Then I saw that the cord which held him was insecurely fastened, and that many of
                  the strands were untwisted, so that its strength was rapidly diminishing, and
                  unless some new security were added, the first heavy wind might leave him without
                  a support.
               As I looked he produced a heavy sledge, and began with strong blows to batter the
                  ancient pier.
               "What are you doing, my friend?" said I, earnestly.
               "I am trying the strength of this old pier," he coolly answered.
               "But," said I, "it has stood for ages, and been proved beyond a doubt to be secure
                  as the throne of the living God."
               "Yes," he answered, "that is the very reason why I try it. It is antiquated, and
                  perhaps rotten by this time. It may have been a firm security for my fathers, and
                  yet not be so for me and my children." As he spoke, some large flakes of moss and
                  pebbles, the accumulation of centuries, were separated by his strokes, and fell
                  with a heavy plash into the water below.
               "See," said he, with animation, "I have already begun to discover its
                  rottenness."
               "But," said I, "you have but to look carefully to be convinced that what you have
                  loosened was not a part of the structure: and see, where you are now directing
                  your blows you must inevitably
                  dissever, not only the cord which binds you, but that which fastens
                  the boat of your children."
               "I have no fear," he answered, "if I loosen it, let them fasten it again to this,
                  if they feel confidence in it, or to some of the others, which are more modern,
                  and perhaps more safe. I would not have them fasten to this pier,
                  because I did, even were I myself convinced; let them judge for
                  themselves."
               "But," I urged, "if they are loosed from here they may never be able again to
                  secure themselves, and this may be the only one that is safe, do not,
                     do not loosen them."
               "I have no intention particularly to loosen them," he said, still aiming blow
                  after blow directly where their cord was fastened, "but I must try whether this
                  antiquated pier, so long revered, is worth trusting. The age is progressing, old
                  things must yield to new;" and again he vigorously plied his sledge.
               The cord was suddenly severed, the dancing boat was borne rapidly on towards the
                  boiling surge. "Dear brother," said the little one, "our boat sails
                     so swiftly, are we not in danger?"
               "Oh, no," answered the boy, "father knows, he will do all right," and again they
                  sung. The father knew not their danger, he was redoubling his blows, and as he
                  heard the loud reverberations, he seemed to suppose he had loosened the
                  foundations. Alas! misguided man, he but loosened the few remaining strands, and
                  was borne, with his weak implement, on, on to the ocean.
               I cast one shuddering glance. The children, clasped in each other's arms, were
                  being overwhelmed, and the wretched father, now fully aware of all the danger to
                  himself and little ones, in vain struggled to avert the terrible catastrophe.
                  Suddenly I awoke, and my heart said, "Seek for the old paths," "Lead me to the
                  rock that is higher than I," "What shall the righteous do if the foundation be
                  destroyed!" and my prayer arose, "Oh! Heavenly Father, suffer not parents blindly
                  to lead their children to ruin."
               
                  L. B. M.
               
            
            
               HOME.
               
                  O, SACRED word! how oft doth creep
                  Its cadence on my ear,
                  When I compare my lot with those
                  Who have no home to cheer,
                  While passing through life's thorny maze;
                  They face the world alone,
                  But I've a friend to lean upon,
                  Within mine own sweet home.
               
               
                  A counselor, a guide I have,
                  Who will not lead astray,
                  And we, unitedly, to God
                  Our daily tribute pay,
                  For all His care, and kindness, too,
                  Which He to us has shown,
                  In giving us such treasures rare,
                  Within our own sweet home.
               
               
                  He gave us first a darling son,
                  Who woke new notes of love
                  Within our heart's deep cells, which ne'er
                  Before were bid to move.
                  A happy trio band were we,
                  We did not wish to roam,
                  But found true joy and happiness
                  Within our own sweet home.
               
               
                  Time passed away; how rapidly—
                  We scarcely knew 'twas gone!
                  When another nestled on our breast,—
                  'Twas on a winter's morn,
                  When first she came to us,
                  A pure, a precious loan
                  From God's own hand, which He had sent
                  To dwell in our sweet home.
               
               
                  And oh! may we, my love and I,
                  Forget not whom we owe
                  Such debt of gratitude and praise,
                  While we remain below.
                  
                  And may it ever be our prayer,
                  That grace to us be given,
                  To train our little darling ones
                  For a sweeter home in heaven.
               
            
            
               SYMPATHIZE WITH CHILDREN.
               YES! we would repeat it, sympathize with them, with deep and sincere sympathy,—not
                  of that morbid kind which runs to pick up a stout boy who has tripped and fallen
                  upon the sitting-room carpet, and lies roaring lustily for assistance, for of that
                  there is quite enough.
               Too much pity expressed for mere physical suffering of a trifling nature, makes
                  boys cowardly, and girls whining and nervous; but there is a sympathy of another
                  and a higher kind, which is too often wanting on the part of those who have the
                  education of the young, we mean that sympathy which shares in the child's
                  pleasures, griefs, hopes, and aspirations. The world-hardened, the sordid and
                  selfish may live without sympathy, but the child cannot. If it is
                  denied him in his home, he will seek it elsewhere.
               The father who meets his little daughter with indifference when she shows him the
                  successful result of some childish effort, and coldly replies, "it does well
                  enough," may yearn in vain for that daughter's confidence when it is bestowed
                  where no earthly power can withdraw it; or, when the heart, chilled and hardened
                  by indifference, has no love to bestow on him. The mother who sweeps into the fire
                  her boy's first effort of mechanical ingenuity, because it "litters the floor," or
                  who hurries him away to school, when he lingers for a kiss, or a good-bye, with
                  "there's no time to waste in compliments," may, when silver hairs are mingled with
                  the brown, yearn in vain for the kiss new so lightly prized, or sigh at the burial
                  of the "one talent," which might have been rendered back with usury.
               The hardening process commenced by a chilling indifference in childhood, will go
                  on, imperceptibly at first it may be, but none the less deep and sure; or else the
                  impetuous affections turned from the course of their proper development into other
                  channels, will rush on like the mountain torrent which has broken from its
                  original course, marking its new path, by wasting and destruction.
               Would you have the boy love and confide in you as he approaches manhood? would you
                  have him treasure your advice, and value your precepts? Give him your sympathy now
                  in his mental wants, his plans, his hopes; commend him for his perseverance in
                  mastering a difficulty, be it what it may; appreciate the effort he makes, even
                  though he fail, and when he is heartsore with disappointment, sympathize while you
                  strengthen him for new effort.
               The griefs of childhood are as great in proportion to the ability to bear them as
                  the griefs of mature years, and the child mourns as keenly for the time being,
                  over the destruction of a favorite toy, or a successful design, as in youth over a
                  blighted hope. The world has in it none too much of love, none too much of
                  sympathy; let us all seek to add to these lighteners of human misery our quota,
                  however small, nor forget that we ourselves were once children.
               A CONTRIBUTOR.
            
            
               THE EYES.
               THERE is a popular notion, sanctioned even by medical men, who ought to know
                  better, that the eyes are preserved by opening them, every morning, in a basin of
                  cold water. Some of the worst cases of petergioum, or film on the surface of the
                  eye, have been witnessed in those who have boasted of this practice. When water
                  gets into the windpipe, the nostrils, or the ears, irritation is produced; and
                  when the eyes are opened under water, the sensation is anything but agreeable. The
                  eye is lubricated by a secretion admirably adapted to facilitate the motion of the
                  lid over its surface, and as this secretion is partially soluble in water, it is
                  as inconsistent with common sense to wash it away, as it is to remove the oil from
                  the wheels of machinery. It is, unquestionably tionably, important that the cleanliness of the
                  organ be maintained; yet this may be accomplished in the usual manner, without
                  opening the lubricating surfaces. When the secretion is vitiated by cold or other
                  causes, quince seed tea or milk and water are preferable for ablution to water
                  alone. Avoid eye waters, many of which contain lead, and there are ten chances to
                  one, they will produce an incurable film. To make this clear, dissolve a little
                  sugar of lead in water, and pour the transparent solution in a wine glass,
                  containing a water solution of common salt. When the fluids are mixed, a white
                  precipitate of chloride of lead falls to the bottom of the glass. When eye waters
                  containing lead are permitted to pass to the surface of the eye, the tears furnish
                  salt, and the lead is precipitated. The transparent portion of the eye is
                  sometimes extensively tattooed with this white leaden powder, and vision becomes
                  indistinct, even destroyed.
               When the general health is robust, it is astonishing what an amount of labor the
                  organs of vision will endure; yet when it is depressed, especially, by mental
                  disturbance during a periodical function, they are easily deranged by too close
                  application to business. When they have become weak, much of their preservation
                  depends upon the proper management of light to which they are exposed. When the
                  light is in excess it should be diminished, and when it is deficient labor should
                  be discontinued. The light blue of the sky and the verdure of the fields are the
                  colors to which the organ of vision is naturally adapted, and which it will endure
                  with the most ease. The flame of a good oil lamp is more regular than that of gas
                  or candles, and is therefore to be preferred. The intermitting flickering of gas
                  is particularly injurious, as it produces constant contraction and dilations of
                  the pupil, and undue exercise of the whole organ. By placing a shade of light blue
                  tissue paper over the lamp the light is ameliorated, for artificial light contains
                  a superabundance of the yellow and red rays, but is deficient in the violet. By
                  allowing it to pass through the bluish medium, it approaches nearer to the light
                  of day, and is better adapted for continued application of the organ of
                  vision.
            
            
               WHAT A SAVIOUR!
               BY REV. A. S. PATTON.
               
                  
                     
                        "Wherefore He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto
                           God by Him."
                     
                     —Heb. 7: 25.
                  
               
               RIGHTLY to direct a soul, when awakened to a sense of its guilt and danger, is one
                  of the most solemn and responsible duties of the Christian pastor. So vast are the
                  interests at stake, and so various, and even diverse, are the exercises of
                  penitents, that more than ordinary wisdom and prudence are demanded, in order
                  successfully to counsel such in the successive and critical stages of their
                  experience.
               There are, I admit, some leading traits in the experience of all sincere
                  inquirers, yet there are also some marked individual peculiarities. The general
                  laws of spiritual influence seem, in most cases, to be accommodated to the age,
                  temperament, and circumstances of the awakened; so that when an individual is
                  brought under conviction, we expect to witness a manifestation of feeling
                  corresponding with the known peculiarities of his character.
               Thus, for instance, it will be found that the same truths that excite in one bosom
                  feelings of irrepressible anguish, will cause another quietly to retire and
                  commune in secret with his own heart. The same influences that constrain one
                  earnestly and wildly to cry, "What must I do to be saved?" will lead another in
                  the silence of his own soul to pray—God be merciful to me a sinner. While one
                  forgets to eat his bread, or moistens it with tears, and mingles his drink with
                  weeping, another who feels the burden of spiritual concern equally great, will be
                  able to conceal his sorrows from the world, and even from his most intimate
                  friends. And let it be remarked, moreover, that in cases like these the counsels
                  and encouragements that would prove all-sufficient for the one, would be found
                  entirely inadequate to the other. In some instances all that seems to be required
                  is simply to direct the inquirer to the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of
                  the world, while in others the mind is so clouded by doubts, and the spirit is so distracted by conflicts,
                  that the most consummate skill, and the most untiring patience are necessary, in
                  order to bring the heart to understand and appreciate what are commonly received
                  as the first and simplest truths of the gospel.
               A striking instance of this last description occurs to my mind in the case of Mary
                  P—. She was a regular and serious attendant upon my ministry at —, and one in
                  whose spiritual welfare many had been led to feel a more than ordinary interest.
                  In the early winter of 1849 the Spirit of God moved upon the hearts of his people
                  in that town, and the result was, a manifestation of general concern for the
                  salvation of sinners.
               Among those who were made the subjects of special and earnest prayer was this
                  young lady; and very soon she was discovered to be under deep conviction of sin.
                  So marked was the change in her deportment and feelings, that no one could fail to
                  notice it. Naturally gay and cheerful, she became at once sober and sorrowful,
                  losing at once all relish for what had before given her greatest enjoyment: she
                  turned away from her most loved associates, and like a stricken swan that leaves
                  the flock to heal her wound, or die alone, she sought to bear as best she could,
                  or soothe her disconsolate spirit in protracted seasons of meditation and prayer.
                  Not that she entirely secluded herself, nor that she was at all averse to
                  receiving counsel; on the contrary, every opportunity was embraced to gain the
                  advice of those whom she believed to be pious and experienced; and beside this,
                  she repeatedly availed herself of the privilege of asking in a silent, but
                  expressive manner, an interest in the prayers of God's people. Still, when at
                  home, most of her time was spent in the retirement of her own chamber, and very
                  sorrowful and distressing were the hours which she thus passed.
               Others, though awakened subsequent to herself, had experienced mercy, and were now
                  rejoicing in hope of eternal life, but alas, to her the prospect seemed to grow
                  more and more discouraging. Nor was this to be wondered at, as the sequel will
                  show.
               In a private conversation had with her pastor just before the appointed hour of an
                  evening service, the great difficulty was mutually discovered—She had been
                     trying to repent in order to come to Christ, instead of coming to Christ in
                     order to repent. A common mon mistake, and oh, how serious a one,
                  turning, as it does, repentance into a kind of obstacle between the sinner and
                  Christ.
               To correct this error she was assured that there would be no virtue in our
                  repentance, even if we could repent of ourselves, to recommend us to the favor of
                  the Redeemer; but that there goes forth virtue from the Redeemer himself,
                  strengthening us for that repentance which is alone genuine and acceptable. And
                  farther, that the Apostle Peter, in declaring the purpose of Christ's exaltation
                  to be that he might "give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins," clearly
                  recognized repentance to be as much a gift of the glorified Christ as forgiveness,
                  and taught the great truth that from him must come the grace of contrition as well
                  as the cleansing of expiation.
               So far the way seemed now to be clear, but immediately another difficulty arose;
                  wicked unbelief suggesting a doubt of Christ's willingness to receive, and his
                  ability to save one so lost and guilty. In this state of mind she left for the
                  sanctuary. During the delivery of the discourse her countenance wore the very
                  aspect of despair, and her case seemed more than ever hopeless. But in that same
                  hour the Saviour was present to comfort and bless. We were closing the meeting
                  with that subduing hymn— 
                     
                        "Come weary sinner, in whose breast
                        A thousand thoughts revolve," &c.
                     
                   And just as we reached the last stanza— 
                     
                        "I can but perish if I go,
                        I am resolved to try," &c.,
                     
                   seeming to catch the full influence of that holy purpose, she cast herself
                  entirely on the mercy of Christ, and, under an instant and glorious discovery of
                  his sufficiency—with clasped hands and streaming eyes, she exclaimed—OH, WHAT A
                  SAVIOUR!
            
            
            
               
               CULTIVATION OF THE IMAGINATION.
               MAN, since the fall, has been prone to err in thought and in action—in duty and in
                  judgment. The manner of mental development, as well as that of fulfilling many
                  other obligations, has been attended with much doubt and perplexity; and in a
                  majority of cases human happiness has been sacrificed by misguided judgment. The
                  mental part of man, no less than the physical, consists of various members or
                  faculties, each of which, in its appropriate sphere, is equally essential to a
                  perfect constitution, and to happiness. To suppose otherwise, would be to charge
                  the Creator with folly.
               If every faculty of the mind is, by the appointment of God, essential to our
                  happiness, then by the same appointment, the proportionate development of each is
                  our duty. It is evident that all the faculties are not of equal importance. Though
                  they are all intended to subserve the same design of our creation, some of them
                  are appointed to the supremacy, while others are to act a humbler part. It is
                  equally evident, that if by our mismanagement we cause any faculty to transcend
                  the limits of its own appropriate sphere, we thus far defeat the design of our
                  Creator concerning us. We diminish our powers of enjoyment, and lose that beauty
                  of symmetry with which the mind was at first characterized.
               If we cultivate a subordinate source of happiness in opposition to a superior, we
                  virtually and effectually reject the superior, and thus do violence to our nature;
                  and as the established laws of nature secure to us the greatest amount of
                  happiness of which we are capable, any violation of these laws must result in
                  diminution of happiness, and of capacity for happiness.
               It then appears that the imagination, being one of the faculties, should be
                  cultivated. But the question arises, in what manner, and to what extent should it
                  be cultivated? Though the imagination is a very active and efficient faculty, it
                  cannot justly assume the supremacy. When well disciplined, it is a powerful source
                  of good. Its office is to assist the other faculties of the mind; to cheer and
                  encourage hope; to enrich and beautify nature.
               
                  
                     "There are moments when the cares of life
                     Press on the wearied spirit; when the heart
                     Is fainting in the conflict, and the crown,
                     The bright, immortal crown, for which we strive,
                     Shines dimly through the gathering mists of earth."
                  
               
               Then it is the prerogative of imagination to tinge hope as with a ray of heavenly
                  light; and pierce the clouds that gather around the darkened hour.
               It imparts to the most rugged scenes of nature an air of pleasing melancholy.
                  Without the aid of imagination, the sculptor, the poet, and the painter, would
                  lose their power to please.
               Addison has very justly said, "a man of a polite imagination is led into a great
                  many pleasures, that the vulgar are not capable of receiving. He can converse with
                  a picture, and find an agreeable companion in a statue. He meets with a secret
                  refreshment in a description, and often feels a greater satisfaction in the
                     prospects of fields and meadows, than another does in the
                  possession. It gives him, indeed, a kind of property in everything he sees, and
                  makes the most rude, uncultivated part of nature administer to his pleasure; so
                  that he looks upon the world, as it were, in another light, and discovers in it a
                  multitude of charms that conceal themselves from the generality of mankind." But
                  this is its effect, only when it is well disciplined; when it has been rightly
                  developed, and made to act in its own sphere. In these two particulars, the mass
                  of minds fail; consequently their imagination tends, not to enrich, but to
                  impoverish them. In cultivating this faculty, they exercise it upon the wrong
                  objects; and are not sufficiently aware of its active and aspiring nature, to keep
                  it within its proper limits. And when this servant of the human faculties gains
                  the ascendency, it becomes a relentless tyrant. Unconscious of its material
                  tenement, it roams in fields of elysian, or reposes on cygnet down in its own
                  etherial palaces. "It cannot brook the low dull round of cold reality."
               Thus, though it is admitted that the imagination should be cultivated, it is
                  evident, that the most unceasing and vigilant care should be taken to exercise it upon such objects,
                  and with such restraints, as will most successfully train it to perform the part
                  for which it was designed by our Creator. The tendency of works of fiction, when
                  read, and contemplated frequently and with pleasure, is, to corrupt and pervert
                  the imagination; to surrender to it undue supremacy, and thus render the reader
                  unfit for the sober duties and realities of life. They winningly infuse their
                  "poison drop into man's purest cup," and none are so slow to see the danger as the
                  victim. When persons, who are much in the habit of reading and contemplating works
                  of fiction, are, by sheer necessity, brought in contact with the stern realities
                  of earthly life, in their own imagination they become the objects of
                  deserved sympathy from all around.
               The perusal of fiction is a prolific source of evil to the imagination. It creates
                  a disrelish for rational and useful reading. The individual who delights in tale,
                  is wakeful and tearful at the midnight hour, over the brave, the noble, the
                  suffering phantasm; while a moral essay, or a few pages on practical piety would
                  be an efficient opiate: and the scenes of Gethsemane, and of Calvary, would not
                  awaken one emotion, or elicit a single tear. They would be to such an one a
                  pithless circumlocution. The social circle of the pious and the grave is
                  intolerable monotony; and the house of religious worship presents a scene of idle
                  vacuity, indefinite wanderings of thought, and the sighings of unsatisfied
                  desire.
               Since God has made nothing in vain, he evidently designed the imagination for some
                  use; and from what we know of his character and works, we have sufficient reason
                  to suppose he designed it should be a source of happiness to us; and since it is
                  the work of his hand, to neglect it would incur guilt. Its cultivation becomes
                  duty; yet but a small number succeed in performing this duty aright. The
                  imagination should be so cultivated as to enable persons 
                     
                        "To commune with their thoughts,
                        With nature's changing bloom—
                        To find a tongue in earth's sweet spots
                        That tells of another home!
                        To find a voice in everything they see,
                        Speaking with a low, sweet tone,
                        The strains of sweetest melody."

               BY MRS. LYDIA H. SIGOURNEY.
               
                  Come gather closer to my side,
                  My little smitten flock,
                  And I will tell of him who brought
                  Pure water from the rock;
                  Who boldly led God's people forth
                  From Egypt's wrath and guile,
                  And once a cradled babe did float
                  All helpless on the Nile.
               
               
                  You're weary, precious ones; your eyes
                  Are wandering far and wide;
                  Think ye of her who knew so well
                  Your tender thoughts to guide!
                  Who could to wisdom's sacred lore
                  Your fix'd attention claim,
                  Ah! never from your hearts erase
                  That blessed mother's name.
               
               
                  'Tis time to sing your evening hymn,
                  My youngest infant dove;
                  Come press your velvet cheek to mine,
                  And learn the lay of love;
                  My sheltering arms can clasp you all,
                  My poor deserted throng;
                  Cling as you used to cling to her
                  Who sings the angel's song.
               
               
                  Begin, sweet birds, the accustomed strain,
                  Come, warble loud and clear;
                  Alas! alas! you're weeping all,
                  You're sobbing in my ear.
                  Good night; go say the prayer she taught
                  Beside your little bed;
                  The lips that used to bless you there
                  Are silent with the dead.
               
               
               
                  A father's hand your course may guide
                  Amid the thorns of life,
                  His care protect those shrinking plants,
                  That dread the storms of strife;
                  But who, upon your infant hearts,
                  Shall like that mother write?
                  Who touch the springs that rule the soul?
                  Dear smitten flock, good night!
               
            
            
               CONVERSATION WITH DEATH.
               WHO desires that familiar acquaintance with Death, that leads to conversation with
                  the grim messenger? His stealthy approach awes us—the wan features—the icy chill,
                  and the hushed stillness that follow wherever he has been—fill the soul with
                  terror. What! sit down, as with a companion, in the presence of that dread
                  something, that makes the loved countenance so pale and ghastly—that causes that
                  look of deep distress, and sends those throes of agony through the frame?—that
                  dims the speaking eye—that cuts the silver chord, and turns the bodies we loved so
                  much, to a decaying mass, which we beg may be buried from our sight?
               When a child, I used to think how very strange the idea contained in those
                  oft-repeated lines of Dr. Watts: 
                     
                        "Stoop down, my thoughts, that used to rise,
                        Converse awhile with death;"
                     
                   and the scenes of all the years that have since intervened, never made me
                  feel their full import so clearly as those through which I recently passed. The
                  providence of God brought me for days and weeks into close communion with the
                  destroyer, where I must watch closely the impress of his finger—where I must trace
                  his secret workings, and feel the force of his utterances of destruction
                  determined upon the objects of my love and care. And I found it good to take
                  lessons of Death—good, for a heart all choked with the cares of the world—good,
                  for affections spellbound bound by earthly attractions—good, for aspirations and
                  desires that had directed their flight away from God and his glory.
               In order rightly to appreciate the things of time, one must take their estimate
                  from death. When standing by the bed where death is doing his strange work on a
                  human form, 
                     
                        "Alas, how poor and little worth
                        Are all the glittering toys of earth
                        That lure us here;"
                     
                   Its pleasures have all vanished—they are phantoms that can render no service
                  there—its riches yield no relief from the death-pangs, neither can they purchase a
                  passport to realms of peace. Its friends must all be left behind; love is of no
                  avail in that dread hour. Jewels cannot please the glazed eye, nor music wake to
                  life the deadened ear. Then it is that all our thoughts, however far they have
                  wandered—our aspirations for earthly distinctions—ambition, hope, love, gayety,
                  mirth—all must stoop to converse with Death.
               And it is good to be there, because thither our feet are surely tending; and how
                  much better to become familiar with him, than in an unexpected moment to fall into
                  the hands of a strange enemy. Yes, we must not only make the acquaintance of
                  death, as he takes one after another from the circle of those we love; but we
                  must, each one of us, "feel his cold embrace," and yield up our life
                  with all its fond associations and endearments—all its tempting pleasures and
                  glittering honors—and lie down in the cold, dark grave, while the
                  immortal spirit—where? oh! where will it go? Say, reader, where will your soul
                  find refuge, when Death tears down its clay tabernacle, and hides it in the
                  dust?
               Come, then, converse with Death, as he now speaks in the sear leaf, and the
                  departing, dying year—as he enters the family circle, and looks on you from the
                  coffin and the opened grave—as he throws his withering wand over sea and land,
                  until scarce a home is found where there is not mourning for the dead! Take the
                  valuation from Death, of the things of time and those of the future state, and
                  decide in his solemn presence the momentous question, whether you choose the path
                  that leads to life—eternal life; or, that of eternal death.
               
                  MRS. M. G. CLARKE.
               
            
            
            
               
               INCONSISTENCY.
               
                  
                     "This ought ye to have done and not to have left the other undone."
                  
               
               "How strange it is, mother! I don't understand it at all. She subscribed ten
                  dollars, last week, to benefit the Dorcas Society."
               "Yes, it is strange, my child," replied Mrs. Moreland; "but I grieve to say that
                  such inconsistencies are far more strange than infrequent. The more you mingle in
                  society, the more you will have occasion to look with wonder upon the
                  incongruities of human nature."
               "O dear, I don't like to anticipate such experience, for the future. What you say
                  makes me think of the poet's words— 
                     
                        'O Life, O Beyond,
                        —thou art strange evermore.'"
                     
                  
               
               "But, mother, why should it be so with Mrs. Pelham? Why should she be so generous
                  to one class of the poor last week, and to day insist upon her seamstress making
                  up that piece of linen for so pitiful a sum?"
               "I cannot divine the reasons of her inconsistency, with certainty, Isabella. But I
                  think thoughtlessness has something to do with it. The claims of the
                     helpless poor have been brought very distinctly before her mental
                  view by those with whom she associates, while the wants and the rights of the
                     industrious poor, have been, to use an old adage, "out of sight,
                  out of mind."
               "But one is as important as the other."
               "Most certainly. The poor seamstress has an invalid mother, and a young sister,
                  dependent for their daily bread almost entirely upon what she can gain by her
                  needle. The reduction of her price was not only most ungenerous, but an act of
                  gross injustice. It is worth much more to make up the linen than Mrs. Pelham has
                  contracted to give."
               "And, very likely, poor Eliza will have to suffer a great deal in consequence. Her
                  mother has but few comforts at the best. I think such meanness as Mrs. Pelham's is
                  shameful. And yet she has the reputation of being very generous."
               "Consistency is a jewel of great worth, my daughter, but as yet, rarely found.
                  There is, however, reason to believe that a better state of things is approaching.
                  Attention has been of late, by many interesting writers, called to the wrongs of
                  the industrious poor, and in many instances with happy results. Several ladies in
                  this street have increased the pay both of their seamstresses and washerwomen. And
                  I am acquainted with a number of clothing merchants, who have resolved to give
                  fair prices for every article of shop-work. So we will hope for better times,
                  Isabella."
               "And in the meantime, I can visit Eliza's mother, and see that she does not want
                  for necessaries."
               "That is right. Our indignation against an evil is not worth much, if we make no
                  effort to lesson its unhappy influence."
               
                  L.
               
            
            
               "LIFE IS NOT ALL SUNSHINE."
               "LIFE is not all sunshine," is the stern teaching of experience. "Would that it
                  were so," is the response of many hearts. Who does not love the glorious sunshine?
                  When, as Aurora throws wide open her golden gates welcoming the "king of day," the
                  silvery moon recedes, and those bright astral lamps, which during the hours of
                  night have lighted up the azure vault, follow in her train, all nature rejoices in
                  the sunshine. How beautiful the sparkling snow-flakes in the sunshine of a
                  winter's morning! How lovely the dawn of day in spring, when the sun awakes the
                  flowery petals amid the sparkling dewdrops, or on the leafy boughs where the
                  feathered songsters warble their notes of praise. Yes, sunshine is always
                  beautiful, and yet what desolation would soon visit the earth were we to have
                  continual sunshine.
               If after the laborer has cast abroad his seed, the sunshine is necessary to ensure
                  a plentiful crop, the dark cloud discharging its watery treasure upon the thirsty
                  earth is none the less so. The plentiful shower is indispensable, and even the
                  thundering storm, the uprooting
                  hurricane, are not wholly messengers of desolation. Yet how perfectly natural to
                  love bright sunny days! and to look upon the howling storm only as an evil that
                  must be endured.
               So we short-sighted, erring mortals, would fain have all our pathway strewed with
                  flowers, and lighted up with the sunshine of prosperity. How hard to believe, when
                  tempest-tossed, that these things shall work together for our good, that they are
                  blessings in disguise. We would desire some milder process by which the dross
                  might be separated from the gold, than that of being cast into the crucible of
                  affliction. We sigh for perpetual sunshine. But our Heavenly Father is wiser than
                  we, and he knows that in order that we may bring forth fruit, "first the blade,
                  then the ear, afterwards the full corn in the ear," we must endure trials. The
                  Lord chastens those he loves; dark clouds often gather round their pathway;
                  earthly hopes are blighted; the grave opens wide its mouth to receive its prey,
                  and hide from sight the forms of those best loved, leaving us to journey on
                  through earth's mazes dark and wild—alone, "where storm after storm"
                  may overtake us, until we are ready to question the goodness of that hand that
                  still guides all, and who will say to the waves that toss us to and fro, "hitherto
                  shalt thou come and no farther."
               Ah! desponding one, raise thine eyes from earth. See that bow of promise spanning
                  you dark cloud. Blessings still await thee. How sweet the sunshine after storm!
                  Thus the eye of faith sees the cherished ones of the bereaved, not
                     lost, but as having become inhabitants of that world where the sun
                  never sets. One after another has joined that blest band, till we feel that there
                  are but few ties to bind us to earth. Our treasure is above. Oh! shall we not
                  bless God for the storm that drives us nearer home. But ho! weather
                  beaten comrades, we have not yet reached the port. Life's mission is not yet
                  fulfilled. Then let us up, and with trusting, thankful hearts move onward.
                  Bereaved ones! fatherless children look up to thee; trust in the Lord and go
                  forward; His promises are ample and sure. Lone orphan wanderer! thy Father still
                  hath need of thee. The trembling form of her that bore thee, and of him that
                  provided for thy early wants, call no more for thy watchful care. They are at
                  rest. The present is thy day of labor. The wide, wide world is the field. The
                  sunshine shine of thy love may rest with genial influence upon many of earth's
                  oppressed and weary ones. Through thy instrumentality the "Sun of Righteousness
                  may arise and shine with healing in his wings" over some dark spot, and souls be
                  won, which shall shine as stars in thy crown of glory. Sigh not then, though life
                  be not all sunshine; but strive rather for that faith which will enable you to
                  rejoice amid the storm, and at last to moor your bark in the haven of eternal
                  day.
               
                  ABBIE.
               
            
            
               DAILY DUTIES; OR, WORK FOR THE WILLING.
               "How provoking it is that she will get up so early! I'm sure there is no need to
                  rise before the sun these cold mornings." Thus soliloquized Kate Harmer as she
                  half opened her eyes and then settled herself for her usual morning doze. But this
                  morning she tried in vain to forget herself in sleep; her mind was in full
                  activity, and these were some of her thoughts, if they had been put into
                  words.
               "If I had some motive for rising early, I could do it as well as Susan, but I find
                  the day quite long enough for the trifles that fill up my day. I wish I had some
                     important duties, then I should be anxious to begin the day, and I
                  should be so active and careful not to waste a moment. If I were a missionary—or
                  if I had even the care of a little sister, then there would be an object in life;
                  but, as it is, I am of no use to any one. Susan and Emily have so many
                  occupations, it is different with them. Susan is the house-keeper and she likes
                  it, so it is no wonder she is cheerful; and Emily is so fond of drawing and
                  reading, that she says the day is never long enough for her; she does other
                  things, such as keeping the parlor and father's office in order, and often goes on
                  errands, but she does all this because she likes it, and says it does her good to
                  bustle about a little after sitting still some hours. Heigh ho! I wish—I could go
                  somewhere—I hardly know what I wish;—but here, I feel I am only a cipher in the
                  family."
               
               After indulging for some time in these unprofitable musings, Kate slowly commenced
                  her morning toilet. She hurried over a short prayer, while the bell was summoning
                  her down to the breakfast room.
               Kate's brow looked so clouded, and she wore so grave an aspect, that her brother
                  could not help (boy-like) teazing her a little about it.
               "Now Kitty what's the matter?" said he, approaching her tapestry frame, "You look
                  as if you had all the affairs of the nation on your mind; say, couldn't you get
                  your curls to turn the right way, or can't you give that dear little poodle's eyes
                  you are making, the proper squint?"
               "I do wish, John, you would let my looks alone, and not interfere with what
                  doesn't concern you. I know you think all that we girls do, is very useless, for
                  you are forever sneering at my work," said Kate, with much pettishness.
               "What a calumny!" exclaimed John, "and to disprove it I will get you to put new
                  wristbands to my shirts, and then you could not be more usefully employed."
               "Emily always attends to your mending, why don't you ask her? I must get this done
                  by New Year's Day and can't be hindered." After saying this Kate turned away to
                  seek some worsted, and her brother went to find Emily.
               Though Kate's tapestry work advanced, and both her sisters were warm in their
                  praises of its beauty, she could not feel satisfied, and got more and more out of
                  humor with herself and everybody, so that Emily's remark that "such work must be
                  very amusing," jarred on Kate's present mood, and she replied,
               "I'm sure I don't, I am getting sick of the sight of it, and if I had
                  not promised it to Cousin Mary, I wouldn't do another stitch to it."
               "Oh! Kate," exclaimed Emily, "you are not in earnest; it will make such a
                  beautiful ottoman, you know how delighted Mary will be to have it."
               "Yes, she will no doubt express pleasure to please me," answered Kate moodily,
                  "and then it will be put in a corner of the best parlor, and be of no use to
                  anybody—a thing that I have been at work on for seven months!"
               "But it will repay you when it is done; you have been bending over it too long,
                  dear Kate, and probably have a headache; let us take a nice walk together, and
                  then you will return to it with more energy," said Emily cheerfully.
               "I have not got a headache, and I don't want you to take a walk just for me; where
                  did you intend going?" asked Kate.
               "Oh!" replied Emily, "my object was to cheer you, and make a little change for us
                  both, as my eyes are a little tired with this stitching."
               "But you said just now that Susan had asked you to make a cake, as she is going
                  out; that will make a change for you; I think there are few things more stupid
                  than to walk along a dull, dusty road; so if you are going, Emily, you must not
                  expect me to accompany you?"
               "No, if you do not wish to walk, there are many things to be done which I will set
                  about this afternoon, instead of to-morrow morning," said Emily, as she left the
                  room.
               "'Many things!' one would think to hear her talk that we had to do our own work;
                  now I wonder what Emily can find to do, to make her so busy this afternoon!"
                  Though Kate allowed this thought to pass through her mind, she did not think it
                  was her duty to follow her sister, and help her to accomplish a few of the many
                  things that had to be done. On the contrary, she contented herself with supposing
                  Emily made herself busy because she liked it.
               About an hour after the foregoing conversation, Mr. Harmer came in, looking much
                  wearied, and throwing himself on the sofa, drew several letters from his pocket
                  which he said he had been writing, and would like some one to copy for him.
               "I will call Susan if you like, father, she always copies your letters," said Kate
                  rising.
               "Well, if she is not engaged, but now I think of it, I remember she said at dinner
                  time she was going out; suppose you were to copy them. I am sure you must be tired
                  of putting your needle in and out of that bit of canvas," said her father.
               Kate slowly began to collect her worsteds together, and then with a sigh asked,
                  "if all those letters had to be copied?"
               "There are only four, and quite short, being business letters, but I believe, Kate, if you will lend me your pen,
                  that I would prefer copying them myself."
               Kate offered no remonstrance, and after giving her father the pen, she resumed her
                  seat.
               Emily, meanwhile, was profiting by Susan's absence, to get all her jelly jars
                  sealed up, and put away, knowing it would be an agreeable surprise to her sister.
                  She had previously made her cake, and ironed several of her own and her sister's
                  muslin collars. She had just filled the sugar bowl, and cut the cake for tea, when
                  her foot slipped as she ran up stairs with both hands full; in her endeavor to
                  save the glass sugar bowl, she fell and injured her ancle so much, that she found
                  it was impossible to rise without assistance.
               Both Kate and her father heard the noise occasioned by Emily's fall, and ran out
                  to see what had happened. Poor Emily smiled through her tears, as she lay
                  prostrate on the stairs, surrounded by bits of cake and sugar. Kate tried to raise
                  her, and at the same time, Emily endeavored to help herself, but fainted in the
                  effort, the agony of her foot was so great. Mr. Harmer lifted her up, and laid her
                  on the sofa, and after sprinkling cold water on her face, she was soon restored to
                  consciousness. Kate was very much shocked at the accident, and shed more tears
                  than Emily, while the doctor bound up her ancle, which put her to much torture;
                  she was forbid to put her foot to the ground for at least a week.
               Kate lay awake a long time that night thinking. She had blamed herself very much
                  for the accident that had befallen her sister, after hearing from Susan how badly
                  Emily had been, and that it was in her haste to get everything done, that she had
                  tripped on the stairs. She felt, and justly too, that she ought to have assisted
                  her. This led her to review her conduct, and to examine herself as she had never
                  done before. She now saw that while she longed for a sphere of greater usefulness,
                  she had wholly neglected the daily duties which belonged to the station in which
                  God had seen fit to place her.
               Before closing her eyes in sleep she had made many good resolutions; she knew it
                  would be a great effort for her to rouse herself, for ever since she left school,
                  which was nearly two years previous, she had indulged these indolent habits. Her
                  mother died when she was very young, but at school she had a kind and faithful
                  teacher, who, while instructing the minds of her pupils, had never lost sight of
                  their immortal souls. Kate had therefore been piously brought up,—she knew that in
                  herself she had no strength to do what is right, but she prayed earnestly to her
                  Heavenly Father, that He would guide her for Jesus Christ's sake. Kate's
                  disposition was naturally amiable, but the unhappy indolent state in which she had
                  been living, had greatly soused it. At the sight of suffering, all her sympathies
                  and good qualities were called out. She determined to try and make Emily's
                  confinement to her room, as little irksome as possible, by devoting herself to her
                  amusement, and by taking upon herself all Emily's self-imposed duties.
               She arose as soon as she heard Susan stirring. On repairing to her room she heard
                  with much sorrow, that Emily had been very feverish through the night from pain,
                  and had hardly closed her eyes. Susan begged her to fetch some vinegar and water
                  to bathe her sister's temples, which throbbed violently. Having done so, Kate went
                  down stairs to attend to Emily's birds, water her plants, and dust the parlors.
                  She felt half inclined to be angry with Margaret, the servant girl, who exclaimed
                  on seeing her, "Why Miss Kate! are you about already? is it so late? for you never
                  come down before Miss Emily has got things in order, and I have breakfast all
                  ready for you." Kate restrained the sharp reply which trembled on her lips, and
                  answered quietly—"Emily's ancle is so much hurt she will not be down stairs for
                  some days, can you tell me where she keeps the dusters?" "Yes, sure, here they
                  are, but let me do that; you are not used to it," said Margaret
                  good-naturedly.
               "It is time I should be used to it," said Kate, smiling, "so give me
                  the duster, and you can get breakfast ready meanwhile."
               Before she had quite finished, Susan joined her, saying Emily was easier, and had
                  dropped asleep. She saw with pleasure how actively Kate was employed, but she
                  judiciously refrained from making any remark upon it. Susan had to go to market
                  after breakfast, and had some necessary shopping to do, so several little culinary
                  matters devolved upon Kate, who performed them cheerfully, but very slowly, for she was unused to
                  such employment.
               The morning slipped rapidly away, so that Kate was astonished when the clock
                  struck twelve. She always thought the mornings were the most tedious part of the
                  day. She was engaged in trifles, it is true, but it is just those trifles that
                  conduce so much to the general comfort. There was a good deal of running up and
                  down stairs to see that Emily was comfortable, and to fetch her books or sewing,
                  or do 
                     any any
                     any
                   other little errand to please her. Though poor Emily was obliged to sit
                  quiet in one place, her thoughts were constantly busy, thinking of this thing or
                  that to be done for her father or brother, or to save Susan's having too much to
                  do; for Susan's health was not very good. She had no sooner expressed a longing
                  that she could jump up and do it, than Kate offered her services and felt happy
                  while thus engaged.
               The next day brought its appointed duties, and Kate went through them much quicker
                  from knowing exactly in what they consisted; and thus was able to put some method
                  into them; besides, she moved about more nimbly as Emily had begged her to come
                  and sit with her as soon as she could, for she found it dull sitting alone as her
                  head ached too much to amuse herself with reading.
               "Shall I read to you, Emily?" said Kate, as she seated herself opposite to
                  her.
               "No, I thank you, I would rather hear you talk, but you ought to have brought your
                  work; do get your ottoman, I shall like to watch its progress."
               "I have put that quite away," replied Kate cheerfully, "and do not intend to put
                  another stitch to it till you are well."
               "Oh! do not say that," said Emily, "for I may be tied to my chair for two weeks.
                  Dr. Graff says my ancle has received a severe sprain, so I must take in a stock of
                  patience."
               Kate left the room for her tapestry work; on returning with it, she said, "I have
                  been looking in your work-basket for the fine piece of linen from which you cut
                  John's wristbands, I wish to stitch a pair before I do any embroidery; so, please
                  tell me where I can find it."
               "No, no, dear Kate, I have stitched three pairs and have the others by me ready
                  cut out; I might as well finish them, for sewing and reading are about all I can
                  do now;" and Emily half suppressed a sigh.
               "I shall do the rest, and for the future, dear Emily, I wish to do my share of the
                  mending; I see your look of astonishment, so I suppose I shall have to tell you
                  that I have resolved to try and be a better girl—I feel that I have been leading a
                  very selfish life; for some time I have felt uncomfortable and restless, and your
                  accident has been the means of showing me why my heart was not at ease, for it led
                  me to examine my conduct; and the result has been as I said before, that I found I
                  have been very, very selfish." As she said this she could not restrain her
                  tears.
               "Dearest Kate, you are too hard upon yourself, I am sure you should not reproach
                  yourself so."
               "I cannot reproach myself too much, and I am thankful that God has opened my eyes
                  to see my folly—it is worse than folly, it is sinful. Last night as I
                  reviewed my conduct for only one day, I was ashamed and grieved to see how selfish
                  I had grown. You did not, perhaps, know that John asked me to alter his
                  wristbands, and I refused, saying it was your business not mine. And then when
                  father asked to have his letters copied, how I avoided doing it by offering to
                  call Susan, who I knew wanted to go out, and then, by my ungracious manner,
                  forcing my poor father (though he was very tired) to copy them himself. And again,
                  I knew very well that you were as busy as you could be, but"—
               "Now you shall not say another word." said Emily gently putting her finger on her
                  lips, "I will not let you rake up so many grievances against yourself."
               "Well I will not say anything more about them, but I shall not
                  promise not to think about them, and I hope my deeds will show that I
                  have thought about my selfishness to some profit, and after you are well I intend
                  to continue to take an active part in the house."
               "The house is so small Susan and I can easily manage it, for I know you want to
                  finish your ottoman and you are not fond of housework, whereas I like bustling
                  about," said Emily, good naturedly.
               "And I," said Kate, laughing, "must learn to like to bustle about, and you and
                  Susan must learn to like to sit still sometimes, and make ottomans, or any other fancy work; you
                  know many hands make quick work."
               The sisters tenderly embraced each other, and then Emily declared herself well
                  enough to read aloud, in their library book, "The Experience of Life," which they
                  knew would be an interesting book when they saw the author's name. They soon
                  became absorbed in it, and drew many a practical hint from that humble, excellent
                  Christian "Aunt Sarah"—whose history it related. Kate's good resolutions were
                  kept, and she daily became more and more necessary to the happiness of each member
                  of her family; and while living for their comfort she promoted her own.
            
            
               I WANT TO GO HOME.
               
                  "I WANT to go home," said a little child,
                  That had lost its way in the forest wild,
                  While the tear that stole down its soft, white cheek,
                  Told far more plainly than words could speak,
                  "I want to go home."
               
               
                  "I want to go home," said a youth, as he roll'd
                  On a bed of pain in the land of gold;
                  "To gaze once more on a mother's face,
                  To be clasped in a sister's fond embrace
                  "I want to go home."
               
               
                  "I want to go home," said a sea-rocked one,
                  As he gazed through his tears on the setting sun;
                  "O hills of my youth! ye will never depart
                  From the pictures that hang on the walls of my heart.
                  I want to go home."
               
               
                  "I want to go home," said an aged saint,
                  "My pulse is feeble, my heart is faint,
                  My friends have all gone to the spirit shore,
                  Welcome the wave that shall carry me o'er.
                  I want to go home!"

               THE NECESSITY OF A WELL DIRECTED MATERNAL INFLUENCE.
               IT is the duty of the preacher and the moralist, not so much to discover new
                  truths, as to proclaim and enforce principles long acknowledged to be of primary
                  importance; and it is well—it is right—to enforce upon each successive generation
                  of mothers, the vast amount of responsibility resting upon them. To the humblest
                  mother is committed an heir of immortality, whom she may train for eternal
                  blessedness, or consign to everlasting woe:—a future member of society, who may,
                  by her care, become useful and happy, a blessing to the family, and to the
                  world;—or she may cherish one who, like a serpent, may first sting the bosom which
                  nourished it, and whose track through life may be marked by blight and desolation.
                  If mothers did but duly estimate the value of maternal influence they could not
                  remain indifferent as to the manner in which they meet the obligations which it
                  impose. If they felt that they were responsible both to their country and their
                  God, for the manner in which they employe it—if they could look down through the
                  long vista of time and eternity, and see that influence deepening and extending,
                  how sacredly would they guard their precious trust—how carefully watch
                  themselves—how prayerfully seek the Divine aid, that the influence daily exerted
                  might be such that they should rejoice to meet it at the bar of God.
               It is the influence of the mother that forms the character of her children. The
                  spirit she habitually breathes, the temper she daily exhibits, the moving
                  principles which actuate her, the ten thousand petty acts of domestic life,
                  perhaps deemed beneath notice, these mould the character of the
                     family,—these, in fact, educate her children. It is not the
                  isolated act—it is not the formal lesson, it is not the grave precept, which forms
                  the character of the man; and our children will become, not what we wish, but what
                  we are. It is wonderful, it is fearful, to see the influence which the mother
                  exerts upon her family; to see how often her children are but miniatures of
                  herself; not as she is in the drawing-room ing-room or the church, but of what she is in the
                  nursery and by the fire-side. Although the influence of the mother is first felt
                  in the family circle, it is not long confined to it. The family is a fountain
                  which will send forth pure streams, to gladden and bless the world; or, if the
                  mother fail in her duties, it may be a noxious pool, which shall spread around
                  miasma and death.
               We have said that it is the influence of the mother which forms the character of
                  her children. The father speaks with the voice of authority. The mother does not
                  continually awe; she soon lays aside the tone which commands; and the sentiment
                  through which she sways is at once pure and elevated, sweet and tender; and her
                  influence is felt long after the authority of the father is withdrawn; and, when
                  the pride of manhood would spurn restraint, often does the influence of the mother
                  fall like the dews of night, or the showers of spring, upon the heart seared and
                  blighted by the feverish passions of life; restoring the freshness of youthful
                  feelings, and reviving the hopes and joys of early life. To every mother, then, is
                  committed an amount of influence, and from the responsibility which it involves
                  she cannot escape. Intelligently or unconsciously she is moulding the characters
                  and deciding the destinies of her children.
               The nature of the influence she exerts must depend upon her own character, and,
                  that it may be salutary, it should be founded on habits of obedience, early and
                  judiciously formed, strengthened by right principles carefully instilled,
                  confirmed by a daily example, in accordance with these principles, and secured by
                  the habitual manifestation of an ever watchful, tender affection. The mother who
                  does not control her children in infancy will never be able to exercise an
                  intelligent influence over them in future life; and the period in which she should
                  secure this power has often passed before she has been aware that it had arrived;
                  and we are sure that observation will justify the remark that no mother can secure
                  the influence she should desire to exert over her children who allows their
                  infancy to pass without forming habits of obedience and respect. Authority, when
                  it is once established, gradually softens into influence, which, when secured by
                  love and confirmed by respect, the mother will retain through life. As she should
                  exemplify in her own deportment the virtues which she wishes her children to
                  possess, she will find it the hardest task in the education of her family, so to
                  guard her own heart, as to conform her life to the precepts by which she would
                  regulate theirs.
               We have said that the influence of the mother should be secured by love. The love
                  which restrains, is greater than that which indulges, and we often do a greater
                  violence to our own feelings in punishing our children than we can by any
                  sacrifices which we make to promote their gratification. But while we are
                  conscious that we are making sacrifices and exertions that prove the depth of our
                  love, we may indulge in a temper which will mar their comfort, and chill their
                  affection, and in giving the higher proof of paternal love, may forget the minor
                  acts which sweeten life and keep the chain of family love bright and firm. And on
                  natural affection must be grafted the kindness and long suffering of the gospel,
                  before the fruits can be joy and peace. The cares and trials which fall so heavily
                  upon mothers during the early years of her children, may make her fretful and
                  impatient, and they may leave her with the impression that they have been regarded
                  as incumbrances, rather than welcomed as blessings; and through all their future
                  life may rather dread than love her.
               Let the mother, then, who desires to exert a controlling influence over her
                  children in future life, make their home and their early years happy, and when
                  they leave her, let them carry with them a deep and abiding sense of a mother's
                  love, of a mother's faithfulness. So shall the influence of the mother bless her
                  family, the church and the world.

                  THE bird which sung so sweet has flown,
                  Its thrilling notes no more we'll hear,
                  A fairer land has claimed its own,
                  And gentler lays 'twill warble there.
                  No more, as seasons pass, 'twill come,
                  To cheer with song the parent nest;
                  
                  No more, in Spring's soft hour, we'll feel
                  The influence which its song possessed.
               
               
                  The voice which waked up memory's chord,
                  Within our home, lies hushed and stilled;
                  Those chords vibrating, deep and strong,
                  With mournful echoes now are filled—
                  That voice with us no more will join,
                  In evening song, and morning prayer;
                  Its joyous notes seem lingering still—
                  Sad contrast to the gloom now here!
               
               
                  Though lost to us, that voice is tuned
                  To nobler songs than earth can give!
                  E'en now, triumphant praise resounds
                  To Him, who died that she might live!
                  To God who gave, then let us bow,
                  If He see best his gift t' recall;
                  Still let our faith unshrinking trust,
                  And feel that love has ordered all!

               THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF MOTHERS.
               BY MRS. P. B. FORD.
               MUCH has been said, and more yet remains to be said, on this subject; and very
                  few, methinks, understand fully and judiciously their responsibilities. The
                  mother's, truly, is a fearful task; and had not the Saviour promised to be her
                  wisdom and guide, she must fail in the attempt of its discharge. Hers it is to
                  direct the path of the nation. Her own finger points her infant son to the star of
                  fame, and by her untiring zeal, he may sit beneath its twinkling light; or, by her
                  neglect, where, oh! tell me, where may she not fear to find him! Perhaps in the
                  gutter by her door, or in yonder prison awaiting the sentence of death, or to drag
                  out a miserable existence. Is this picture, dear mothers, too highly colored? Is
                  it not true? Is not the infant soul committed to your care and keeping? Do you not
                  have the power to mould and fashion its passions as they unfold in your presence?
                  Can you not, like the careful husbandman, direct its tender yet supple branches?
                  You can: by the grace of God, your sons and daughters will fill the desires of
                  your heart, and call you blessed. Then arm yourselves, mothers, and prayerfully
                  discharge your duties—ever leading them by that living example that speaks in
                  after life; removing every thing that will mar their intellectual and moral beauty
                  and growth, until, like the parent stem, they become strong and able to breast the
                  storm of life.
               Do not expect your children to be men and women while they are in the cradle, or
                  prattling by your side. How would old heads look on infant shoulders? "When I
                  became a man," says the Apostle, "I put away childish things." But forget not your
                  position as mothers; take your stand high and holy, and lead them step by step,
                  until you see them men and women, carrying out that important principle, of being
                  good and doing good. Never allow yourselves to fall into that fretful, impatient
                  spirit, which children frequently manifest; but as our Redeemer was to the world, so be ye before your
                  children a pattern for all things.
               True it is that some women feel that their influence could be more generally felt,
                  were it customary for them to act in the public arena of life. But who is prepared
                  to say that she would be honored by it? Would her presence at the polls reflect
                  glory on her character? Would not that spell that binds the unhallowed passions of
                  man in her presence be broken, and would he not treat her with much more
                  disrespect than his fellow-man. And have we not, my sisters, already as much to
                  perform as we can do? What mother does not feel that her domestic cares are
                  already keeping her too long from her nursery? Our children are suffering from
                  this very source, (too much to do,) and the myriads of difficulties that arise in
                  the family circle, or in her absence. When she is there, with the dignity and
                  heart of a mother, every thing moves along in peace and order. A mother at home!
                  how sweet the sound! How delightful to the little children, as they return from
                  school, to know they will find mother at home; and the devoted husband and father,
                  who can describe his fond anticipations as he returns from his toils and cares to
                  the affectionate embrace of his family!
               Then let us be content with the spheres we now occupy, and enjoy the holy quiet of
                  the family circle, and send our sons to act in public duties, well qualified, and
                  with a mother's blessing. Then, dear mothers, you may seek your sons in the
                  legislative hall, or in the sacred desk, and your daughters running on errands of
                  mercy—plucking the thorn from the pillow of pain, comforting the broken hearted,
                  and pointing the wayward to that fountain which was opened in the house of David
                  for sin and uncleanness, and every transgression; and, like many of earth's good
                  and great, they will "bless you with their latest sigh." Are we not blessed with a
                  heaven-born privilege? Who can esteem it lightly to receive to her bosom the newly
                  formed spirit—a glorious charge indeed! Notwithstanding the fearful
                  responsibilities it brings, still the devoted mother receives it with joy.
               Be encouraged then, thou faithful and devoted mother; and although your path in
                  life be strewed with cares, anxieties, and difficulties, the day of your
                  redemption draweth nigh, and your reward will be glorious.
               
                  
                     Still bear your cross, nor lay it down,
                     Until to you is given
                     A many starr'd and sparkling crown,
                     To deck your brow in heaven.
                  
               
            
            
               THE WORLD WE LIVE IN.
               "THE world," is a term applied not only to this "great round ball that seems
                  swinging in the air," as we learned from Peter Parley; but it is often used to
                  imply the inhabitants of this little planet called Earth. To this latter meaning
                  our thoughts seem at present most inclined to turn. The study of human nature is a
                  deeply interesting one, and at the same time, one that is much neglected. This is
                  a curious world, i. e. these curious people in it. Did you ever think
                  of it? What a diversity! As no two are exactly alike in outward appearance, so
                  also no two minds are the same. There is something in each member of the human
                  family that distinguishes them from others. Some seem only created to
                     laugh, others to weep; some for society,
                  others for solitude. While some are born with a silver spoon in their
                  mouths, others seem to come into the world with an iron spade in hand, and ever
                  after remain down in the ditch—dig, dig, digging, from which they never ascend,
                  and scarce ever turn their eyes to the fair heavens above them. But I confess that
                  I cannot see that all of the "silver spoon" class are much better
                  off; for some appear to need to be fed on spoon victuals all their lives, such is
                  their pusillanimity. Now, although a silver spoon is desirable enough, still I
                  think if I had that in my mouth, I should want in one hand a good mining apparatus
                  with which to explore the mines of knowledge, and in the other a kind of safe in
                  which to store my treasures.
               But, this is a queer world! what one likes, another dislikes. While to many the
                  accumulation of dollars and cents appears to be the maximum of human happiness, and the chief
                  end for which they were created; a few are foolish enough to esteem
                  mental treasures of greater worth, and nearly all, whether the
                  objects of pursuit be monetary or literary, are seeking the aggrandizement of
                  self.
               Not many seem to understand that the great end of their creation is to glorify God
                  and enjoy him for ever. Enjoy God for ever? What a thought! Well might those who
                  have begun to find that enjoyment here which shall increase, and still increase
                  through eternity, exclaim, "I have found it! I have found it!" Found that which
                  alone is able to render fruitful the moral wastes of the world we live in, and lay
                  the sure foundation of that intellectual greatness of which this same odd,
                  distorted, and deformed world seems to possess the latent capabilities.
               But before such a day shall dawn, there is much labor to be performed. There is
                  much rubbish to be removed, and the walls of the strongholds of superstition and
                  prejudice must be broken down. There is labor to be performed, and by whom? surely
                  by this self-same world. Angels will not do it. The spirits of the departed will
                  not. But the great trouble here is, that while we see others, we lose sight of
                  ourselves. We forget that we are one of the specimens of humanity that go to make
                  up the world we live in. We can easily perceive that this one is singular, or that
                  one a slave to custom. That he is not very smart, or she
                  is not a lady, and so on, of many other things of greater or less importance. We
                  laugh at the mistakes, the ignorance, or the mishaps of others, and they in turn
                  amuse themselves with our peculiarities.
               Now what is to be done with such a world? Many call this an age of improvement;
                  but still many things connected with the world we live in, remain as they were in
                  the past, and will probably continue the same while we live in the world. But when
                  we shall "shuffle off this mortal coil," thus dissolving our connection with the
                  human family, we leave earth and its inhabitants behind, and enter upon another
                  state of existence, to reap the fruit of the evils to which we have yielded our
                  whole lives, or with enlarged and healthy faculties enjoy the bliss of a perfect
                  holy world.
               
                  ABBIE.
               
            
            
               ABIGAIL.
               BY AXIE ALLEN.
               "Now the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife was Abigail, and she
                  was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance; but the man was
                  churlish and evil in his doings." How it happened we are not told, that a man of
                  whom no good could be said, should have for a wife a woman beautiful, intelligent,
                  and without doubt decidedly pious. Perhaps she was given away by a parent or
                  guardian without her consent, or she might have been dazzled with the great wealth
                  of Nabal, and thought, with many at the present day, that to be happy we need only
                  to be rich. I think, by reading the narrative, Abigail could not have been a very
                  happy woman as a wife. As mistress of a large establishment doubtless her mind was
                  very much occupied with domestic concerns, and the oversight of servants; besides
                  this it seems she did not fully trust her husband with the management of out-door
                  concerns, knowing that his pettish disposition was unchecked by the fear of God.
                  The servants understood the difference between their master and mistress, and
                  dared to condemn his policy in the present instance, in the hearing of his wife,
                  and she concerted a plan with the servants to counteract the will of Nabal.
               There must have been many hours of sorrow, of bitter tears, and unavailing regret;
                  a hope of reform must have died from her heart, and dark despair have taken its
                  place, before a woman of "good understanding" could stoop to converse with
                  servants about the misconduct of their master and her husband. But she dared to
                  disannul his decision to the servants of David, and gave to him and his famished
                  followers a queenly gift without the knowledge of her covetous lord, and then,
                  while she acknowledged to David her husband's folly, humbly begged that she might
                  bear the iniquity of it. While looking at her course of conduct, some might think
                  she acted quite unlike an obedient, dutiful wife, in giving away that which her
                  husband had refused in his own name,
                  and in speaking of him in the manner she did to David. But we are sometimes
                  justified by the circumstances with which we are surrounded. So Abigail, by
                  bestowing a gift, saved a fortune; by disobeying her husband's orders, doing
                  contrary to his wishes, and without his knowledge, saved his life and the lives of
                  many others. When her object was accomplished, and David's wrath appeased, she
                  returned to her house, not to commune with her husband, and tell him her
                  adventures and the results of her journey, as is perfectly natural for a wife to
                  do. O no! Abigail had no husband to sympathize, console, or advise her that night;
                  her secret must be locked in her own heart, for Nabal was drunken with wine, and
                  was not a suitable companion for any honorable woman.
               It is not reasonable to suppose that riches or splendor gave her any pleasure at
                  that time. All her support was derived from a consciousness of integrity of
                  purpose, a conviction that she had done the best she could; and without doubt she
                  put her trust in God for the future, not knowing what a day would bring forth.
                  Perhaps she anticipated Nabal's wrath, when he should hear of what she had done,
                  and anxiously waited the first return of reason to tell him of his danger, and by
                  what means his life and property were preserved. A brighter day was nearer its
                  dawn to her than she expected! God smote her drunken, churlish husband, and took
                  him away. Death is death! solemn, dreadful, let it come to whom it will; but when
                  it comes to the tyrant, the captive can but breathe more freely. I do not suppose
                  she could be glad, for death was the giving up of hope for him; yet how could she
                  mourn for the man whose better nature was all perverted—whose heart had never
                  answered to the nobler impulses of generosity, benevolence, and sobriety!
               I have often thought of the Abagails of the present day. Many, very many have a
                  Nabal for a husband without his riches, and a numerous family to increase the
                  burden of the wife and mother. Many a woman brings her children to the sanctuary
                  that they may learn to reverence God in his house, while her husband sleeps away
                  his time, or spends it in a worse manner. Many a one gives to the poor man who
                  works for them, to remunerate him for the unjust weight or measure of her husband
                  Many maintain for their family a respectable position in society, when the husband
                  alone would have sunk into contempt or utter obscurity. Many a woman of generous
                  nature gives her alms without her husband's knowledge; she feels the calls of
                  humanity, and the love of God burns in her heart; she cannot turn away and feel
                  justified, and to avoid an outburst of passion from her husband, she gives without
                  his knowledge. Many a well informed woman is united for life with a rich, ignorant
                  churl, who knows as little about common national affairs, as Nabal professed to
                  know about the 'son of Jesse.' It is impossible for an intelligent, virtuous
                  woman, to honor, reverence, or respect a man who is intellectually and morally her
                  inferior, however much she may desire to do so. There is no way for an Abigail to
                  do, but to do right: to have the conscience enlightened by the Word of God, then
                  act up to its dictates.
               'Tis not well to look on the dark side of life long at a time; but seek to have
                  every adversity sanctified to the purification of earthly passions; striving to
                  discern a Father's hand in every trial: knowing that "tribulation worketh
                  patience, and patience experience, and experience hope." Do not say with one of my
                  acquaintance: "God hath forsaken me—He does not hear me when I pray—He does not
                  pity me in my affliction—there is no space for repentance for me;" yet that same
                  woman went, as a duty, to the sanctuary with her little children, and God, by the
                  mouth of His servant, addressed her from the words, "There is no hope." Every
                  sentence seemed adapted to her. Her despondency yielded to hope and trust in God,
                  and on that manna she will live until He gives her another taste of food
                  divine.
               O, ye Abigails! do right according to the Word of God; suffer and bear anger,
                  taunts, and reproaches; labor for the good of your families; and, if need be, even
                  bear the iniquity of your chosen companions. Remember, God's eye is on you; He has
                  not forgotten your tears and wrongs, and ye shall be saved in His own time and
                  way.
            
            
            
               
               BURY ME, OH, BURY ME!
               BY CAROLINE ELLEN.
               
                  BURY me! oh, bury me
                  Close by my mother's side!
                  Where the long-leafed willow droops,
                  Where the waters glide:
                  Where, above her gentle head,
                  Blossom roses white and red.
               
               
                  Bury me, oh, bury me
                  Where my father sleeps!
                  Where the grass waves mournfully,
                  Where the cypress weeps:
                  There, in solemn peace they rest,
                  Toward the bright and glowing west!
               
               
                  Bury me, oh, bury me
                  Near my brother's mound!
                  Where the sighing balsam stands,
                  Where the path winds round:
                  He was all my life loved best,
                  After they two went to rest.
               
               
                  There they sleep, these loving three,
                  Mingling clay with clay;
                  Flowers have blossomed o'er and o'er
                  Since they passed away!
                  Oh, how sacred is the spot!
                  Whispering "Forget me not."
               
               
                  Bury me, oh, bury me
                  With their precious dust!
                  Earth may boast its kindred earth,
                  Heaven has holier trust!
                  Spirit gems are there reset,
                  In its household coronet!
               
            
            
               
                  
                     Comet of 1744, as seen in Switzerland.
                  
               
               THE COMETS.
               BY S. S. GURLEY.
               
                  MY young friends will recollect that in a previous article I gave them a peep
                     through the telescope, at the great planets belonging to the solar system. We
                     will now let that instrument rest for a time, while I give you a sketch of the
                     comets, those singular stars with bright shining trains, which sometimes appear
                     in the heavens for a few evenings only; then vanish from our sight, and are
                     gone for a long, long time; their visits being "like angels', few and far
                     between."
                  The word comet is from a Greek word which signifies hair. It was given to these stars on account of the hairy
                     appearance of their trains. People in ancient times were very much terrified at
                     the sight of comets. They considered them as messengers of evil to mankind,
                     bringing war, pestilence, and famine. The poet Milton alludes to this in his
                     passage in Paradise Lost, where he says:— 
                        
                           "Satan stood
                           Unterrified, and like a comet burned,
                           That, from its horrid hair,
                           Shakes pestilence and war."
                        
                     
                  
                  Some of the ancients, however, regarded them as celestial chariots, in which
                     the souls of their departed friends were borne to the regions of bliss. The
                     Romans thought so of one that appeared near the time that Cæsar the dictator
                     was assassinated, about forty-four years before Christ.
                  Some of the learned in ancient times considered comets as nothing more than
                     meteors, born and perishing in the atmosphere of the earth. Others of a later
                     age have more justly concluded that they were permanent bodies, moving like the
                     planets, in fixed paths around the sun, though in very different orbits,
                     coming, sometimes, very near that body, and then flying off beyond the most
                     distant planet. While the planets move in orbits nearly in form like a hoop,
                     always from west to east, and in that part of the heavens in which the sun
                     appears to move, it is not so with the comets. They move in almost every
                     direction; sometimes from east to west, or cutting the ecliptic at right
                     angles, and may be seen in any part of the heavens.
                  It is supposed that there are a vast number of these mysterious bodies, but
                     only a hundred and thirty-seven have been recognised, and the times of their
                     revolution assigned. Halley, an astronomer living in the days of Newton, was
                     the first to anticipate the return of a comet, and calculate its periodic time,
                     which he did with great precision; the comet itself proving the accuracy of his
                     work, by appearing just at the time predicted.
                  In the year 1680 a comet of vast size and fearful aspect appeared in the
                     heavens. It came so near the sun, that the celebrated Newton supposed its body
                     must have been heated two hundred thousand times hotter than red hot iron. When
                     its nucleus had set, its immense flaming train, of four hundred and
                     twenty-three millions of miles, streamed upward to the zenith with glowing and
                     fiery corruscations, flashing through its whole extent, giving to every
                     beholder the idea of "the Cherubim and flaming sword" at the entrance of Eden,
                     "which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life."
                  This illustrious visitor, covering such a space, and traveling at the amazing
                     speed of eight hundred thousand miles an hour, might well attract the
                     astonishment of mankind, and it is no wonder that the eyes of the learned world
                     were turned towards it. They examined the chronicles of the past, and came to a
                     pretty fair conclusion that it was the identical comet which appeared at the
                     death of Cæsar, and that its periodical time was about five hundred and
                     seventy-five years. If this be true, it is now winging its mysterious flight
                     far beyond the distant Uranus, and its next return will be in the year 2255.
                     How vast the journey! How strong the contrast in the extremes of the route! One
                     in the solar blaze, the other eighteen thousand millions of miles from it! The
                     heat how intense! The light how strong! The cold how severe and withering! The
                     darkness how great! The sun is then reduced to a mere point, but the comet is
                     not beyond his influence. His attractive force will at last overcome the force
                     of its amazing velocity, and draw the comet back to its perihelion, or place
                     nearest the sun. How wonderful is this power of the heavenly bodies! How wise
                     the Being that gave them this power! Without it the sun, the planets with all
                     their moons, the comets, and all the stars, would go rushing through the
                     heavens; one world dashing against another till all would be hurled to ruin,
                     and not a single star left to light the darkened universe.
                  At the first recorded appearance of this comet, forty-four years before Christ,
                     it was seen as a hairy star in the skies of Rome. Pliny has preserved to us his
                     published memorial of it, which ran thus, "In those days, during the solemnity
                     of my games, there was seen a blazing star, for seven days together, in that
                     region of the sky, under the north star, Septentriones. It arose about the
                     eleventh hour of the day, and was evidently seen in all lands. By that star it
                     was signified that the soul of Cæsar was received among the divine and immortal
                     gods."
                  
                  Its second exhibition was in the reign of Justinian, A. D. 531. It was seen in
                     the western sky, with its train inclined to the north, and was called by some
                     Lampidas, on account of its resemblance to a burning lamp. Its third visit was
                     in the year 1106, in the reign of Henry II. of England, and was then described
                     as a "blaze of the sun, having an immense train." Its fourth appearance was in
                     1680, as above described.
                  Another remarkable comet made its appearance in the year 1456, filling all
                     Europe with alarm. It passed very near the earth, and swept the heavens with a
                     tail more than sixty degrees in length, in the form of a sword. The Turks were
                     then at war with the Christians, and masters of Constantinople. The comet
                     variously excited hope and fear, as he was deemed friendly to the Crescent or
                     the Cross. Each night after sunset he was seen rising in the west, and
                     traveling towards the east, approaching the moon. The night of its full it
                     happened to be eclipsed. Some persons seeing this flaming sword in the heavens
                     thus boldly marching towards the darkened moon, supposed it was a sign that the
                     Christians of the west were about to march against the Turks and overcome them.
                     The Pope, however, considered the comet in league with the Turks, and ordered
                     Ave Marias to be repeated by the faithful three times a day instead of two, and
                     the church bells to be tolled at noon, a custom which still prevails in
                     catholic countries. To the Ave Maria was to be added the prayer, "Lord save us
                     from the devil, the Turk, and the comet."
                  
                     
                  
                  The periodic time of this comet, as afterwards calculated by Halley, is
                     seventy-six years. From his great labor in this work, and its actual appearance
                     at the time he had predicted, it has been called Halley's comet. Its later
                     apparitions have been far less brilliant than its former ones; though in 1835
                     it was tolerably distinct, being often seen without a telescope.
                  The comet of 1744 excited great attention. It appeared with a tail divided into
                     six branches, all diverging, and curved in the same direction. Each of the
                     tails was about four degrees in width, and from thirty to forty-four in length.
                     The edges were bright and decided, the middle faint, and the spaces between
                     dark as the rest of the firmament and the stars shining between them. In
                     Switzerland it was seen with its nucleus below the horizon, its six tails
                     beautifully curving upwards, half way to the zenith. Its aspect in this
                     position was striking and beautiful in the extreme.
                  The comet of 1759 was observed with great interest. Its advent had been
                     confidently predicted from mathematical calculations, and its return within a
                     month of the time appointed was deemed a remarkable proof of the then newly
                     discovered law of gravitation. At its next return, after an absence from the
                     immediate vicinity of the solar system of about seventy-six years, its
                     appearance was greatly changed. Its train was very small, but at the same time
                     a luminous jet was seen directed toward the sun. At first it was single and
                     narrow. Afterwards it became broader and swallow-tailed, like a flattened
                     flame, and again two or three jets turned toward the sun. The jets were very
                     bright near the nucleus, but grew dim toward the extremity; they curved
                     backwards like smoke before a strong wind. In form and direction these
                     emanations were exceedingly capricious, changing so much as not to be the same
                     on two succeeding nights.
                  Another comet, with somewhat remarkable features, was seen in 1809. Its train
                     was divided in two parts, varying in size and appearance. Corruscations,
                     flickering and vanishing like the northern lights, seemed to shoot out in an
                     instant from the train, to an immense extent.

                  THE COMETS.
                  CHAPTER II.
                  THE autumn of 1811 witnessed the most beautiful comet that has adorned our
                     heavens since the days of Newton and Halley It was first beheld in the early
                     part of September, and was visible more than three months in succession. It
                     shone with the greatest splendor, attracting the gaze of an entire hemisphere.
                     Its luminous train extended through a space of one hundred and twenty-three
                     millions of miles in length, by fifteen millions in breadth. Supposing the
                     nucleus of the comet to have been placed on the body of the sun, and its tail
                     on the plane of the planetary orbits it would have reached over those of
                     Mercury, Venus, the Earth and bordered on that of Mars. When nearest the earth,
                     it was yet distant one hundred and forty-one millions of miles. Its periodic
                     time, as assigned by Lamaur, is four thousand two hundred and thirty-seven
                     years. Others give it a less time. What an immense journey that, to be
                     traversed by an object whose return, at the lowest estimate, cannot be expected
                     till the year 4857. Before its expiration, no doubt, the angel who shall stand
                     one foot upon the sea and the other on the land, will lift up his voice and
                     swear, by him who liveth for ever and ever, that time shall be no longer.
                  "The appearance of the comet," says our chronicler, "was strikingly ornamental
                     to our evening sky. Many a reaper, late in the harvest, stayed his hand, and
                     many a peasant, homeward bound, stopped to gaze on the celestial novelty, as it
                     grew distinct with the declining day." The Ettrick Shepherd has left his
                     impressions in the following lines: 
                        
                           "Stranger of heaven, I bid thee hail!
                           Shred from the pall of glory riven;
                           That flashest in celestial gale—
                           Broad pennon of the King of heaven!
                        
                        
                           Whate'er portends thy front of fire,
                           And streaming locks, so lovely pale,
                           Or peace to man, or judgments dire,
                           Stranger of heaven, I bid thee hail!"
                        
                     
                  
                  Those who were alive in 1811 will recollect the warm summer and bland autumn of
                     that year, with its bountiful harvest and abundant fruits,—the blessings of
                     which were assigned by many to the resplendent comet. But accurate calculations
                     by the learned have clearly shown that the presence of a comet has no effect on
                     the temperature of the atmosphere. Therefore, no credit is due to them for warm
                     weather or abundant harvests. Much superstitious fear was still blended with
                     the admiration occasioned by the splendid visitant of 1811. As the comet of
                     1680 was deemed the presage of that direful act which caused the persecution of
                     the French Protestants and the long wars that followed, so our beautiful guest
                     was now regarded by many as the herald of some awful event: nor was it doubtful
                     what the event might
                     
                        Comet of 1811
                      be, when the city of Moscow was fired, and the legions of Napoleon
                     were led forth to perish amid the snows of Russia; neither was it an
                     uncertainty in the minds of some of our own countrymen, when a second war with
                     the mother country was announced, and her soldiery landed on our shores. But
                     the harmless comet passed away, unmindful of the slanders of the ignorant and
                     superstitious, and probably will return to visit us no more.
                  Passing some which have made their advent without trains, and whose periodic
                     times are much less, we next mention one, which startled the world with its
                     sudden apparition, in the spring of 1843. Its train was first discovered
                     shooting upward in brilliant pencils of light, in the south-western sky, just
                     after sunset. This was one of the largest comets ever observed, and if it could
                     have been seen under favorable circumstances, it would have been one of the
                     grandest cometary exhibitions ever witnessed. The portion of the tail which was
                     seen, as measured by Sir John Herschel and others, was from thirty to
                     forty-five degrees. It is supposed that its immense train must have extended
                     into celestial space to the vast length of one hundred and sixty millions of
                     miles. When first discovered, it was traveling away from the sun with amazing
                     velocity, and soon vanished from our sight into the limitless regions of
                     immensity. In South Africa its presence was very distinct. A Mr. Maclear, near
                     the Cape of Good Hope, caught a favorable view of it from the heights of the
                     Cedarberg. He states that "few of its kind have been as splendid and imposing
                     as the grand comet of March, 1843. I remember that of 1811. It was not half so
                     brilliant as this."
                  It was also favorably seen by a European traveler among the savages in the
                     wilds of South America. They were encamped on an island in the Essequibo river,
                     four degrees, eleven minutes north. From his description we make the following
                     abstract. "For the first time since our departure from the coast, the sky was
                     clear, exposing toward the south-west its deep tropical blue, spangled with
                     stars. But what was our amazement when in the W. S W. we beheld a broad white
                     nebulous band inclined to the horizon, and stretching to the height of
                     forty-five degrees. The zenith was covered with those beautiful clouds called
                     cirrocumulus. The sky was clear however on both sides of the band, which was
                     more than one degree in width, and of a pure white, forming a delightful
                     contrast with the deep azure of the celestial dome. What was it? was the first
                     inquiry. My Indian friends stood around me looking now at the wonder in the
                     heavens, and now askance at me. But the next evening, March 9th, our doubts
                     were solved. It was a comet! About 7 o'clock the clouds in the west were
                     cleared away and there was the comet in all its grandeur, its nucleus about
                     twelve degrees above the horizon, and as large as a star of the second
                     magnitude, with a train forty-five degrees in length; the whitish light, and
                     transparent vapor of which, resembling those clouds which are 
                        "The beauteous semblance of a flock at rest,"
                      diverged about twenty degrees below the foot of Orion in nebulous stripes.
                     We moved not for amazement. It was the most remarkable object of the kind we
                     had ever seen. I well recollect the beautiful comet of 1811 with its diverging
                     beams of fiery light, but its train was much less in length than the one we now
                     beheld. There we stood on an island in the midst of the Essequibo; the foaming
                     waters thundering on over the black stony masses;—I the only civilized being
                     among a number of naked savages, some standing upright with their arms across
                     their breasts, some squatting on the ground, but all with their fearful eyes
                     turned towards the stranger star,
                     with its luminous train. Not a word was spoken, nor a sound heard save the rush
                     of the foaming waters. Tamanua, a young Indian of more intelligence than many
                     of his tribe, at last broke silence. 'This,' said he, 'is the spirit of the
                     stars, the dreadful Capishi. Famine and pestilence await us." The savages then
                     burst into a torrent of declamation, bewailing the dreadful precursor of evil.
                     I was surprised to find, among my Indian followers, the same superstitious
                     dread of a comet, which in all ages has rendered their appearance the terror of
                     the ignorant and vulgar. The Indians around me were composed of three tribes.
                     The first called the comet by a name which signifies 'the spirit of the stars;'
                     the second, by one signifying 'a fiery cloud,' or 'a sun casting its light
                     behind.'
                  We have now sketched an outline of the most important comets of which we have
                     any knowledge. We have seen them extinguished in the solar light, and have
                     followed them till they were lost in distance beyond the utmost stretch of
                     imagination. What their mission is, in their immense journeys, no one knows.
                     That they are the ministers of evil to mankind is not proved. They are
                     exceedingly rare bodies, not denser than vapory clouds, stars having been seen
                     through every part of them, and it is supposed they would cause no disaster
                     should they come in contact with the earth's attraction. The chances that such
                     a collision may take place is said not to be more than one in two hundred and
                     eighty millions.
                  And still, we wonder what these flaming torches are, and the answer returns,
                     "None knoweth save He who lit them, and sent them forth, flashing terror in the
                     eyes of a world, and exciting the admiration of many." If these, which are the
                     work of his fingers, are so wonderful and glorious, what must be the glory of
                     him, their Creator, who sitteth in the circle of the heavens, and holdeth the
                     stars in his right hand! And how great was the stoop when he condescended to be
                     clothed in flesh, that he might die for us, a mere speck, which he might have
                     blown away with a single breath of his nostrils. Well might light retire
                     abashed, when he was vailed in the darkness of death.
               
            
            
               AN EVENING AT HOME
               THE wood fire burned cheerfully in the little Franklin stove, and the polished
                  brasses reflected its bright light. Not a shred was to be seen on the rag carpet.
                  The plain table was covered with a neat cloth and strewed with books. The muslin
                  curtains were snowy white, and the plants that stood on the little stand were
                  thrifty and well cared for. On a small lounge, covered with curtain calico, sat a
                  lady who might have been twenty-five. She was not beautiful, but her soft chestnut
                  hair was braided so becomingly, there was so much expression in her dark eye, with
                  its long lashes, such a simplicity and neatness in her attire, that one could
                  scarce behold her without pronouncing her a lovely woman. By her side sat a plain
                  but intellectual looking man, some five years her senior. One arm encircled her
                  waist, and his brown hand clasped hers as he bent towards her, and his tones were
                  low and tender, while ever and anon those eyes looked up to his confidingly.
               The twilight deepened, and the flickering flame cast but a faint light; still the
                  lovers, (for such they really were, though twice twelve months had passed since
                  they took the vows that united them,) noted not the coming shadows.
               "It is so pleasant to be at our own home again," said Ellen.
               "And it is quite as pleasant to have you here once more," answered her husband; "I
                  can never consent to have you leave home for a whole week again. Why there has
                  been a shadow upon everything. Ah, Ellen, you are the light of my home. But say,
                  dearest," and a slight shade passed over his open brow, "did you not sometimes
                  sigh amid the splendor of your cousin's dwelling, when you thought of your plain
                  home, and still plainer husband? And when you reflected that her splendid mansion
                  might have been yours, but for your girlish recklessness, to prefer a plodding
                  farmer to a city merchant?"
               "Oh! Edward!" answered his wife, a tear dimming her eye, "how can you speak so?
                  You know I never loved William Spencer cer—you know I gave you my whole heart, and have
                  never repented it."
               "No, my love," answered her husband, soothingly; "I did not mean that; I have
                  never for a moment doubted your affection. But when you saw your cousin surrounded
                  with all the luxuries and elegances of life, with servants to do her bidding, and
                  her husband dressed to the best advantage—and then thought of your own low roof,
                  with its simple furniture, with only your own self to be maid of all work, when
                  you saw Isabella always at leisure, or only employed about some pretty piece of
                  finery, did you not think of the scrubbing, the cooking, the patching, the
                  darning, and all the etceteras that engrossed your time? And then your laborious
                  husband, with his work-a-day attire—did not one sigh escape?" and he looked half
                  playfully, half earnestly into her face.
               "No, Edward, never. I never loved William, and of course could not have been happy
                  with him in any situation. Isabella does love him dearly, and her husband dotes on
                  her, yet I doubt whether they have half the real happiness that we enjoy. Isabella
                  is a little, a very little fretful, and her servants often vex her. Then cousin
                  William is so very particular about his food, and an over-done beefsteak is no
                  more palatable from a silver fork, and heavy cake is no nicer from a silver
                  basket. I am glad you are not annoyed by trifles, Edward. I shall know how to
                  appreciate you now."
               "And are you quite sure that I am not annoyed by trifles?" asked her husband,
                  archly.
               "Certainly. Have I not proved it by two years' experience?"
               "I am not sure of that, Ellen. You have never tried me with such
                  trifles. Let me have my food half cooked and ill seasoned from the hands of a
                  slatternly girl, instead of the plain, well cooked dishes prepared by my
                  neat-handed wife, and see then—but I interrupted you. I am sure Isabella must be
                  very happy all the day, in that splendid parlor, with a carpet so dainty that it
                  seems a breach of propriety to step on it, those enormous mirrors that betray all
                  one's awkward movements; then those 'antique chairs,'—I believe you call
                  them—covered with rich velvet, and the lounges, the sofas, the wrought ottomans,
                  and the other elegant things of which your humble husband does not even know the
                  name."
               "No, no, Edward," said Ellen, "you are not quite so ignorant as you profess; but
                  it is of no consequence, for it will be but a little while before the fashionable
                  world will be obliged to have a new style of furniture, because we country people
                  have learned the names, and are beginning to imitate the style—But we were
                  speaking of Isabella. I think she is not as happy in the midst of this splendor as
                  I am, because I am always busy. It is not necessary for Isabella to labor, and it
                  requires considerable decision of character to keep one's self employed where
                  there is no incentive. If I set my pantry in order, I have no one to disarrange
                  it, and I am more than repaid by the pleasure I take in seeing it tidy. If I
                  stitch the wristband, or darn the stocking, I know that this will add to the
                  comfort of him I love; if I weed and water my flowers, they always smile upon me
                  in return. Even in cooking, which so many count a drudgery, I am always thinking
                  how I can make the best article with the least expense and trouble. At cousin
                  Isabella's, servants do all this, and she takes no interest, except to scold them
                  occasionally, when things are too bad. When in company, Isabella is
                  the personification of gayety, but I suspect there are many hours when she sits
                  alone in her splendid apartments, and sighs, though she cannot tell why. I am far
                  more inclined to pity than envy her, I am sure."
               "But you say they love each other. Surely when evening comes, when that brilliant
                  chandelier is lighted in the hall, and the parlor is illumined—when the heated air
                  is diffused so softly, when they draw around that splendid centre table, strewed
                  with engravings and periodicals, then Isabella must be happy."
               "Yes, her dreamy eyes light up; and as William puts on his embroidered slippers,
                  and seats himself beside her, kisses her fair cheek, and plays with her jeweled
                  fingers, and calls her all sorts of fond names, she looks perfectly happy. But
                  after a short time he takes a newspaper, (the only reading he seems to have any
                  taste for,) and she looks over the last magazine, or does a little fancy work, and
                  so the evening passes, varied perhaps occasionally by some trifling conversation,
                  or a dish more of fondling."
               "You do not disapprove of affectionate manners altogether, do you, Mrs. Howell?"
                  said the gentleman, with mock gravity.
               "No, you know I do not," said the wife, smiling; "but it is like rich cake; a
                  little, mingled with plainer food, is delicious; but were I to live upon it I should soon get cloyed.
                  No, Edward, when, after having been busy all day, the evening comes, and we sit
                  down in our own little sitting room, and read together, occasionally laying aside
                  the book to interchange thoughts, and give expressions to ideas and feelings we
                  might never have had, if the reading had not given rise to them, I am sure I enjoy
                  a more exalted happiness than Isabella ever knew. But look, it has grown quite
                  dark while we have been idling here. Let me go till I bring lights, and then I
                  will take my knitting work, which I have scarcely dared show at cousin Isabella's,
                  and you will read to me from those charming Miscellanies of Macaulay once
                  more."
               The next morning, when Mr. Howell saw his wife in a neat morning dress, tripping
                  lightly about the house, and heard her musical voice singing, 
                     
                        "Tis home where'er the heart is,
                        Where'er the loved ones dwell,"
                     
                   he felt quite sure the heart contained a wealth of happiness which money
                  could never have bestowed.

               MY COTTAGE HOME.
               
                  OH! give me back my cottage home,
                  Among the blooming fragrant flowers,
                  And o'er the hills, oh! let me roam,
                  As oft I did in childhood hours.
               
               
                  Oh! give me back my humble cot,
                  For there my happiest days were past,
                  But dearer still I love the spot,
                  'Twas there I saw my mother last
               
               
                  My cottage home give me again,
                  Beneath the beech let me recline,
                  Or wander through the winding lane,
                  Or swing upon the laden vine.
               
               
                  Give me that cot—contentment's shade—
                  O'er which the oaks so proudly wave;
                  And dying, there let me be laid,
                  Beside a mother's lonely grave.

               MARY AND THE VISITORS.
               MARY was fond of drawing. Her mother bought a drawing-book for her, and made her a
                  nice portfolio, and put pencils, paper, and India rubber in it, and told her that
                  at two o'clock every afternoon she would give her a drawing-lesson. Mary found it
                  very difficult to hold her pencil rightly. She thought she could make much
                  straighter lines, when she curled her fingers around her pencil.
               "Mama," said she, "why can not you let me hold my pencil as is the easiest for
                  me?"
               "Because, Mary, I wish to have you learn to hold it right. This is one object I
                  have in view in teaching you to draw."
               "What do you mean by 'object?'"
               "It is one thing that I teach you for. It is to have you hold your
                  pencil rightly, that I take the trouble to teach you. I had rather have one of
                  those chimneys drawn, with the pencil held right, than to have a whole sheet full
                  drawn, with your finger cuddled up, in your fashion."
               Mary took a great deal of pains to learn what her mama desired, and at length it
                  became easy.
               One day her mother praised a gate which Mary had drawn.
               "It is very well done, Mary."
               "I can draw much better now, mama, when I hold my pencil as you taught me. I do
                  not think I could make a good gate, to hold it as I used to. May I try, mama, just
                  for fun?"
               "Yes, you may try. You will always find that the right way is the
                  easiest way, to do everything, in the end."
               Two ladies now entered the parlor, and mama sat down on the sofa to talk with
                  them. Mary tried to draw a chimney, in her old way. It tumbled down one side, and
                  she began to laugh heartily. She took the sheet of paper and ran with it to her
                  mother.
               "Mama, only look at my chimney."
               
               "I am busy now, and cannot attend to it, little daughter."
               Mary returned, slowly, to her seat, and mama went on talking with the ladies. Mary
                  tried, next, to draw a gate; and she made such an odd-looking gate, that off she
                  ran to her mother again.
               "O, mama! mama!—my gate! my gate!—it is really very funny."
               "You must not interrupt me again, Mary. I just told you I could not attend to it
                  now."
               Mary put down her drawing, but she was very restless. She hopped about the room on
                  one foot, until her mama was obliged to speak again and tell her not to make so
                  much noise. Then she went into her play-room and brought out her boat and her wax
                  doll called Cate. She placed these in the lap of the lady who smiled the most, and
                  began telling her the history of the boat, how Harry once broke the sailors, and
                  papa glued them on for her, and how many clothes aunty had made for Cate. The lady
                  could not attend to anything else but Mary during her call.
               When the ladies had gone, mama said to Mary, "You troubled me to-day, when I had
                  visitors. You were asking me questions, or making a noise, or interrupting the
                  conversation, in some way, all the time; did you know it?"
               Mary hung her head, but made no reply.
               "You are old enough now to remember what I am going to tell you, and to do as I
                  wish you to. When you were a little girl, I used to send you up into the nursery
                  if you made a disturbance; but now I think you ought to stay in the room when I
                  have company. I wish to have you take pains to be still and quiet. Be very careful
                  not to ask me any questions. I must attend to my visitors; I cannot leave them
                  every minute or two to talk with you; it troubles me. Reserve your
                  questions until we are alone."
               "Does reserve mean—mama—does it mean—"
               "Try; you can think it out."
               "Does it mean I must keep my questions until the company are gone, and then ask
                  them?"
               "Yes, that is what I mean. Then I wish you to be careful, and not trouble the
                  ladies. Do not ask them questions, and beg them to look at your play-things,
                  unless you see that they want to. Remember they came to see mama, and not little
                  folks."
               "The lady, to-day, mama, smiled and asked me about my dollies."
               "When visitors ask to see your dollies, then you can show them; and
                  when you think they want to see your boats and sailors, then you can show them.
                  You are old enough now to judge for yourself, whether a lady wishes to talk with
                  you or with mama. What I wish to have you do is, to be careful not to be
                  troublesome either to visitors or to mama. Once I went to make a call, and there
                  was a little girl in the room—just about as old as you are. She teased her mother,
                  first for one thing and then for another, so that her mother could not talk with
                  me at all. After she had done teasing her mother, she came troubling me. She
                  pulled my shawl and tumbled up my collar. She would not mind when her mother
                  called her away; or rather, she would go away for a minute, and then come right
                  back to teasing me again. At length, to keep her quiet, I handed her a very pretty
                  bead-bag. She sat down on the carpet, and went to playing with it. This kept her
                  still, so that I could talk with her mama. But when I rose to go, and took my bag,
                  I found she had opened the clasp and taken out my card-case, and broken the little
                  hinge which held the cover on, and tumbled my cards all over the floor."
               "She was a very naughty girl, mama. I think I am old enough not to be so
                  troublesome as that."
               "I think you are, too. Still, to-day, you troubled me so much that I lost all the
                  pleasure of a call."
               Mary said she would try and remember all this when her mother had visitors again,
                  and she did remember it. She became quiet and troubled no one, and her mother's
                  friends thought she was a lady-like little girl.—

               STAYING THE PLAGUE. NUMBERS XXXV. 11.
               
                  O THOU, so wont of old to bless
                  The children for the parents' sake;
                  Around thy Throne of Grace we press—
                  To bless our sons, awake! awake!
               
               
                  Though ours be not the strife of blood,
                  The deadly plague of sin to stay;
                  We would be zealous for our God,
                  And turn thy righteous wrath away.
               
               
                  Be our own hearts forever pure!
                  Our hands, our voices swift to aid
                  The inexperienced and secure,
                  By many a deadly snare betrayed.
               
               
                  O, may we watch with heedful eye,
                  The erring footsteps of the young;
                  And point their hearts and hopes on high,
                  Ere yet the Tempter's snare be sprung!
               
               
                  Alas! too late we mourn to see
                  The children of our love beguiled;—
                  O God! where can a mother flee,
                  But to thy grace, to save her child!
               
               
                  So may the dire contagion cease,
                  O'er which our breaking hearts have sighed:
                  Send thy sweet covenant of peace,
                  With us and with our sons abide.

                           The heir of heaven, henceforth I fear not death:
                           In Christ I live; in Christ I draw the breath
                           Of the true life; let, then, earth, sea, and sky
                           Make war against me! On my heart I show
                           Their mighty Master's seal. In vain they try
                           To end my life, that can but end its woe.
                           Is that a death-bed where a Christian lies?
                           Yes! but not his—'tis death himself there dies!

               THE expiring believer does not see death: he sees the heavens opened, and Jesus
                  Christ standing at the right hand of God. It is no dark valley through which he
                  passes, but he moves along the highway of the Lord, to the palace of the great
                  King. He escapes out of this Golgotha into the only true land of the living.
                  Stephen was not vanquished on the field of martyrdom; he came off victor over
                  enemies, human and Satanic; yea, he was more than conqueror; cast out of the city,
                  he ascended to heaven. Amidst the shouts of an infuriated mob, and a shower of
                  stones, "He fell asleep." None of these things move him, neither counteth he his
                  life dear unto him. He is full of the Holy Ghost, and so is full of joy and peace.
                  He was not killed; he has only fallen asleep in Jesus; 
                     
                        "Like one who draws the drapery of his couch
                        About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams."
                     
                   Never did evening shadows lengthen more quietly, nor the dews come down more
                  benignly, than he, than every true believer, sinks to rest. "He is not dead, but
                  sleepeth." "They which sleep in Christ are not perished." They live; they live in
                  him, and with him,—a life higher, holier far than this. The protomartyr, now
                  opening his eyes as never before on the glory of God, and on the Son of Man
                  standing at the right hand of God, can say, "I laid me down and slept; I awaked,
                  for the Lord sustained me." The French Assembly may vote "Death an eternal
                     sleep;" the atheist Mirabeau, when
                  speech fails, may spend his last strength in writing, "Death is but a sleep;" the
                  atheist Danton may play off his horrid levity on the scaffold—"Let me go to
                  sleep;" but that is to fall asleep in sin, sorrow, wrath; it is to fall into outer
                  darkness, "where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched."
               Stephen, in holy calmness, in the quiet sublimity of a triumphant faith, prays for
                  himself—"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit;" prays for his murderers, "Lord, lay not
                  this sin to their charge;" bids earth good night, and sinks into the repose of
                  heaven. "So he giveth his beloved sleep." In the hour of dissolution, every saint
                  in Christ Jesus, whether sinking under a shower of stones, or the assaults of
                  disease, hears a voice saying, "Come up hither!" Before escaping from this prison,
                  light begins to break in. Gleams from the sunshine of everlasting glory find their
                  way to his cell.
               "O what joy!" exclaimed Dr. Gordon. "People have said that death is frightful. I
                  look on it with pleasure. I see no monsters around me. Death! I see no death at my
                  bedside. It is that benign Saviour waiting to take me. I could not have a fear.
                  This is not the testimony of one who has nothing to live for. I am in the prime of
                  life, with comforts and friends around me. But the prospect of heaven is more than
                  all." "I fear I am sinfully impatient in so longing after heaven; but it is so
                  glorious! Christ, not death, is about to take me from earth. There is no death to
                  the Christian. That glorious gospel takes away death." Such a departure is
                     mors sine morte,—a dying without death; it is
                  the believer's birth-day of eternity,—his last, best birth-day, his birth into
                  glory unutterable and unending.
               The saint, no less than the sinner, must depart this life. Of all the millions who
                  have yet lived, two only have been translated; and, in time to come, those only
                  who are alive at the coming of our Lord, shall in the twinkling of an eye be
                  changed, without tasting death; but the law is—and these exceptions are hardly to
                  be named—that all must die. The most eminent saints, the men and women after God's
                  own heart; the beloved disciple,—the one just referred to,—who, on the eve of
                  departure, saw the heavens open, and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of
                  God; and he, who years before decease, was caught up to the third heaven, have
                  alike been obliged to pass through the same door into the unseen world. It was
                  revealed unto venerable Simeon that he should not see death before he had seen the
                  Lord's Christ; but the sight of him who is a light to lighten the Gentiles, and
                  the glory of Israel, made it no less necessary for him to behold the King of
                  Terrors.
               That is the epoch of dissolution when soul and body part company till the
                  resurrection. The substance of the soul suffers no harm, and its consciousness no
                  abatement, by that change. "Then shall the dust return unto the earth as it was,
                  and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it." "And it came to pass that the
                  beggar died, and was carried by angels into Abraham's bosom." Paul speaks of death
                  as the hour of his departure, and departure to be with Christ. The believer's soul
                  is then disembodied, not destroyed, not consigned to sleep, but sent forth, active
                  and immortal. His tent is struck for the last time, and he passes over Jordan. The
                  ship goes to pieces, but the passenger is safe. The believer may one moment be in
                  the agonies of dissolution, the next reposing calmly in Abraham's bosom.
               The transition is doubtless instantaneous. It is no tiresome walk down through a
                  lonely dark valley; it is no weary flight upward, as the eagle mounts, higher and
                  higher; but no sooner is a believer's soul disembodied, than it is in Paradise.
                  The partition once broken down, what shall hinder an immediate view of all beyond?
                  And O, what a morning is that day-break of glory! The sun of righteousness shines
                  in all its brightness. It is the effulgence of Christ's person which lights up
                  that whole far-stretching world, and sheds a quickening radiance on every resident
                  there. If, two thousand years before the coming of Christ on earth, Abraham
                  rejoiced to see his day, what must be the joy of seeing him as he now is, at the
                  right hand of majesty, in the heavens!
               Stray beams of his lustre often fall on the dying believer, before his soul leaves
                  its tenement. "This is heaven begun," said Rev. Thomas Scott; "I have done with
                  darkness forever—forever. Satan is vanquished. Nothing now remains but salvation,
                  with eternal glory—eternal glory." Come to the veranda of a Brahminic temple. In the last spasms of
                  Asiatic cholera, Gordon Hall cries, "Glory, glory, glory!" and he 
                     
                        "Passed through Glory's morning gate,
                        And walked in Paradise."
                     
                  
               
               "Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord, from henceforth!" Blessed are the
                  dead, not survivors, not the most favored of those who remain here, still sinning
                  and repenting, and so imperfectly serving God—but blessed are the dead in Christ,
                  who have ceased from sin, are made perfect in holiness, and have passed into
                  Paradise.
               Transplanted trees flourish best. Shall we grudge those plants of righteousness
                  their better soil and purer air? Shall we grudge an escape from the hovel into the
                  palace of the Great King? "Children," said the mother of John Wesley, the last
                  thing she uttered, "Children, as soon as I am released, sing a psalm of praise to
                  God." Music sounds best after sunset. It is no time to mourn here, while angels
                  clap their wings, and the whole family above cry, Welcome home! Who would keep his
                  tears for the coronation day?
               "Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord!"
               
                  
                     "Thus star by star declines,
                     Till all are passed away;
                     As morning high and higher shines
                     To pure and perfect day.
                     Nor sink those stars in empty night,
                     But hide themselves in heaven's own light."
                  
               
               Shall not this abate the dread of dying? That dread is instinctive; it is deep. By
                  most, death is regarded as ultimum
                  terribilium,—the extremest of things terrible; but is it not gain,
                  great, unspeakable gain, to the child of God, to die? And shall we hesitate to
                  encounter the little inconvenience of stepping ashore from this shattered vessel?
                  Why so in love with perils? Whence this fondness for buffetings, sickness, and
                  protracted wreck? Whence this aversion to enter the haven of everlasting bliss?
                  For all saints in Christ Jesus, death has been unstinged. What if the serpent,
                  deprived of its fangs, do hiss?—he is harmless.
               "How hard it is to die!" remarked a friend to an expiring believer. "O, no, no!"
                  he replied; "easy dying, blessed dying, glorious dying!" Looking up at the clock,
                  he said, "I have experienced more happiness in dying, two hours this day, than in
                  my whole life. It is worth a whole life to have such an end as this. O, I never
                  thought that such a poor worm as I could come to such a glorious death!"
               Chrysostom, when banished, said to a friend, "You now begin to lament my
                  banishment, but I have done so for a long time; for since I knew that heaven is my
                  country, I have esteemed the whole world a place of exile. Constantinople, whence
                  I am expelled, is as far from Paradise as the desert whither they send me."
               A few moments before he expired, Edmund Auger said to a friend, "Do you see that
                  blessed assembly, who await my arrival? Do you hear that sweet music, with which
                  those holy men invite me, that I may henceforth be a partaker of their happiness?
                  How delightful it is to be in the society of blessed spirits! Let us go. We must
                  go. Let me go." O, death! where is thy sting?
               What is it to die? To believers, it is to drop the body of this death, and to put
                  on a joyous immortality; to pass from darkness to everlasting sunlight; to cease
                  dreaming, and commence a waking existence; yes, to awake in the likeness of
                  God—satisfied, fully and forever satisfied. What is it to die? To feel the last
                  pang, to shed the last tear, to raise the shield of faith against Satan's last
                  dart. It is to go home to God; to open the eyes on the enthroned Mediator; to
                  close the ears upon all discords, all sounds of woe, all the falsehoods, the
                  maledictions, the blasphemies of earth, and open them to the harmonies of heaven.
                  What is it to die? It is to stop sinning, to cease grieving the Spirit and
                  grieving the Saviour, to close up the inconsistencies of terrestrial profession,
                  and commence a forever blameless life in bliss. What is it to die? To lean on the
                  Almighty for a few steps down a narrow valley; to step out of Jordan, upon the
                  borders of the Better Land; to pass up to the New Jerusalem; to enter by one of
                  those gates of pearl into the city; to have ten thousand angels come and utter
                  their cordial welcome; to see—O, let me die the death of the righteous!—to see the
                  Saviour smile benignantly, and to hear
                  him say, "Well done, good and faithful servant; enter thou into the joy of thy
                  Lord!" That is to die.
               But in order to that, there needs be "an anchor to the soul, both sure and
                  steadfast,"—a most earnest "looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our
                  faith." It was not in the hour of martyrdom that Stephen first beheld the Lamb of
                  God. The religion that is good for nothing in life, is good for nothing in death.
                  The time will come, when we shall need a strong arm near, and a firm faith to
                  grasp it. The sentimentalities of fading flowers, and falling leaves, and of
                  moonlight musing, all the prettinesses of poetry, all natural amiabilities, and
                  mere natural charities, however cultivated, will avail nothing in the day when God
                  shall require the soul—in the day when we stand at his bar. Faith alone will
                  suffice,—an appropriating, justifying faith; an operative, vitalizing faith; a
                  hearty, adoring faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, who stands as Redeemer and
                  Advocate at the right hand of God.

               A FAMILY SKETCHED FROM LIFE.
               BY REV. DR. BELCHER.
               A HUNDRED years ago, there was, probably, not a Sunday school in the world,—very
                  little literature adapted for the young had ever been published; and both in
                  Europe and in this land, eminently favored in other respects, there was but a
                  small portion of evangelical piety. Even then, however, God had his "hidden ones,"
                  and he was at no loss to devise means by which his banished people could be
                  brought near to him. The reader will perhaps allow me to bring under her view a
                  sketch of a family in the old country, in which the omnipotent grace of God has
                  been signally displayed, some of whose members have for many years past occupied
                  places in our American churches, and whose olive branches already adorn the
                  vineyard of the Lord. In the preparation of this sketch, imagination has had
                  nothing to do, and the only task of the writer has been to "put in order" facts
                  drawn from documents furnished by members of the family.
               About ninety years ago, might have been seen at Olney, in
                  Buckinghamshire,—afterwards the residence of Cowper, the poet, of John Newton, the
                  eminent Episcopalian clergyman, and of John Sutcliff, a useful Baptist minister,
                  the bosom friend of Andrew Fuller, and one of the founders of the Baptist
                  Missionary Society;—here we say, might have been seen a poor orphan girl of nine
                  years, living in the family of a poor widow. This little girl had no education,
                  was unable to read even the child's primer, and had not then ever heard the way of
                  salvation, even from the pulpit. In the same town lived a poor boy, the son of
                  pious parents, who taught him to read and write, but as his father died when he
                  was very young, he had no further opportunity of acquiring knowledge, except by
                  his own efforts; and being the eldest son, he had to take care of a widowed
                  mother, and younger brothers and sisters.
               These two young persons, whom we have thus introduced to the reader, in very early
                  life became acquainted with each other, and were married. They were poor, honest,
                  and industrious, but neither of them was under the influence of religion, till
                  seven children had been given them to train for time and eternity. Under the
                  teaching of the Holy Spirit, they then became the followers of Christ, and were
                  both baptized by the excellent John Sutcliff. Our friend Robinson, for such was
                  his name, then became sexton at the Baptist church, and his wife, as often as she
                  could attend on the worship of God, rejoiced in association with his people. The
                  husband could now and then snatch a few moments from his hard labor to cultivate
                  intellectual and moral improvement, but the wife and mother had to grieve over the
                  almost impossibility of acquiring even the first elements of education. She did
                  indeed learn, somewhat imperfectly, to read her Bible, but she never advanced
                  further than this. Constantly did she mourn that her mind and soul had been
                  neglected, till the duties of a family so hardly pressed upon her.
               One duty she could discharge, and she never neglected it—incessant labor for the
                  highest interests of her children; one privilege she did enjoy, and which she
                  would never forego—a morning visit to
                  her closet; and one object she most earnestly prayed for—that she might live to
                  see all her children learn to read and write, and especially that all might be
                  brought to Christ. This first desire of her heart, as we shall soon see, was
                  accomplished.
               It must not be supposed that her husband was less intent on Christian duties than
                  herself. Like his wife, he lived for his family. He contrived to devote a short
                  time every evening to the instruction of his children, and encouraged them to
                  spend the little sums devoted by other children to toys and candies, to the
                  purchase of useful books, though alas, such books as our children are
                  blessed with, had no existence then.
               Sunday schools were not then what they are now; indeed, comparatively few of them
                  existed. The good man had no idea of sending his children to school, to save his
                  labor in instructing them at home: nor would he expose them to any evil influence
                  which might be exerted upon them in going to and from school, nor to the petty
                  jealousies which are too often found among schoolmates. He adopted his own plans,
                  which, among other advantages, could be pursued in all states of the weather. In
                  the intervals of worship he always gathered his children, who were capable of
                  instruction, into a room, where he taught them to read, questioned them on the
                  sermons they heard, explained any difficulty they might meet with in hearing or
                  reading, and furnished them with small manuscript books, in which he taught them
                  to record the texts and heads of the sermons to which they listened. He had the
                  ample reward of seeing them grow up intelligent and estimable members of society,
                  and converted in early life, they were happily distinguished as well-informed and
                  happy Christians.
               In 1802 these happy parents were blessed with seeing their first-born son baptized
                  by the venerable John Sutcliff, at the age of eighteen years; and four years
                  afterwards, in 1806, they took their final leave of him on earth, on his departure
                  to engage in the labors of the missionary field in India, where he faithfully and
                  successfully labored in connexion with the Baptist Missionary Society, for the
                  long period of forty-seven years and a half,—being the oldest missionary, it is
                  believed, of this century. He died at Dacca, Sept. 2, 1853.
               Here was indeed a happy family. Eight of the sons and daughter ters were baptized
                  and added to the church before they formed matrimonial engagements, and all in the
                  end married members of the same church. The young people were the objects of
                  admiration for their consistent profession of piety, and for their devotedness to
                  their parents. Often did they sing with delight the good old child's hymn of
                  Watts:— 
                     
                        "Thanks to my friends, whose care in my breeding,
                        Has taught me betimes to love working and reading."
                     
                  
               
               Sickness seldom entered their dwelling, and death paid not a single visit to the
                  family, till all had been sometime married. Industry and economy had enabled the
                  good man to build himself a comfortable habitation, and here he lived till all his
                  children had settled from him. One of his married daughters had even then come to
                  this country, where she has long been the wife of a Baptist minister, who is now
                  engaged in an agency for one of our public institutions. Another daughter, we may
                  add here, long since immigrated with her husband to this happy land, and in the
                  State of New Jersey is an active and devoted Christian.
               But the time approached when the good man should die. More than fifty-three years
                  had he and his wife "walked in all the ordinances and commandments of the Lord,
                  blameless;" never once had they seen a corpse in their house; and very few
                  households had known fewer sorrows of any character. The good man addressed his
                  eight children, who surrounded his dying bed, and expressed his joyful confidence
                  of meeting them all in heaven. To describe the scene would be impossible,
                  especially when he told them that he had ceased to know one of them from another.
                  The good old lady has long since followed her husband to the celestial country,
                  but their children, and many of their children's children, yet live to adorn the
                  Gospel of God our Saviour.
               This narrative suggests many important lessons, but as they will be obvious to
                  every reflecting reader, it is not necessary to specify them. May the religion of
                  Jesus thus elevate and sanctify many families of our own land, and throughout the
                  world.
            
            
            
               
               ALPINE VALLEYS.
               YOU cannot think how beautiful are these Alpine valleys. Our course, all the first
                  morning after we left Chamouni, lay beside a broad, hearty, joyous mountain
                  torrent, called, perhaps from the darkness of its waters, Eau Noire. Charming
                  meadows skirted its banks. All the way along I could think of nothing but Bunyan's
                  meadows beside the river of life, "curiously adorned with lilies."
                     These were curiously adorned, broidered, and inwrought with
                  flowers, many and brilliant as those in a western prairie. Were I to undertake to
                  describe them, I might make an inventory as long as Homer's list of the ships.
                  There was the Canterbury bell of our garden; the white meadow sweet; the blue and
                  white campanula; the tall, slender harebell, and a little, short-tufted variety of
                  the same, which our guide tells me is called "Les Clochettes," or the "little
                  bells"—fairies might ring them, I thought. Then there are whole beds of the little
                  blue forget-me-not, and a white flower which much resembles it in form. I also
                  noticed, hanging in the clefts of the rocks around Tête Noir, the long golden
                  tresses of the laburnum. It has seemed to me, when I have been traveling here, as
                  if every flower I ever saw in a garden met me somewhere in rocks or meadows.
               There is a strange, unsatisfying pleasure about flowers, which, like all earthly
                  pleasure, is akin to pain. What can you do with them?—you want to do something,
                  but what? Take them all up, and carry them with you? You cannot do that. Get down
                  and look at them? What, keep a whole caravan waiting for your observations! That
                  will never do. Well, then, pick and carry them along with you. That is what, in
                  despair of any better resource, I did. My good old guide was infinite in patience,
                  stopping at every new exclamation point of mine, plunging down rocks into the
                  meadow land, climbing to the points of great rocks, and returning with his hands
                  filled with flowers. It seemed almost sacrilegious to tear away such fanciful
                  creations, that looked as if they were votive offerings on an altar, or, more
                  likely, living existences, whose only conscious life was a continued exhalation of
                  joy and praise. These flowers seemed to me to be earth's raptures and
                  aspirations—her better moments—her lucid intervals. Like everything else in our
                  existence, they are mysterious.
               In what mood of mind were they conceived by the great Artist? Of what feelings of
                  his are they the expression—springing up out of the dust, in these gigantic,
                  waste, and desolate regions, where one would think the sense of his almightiness
                  might overpower the soul? Born in the track of the glacier and the avalanche, they
                  seem to say to us that this Almighty Being is very pitiful, and of tender
                  compassion; that, in his infinite soul, there is an exquisite gentleness and love
                  of the beautiful, and that, if we would be blessed, his will to bless is
                  infinite.
               The greatest men have always thought much of flowers. Luther always kept a flower
                  in a glass, on his writing table; and when he was waging his great public
                  controversy with Eckius, he kept a flower in his hand. Lord Bacon has a beautiful
                  passage about flowers. As to Shakspeare, he is a perfect Alpine valley—he is full
                  of flowers; they spring, and blossom, and wave in every cleft of his mind. Witness
                  the Midsummer Night's Dream. Even Milton, cold, serene, and stately as he is,
                  breaks forth into exquisite gushes of tenderness and fancy when he marshals the
                  flowers, as in Lycidas and Comus.
               But all this while the sun has been withering the flowers the guide brought me;
                  how they look! blue and white Canterbury bells, harebells, clochettes, all
                  bedraggled and wilted, like a young lady who has been up all night at a ball.
               "No, no," say I to the guide; "don't pick me any more. I don't want them. The fact
                  is, if they are pretty I cannot help it. I must even take it out in looking as I
                  go by."
               One thing is evident; He who made the world is no utilitarian, no despiser of the
                  fine arts, and no condemner of ornament; and those religionists, who seek to
                  restrain everything within the limits of cold, bare utility, do not imitate our
                  Father in heaven. Can not a bonnet cover your head, without the ribbon and the
                  flowers? say they. Yes; and could not a peach tree bear peaches without a blossom?
                  What a waste is all this colored corolla of flowers, as if the seed could not
                  mature without them! God could have created ated the fruit in good, strong, homely bushel
                  baskets, if he had been so disposed. "Turn off my eyes from beholding vanity,"
                  says a good man, when he sees a display of graceful ornament. What, then, must he
                  think of the Almighty Being, all whose useful work is so overlaid with ornament?
                  There is not a fly's leg, nor an insect's wing, which is not polished and
                  decorated to an extent that we should think positive extravagance in finishing up
                  a child's dress. And can we suppose that this Being can take delight in dwellings
                  and modes of life or forms of worship where everything is reduced to cold, naked
                  utility? I think not. The instinct to adorn and beautify is from him; it likens us
                  to him, and if rightly understood, instead of being a siren to beguile our hearts
                  away, it will be the closest affiliating band.
               If this power of producing the beautiful has been always so fascinating that the
                  human race for its sake have bowed down at the feet even of men deficient in moral
                  worth, if we cannot forbear loving the painter, poet, and sculptor, how much more
                  shall we love God, who, with all goodness, has also all beauty!
               All this while we have been riding on till we have passed the meadows, and the
                  fields, and are coming into the dark and awful pass of the Tête Noir. When we were
                  winding along the narrow path, bearing no more proportion to the dizzy heights
                  above and below than the smallest insect creeping on the wall, I looked across the
                  chasm, and saw a row of shepherds' cottages perched midway on a narrow shelf, that
                  seemed in the distance not an inch wide. By a very natural impulse, I exclaimed,
                  "What does become of the little children there? I should think they would all fall
                  over the precipice!"
               My guide looked up benevolently at me, as if he felt it his duty to quiet my
                  fears, and said in a soothing tone, "O, no, no, no!"
               Of course, I might have known that little children have their angels there, as
                  well as everywhere else. "When they have funerals there," said he, "they are
                  obliged to carry the dead along that road," pointing to a road that resembled a
                  thread drawn on the rocky wall.
               What a strange idea—such a life and death! It seemed to me, that I could see a
                  funeral train creeping along; the monks, with their black cloaks, carrying tapers,
                  and singing psalms; the whole procession together not larger in proportion than a
                  swarm of black gnats; and yet, perhaps, hearts there wrung with an infinite
                  sorrow. In that black, moving point may be a soul, whose convulsions and agonies
                  cannot be measured or counted by anything human, so impossible is it to measure
                  souls by space. What can they think of, these creatures, who are born in this
                  strange place, half way between heaven and earth, to whom the sound of avalanches
                  is a cradle hymn, and who can never see the sun above the top of the cliff on
                  either side, till he really gets into the zenith?
               What they can be thinking of I cannot tell. Life, I suppose, is made up of the
                  same prosaic material there that it is everywhere. The mother thinks how she shall
                  make her goat's milk and black bread hold out. The grandmother knits stockings,
                  and runs out to see if Jaques or Pierre have not tumbled over the precipice.
                  Jaques and Pierre, in return, tangle grandmother's yarn, upset mother's milk
                  bucket, pull the goat's beard, tear their clothes to pieces on the bushes and
                  rocks, and, in short, commit incredible abominations daily, just as children do
                  everywhere.
               In the night how curiously this little nest of houses must look, lighted up,
                  winking and blinking at the solitary traveler, like some mysterious eyes looking
                  out of a great eternity! There they all are fast asleep, Pierre and Jaques, and
                  grandmother, and the goats. In the night they hear a tremendous noise, as if all
                  nature was going to pieces; they half awake, open one eye, say, "Nothing but an
                  avalanche!" and go to sleep again.
               This road, through the pass of the Tête Noir, used to be dangerous; a very narrow
                  bridle-path, undefended by any screen whatever. To have passed it in those old
                  days would have had too much of the sublime to be quite agreeable to me. The road,
                  as it is, is wide enough, I should think, for three mules to go abreast, and a
                  tunnel has been blasted through what seemed the most difficult and dangerous
                  point, and a little beyond this tunnel is the Hotel de la Couronne.
               If any body wanted to stop in the wildest and lonesomest place he could find in
                  the Alps, so as to be saturated with a sense of savageness and desolation, I would
                  recommend this hotel. I thought I should like to stay there a week, to be left
                  there alone with Nature, and see what she would have to say to me. But two or three hours' ride in the hot sun, on a
                  mule's back, indisposes one to make much of the grandest scenes, insomuch that we
                  were glad to go to sleep; and on awaking we were glad to get some dinner, such as
                  it was. After our dinner, which consisted of a dish of fried potatoes and some
                  fossiliferous bread, such as prevails here at the small hotels in Switzerland, we
                  proceeded onward. After an intolerably hot ride for half an hour, we began to
                  ascend a mountain called the Forclaz.
               There is something magnificent about going up these mountains, appalling as it
                  seems to one's nerves, at particular turns and angles of the road. At last we
                  reached the top, and began to descend; and there, at our feet, as if we were
                  looking down at it out of a cloud, lay the whole beautiful valley of the Rhone. I
                  did not know then that this was one of the things put down in the guide book, that
                  we were expected to admire, as I found afterwards it was; but nothing that I saw
                  anywhere through the Alps impressed me as this did. It seemed to me more like the
                  vision of "the land that is very far off" than anything earthly. I can see it now
                  just as distinctly as I saw it then; one of these flat, Swiss valleys, green as a
                  velvet carpet, studded with buildings and villages that looked like dots in the
                  distance, and embraced on all sides by these magnificent mountains, of which those
                  nearest in the prospect were distinctly made out, with their rocks, pine trees,
                  and foliage. The next in the receding distance were fainter, and of a purplish
                  green; the next of a vivid purple; the next, lilac; while far in the fading view
                  the crystal summits and glaciers of the Oberland Alps rose like an exhalation.
               The afternoon sun was throwing its level beams in between these many-colored
                  ranges, and on one of them the ruins of an old Roman tower stood picturesquely
                  prominent. The Simplon road could be seen, dividing the valley like an arrow.
               I had gone on quite ahead of my company, and as my mule soberly paced downward in
                  the almost perpendicular road, I seemed to be poised so high above the enchanting
                  scene, that I had somewhat the same sensation as if I were flying. I don't wonder
                  that larks seem to get into such a rapture when they are high up in the air. What
                  a dreamlike beauty there is in distance, disappearing ever as we approach!
               —Sunny Memories of Foreign Lands.
               
            
            
               
               
                  
               
               HOME.
               How many pleasing associations cluster around this word! How many sweet memories
                  of by-gone days it recalls to mind, by which the heart is cheered, and the spirits
                  enlivened amid the darkest hours of life's chequered scenes. Do we wander in
                  foreign climes, and mingle among men of diverse tastes and language from our own,
                  how sweet then is the memory of home; how gratefully do the thoughts of it recur
                  to us, as they come booming across the distance, filling the heart with the
                  recollection of the sunny feelings and joyous ecstacies of fireside scenes in
                  early life. Have years come over us, and are we busy amid the cares and
                  solicitudes of life; has time swept away the hearth stone of our early home, and
                  laid in the sepulchre those dear ones who reared us in our infancy, and matured us
                  to meet the sterner duties of after life; does neither parent nor homestead remain
                  to identify to us the scenes in which we once reveled with delight, yet the heart
                  garners up what time cannot efface, and brings sweet reminiscences, which the
                  vicissitudes of life can never erase from the mind.
               A happy home in early life has the most salutary and permanent influence in the
                  formation of individual character. The tender sympathies and affectionate
                  solicitude of devoted parents, or the confiding love and genial attachment of
                  beloved sisters, mould and soften into pliancy all the finer sensibilities of the
                  heart, and fit man to become the companion of kindred spirits, that shall
                  afterwards cling to him in similar relations of life. The practical wisdom and
                  judicious counsels of a kind father give strength and efficiency to the first
                  germs of thought and feeling in youth, and mature those germs into vigorous and
                  virtuous principles in riper years. The tender care and unceasing watchfulness of
                  a beloved mother trace her image in living characters upon the plastic
                  susceptibilities of earliest childhood. And the confiding trust and warm
                  attachment of every beloved companion of the fireside, soften and mould into form
                  all the generous impulses pulses of the
                  youthful heart, causing the sister's affection and the brother's sterner nature to
                  contribute to the general happiness of the entire circle. These endearing
                  relations render home one of the most powerful and efficient means of determining
                  character that God has given to man. Other relations of life are abstract in their
                  nature, and remote in their affinities. Their influences are modified by
                  circumstances, and neutralized by the distance with which they act upon the heart.
                  But around the fireside of home, where mind comes in contact with mind, and the
                  first beatings of the heart can be taught to pulsate for truth and heaven, there
                  is found the school to form and determine character.
               But home, to become thus hallowed in its influence, must be rendered attractive.
                  Every external means possible should be employed to interweave the affections of
                  its inmates with all its relations. It should be invested with such interest to
                  each member that no other place would be preferred to it. In early life the most
                  ample means of rational amusement should be placed within the reach of every
                  child. Free scope should be given to every playful faculty. The gushing impulses
                  of the young heart, as they bound forth and fill the soul with gladness by their
                  very exercise, should find a generous response in the looks, and words, and
                  general mien of the parent. The inventive powers also, which are so constantly
                  developed in the construction of the means of amusement, should be encouraged and
                  directly aided by the older members of the family. Every opening faculty should
                  find some innocent and rational means of gratification. The doll, the play-house,
                  the hoop, and the marbles, with every other facility for the mind's occupancy,
                  consistent with health and amusement, should be furnished, so that home may not
                  become a place, irksome to the mind, and an aversion to the heart. If such means
                  of amusement are not furnished, the mind will prey upon itself, and thus the
                  health suffer, or places and companionship will be sought without the domestic
                  circle, that may lead to the ruin of character, and embitter the declining years
                  of the most affectionate parents with the deepest sorrow.
               Home must also be made the circle of confiding attachments. We may make it ever so
                  attractive by external helps. The playhouse house may be well stored; the out-door
                  amusements the most ample; and every facility for recreation afforded that the
                  youthful heart could desire, yet if the heart has not been trained to entwine its
                  affections confidingly within those of the parent, if its attachments have not
                  been formed and matured by years of growth, the influence of home will not be such
                  as will mould the character aright, after the domestic circle is broken, and its
                  members scattered far and wide in the world. There must be a strong bond of union
                  between all the members of the home circle,—and so enduring in its nature that no
                  vicissitudes in life shall weaken or sever it. Heart must be linked to heart from
                  earliest life, as "with hooks of steel," and then when adversity darkens the
                  pathway of any member—the beloved of the family will ever be ready to sympathize
                  with the sorrowing and afflicted, and the calamity of one become the calamity of
                  all.
               Perhaps no one thing does more toward lessening the hold of the parent upon the
                  affections of the child in after life, than the failure to secure the confidence
                  of children in the home circle. When the parent is never made a confidant, and the
                  secrets of the young heart are never revealed to those who feel so deep an
                  interest in all their plans in life—the result will be that other friends will be
                  sought for advisers and counsellors, and the most affectionate parents become
                  forgotten and overlooked. But where such confidence is implicitly placed in a
                  parent, and the child turns to such as his best friend in maturer life, no words
                  can express the moral power which such confidence has upon a son or daughter
                  whenever or wherever temptation assails such in the multiplied relations and
                  associations of life.

                  A little stranger came to me,
                  And sought its home upon my breast;
                  I loved it—oh, so tenderly!
                  And daily, hourly 'twas caressed.
               
               
                  It grew,—but, like a tender flower,
                  So fair, and yet so fragile too—
                  We kept it 'neath affection's bower,
                  Safe screened from each harsh wind that blew.
               
               
                  And well it did repay our care,
                  So fond and gentle, precious child!
                  Love clustered in each ringlet fair,
                  And ever in her blue eyes smiled.
               
               
                  Ah! little, haply, did we think,
                  As round our hearts the golden chain
                  Was sweetly weaving, link by link,
                  We did an angel entertain.
               
               
                  But now, what then was hid, we know—
                  Our Laura's home was in the skies;
                  Awhile she tarried, thus to show
                  What guests we hold in mortal guise
               
               
                  And, sure, their mission well they fill—
                  Blest are our homes while here they stay;
                  And luminous their pathway still,
                  Which draws us heavenward away.

               A WORD ABOUT THE CHILDREN.
               WE love to talk about the children, because they have found a place in our hearts.
                  They all claim a share of our affections. The tiny little one, who has just
                  learned to answer a mother's look with a smile, the arch rogue who, to satisfy
                  curiosity, is constantly in mischief,—laughing, romping Kitty, and the pensive,
                  thoughtful Allie—each and all, have something in them that interests us. Whether
                  rich or poor, well clothed or in rags, clean or dirty, still they are children,
                  all dear, but all differing from each other; not only possessing
                     family, but also individual traits. Who but has
                  remarked the great difference in children of the same family?
               But leaving others to inquire into the reason of this, we would ask if this does
                  not prove an item of difficulty in domestic training. If all were alike, we might
                  form a code of laws and require indiscriminate obedience; or the employments and
                  amusements of one might be suitable for all. But experience teaches us that this
                  will not do. We cannot thus generalize the matter. Different dispositions require
                  a diversity in the manner of treatment. Hence the mother's task is not an easy
                  one. It requires wisdom and forethought; it requires our time and our strictest
                  attention. Mother! do you wish to have good children? Then study their
                  dispositions, and act accordingly. However much individual character may be owing
                  to education, still it is certain that the mentality of all is by no means the
                  same at birth. It is ours, then, in the first place, to find out what they do, and
                  what they do not possess, so that, by proper training, that which is too weak may
                  be strengthened, and that which is already too strong held in check. But, instead
                  of this, that which is already too prominent, is often rendered still more so. For
                  instance, we see a child full of mirthfulness and hope, and not wanting in
                  self-confidence. In the pursuit of his roguery he is continually meeting a
                  parent's smile of approbation, even in wrong doing. "He is so
                     cunning! how can one find fault with him?" And thus these faculties continually receive new accessions of
                  strength, and thus this child may grow up embracing the idea that he is a natural
                  genius, and from this very reason will-fail to use that effort which renders one a
                  genius, or genius of value. On the other hand there may be another, of very
                  different qualities, who, with little hope, is always fearing lest he may do
                  wrong, and this very fear is constantly leading him into numberless mistakes and
                  accidents; and as he can not, like the other, turn even vices into virtues, he
                  must be content to receive harsh words and frowns. And O! with what withering
                  effect do they full upon his sensitive heart! We do not realize what an indelible
                  stamp may be made on the mind of our child by one harsh word, which impression
                  will cling to him through life. We know a lady who, when quite young, was asked by
                  her father to sing for him. She sang, but instead of a word of commendation for
                  her effort, he simply said, "You can't sing." This was enough. Although many years
                  have passed since then, and she possesses a sweet voice, she cannot bear that any
                  one should hear her sing. With such a one, a word of encouragement, fitly spoken,
                  may be the kindling of a spark which shall increase and yield fruits of happiness
                  and fame in after life. Thus we see that it is a matter of importance that we
                  study the dispositions of our children.
               But fancy hears some mother saying, "I am obliged to toil day after day to provide
                  food and clothing for my children, and it is the least that they can do to obey me
                  without my stopping to give them the whys and wherefores, or to inquire whether
                  they are suitable to their minds or not." Now we do not ask you to do any such
                  thing as this. Your commands may be right, and what you know to be for the good of
                  the child, and yet they may not understand the reason of such command. But perhaps
                  they may understand these reasons much better than we suppose, many times. They
                  can see and feel too, whether what we require is to satisfy the
                  dictates of fashion, or some other equally unworthy end, or whether they proceed
                  from higher motives.
               But another says, "I like to have my children do as I say, whether it is pleasing
                  to them or not. That is the way my parents taught me, and these new ideas on
                  domestic government are ruining our children; we had better follow the old paths."
                  In many respects these paths may be wisdom's paths, but to say that they can in no
                  wise be made better, seems to us folly. No mother that is worthy of that name can
                  think her duty well discharged when the outward wants of her child are alone
                  provided for.
               Nay, the greatest, the most noble part of her work still remains to be done.
                  Better far let some of your work, which has reference only to bodily wants, go
                  undone, than to neglect the intellectual and moral training of those committed to
                  your care. It were even better that much that you now do should be left without
                  doing. It would do no harm to make that dress a little plainer or a little less
                  fashionable; and if you should not find time to make quite so many pies and cakes,
                  no evil would result from it, but much good, in rendering your children more
                  healthy and far less liable to burden you with sickness, or, to say the least,
                  perpetual pettishness.
               Many think the period of childhood emphatically the season of happiness. Without
                  stopping to inquire whether it may be more so than in advanced life, we would at
                  once say that it is, and ought to be, a sunshiny period. Children are naturally
                  gleeful and joyous, and we love to hear their ringing laugh, or to gaze upon their
                  cherub faces, illumined with smiles; and how many hours the mother spends for this
                  one object, of rendering her children happy; and they will be happy, if we will
                  only let them be. Then let them be happy, by being engaged in
                  congenial employment. Children are active; they must be doing something; and by
                  our love to them, let us not hinder their activity for the sake of keeping them
                  dressed like dolls, or because we do not like to have our rooms littered, or
                  furniture misplaced. Let us not repress their curiosity, and prevent the
                  development of their inventive faculties for fear of having our houses turned into
                  infantile workshops. Let them work, while we direct their efforts in the proper
                  channel. Now, although this may seem a task, yet in our opinion it will be found
                  an easier one than that of trying to make them happy, deprived of their dear and
                  innocent enjoyments. Now we would not be understood as thinking that order and
                  neatness are not matters of importance. On the contrary, we think they are
                  generally undervalued. But how can these habits be better formed in youthful minds
                  than by teaching them to practice such habits in the sports of childhood. Let "Daughter" learn to
                  keep "Dolly's" wardrobe in perfect order, and let the boys have a
                     place for carts, hoops, ropes, balls, &c. Thus this and
                  kindred habits may be formed almost imperceptibly and pleasurably, the influence
                  of which on future life cannot now be estimated.
               If these scattered "words about the children," shall serve to awaken in any
                  mother's heart a train of thought, which shall tend to increase the happiness of
                  the little ones and make them better, we shall be well repaid. We would like to
                  say more, and while talking of physical and intellectual training, urge mothers
                  not to forget the moral also, but to remember that they are entrusted with the
                  care of immortal spirits, concerning whom God has said, "Take these and nurse them
                  for me, and I will give thee thy wages." O, what responsibility rests upon us! We
                  must reap according to what we sow. But while it is a responsible, it is
                  nevertheless a noble task; and if we sow aright, under the blessing of him who
                  giveth rain and sunshine in their season, we may reap a glorious harvest.

               THE PHILOSOPHY OF SOCIETY.
               IN this age of books and learning, almost everything seems to be scrutinized. The
                  heavens and the earth, the solid rocks and the restless deep are alike analyzed,
                  and every part and particle carefully examined as to its nature and relations, and
                  yet we cannot forbear the remark, that whilst we are citizens, and mingle, it may
                  be, daily, with the living world, and know much of Society, that after all we do
                  not sufficiently study it. We do not mean so much its business or fashion, nor are
                  we referring to what may be artificial or accidental, but we mean the real
                  Philosophy of Society.
               There is a philosophy of society, a philosophy as thoroughly
                  established, and subjected to laws as certain and as sovereign as are the heavens
                  and the earth. And it is in this respect that we fail to study it.
               We have been in the habit, quite too much, of looking at the human race as a
                  heterogeneous mass, thrown together by mere accident; made up of all classes,
                  nations, ages and conditions; bound to each other by no laws, holding
                  no natural or necessary connection, and hence no special obligations arising
                  therefrom. But let us examine a moment, and see if there may not be a mistake upon
                  this point, a mistake the most disastrous to the well being of society.
               Is it mere accident, that whilst yonder stands a mansion of wealth,
                  filled with all the rich luxuries that heart can desire, that hard by, you see the
                  cottage of poverty, or what is worse, the cellar or the garret of squallid
                  wretchedness? That at the doors of this mansion, are knocking the chilled,
                  trembling hands of the half clothed and half fed? Is it a mere happen, that near
                  by the home of intelligence and refinement, are scores of ignorant and debased
                  minds? That while our own houses are filled with the means of light and knowledge,
                  thousands around us are groping their way in deep darkness? Is it nothing to us
                  that whilst we are reposing in the bosom of kindred and friends and rejoicing in
                  old and well established friendships, by our doors are multitudes of aliens, and
                  strangers saying, "no man careth for my soul?" Is there no ordering of these
                  relations? How is it that when your home is the abode of prosperity, that your
                  next door neighbor may be cast down and well nigh destroyed? How is it, we ask
                  again, that when blooming health may be clothing your household with beauty and
                  vigor, that sickness and death at the next door may be sending the groan of agony,
                  or the wild wail of despair up into your chambers, and the "mourners go about your
                  streets?" How is it that there are so many orphaned children, and mourning widows
                  in this world? Have we been accustomed to study this subject? Have we looked well
                  into the interior, so as to feel the force of the underlaying and ordering of this
                  mighty living structure? Do we suppose that no hand guides the waves of this
                  ever-rolling, restless ocean of living, dying humanity? Are we to suppose that its
                  mighty oscillations, which are daily rending old relations and forming new ones,
                  are merely "happens," the results of accident, or chance? By no means. There is
                  the work of a God in all this. We may see, if we will look, the very hand that guides the comet in its
                  wild flight across the heavens, and eases the sparrow in its fall to the
                  ground.
               If these things be so, ought we not to study society. Should not our minds become
                  familiar with its philosophy? Should we not look well to its relations and claims?
                  Should not our eyes be opened to the needy, and our ears to the cries of the
                  "ready to perish?"
               Society has claims upon us which we must not, we cannot escape. It imposes duties
                  imperative in their nature, which no man or woman can neglect with impunity. These
                  claims arise from the very nature of the relations which we sustain. And these
                  relations the Creator, as we have seen, instituted, and we have no power to
                  dissolve them; for, "The poor ye have always with you." And ever since sin entered
                  and cursed the world, bringing with it sickness and death, the cry of the orphan,
                  and the wail of the widow, and the prayer of the perishing, have called alike,
                  that we should "weep with them that weep." And "blessings from the ready to
                  perish" will descend like the dew of evening on all who faithfully meet their
                  righteous claims. The Creator has so decreed it. It is the established law of the
                  universe, that when we bless others, we thereby bless ourselves. Or, when we
                  minister to others, as our duty demands, then we are most certainly ministered
                  unto ourselves. This the Saviour of the lost declared, when he said, "To him that
                  giveth it shall be given again, good measure, pressed down, shaken together,
                  running over, shall men give into your bosom." Go, then, reader, understand your
                  high privilege; scatter your bread upon the waters, that at length you may gather
                  it again, greatly increased. Make yourself rich in ministering to others. Then,
                  with Job, you can say:— 
                     
                        "When the ear heard, then it blessed me;
                        And when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me;
                        Because I delivered the poor that cried,
                        And the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.
                        The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me;
                        And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy."

               THE FADED FLOWERET.
               BY LEA.
               
                  SWEETLY bloomed a tender floweret
                  During bygone summer days—
                  O, we watched its growth with pleasure
                  'Neath the sun's resplendent rays.
                  But, alas, we saw with sadness
                  When that plant began to fade—
                  Soon it lay all pale and wither'd—
                  Ah, how soon our hopes decay'd!
               
               
                  Faithful we its growth had nurtur'd,
                  Glad had seen the pearly dew
                  Sparkling on its petals brightly,
                  As it older, stronger grew.
                  Now, alas, its place is vacant.
                  Ah now bleed our aching hearts!
                  What, oh what our grief can solace?
                  What extract stern sorrow's dart?
               
               
                  But the darkness fast is fading,
                  And we see an angel hand
                  Draw the vail, in love revealing
                  Yonder sin-unburdened land.
                  There we see Life's crystal river
                  There are plants that never fade,
                  There are shining angel-watchers,
                  There is nought to make afraid.
               
               
                  There behold a floweret blooming;
                  Oh, it is the one we love;
                  Now, transplanted into Eden,
                  It forever lives above.
                  Praise to thee, O Holy Father;
                  All thy ways with us are kind
                  Thou hast taken lovely Clara,—
                  Make us to thy will resign'd!
               
            
            
            
               
               THE OLD MAN.
               BY MRS. M. A. DENISON.
               "THAT'S right boys! I like that. That's genuine old time politeness," thought I,
                  as I saw two little boys bow to an aged man. That one act shows where the mother's
                  heart is, and what the fireside circle may be at home.
               There is something under those yellow curls, in the flashing of those bright, blue
                  eyes, that will make more than men of you, if great ye are to be—that will make
                  you good; for without goodness there is no true honor.
               God bless the aged man. There are a world of memories clustering in his bosom,
                  that send oftener the tear than the smile to his dim eye. He has folded babes to
                  his bosom; he has dreamed over infant beauty that dream that Hope weaves in the
                  soul of every parent. He has kissed the white lips, and twined the golden ringlets
                  around his hard fingers. He has felt that glow of which sometimes tears are born,
                  when the innocent lips first said "Father."
               He has bent over the little pallet at night, with that true one at his side, and
                  read immortal dreams in dimples. He has woven a path for the unconscious sleeper
                  that should be more brilliant than diamonds, softer than beds of roses; for would
                  it not flush with the radiance of his love? would not his love be a wall of
                  adamant, over which no danger, with glaring eye-balls and fiery breath, could leap
                  to destroy his heart's own darling? And O! woe! he has held out his arms to fence
                  back the cold angel that with his gleaming scythe, has glided over those walls of
                  love, into the beautiful path, and spoiled the thornless flowers. He has sunk
                  sobbing by the little still couch, all curtained by angels; he has laid his hand
                  on the throbless bosom and wondered at its waxen loveliness—but O! such a dumb,
                  chilling wonder! He has shut out the sunlight from his home, and shuddered to
                  behold it glaring full into that dark grave, that long, narrow cradle for his
                  babe, in which the beautiful body would never be rocked to wakening, though the
                  very birds sang their most thrilling melodies all day by its side.
               God bless the aged man! Sorrow, with folded hands and drooping brow, has taken her
                  abiding-place at the very threshold of his heart. There is a wreath of hyssop
                  bound about her forehead, and she holds in one hand the faint flickering torch,
                  almost inverted, and in the other the cup of life, with but a few drops of dregs
                  at the bottom. Under her feet lay meek-eyed angels, the hopes of this world—but
                  they have lost their wings; they are helplessly abject to sorrow; yet like him
                  whose soul they have brightened, waiting for the change which makes them
                  immortal.
               And beyond the vision of that old man, though not beyond the outstretching of his
                  arms, hangs the glittering veil that his last feeble breath shall rend asunder;
                  and beyond that, O! who has ever yet painted the glories of heaven?
               God bless the aged! Children, bend your heads at their approach, lift your hats
                  reverently, speak to them as you would to God's messengers, love them dearly, and
                  never insult their gray hairs by one irreverent word or thoughtless smile.
               God bless the aged!
               —What Not.
               
            
            
               CLOTHING AND EXERCISE OF INFANTS.
               THERE seems to be a decided determination on the part of man to mar as far as
                  possible the Creator's intentions respecting his chief work. In the Ethnological
                  room of the British Museum may be seen a cradle, so contrived as to flatten down
                  the forehead of the infant, and to give it all the appearance of an idiot. In the
                  Celestial Empire the feet are so cunningly bandaged as effectually to make a
                  Chinese lady hobble all her life; and, until very lately, a neighboring nation,
                  who, like the Chinese, boast of being in the van of civilization, without,
                  however, laying claim as yet to the immutability of their institutions, used to
                  bind up the limbs and bodies of their little ones as carefully as the Egyptians
                  did their dead. We have fortunately no such plans to deprecate at home, but when seeing an infant dressed for the
                  first time, we have often been struck with the idea that many of the pretty little
                  things with which he is harnessed might be dispensed with. We are afraid we have
                  already said enough to raise against us a whole army of mothers, grand-mothers,
                  and nurses; but having given utterance to half our opinions, it would be unmanly
                  not to conclude, and say that, in our estimation, so long as an infant is a
                  perfectly passive little thing, without even the power of crawling, it would be
                  quite enough to bandage him with a roller, and dress him in a loose gown. With a
                  flannel and a blanket the child may be made as warm as necessary. At all events,
                  there should be nothing tight about him, and, above all, no pins by which he might
                  be wounded.
               The child should be accustomed to go bare-headed both day and night. This is
                  generally admitted by medical men to be the best plan of warding off a tendency to
                  determination of blood to the head, and those affections of the brain which are so
                  fatal at that age. A thin cap, as gay as a mother wishes, can be always ready to
                  be put on, so often as the child is brought down into the drawing room, to be the
                  cynosure of all eyes, and the admired of all observers.
               We think it good to short-clothe a child early, and thus to give him as soon as
                  possible the greatest freedom of his limbs; but in this, parents must be guided by
                  the season of the year, as it would not be well to make this change in winter. On
                  undressing a child from two to three years of age, we frequently find the frock
                  tied tightly around the waist, so as to give a graceful appearance to the figure;
                  for the same reason are the under-garments similarly tightened, and sometimes so
                  much so that red lines are marked upon the body. Now it must be apparent to all
                  that this constant pressure must tend to prevent the full development of the chest
                  requisite for respiration, which is repeated so many times during every minute,
                  and that it must likewise interfere with the growth of the child. Again, the
                  little clothes are supported by bands and tapes which are called shoulder-straps,
                  although they are not so in reality, for they are thrown off the shoulders to make
                  the children look pretty, and press upon the side of the arm about an inch below
                  the head of a bone which can be easily felt, and is the humerus or bone of the arm. This pressure cannot be made without
                  depriving the child of the free use of his arms, to extend which he has to
                  overcome the weight and pressure of the clothes. Muscular action being thus
                  impaired, the child is prompted to assume a stooping position, and thus is laid
                  the first foundation of round shoulders, of contraction of the chest, and of
                  flattening of the ribs.
               But in this favored land there are many mothers judicious enough to consider the
                  health of their little ones of more importance than their appearance, and will
                  seek it by all the means which can be brought home to their understanding. Having
                  been told that the child should be left free of his dress, they will take care
                  that there be sufficient space for the hand to pass freely under his clothes, and
                  then fancy that the child's health is safe so far as dress is concerned; but the
                  body runs almost as great a chance of deformity on account of the plan of throwing
                  the shoulder-straps off the shoulders, so that the whole weight of the clothes
                  presses on the side of the arm and under its joint.
               Such are the defects of the present system of dressing children. By showing how
                  they ought to be dressed, we shall at the same time show how these defects can be
                  avoided. The child's shirt should be roomy, but not too full so as to make
                  creases. The bodice should be made long-waisted, and to fit the frame, but a large
                  piece of elastic tissue in front should permit the free expansion of the chest, as
                  in the child's bodice, invented by Mrs. Caplin. The shoulder straps should be sewn
                  in front of the bodice, and pass over the shoulders so as to cross each other, and
                  button under the blade-bone of the opposite side; for if, as Mr. Bishop has shown,
                  the weight of the soldier's knapsack should rest as much as possible on the
                  shoulders, it stands to reason that the shoulders should bear the weight of the
                  child's clothes. The petticoats must be buttoned to the lower part of the bodice,
                  so that no tight strings may impede respiration. The frock ought not to be made
                  tighter than the bodice: it must rest, like it, upon the shoulder, so that it may
                  no more impede the raising of the arms than a man's coat. In a few words, the
                  weight of the clothes should rest upon the shoulders by a band, which can be made
                  of elastic tissue; and until the eighth or ninth year, when the hip in girls is
                  sufficiently formed to sustain the petticoats, they should be buttoned to the bodice. Mothers and
                  dressmakers may object to covering the shoulders, but by so doing, the chest will
                  be preserved against the evil effects of a variable temperature, so often causing
                  fatal complaints; and if the shoulders are covered in childhood, they will be
                  better worth exhibiting at a later period in life. Fashion at this moment,
                  however, coincides with common sense, and children are beginning to be dressed
                  more "en cœur," as it is termed, or to show less of the shoulder; and perhaps even
                  some of our most prejudiced fair readers will smile our forgiveness when we tell
                  them that the shoulder-straps can be so arranged as to be passed under the arm,
                  completely out of sight, whenever the mother is anxious to show off her little one
                  to the best advantage.
               Flannel next the skin is unnecessary, and should be kept in reserve in case it
                  should be required at some later period of life; but if children are delicate, or
                  prone to chilblains, lamb's-wool socks should be worn throughout the winter.
               There is nothing exaggerated in the following picture of a fashionably-dressed
                  child, as drawn by Dr. Maunsel, in his valuable work: "Who has not seen one of
                  those miserable victims of parental vanity, whose appearance in our streets will
                  sometimes, upon a March or November day, strike cold into our hearts? The cap and
                  feathers set upon, not covering, the child's head, and probably of a colour and
                  richness contrasting mournfully with blue ears, sharpened nose, and shrunken
                  cheeks, in which cold has assumed the features of starvation,—the short kilt and
                  Highland hose, exposing between them cracked and shivering knees,—altogether
                  require for their description more graphic power than we presume to lay claim
                  to."
               Need we say that a mother should not gratify her vanity by letting her little ones
                  thus go bare-legged, or sometimes even bare-kneed in winter, since there are 
                     wollen
                     woollen
                   leggings to be had? For if she so much wishes to see the contrast of the
                  flesh-colour on the white displayed above and below, we suggest the possibility of
                  matching the flesh tint so well in some warm material, that children may be kept
                  warm, while they seem to be "sans culotte."
               During the first months of infancy, exercise is principally passive, and the nurse
                  should be careful never to carry the infant in a sitting position,
                  during at least the first four or five months. If this precaution be neglected,
                  its large and heavy head will be observed to hang over on one side, in such a way
                  as to impede breathing and even swallowing. Hufeland mentions a case in which even
                  death was caused to a very young infant by a sudden jerk of the head to one side.
                  After the fourth or fifth month, the sitting position may be allowed for a few
                  minutes at a time, if the child seems to like it. But when the infant is
                  prematurely carried in this way, even the compression upon the chest, caused by
                  the hand supporting it in front is not unattended with inconvenience.
               "In lifting young children," as Dr. Barlow has observed, "the nurse
                  should be very careful never to lay hold of them by the arms, as is sometimes
                  thoughtlessly done; but always to place the hands, one on each side of the chest,
                  immediately below the armpits. In infancy, the sockets of the joints are so
                  shallow, and the bones so feebly bound down and connected with each other, that
                  dislocation and even fracture of the collar-bone may easily be produced by
                  neglecting this rule.
               "There is one very common mode of exercising infants, which, we think, deserves
                  particular notice—we mean the practice of hoisting or raising them aloft in the
                  air. Some people are so energetic as to throw up children and catch them in
                  descending. This rashness there can be no hesitation in reprobating; for however
                  confident the person may be of not missing his hold, there must ever be risk of
                  injury from the concussion suffered in the descent, and even from the firmness of
                  grasp necessary for recovering and maintaining the hold. The motion of the body,
                  too, has a direct tendency to induce vertigo; and when the liability of the infant
                  brain to congestion and its consequences is considered,—when the frequency of
                  hydrocephalus in infants is borne in mind, an exercise which impels blood to the
                  brain will not be regarded as wholly insignificant."
               When the infant begins to be strong enough to take active exercise, he should be
                  placed on a carpet, or, in fine weather on the grass, with a few playthings in
                  reach and then allowed to teach himself to use his muscles for crawling and
                  walking. The nurse should watch him without meddling with his first efforts, or
                  frightening him by her tones of fearful apprehension.
            
            
            
               
               LETTER TO A DISTANT FRIEND,
               Upon hearing of the death of her youngest darling child, of two and
                  a half years
               
                  MY DEAR MRS. N.,
               
               I was both surprised and pained, to learn, by an eastern paper, a few days since,
                  that your dear and cherished boy had been removed from you by death. I, of course,
                  know nothing of the circumstances attending his decease; but whatever they were, I
                  know indeed that they must have been painful to a mother's heart; and especially
                  so to one who has repeatedly been called to part with the dear objects of her
                  affection. My first emotion was the deepest sympathy for you, and I would fain now
                  make such an expression of that sympathy, as would in some way soothe or console
                  you in your sad bereavement—but how difficult to offer any thing in mitigation of
                  grief when a tenderly loved object has been taken from us, though conscious that
                  the rod is appointed by an unerring hand. I would not bid you cease to mourn, for
                  when the heart is crushed and well nigh broken, nature demands time,
                  at least for its healing. I would not bid you forget, for in the sad recollections
                  of that dear child, you may experience some of the happiest moments of your life.
                  How often will every association connected with his short pilgrimage pass in
                  review before your mind's eye, and at each time will the remembrance of him become
                  infinitely dearer to your heart.
               He was indeed lovely in his life—I can seem to see him, with his deep blue eyes
                  and laughing lips, closely nestled in his mother's arms. But, dear E., can you not
                  think of him now as incomparably more lovely, disencumbered from his tenement of
                  clay, enjoying the immediate presence of his Saviour, and reflecting his
                  resplendent glory?—I know your heart, and indeed your whole being, yearns for his
                  companionship—you each day miss more and more his sweet voice, and the thousand
                  interesting ways and incidents connected with the development of his various
                  faculties, which none but a mother could fully appreciate; and yet would you be
                  willing to recall him to this world of sorrow and perplexity, to take him from
                  that omnipotent Friend, who said, when on earth, "suffer little children to come
                  unto me and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of heaven?"—How
                  delightful, dear E., to think that you have been permitted to commence the
                  training and discipline of an immortal spirit, the completion and perfection of
                  whose discipline is to be by your Heavenly Father. 'Tis a fearful thought
                  truly,—and yet what a distinguishing favor, that you have been chosen for so
                  momentous a work; how sweet the reflection that the undying spark, which so
                  recently animated your own cherished babe, is now uniting with angels in praising
                  God and the Lamb.
               It is true you have been repeatedly and severely afflicted—but has not each
                  affliction brought with it a balm? What 
                     satisfation
                     satisfaction
                   in the consciousness that each dear object of your affection is now at
                  rest; that no more care, no more sorrow can ever assail them. When thinking of
                  that group of your own little ones, that loved sister, and those dear brothers now
                  holding communion with spirits purified and redeemed through the blood of Christ,
                  around the throne of God, do you not feel at times as if you would fain loosen the
                  cords that bind you to earth, and soar away and be at rest in those heavenly
                  mansions? How cordial the welcome you may expect from those loved ones;—how
                  delightful the consciousness that there is a beloved family group, assembled in
                  the courts above, observing with intense interest the effect of these oft repeated
                  afflictions, and prepared to hail you with shouts of joy, when you shall have
                  finished your course on earth, and through Christ shall have won the crown of
                  rejoicing, prepared for those who love God.
               I know full well, dear E., that this is indeed a severe bereavement, for I
                  remember distinctly how fondly your affections twined around that darling babe;
                  with what untiring love you watched over his infantile helplessness, and that he
                  seemed an indispensable part of yourself; yet I truly hope you will be enabled to
                  see the hand of God in it, and to feel that he does not afflict willingly.
                  Remember he is a God of love, and endeavor, if possible, to appreciate in some
                  degree at least, his goodness in lending you such a blessing, even for a short time. He gave—and
                  shall he not recall his own?
               Every mother's heart must be filled with intense anxiety for the welfare of her
                  children, while exposed to the temptations of this life of sin and sorrow; but by
                  the early removal of your loved one, you have been spared all doubts, all fears in
                  regard to his future; when had he lived to manhood, he alone who knows the end
                  from the beginning could tell what trials might have awaited him, or to what
                  temptations he might have yielded. And now can you not feel grateful that his
                  presence was so early required in the "celestial city," thereby rendering it
                  impossible for him to suffer by contact with the manifold impurities of this
                  world?—What safety in feeling that he is with Jesus. Remember that our ascended
                  Saviour knows full well the bitterness of your cup of affliction; he sees the
                  fullness of your heart, and can you not with the eye of faith seem to see him
                  yearning over you, his countenance beaming with love and sympathy? We are assured
                  that he wept with his afflicted friends when on earth, and we cannot for a moment
                  suppose that his interest in those who love him, is in the least diminished. And
                  now I beg you, let your trust in him be so entire, your faith so perfect, that you
                  will feel that it is indeed a mercy that he has seen fit to take the guardianship
                  of these dear little ones, bearing in mind that the separation will be only a few
                  short years at most. Rest assured these afflictions will work out for you a far
                  more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, than you could possibly otherwise
                  enjoy.
               I would most gladly be with you, my dear friend, to perform those offices of
                  kindness and sympathy, which are so grateful to one in the hour of affliction, but
                  that may not be. I trust other hands are near, to discharge such duties, since
                  distance deprives me of the privilege. I commit you again to our dear Redeemer,
                  who alone is able to sustain you, and make your pathway once more joyous. Adieu,
                  dear E—.
               
                  Aff'ly,
                  A—E.
               
            
            
               SABBATH MORNING
               
                  SWEET and mellow is the chiming
                  Of the Sabbath morning bell;
                  Angels come on earth to linger,
                  While of Jesus' love they tell.
                  Hark! as through the air they float,
                  Sweetly swells each tender note.
               
               
                  From distracting cares they call us,
                  From the wide world's angry strife,
                  And with sweet constraint they draw us
                  To the wells of heavenly life;
                  Wells whose waters, ever sure,
                  Through eternity endure.
               
               
                  Blessed Saviour, may our spirits,
                  In a waiting frame be found;
                  Keep us humble, keep us prayerful,
                  While we tread on hallowed ground;
                  Let us lean upon thy breast,
                  Foretaste of eternal rest.
               
               
                  Sabbaths seem like sweet oases
                  In the desert of our life,
                  Where we come to sing thy praises,
                  From the rude world's noise and strife;
                  Oh! may all such seasons prove,
                  Rich repasts of heavenly love.
               
               
                  And when we again are scattered,
                  Mid the tumult and the din,
                  May our souls be kept in safety,
                  From the tainting touch of sin;
                  May we ever strive to be,
                  Blessed Saviour, more like thee.

               CARRIE'S LESSON.
               BY MISS M. A. COLLIER.
               CARRIE LENOX was but ten years old when she went, for the summer season, to a
                  boarding school in the country. It was a damp, chilly afternoon in the beginning
                  of May, when she stood upon the steps of a very large, very old-fashioned brick
                  house, at the corner of — street in Boston. A dark merino frock, and a little
                  straight willow bonnet was her traveling dress; and stepping lightly into the
                  coach that drove up the street, stopping at her father's door, she was whirled
                  away, and before many minutes had passed, was looking out upon green fields. The
                  spring had been so cold and backward that Carrie was surprised at the verdure of
                  the country, but her observations were soon replaced by a new set of images, for a
                  ride of a couple of hours had brought her to her new home. She found herself in a
                  spacious sitting-room, plainly furnished, with a grave-looking carpet, of brown
                  and white, flag-seated chairs, and a piano. About a dozen girls, mostly older than
                  herself, were enjoying the luxury of a very cheerful fire in an open grate.
               It needed only one sight of the face of Mrs. Howard, the mistress of this mansion,
                  and one tone of welcome from her lips, to make all these girls, and Carrie among
                  the rest, feel happy and at home. There was a peculiar charm in her manner of
                  addressing them. All felt its power. Each pupil was wont, from this institution,
                  to bear away, into future life, a memory so dear, as to be almost sacred, of one
                  who was at once instructress, companion, friend.
               It was on the first day of this term, a cold, easterly storm came on; and it
                  lasted for several days, making the blazing fire in the sitting-room a real
                  blessing. Suddenly, however, the wind changed, and the sun shone out so warm and
                  bright, that the whole world seemed rejoicing. The lilac budded, and the flowers
                  hung in masses of rich purple on the fresh green trees. Carrie loved to be in the
                  country. She had found here, moreover, some girls of her own age, and she loved
                  (who could help it?) Mrs. Howard, dearly.
               Some of the girls came from a great distance, and Carrie had an especial pity for
                  one little girl whose home was in Texas, and whose parents visited her only once
                  in two years. Far different was it with Carrie, for on pleasant summer afternoons,
                  her mother would often ride out in a carriage to see her.
               One afternoon, just as she was finishing her drawing lesson, and was in the act of
                  giving the last touch to a group of old, rough-looking trees by the side of a
                  stream, she heard the gentle voice of Mrs. Howard, telling her that company had
                  arrived, and that she might be released for the time from school. She looked out
                  from the school-room window, and saw her mother alighting from the carriage. She
                  bounded to the door and was enfolded in a warm embrace.
               "Did you take your mother into your sleeping-room, Carrie?" asked Mrs. Howard, at
                  the tea-table that same evening. Carrie replied that she had done so. Mrs. Howard
                  smiled, and added, "I hope she found it in good order." Carrie
                  blushed deeply at this remark, so deeply, that Mrs. Howard could not help noticing
                  it. She waited for a moment, in silence. At last Carrie looked up, and met the
                  inquiring glance of Mrs. Howard.
               "How was it, Carrie?" said that lady.
               "Indeed, I cannot keep my things in order. I am always trying, but I
                  never can." Here a shadow came over her countenance as she added, "my mother was
                  greatly displeased."
               "If," said Mrs. Howard, "you are always trying, and never succeeding, it is very
                  strange."
               "Well, I am always trying, but somehow, things will get out of
                  place—the first that I know about it, they are all in a heap."
               "And you really wish to improve?"
               "Indeed I do, dear Mrs. Howard.
               After rising from the table, both went together to the chamber of Carrie. It was
                  in tolerable order, owing to the reproof of her mother, who had so lately been
                  there; but the willow bonnet, lying upon the bed, was crushed by the shawl that
                  had been thrown upon it. Moreover, half a dozen sheets of letter paper had been
                  blown from the table to the floor, where they were scattered tered, and a corner of the long, white window
                  curtain was unfortunately dipped into the inkstand.
               Carrie quickly folded up the shawl, and laid it, with the bonnet, on a shelf in
                  the closet, then she picked up the white paper and laid it all carefully in the
                  little drawer of the table. Then the room looked tidy.
               "I see," said Mrs. Howard, "that you can put your room in order; now the thing is
                  to keep it so." As Mrs. Howard said this, she took a crayon pencil from Carrie's
                  drawer, and wrote with it on half a sheet of paper, in large black letters,
                  "FIVE."
               "What is that for?" asked Carrie.
               "You shall see, my dear," said the lady, as with a quiet smile in her eye, she
                  proceeded to fasten the paper to the wall. Carrie looked on, wondering.
               "This," said Mrs. Howard, when she had finished, "is to help you to keep things in
                  order."
               "I'm sure I cannot see how."
               "That I am going to tell you," said the teacher. "Every day it is part of your
                  morning duty to devote five minutes to the special purpose of ascertaining whether
                  or not there is any disorder in your room; a trunk, or drawer, or box, that has by
                  any means become disarranged, anything, however trifling or minute, that is not in
                  as perfect order as possible."
               Carrie kissed her teacher, and thanked her for the suggestion.
               "The constant sight of this paper," said Mrs. Howard, (which I admit is by no
                  means an ornament) "will prevent you from forgetting."
               When the summer term closed, Carrie's habits of neatness and order were so
                  changed, that it was remarked by the other girls.
               Had she been a philosopher, instead of a school girl, she might have entertained
                  herself by watching the inner growth of the love of order—the passion for
                  arrangement. She might have observed, carefully, how it extended itself from one
                  class of objects to another, and another; how the eye, educated by special
                  attention each day for a period of time too short to be felt as a loss, became
                  pained at the sight of the disorderly desk in the school room, and almost without
                  intention kept it carefully arranged.
               When Carrie returned home the next winter, occupying once more her own room, she
                  had no need of the black letters to remind her of disorder, and found herself
                  doubly rewarded in the value of the habit, and the pleasure of her mother.
            
            
               TO A CHILD.
               
                  NEVER, my child, forget to pray,
                  Whate'er the business of the day;
                  If happy dreams have bless'd thy sleep,
                  If startling dreams have made thee weep,
                  With holy thoughts begin the day,
                  And ne'er, my child, forget to pray.
               
               
                  Pray Him by whom the birds are fed,
                  To give to thee thy daily bread;
                  If wealth her bounty should bestow,
                  Praise Him from whom all blessings flow;
                  If He who gave should take away,
                  O ne'er, my child, forget to pray.
               
               
                  The time will come when thou wilt miss
                  A father's and a mother's kiss;
                  And then, my child, perchance thou'lt see
                  Some who in prayer ne'er bend the knee,
                  From such examples turn away,
                  And ne'er, my child, forget to pray.
               
            
            
            
               
               PHILOSOPHY OF THE HUMAN VOICE.
               THAT "there is a right way of doing everything," is an oft-repeated adage, the due
                  observance of which has ever been attended with satisfaction and pleasure. Its
                  application, however, to the production of voice, is almost completely lost sight
                  of. It is true that, in singing, such things as compass, modulation and
                  inflection, are held to be essential. But it would seem that, in speaking, the
                  wisdom of the adage had been studiously avoided, and the wrong way deliberately
                  pursued. Indeed, so widespread is the evil, that it is beginning to be no uncommon
                  thing to say of the public speaker, "Oh, I care nothing about his voice; I look
                  for development of mind."
               Now, surely if vocal culture be necessary to set forth the sentiment of song, it
                  is also necessary to render speech effective; and especially so, when it is
                  considered, that speaking is a comparative degree of musical utterance.
               The true sentiment of speech can only be realized when the speaker approaches his
                  auditors in the order of their physical as well as intellectual
                  nature, and this can only be accomplished when attitude, gesture, and voice, are
                  all employed to the best advantage. It should be borne in mind that the outer man,
                  with its senses and susceptibilities, is the great avenue to the inner, and that
                  therefore the speaker should be a man of good and acceptable physical as well as
                  intellectual and moral manifestations. He must be able to subdue the inner man, by
                  appealing through the same susceptibilities as does the hero of the stage, when he
                  sets the mere combustibles of the soul on fire. But if the voice be destitute of
                  volume and music, the speaker lacks the power on which he must rely,
                  if he would fire the soul and sway the mind.
               When we look around, and see great numbers of the sweetest singers hanging their
                  harps on the willows; when we see the most eloquent counselors retiring from the
                  bar, and the profoundest statesmen silenced in the halls of their country; when we
                  see thousands of the messengers of peace, dropping like stars from their orbits,
                  and doomed to perpetual silence, their message not half delivered; and all for
                  want of a correct knowledge of the nature and properties of the human voice, we
                  feel that we have a mission of great importance and responsibility to perform, and
                  we are oppressed with the fullness and value of our subject, and of our own
                  personal inadequacy to exemplify the views we are called upon to advance.
               The object of the present lecture is, to demonstrate that the diseases incident to
                  public speakers and singers may be both prevented and relieved, and the weakest
                  and harshest voice made strong and melodious; in doing which, we shall first
                  invite your attention to some remarks on the production of voice.
               One of the most common errors is to confound cause and effect, and to mistake the
                  latter for the former, the manifestation for the producing cause. Hence the
                  prevalent opinion that the chest, lungs, and throat are the organs to be used in
                  the production of voice. But it is a still more common error to locate cause and
                  effect in close proximity, whereas the effect is an ultimate, and proceeds always
                  as far away as possible from the cause, before it manifests itself. This is an
                  immutable law.
               The electricity generated at the cylinder, industriously seeks the end of the
                  wire, to flash forth the proofs of its existence. The effect of the cannon ball is
                  not in or near the gun. Precisely so, is it with the human voice. Generated, so to
                  speak, at the base of the pyramid or trunk, it ascends to the throat, and
                  manifests itself in that remote locality.
               Let it be observed, then, that all the varied and sensible phenomena of expiration
                  are, in conjunction with atmospheric pressure, produced by the contraction of the
                  abdominal and dorsal muscles upon the viscera, so that the viscera, by being
                  continuously pressed against each other, from below upward, shall act upon the
                  lungs at each muscular contraction, and thus mechanically expel the air. The
                  throat and its attachments perform the same office in speaking, that the fingers
                  perform in playing on the flute. They have no agency in the creation or expulsion
                  of sound, except their modulation of the same, which is denominated voice.
               The human trunk is governed and moved on much the same principle as a pair of bellows, and may, in most
                  respects be compared with the same; the throat or windpipe, answering to the
                  passive metallic pipe or nose of the bellows; the chest, to the great vault or
                  cheek, having, like the bellows, no self-contracting power by which
                  to expel the air. The abdominal muscles answer to the handles of the bellows,
                  shutting or contracting the vault by their proper action, compressing the
                  furniture within, and forcing it against the lungs, thus mechanically expelling
                  the air. We also see, that like the handles of the bellows, the abdominal muscles
                  are situated at the most remote and largest part of the chest or vault, to
                  increase their force of leverage on the same, at its most movable part. Now who,
                  in using a pair of bellows, would seize them by the sides or nose? And yet every
                  one who attempts to talk from the lungs or throat performs an act equally
                  absurd.
               So true, indeed, is it, that articulated sound is the result of abdominal effort,
                  that if the viscera are suddenly elevated against the lungs, with a favorable
                  position of the vocal tube, dead or alive the man must speak! This may seem
                  incredible. It is nevertheless true, as an illustration from the history of our
                  own experience will sufficiently show:—Many years ago, a party of body-snatchers
                  started off, in bold defiance of popular feeling, to possess themselves of a new
                  subject. But fearing detection, and being in great haste to escape with the body,
                  they laid it rather roughly on its back across a rail, when, by a sudden
                  contraction of the abdomen, a most unearthly and terrific sound was expelled
                  through the vocal tube, causing every hair to stand erect upon the heads of the
                  disturbers of the dead man's repose. And so much of a reality was this voice from
                  the dead, that one of the resurrectionists instinctively seized a club to inflict
                  a blow upon his supernatural adversary, for whom, in the dark, he mistook one of
                  his associates, and commenced beating him with a will.
               The great secret of developing and preserving the voice, lies in the due exercise
                  of the organs which produce and modulate the same.
               You have only to listen to the deep, guttural, and proud tones of the untutored
                  Indian, to feel that he speaks from the deeps; that he, too, boosts
                  or lifts out his characteristic tones. His stately form and erect
                  head, indicate the tense and firm condition of his abdominal muscles. These are
                  just adapted by their slightest contraction to compress the lungs and
                  force the air through the comparatively straight vocal tube. And, when he sings
                  his war-song, and yells his war-whoop, he is able by this means to make the welkin
                  ring, and drive terror into the very bones of his enemies. Yet, I have been unable
                  to learn that an Indian was ever hoarse or bronchitic, from vocal effort. His
                  physical habits forbid it.
               Take next the infant, before he is old enough to go astray. Lay him upon his back
                  for a cold wash. See how he pushes out his feet, and spreads his toes, thrusts out
                  his arms and clinches his fists; how he throws back his head, opens his mouth,
                  straightens his spine, draws in a full inspiration, contracts his abdomen,
                  concentrates all his energies in one strong pull, and a pull
                  altogether of his muscles, whereby the lungs are directly compressed, and
                     don't he scream? repeating and re-repeating the charge, with
                  undiminished energy and clearness, until the house is brought to terms, and all
                  without the least hoarseness, or inconvenience to himself? Now lay your hand upon
                  his abdomen at the zenith of one of his screams. The contracted abdominal muscles
                  will be found so tense, that you will begin to fancy your hand in contact with a
                  satchel of live snakes. But so soon as he relaxes his muscles for a new
                  expiration, his abdomen is as soft as down. The same principle also applies to all
                  instinctive and involuntary utterances, common and necessary to the action of the
                  physical organization, which, to the reflective mind, needs no specification.
               Public speakers, especially clergymen, who suffer from bronchitis and other vocal
                  derangements, usually suppose that the pain and weariness of the back, the
                  constipation, the indigestion, and great sense of vacancy and
                     "goneness" in the region of the stomach and breast, which they
                  generally experience, are all caused by the affection of their throat, and
                  accordingly expend much money, and oftentimes much vital energy, by local and
                  constitutional appliances therefor, in the hope, as they often express it, of
                  "preserving the power to serve in the sanctuary;" whereas their physical indolence and indiscretion have
                  induced a relaxation of the muscles, and a consequent derangement of the viscera
                  and nervous system, producing a train of evils which subsequently, if not
                  simultaneously, affect the throat, thus affording to all an easy illustration of
                  the way in which the effect is mistaken for the cause. The difficulty generally
                  begins at college, where the body is too often unscrupulously robbed to benefit
                  the mind, just as though a clergyman was expected to live without a body, or as
                  though his mind was practically anything without a healthful body. The ground-work
                  of ruin once laid, it is easy enough to go on in a lazy and lounging manner of
                  studying and preaching, until the wreck is complete; and then, forsooth, this
                  breaking down of body and mind is quaintly, if not wickedly termed, "wearing out
                  in the gospel!"
               In order to exhibit the cause of this disease and of other vocal derangements, let
                  us take the case of a minister who preaches calmly by note from a low desk, with
                  the head depressed, the shoulders drooping, and the mouth not freely opened.
                  First, then, he bends forward, and relaxes the muscles of the abdomen, which lets
                  down the viscera from supporting the diaphragm, and thus deprives himself of the
                  proper vocal leverage, the starting-point in the production of the voice. Next, he
                  contracts the dimensions of the lower chest, and of course compresses the lungs
                  there, compelling the superior lobes to do more than their part. In the next place
                  he is compelled to speak by the contraction of the chest, caused by bending
                  forward and inclining his shoulders, and not by the uplifting of the abdomen, as
                  he should speak. The expelling power is thus applied at right angles and not in a
                  direct line. Of course, then, more power is required and more force is exerted in
                  this unnatural mode upon the tubes or air cells, inducing a straining or
                  concussion in them, which is both painful and permanently injurious. Besides,
                  under these circumstances, the air is not expelled directly upward, but sent out
                  in all directions, and thus a general concussion is produced, together with a
                  confused and vibrating motion, instead of a smooth, 
                     continous
                     continuous
                  , and melodious sound.
               Thus it appears that bending the head forward in speaking presents a natural
                  obstacle to the progress of the air, making it strike the palatine arch or roof of
                  the mouth, whence it again rebounds, producing a general vibration in the whole
                  column of air, and of course a more or less violent and extensive concussion of
                  the lungs. The air is expelled by a continual sideways and oblique pressure, in
                  lieu of the direct and alternating pressure and collapse of the abdomen. When the
                  mouth is not opened freely, as in this posture it cannot be, the exit for the air
                  is not commensurate with the volume passing upward and seeking egress. This
                  constitutes another mechanical obstruction, which again increases the concussion
                  and scatters the air, driving some of it through the clenched teeth, or the
                  elongated mouth—a shape not celebrated for producing the proper sounds of the
                  vowels—and forcing it backward and out of the nostrils.
               To the public speaker, then, we say, you must stand erect, elevate the head, move
                  the lips freely, vary the shape of your mouth so as to cause the various vowel
                  sounds to be clearly emitted, and expand your chest. The body should talk all at
                  once. Let neck and heels turn speaker. Strive to concentrate the will upon the
                  abdominal muscles, so as to effect their sudden contraction at each syllable, as
                  in ejaculating the word shoo!
               
               Ministers of the gospel should leave off preaching by note, or use an elevated
                  framework to hold their manuscript, so that they can stand erect, at some
                  distance, and yet read distinctly, by merely casting the eye upon the page,
                  without bending the head or back. They can then see their audience, and the
                  audience in turn may see the minister's face, not the top of his
                  head. His attitude will thus become correct, to say nothing of the more graceful
                  and manly bearing, and his vocal organs performing each their appropriate work,
                  the speaker will stand some reasonable chance of holding the attention of his
                  people. His voice will also be clear and of a large volume, pleasant alike to
                  himself and his hearers; and though his throat be sore, dry, and stiff, he may
                  continue to preach, not only without further injury, but almost without
                  inconvenience, for every effort he now makes will contribute to the improvement of
                  his voice, just in the same way that a limb diseased from want of proper exercise
                  shall improve by the supply of that want.
               But after all, though beautiful and desirable it be to stand forth as a Man, how few aspire to the true dignity of
                  manhood. Physical education is not deemed necessary to the formation of the noble
                  structure, and yet every one knows that the mere cultivation of the intellect is
                  not a sufficient guarantee for an erect and symmetrical form of body. It is a
                  lamentable thing that man should live on, generation after generation, as though
                  he were totally incapable of appreciating the loftiness and the loveliness of his
                  physical bearing.
               If we fully realized the important truth, that sooner or later the day of
                  reckoning about the use of our bodies must surely come, more of the time and
                  talent of the present age would be enlisted in the cause of physical education.
                  Nor would mechanical pathology be so much neglected, as that a class of diseases,
                  not cognizant of medicine, and which from their very nature, can only be
                  aggravated by constitutional treatment, should be spread upon the list of human
                  woes. Alas! the watchmen are asleep; the world is almost intoxicated with
                  psychological abstractions; and, the once noble and imposing physical structure of
                  man, is fast receding before the destructive influences of polished,
                     civilized life!
               In conclusion, let me say, that I should be untrue to Medical Science and the best
                  interests of Society, as well as to myself, if I did not here remark, that the
                  treatment of diseases originating from improper postures in speaking and singing,
                  consists in the mechanical replacement of the organs, and in
                  attending to such things as shall restore to them the power to preserve their
                  natural and reciprocal relations.

               A WORD TO CHRISTIAN MOTHERS.
               ALLOW me to address a few words to Christian mothers, and ask of them a few plain,
                  practical questions. I would ask, do we, who are mothers, have upon our minds
                  continually such a sense of the amazing responsibility devolving upon us as we
                  should have? Does this sense of responsibility hang, as it were, with weight upon
                  our minds, that it is uppermost in our thoughts? If so, what corresponding effect
                  does it produce upon our course of action in respect to our children? Some mothers
                  will doubtless exclaim, (as I have myself heard them,) "what! do you wish us to
                  become slaves to our children, and sacrifice the best
                  period of our lives in unceasing watchfulness over them?" We answer no, not
                     slaves, but Christian mothers, deeply feeling as you
                  ought, that the immortal destiny of your little ones is, in a most important
                  sense, trusted in your hands, and that with almost as much facility as the potter
                  moulds the yielding clay to the desired shape, can you mould and shape the mind
                  and morals, committed to you for that purpose; that is, provided you commence
                  young enough, and guard against strong counteracting influences, which might
                  render yours of no avail. Does not that woman desecrate the name of
                     mother, who can feel anything a sacrifice to secure
                  so great and glorious a result as the successful training of a child for heaven!
                  To mothers who thus feel, I have nothing to say, since their conscience must be
                  seared to all religious arguments on the subject, but that there are not a few of
                  such, who call themselves Christians, we have, unfortunately for the church and
                  the world, too much evidence.
               There are, however, many who are sincerely desirous to do right, in the training
                  of their young children, who still from want of thought, and the pressure of other
                  cares, are in danger of neglecting the subject entirely. Will such pardon me,
                  while I ask and answer a few questions, which may present the matter plainly to
                  their attention. Do you make it the daily duty of your lives, to teach to your
                  children so much of divine truth as time will allow, reading to them, explaining
                  and enforcing the words of inspiration. This is a duty which most mothers seem to
                  feel quite unnecessary. They wait until their children are of sufficient age to
                  attend the Sabbath school, and having consigned them to the care of a teacher,
                  they feel as if their duty was all discharged. But what a vast mistake is thus
                  committed. Those years in which the child is considered too young to be taught
                  religiously, are the very ones most precious to the mother, who is desirous to
                  imbue the mind of her child with a love for God's word, and a veneration for
                  religion. The little child who would not listen to the words of his teacher in
                  Sabbath school, but whose eyes and
                  thoughts would be wandering from one end of the room to the other, would drink in
                  with intense interest and delight, the words of pleasant instruction from the lips
                  of a beloved mother, as he sits by her side in the still hour of twilight, or the
                  privacy of the chamber. I would not deem it advisable to read to a little child
                  wholly from the word of God, since it would be unintelligible, and therefore not
                  interesting to such a mind; but there are most valuable epitomes, designed
                  expressly to meet the difficulty, such as the series called, "Line upon Line,"
                  "Peep of Day," &c., which are invaluable to the mother, and will create an
                  appetite for the Bible itself. I have known this course of religious instruction
                  commenced at the age of four years, and continued for two or three years, each
                  night, just before the time of rest for the child had arrived, until the severest
                  deprivation which could be inflicted for any fault, was a refusal to read as
                  usual; so that when told to prepare for bed, the invariable inquiry of the child
                  was, "Mother will you read to me," and, at the close of a chapter, always a
                  petition for more. Let any mother try the course recommended for a few months, and
                  I am well satisfied neither she nor her children would willingly forego the
                  privilege.
               Are you habitually careful, that both by word and deed you do not counteract,
                  yourself, the religious instruction you impart to your children? Do you diligently
                  teach and enforce upon them, obedience to God's commands, and yet constantly
                  violate these laws yourself? Do you constantly adopt the maxims, habits, and modes
                  of thinking of the world, and do you expect them to do otherwise? Do you teach
                  them to "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy," and then by light and worldly
                  talk, entertaining visitors, or visiting yourself, on that holy day, set them an
                  example contrary to your precept? surely you need not wonder if they grow up
                  Sabbath breakers; so of any other duty. We do not sufficiently consider the
                  keenness of children's observation, and the quickness with which they draw their
                  conclusions, and act upon them—and that with them, as with
                     us, "practice is better than precept." Do you guard your children
                  carefully from counteracting influences, which may operate effectually upon their
                  minds, preventing any good results from your labors? This is a matter upon which
                  there prevails a lamentable remissness. We teach our children God's truth, and
                  have them instructed on the Sabbath, and then turn them over during all the
                  remainder of the time, to the care of wicked, corrupt and debased servants; who in
                  many instances, in less time than we take to teach them, undo all the fabric we
                  have industriously reared. I speak now of comparatively small children; for I hold
                  to the doctrine that, "just as the twig is bent, the tree's inclined," and think
                  there was much wisdom in the remark of the celebrated Roman pontiff, who said,
                  "give me the first seven years of your children's lives, and you may have the
                  balance." Those children who are not brought very young under wise and holy
                  influences, rarely are influenced by subsequent training, in the right way. It is
                  a fatal mistake to trust their opening minds, so susceptible of impressions,
                  either good or evil, to the care of wicked and immoral servants, for at least one
                  half their time; and we do believe it operates most fatally on the moral and
                  spiritual welfare of many children. We know of no way in which a mother can
                  prevent this evil, other than by obeying a solemn injunction of the great Apostle
                  of the Gentiles, which in these latter days seems to be of small repute, "let the
                  younger women be keepers at home;" but so long as the young mothers of the church
                  feel it of the first importance to spend their time in visiting and gossip, it is
                  in vain for us to expect that their children should not reap the bitter
                  consequences of their neglect.
               Do you conscientiously correct your children when detected in serious faults? This
                  question, in these days of enlightened reason, when mothers have
                  become so much wiser than Solomon, is one which is peculiarly distasteful to many
                  minds. Correction is certainly a painful and unpleasant duty; but if God's word be
                  true, it is as certainly a command as to pray, or read the Bible. The eternal
                  welfare of our little ones is placed in jeopardy, when it is neglected. "Correct
                  thy son with the rod, and thou shalt save his soul from hell." The best trained
                  and regulated children will occasionally need the divinely appointed remedy for
                  out-breaking sin, and that parent incurs a great responsibility who withholds it
                  wilfully. It is in vain to teach or pray with our children, and yet allow them to
                  grow up with uncorrected faults, and unrestrained passions. So long as society
                  requires the strong arm of the law to restrain out-breaking sin, so long will the rod, in the parental hand, be
                  needed to keep in check the little family community. Let any Christian read in
                  God's word the history of one of Israel's high priests—old Eli, in the days of
                  Samuel—and the judgments of God denounced against his sons, with the reprimand
                  given to himself, "thy sons have made themselves vile, and thou hast restrained
                  them not," and say if God's displeasure may be not as likely to follow, and his
                  judgments poured out, upon the heads of their offspring also. Let mothers only
                     reflect with the word of God in their hands, and half the work is
                  done. Children will be trained up in the way they should go, so that when old,
                  they will not depart from it.

               AN EXTRACT.—FOR DESPONDING MOTHERS.
               How much more subtile and difficult is moral than intellectual training. How hard
                  oftentimes to trace and correct and guide the hidden and intricate springs of
                  feeling, and motives of action that lie buried in the human heart. We try to
                  inculcate as much as possible, an abandonment of selfish interest in our children,
                  and a seeking of each other's happiness, but we are often compelled to feel that
                  we accomplish very little in giving these and kindred lessons. One thought,
                  however, may comfort us, and it is that we are often not aware how strong and
                  sincere are the efforts and resolutions which children do make to overcome
                  temptation, and to do right. They are creatures of impulse, of quick and ardent
                  feeling, of inexperience of their own moral weakness, and if we, who have all the
                  advantage of lessons learned in the school of maturity, of experience dearly
                  bought, of the treachery of our own hearts, and the weakness of our best
                  resolutions; if we find it requires moral effort—strong, unflinching, and constant
                  —to keep our hearts and lives, with all diligence, shall we wonder if they require
                  "line upon line, and precept upon precept, here a little and there a little?"
                  Shall we think some "strange thing hath happened," either to us or them, if after
                  we have endeavored to enforce kindness to each other, and have received sincere
                  and apparently earnest resolutions from them, that they will try always to act and
                  speak kindly, we hear the tart reply, and witness the selfish action? Yet we must
                  not be discouraged, if we do not see the immediate fruits of our labors, nor must
                  we infer that they will bring forth no fruit; for all the time there may be going
                  on within the soul of the child, a process of moral discipline, concealed from us,
                  yet not the less sure in its results upon the future character.
            
            
               OUR SARAH.
               
                  "OH! send the word Divine,
                  Far, far away;
                  In every heathen clime
                  Its light display.
                  Oh! let the Burman sing,
                  'Worthy is our Saviour, King.'
                  And loud his praises ring—
                  Praise, praise for aye.
               
               
                  "God's word to every land,
                  Send, send away;
                  He will with bounteous hand,
                  Our love repay.
                  Oh! we shall happy be,
                  When the heathen we shall see,
                  Dwelling, gracious Lord, with thee
                  In heaven, for aye.
               
               
                  "Oh! may we willing be,
                  With heart and hand;
                  Oh! how to give to thee,
                  At thy command.
                  
                  Oh! may we spread thy fame
                  Over every hill and plain,
                  Till thy great holy name
                  Fills every land.
               
               
                  "Then in that happy land,
                  Far, far away,
                  Where saints in glory stand,
                  Bright, bright as day;
                  Oh! we shall sweetly sing,
                  'Worthy is our Saviour, King,'
                  And with the heathen ring,
                  His praise for aye."
               
               "O, Mamma, is not that a beautiful little hymn, and it goes to the tune of 'Happy
                  Land.' Will you teach it the infant class? Then all the children will bring more
                  pennies, and put them in the missionary box, to help send the Bible and
                  missionaries to the poor little heathen children."
               Day after day, little Sarah's voice could be heard singing, 
                     
                        "Oh! send the word Divine,
                        Far, far away."
                     
                  
               
               A few weeks after, on New Years' morning, Sarah and her brother had each a quarter
                  of a dollar given to them, to spend as they chose. A new bright quarter of a
                  dollar they had never had before. They were highly delighted, and for three whole
                  hours not a word was said about spending them. At length Willie asked, "What are
                  you going to do with your money, sister? I am going to buy a book with mine."
                  "Why, brother, I shall take mine to the school next Sabbath morning, and put it in
                  the missionary box." "What, Sarah, all of it?" "Yes, I shall give all of it to the
                  missionaries, I want the poor little heathen children to have the Bible." "Well,
                  sister, I will tell you how you can get it changed into cents, and put two in the
                  box every Sabbath, and then it will last a long time." "No, Willie, I shall give
                  it, just as it is, next Sabbath morning."
               The Sabbath came, and the school rooms were filled with happy children, but Sarah
                  was not among them. The infant class sang "Oh! send the word Divine," but her
                  sweet voice was not heard The missionary box was passed around as usual, but her
                  sparkling eye and ready hand were missed. After a short, but very severe illness,
                  the blessed Saviour who loves little children even better than do their parents,
                  took her to that "Happy Land, far, far away."
               The day before she was taken sick, she said to her mother, "I am very glad Willie
                  did not die when he was so sick. I asked God a good many times to make him well,
                  and he did. God was very good to make him well, was he not, Mamma?" After a few
                  moments she continued. "Mamma, if I should get sick and die, would I go to
                  heaven?" Her mother told her if she was sorry for her sins, and asked God to
                  forgive them, because the Lord Jesus died on the cross to save sinners, even
                  little children, and if she tried to love and serve God, he would take her to that
                  happy place. "Well, Mamma," said she, "I do pray to God very often to make me a
                  good girl, and ask Him to put his Holy Spirit in my heart, and make me fit to go
                  to heaven." "But, my child," said her mother, "if you ever get to heaven, will it
                  be because you pray to God, and try to be a good girl?" "O no, Mamma, it will be
                  because the Lord Jesus Christ died on the cross for me." "Would you like to go to
                  heaven, Sarah, and live with Jesus?" "Yes, Mamma, if you would go with me, but I
                  do not want to go without you."
               Soon after, she wanted her mother to sing, "Lord, teach a little child to pray."
                  After singing that, in which she joined, she said, "Now, Mamma, sing my hymn, 'I
                  want to be an angel.'"
               Two days after this conversation, the Angel of Death visited our dwelling, and
                  took our dear little Sarah from this vale of sin and sorrow; but we trust she is
                  now an angel, safely folded in the arms of the Good Shepherd, who once said,
                  "Suffer little children to come to me, and forbid them not, for of such is the
                  kingdom of heaven." O how full of kindness is Jesus, and will not little children,
                  who read this, love the Saviour, and remember the little children in heathen
                  lands, who have no Bible, and no one to tell them of Jesus?
            
            
            
               
               
                  
               
               THE BLACKSMITH'S FORGE.
               OLD-FASHIONED things are passing away. The stage-coach might have been champed
                  down the throat of the iron horse, so far as its use is now concerned. Grass grows
                  over the ancient highway, and roads of gleaming iron curve their snaky length
                  through the ancient strongholds of forest trees. Old-fashioned homesteads are but
                  rarely met with; ambitious heirs have built them modern gingerbread houses, and
                  dignified them with the name of villas. Old-fashioned manners are fast
                  disappearing. Who sees now the noble matron, with her strong linen apron, to keep
                  soiling from her neat dress; and, hanging at one side, that badge of good
                  housewifery, the bunch of pantry keys, at the other the pin-ball and needle-book,
                  always well supplied.
               Who calls in the morning upon the lady—a pattern of the olden time—and finds her
                  among her servants? No one; our modern lady dances till five, and sleeps till
                  dinner-time; and as to labor, she is delightfully ignorant of a thing so vulgar.
                  The old spinning-wheel is tucked away in garrets, and the farmer's daughter leaves
                  her healthy home for the smoke and clatter of a factory, and some poor genteel
                  husband who spends her earnings in dissipation.
               But the old blacksmith's forge has been left untouched. There the giant bellows,
                  the wonder and delight of merry children, pant and blow as they did fifty years
                  ago. The forge over which aspiring minds have thought themselves into greatness,
                  still stands massive and black, only relieved by a semicircle of red hot iron, the
                  famous horse-shoe.
               There is not a more cheery sight in the world than that of a blacksmith's shop on
                  a dark night. The little building all ablaze with light; brawny workmen shaping
                  the glowing metal; showers of sparks forever rising and falling; tall figures
                  flitting athwart the blaze, form a homely but surely an instructive picture of
                  industry.
               The smith is always "well posted up," and the sires of the village linger around
                  his premises to talk of crops and politics. The cold villager, on his way home
                  from the little market, stops in to warm his fingers, and admires the skill with
                  which young Vulcan shapes the shaft. The traveler drops choice bits of news while
                  his horse is shoeing, and altogether the smithy is a place of general
                  interest.
               May the shadow of the forge never grow less!—What Not.
               
            
            
            
               
               PATRIOTISM.
               
                  
                     
                        "My country, 'tis of thee,
                        Of thee I sing."
                     
                  
               
               IN the present exigencies of our country, what theme is more fitting? Within the
                  memory of the present generation there has been no time when the love of country
                  was more imperative—when indifference or supineness was so unpardonable. For when
                  the "ship of state" glides smoothly on, over a fair sea, leaving in its wake
                  naught but prosperity, then we may and should enjoy both the sunshine and the
                  breeze. But when we see tempests ahead, aye, when the tempest is already howling
                  around us, and the gallant ship is creaking and groaning in its almost dismembered
                  parts, it is then we count her strength, and arouse ourselves for the rescue, that
                  with her salvation our own may be secure.
               Thus should we do now. But it may be asked—what have our mothers and daughters to
                  do with this subject? they are not, and do not wish to be recognized at the ballot
                  box, and what can they do, either to prevent the recurrence of the calamities
                  which have already overtaken us, or, to avert those impending? They can do much.
                  Let them but come up, en masse, to the work. Let them come in their silent, quiet,
                  invulnerable might, and our country shall feel their power; not as it would feel
                  the earthquake's shock, but as this globe feels that grand cohesive power, which
                  cements its heterogeneous masses and binds them in one harmonious, glorious whole.
                  Nor need they leave their homes, nor swerve from the common routine of their
                  delightful duties; for patriotism is not opposed to home, and the loved domestic
                  circle; for in the quietude of that sheltered spot its deepest roots are
                  struck.
               But it is no part of my present purpose to speak of the influence of home-training
                  on the character of our countrymen, for that subject has been so often and so ably
                  discussed that it needs no comment from my feeble pen. I have but one point now to
                  urge,—it is this: Let us—the women of America—aid in preventing so enormous an
                  importation of foreign manufactures, to the injury of our own countrymen. Let not
                  the wealth of our smiling valleys and spreading prairies, nor the immense revenues
                  accruing from our majestic rivers and extended lakes, from our forests and our
                  mines, be lavished on foreign luxuries. Let not so many of our husbands, our sons,
                  and our brothers, be obliged to forego all the delights of home and the advantages
                  of refined and Christian society, enduring more real loss than the Christian
                  pioneer even, to delve in California or Australia, for scarcely gold enough to
                  meet our foreign indebtedness. I quote words of high authority. "Thirty-eight
                  millions of dollars in gold—over nine-tenths of our receipts from California
                  during the year, as officially reported, have simply passed through the country in
                  transitu, and have been shipped away to pay for imported products of European
                  labor, and the interest on our European debt."
               Truly we have slept on this subject. A darkness, which I trust but harbingers the
                  dawn, has enveloped us, else our wardrobes would not now be filled with foreign
                  fabrics, at such cost. Nor would our parlors and drawing rooms be
                  graced with so much of transatlantic ornament. We have fabrics truly American by
                  which the greater part of these articles might now be replaced. And
                  but encourage, for a little season, our own artists and artisans, and what may we
                  not hope?—Let them not be obliged, forever, to bow to the real, or fancied
                  supremacy of the foreigner, nor need they. Think you that the thousands of our
                  females now out of employment, and lacking bread even, might not twine, if trained
                  and encouraged, beneath our fair tree of liberty, garlands as fine as even the
                  Frank has seen? Nor do we need examples of what has been done. Have not our own
                  inventors trained the swift-winged steam, and harnessed it to the proud ship, and
                  have they not taught even the forked lightning to do their bidding?—And have we
                  not had a West and a Cole? And we have now a Powers and a host of
                  others that might be named, who need but the fostering and encouragement which our
                  wealth retained at home would permit us to give them, to enable them to compete
                  with the best schools of English or continental art.—Let us not always say
                     this is superb! it is à la Francaise, or German, or English, or Italian; but may we be proud to say,
                     this is the product of our country's skill. This is
                  American!
               But if our husbands and fathers must become bankrupt, let it not be through our
                  extravagance. Let us deny ourselves the use of luxuries which cost our country so
                  much, not only from a love of country, but from love to Christ. Are we not, from
                  north to south, from the Atlantic to the broad Pacific, already flooded with the
                  Roman and infidel foreigner, who must be evangelized, or we hazard
                  both our liberty and our religion. Let us then engage in this work, and we shall
                  have invested our surplus funds in an enterprise that shall tell an hundred fold
                  of profit while time endures; yea longer; that profit shall continue to augment
                  while eternity rolls on!

               IMPORTANCE OF THINKING.
               HOW averse men are to thinking; I mean, on serious and important subjects. We are
                     all ready enough to think of those things that relate to this
                  life, and upon subjects connected with the advancement of our own selfish and
                  ambitious aims. Anything that we think will increase our happiness of to-day,
                  tomorrow, or next year, is eagerly seized upon by the mind, and thought and
                  reasoned upon, that it may be made to afford us all the gratification possible.
                  The student thinks, and constantly and closely. Early and late he is at his books;
                  and often does he tax his mental powers to such a degree, as to incur permanent
                  ill health, and not unfrequently premature death. But what is his aim? What is the
                  great purpose of life with him? is it not that he may be thought pre-eminent by
                  his fellows that he may gain the plaudits of the wise, and be thought great
                  because learned.
               The physician thinks, and thinks intensely. The study and practice of his
                  profession requires close application and deep thought. He is even ready to hazard
                  his own life, if professional duties seem to require it. At midnight, when most
                  men are wrapped in silent slumbers, he is often at the bed-side of the sick, with
                  all his mental powers active, studying how he may best soothe the troubled spirit,
                  quiet the delirious, or in any way stay the hand of disease, and prolong what is
                  most dear to every man—life.
               The lawyer thinks of his client, and feels that no mental or physical sacrifice is
                  too great, if he can but win the case, and restore him to friends and liberty.
                  Parents think, and upon almost all subjects, but the moral and physical education
                  of their children. In fact, the whole multitude of men and women are engaged in
                  deep thought,—we are a care-worn, anxious, and thinking people. All thoughts, but
                  right ones, take possession of our minds, and lead us captive at their will. The
                  student forgets that the day will come, when books, philosophy and science will
                  avail him nothing. His day on earth will be finished, and then he must be judged
                  from the book on which has been recorded all the transactions of his life. How
                  will he stand the test? Will he not be compelled to exclaim, I have ruined myself.
                  I have been walking up and down the little streams of life, sporting in its rills,
                  chasing its sun-beams—but God, the great first cause—the fountain of life, light,
                  and all things, I have not worshiped.
               The physician talks long and often of the cause and cure of disease, of sanitary
                  reform—the violation of natural laws, as the cause of diseases; he prides himself
                  on his skill in nicely trimming the wick of life, but the flame, the immortal
                  spark, that is to burn on forever,—too seldom engages his attention. The lawyer
                  spends his days in the courts of earth, but puts far from him the day when he must
                  stand before the Supreme Court of Heaven, and there, before the assembled
                  universe, and the eternal God, give an account for the manner in which he has
                  spent his earthly existence.
               What we want in this age is deep, religious thought. If we could induce the
                  impenitent to give one-half hour each day to meditation on their own moral
                  characters, as connected with God, and a future state of existence,—who can
                  calculate the consequences that would follow. Would not thousands at once begin to
                  inquire after those things which make for their eternal peace. Would it not be
                  well for Christians to reflect more, and study more closely their own characters, and
                  the character and attributes of that Being who supplies all their temporal wants,
                  and promises them eternal life in his presence if they will, by faith, seek those
                  things which are from above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. If we
                  would be devout Christians, and be ready at all times to give a reason for the
                  hope that is in us;—if we would be ready to meet all the emergencies of life, and
                  to meet with composure the last great enemy;—we must make religion more of a
                  study, and a subject of deep contemplation and prayer. With what draughts of
                  living water might the Christian refresh his soul, if he would oftener leave the
                  murky streams of this world, and drink of those celestial streams, of which, if a
                  man drink, "he shall never thirst." How important it is, that parents should think
                  earnestly of the best means which can be used to promote the moral, physical, and
                  religious education of their children. How important the duties which parents have
                  to discharge to those committed to them, and how fearful, or joyful the results
                  that must follow the right or wrong discharge of those duties. Every child should
                  be expected to render implicit obedience to all the commands of their parents. If
                  they are not taught to respect the authority of those who have a right to command
                  on earth, how shall we expect that they will be ready to obey Him who has a right
                  to command from Heaven. How many of the evils that afflict society, how many of
                  the horrid crimes that are daily committed, spring directly from bad government,
                  and wrong principles inculcated at the fireside. How many parents, as they walk
                  down the declivity of life, have to lament the unfaithfulness of their children to
                  them, to society and God. But it may be asked, what can be done to remedy the evil
                  complained of. We would answer, let parents think until they become
                  fully impressed with the importance of the duties which devolve on them, and then
                  anxiously consider how they can best be discharged. Let all remember that we can
                  do nothing truly great, for ourselves, our children or our fellow-men, or make any
                  considerable progress in the path that leads to God, without deep thought,
                  meditation and prayer.

               THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.
               "MOTHER," said a little girl of ten years, as she looked up from her atlas over
                  which she had been poring for some time, "Mother, will you please tell me if these
                  are the Sandwich Islands that I have read so much about in the papers lately?"
               "Yes, my child, they are. You have often heard me speak of them as the home of
                  your dear uncle. They have lately become so Americanized that there has been some
                  talk about admitting them into our Union."
               "But, mother, I thought all the South Sea Islanders were heathen. I have read
                  dreadful stories of their cruelty—that they buried their dear little babes alive,
                  and killed and ate the sailors that came to their shores, and did a great many
                  other horrible things that frighten me to think of. Were those true stories,
                  mother?"
               "They were true at the time they were told, my dear; but, within the last few
                  years missionaries have been among them, and the Sandwich Islanders have been
                  converted and civilized."
               "But, mother, I should not think uncle would like to live among such a people, or
                  my little cousins either?"
               "They would not have liked it; indeed, they could not have lived there had no
                  change taken place among the people. But they are not now savage heathen. They
                  have heard the gospel, have learned to love and obey its precepts, and are now a
                  peaceful civilized nation. The Sabbath is as well observed in Honolulu, their
                  principal town, as in this city.
               The children meet in the Sunday School as in this land, and the missionaries, or
                  sometimes the converted natives, teach them of God and Christ, as you are taught.
                  Their parents gather at the sound of the Sabbath bell as cheerfully and constantly
                  as yours. All bring an offering for their pastor's support, and to aid in sending
                  Missionaries to the heathen around them. Some bring bananas; others, bread fruit,
                  arrow root, and other productions of the island. Some offer themselves as
                  missionaries.
               Formerly, they had only one kind of school, in which they were taught their wicked amusements, such as the act of
                  breaking a man's bones for the purpose of robbery. Now the children are taught in
                  good schools. Besides these, there has been established at Honolulu a Royal
                  College on the same plan as our institutions. Your cousin is receiving his
                  education there.
               Alexander Liholiho, who has just been proclaimed king, was once a scholar in these
                  schools. He is a young man of fine talents, and has traveled extensively, in the
                  United States and in Europe. While traveling in this country he visited, among
                  other important institutions, our public schools, and noticed with interest our
                  modes of instruction."
               "Mother, do their school-houses and churches look like ours?"
               "No, my dear. The better class are of coral, whitewashed with coral lime. They are
                  of one story only, and very large. The poorer sort are merely frail thatched
                  buildings with no floors. The ground is covered with dry grass, and then spread
                  with mats neatly braided from the lauhala
                  leaf.
               Your uncle's house is of coral, two stories high, with an observatory. At each end
                  of the house is a verandah, over which a luxuriant passion-flower is trained. Back
                  of the house is the cook-house, covered with the branches of a night-blooming
                  cereus, which blossoms far more beautifully than we have ever seen it. In their
                  garden, where eight years ago there were no trees, a thousand are now growing.
                  Among these are the tamarind, orange, lemon, fig and cocoa-nut. Hedges of geranium
                  supply the places of fences, and their gardens are full of flowers whose beauty is
                  never blighted by frost or snow.
               The climate is very delightful, except in the heat of summer, when your uncle and
                  other residents of Honolulu leave their city homes, and live in the valleys where
                  the cool mountain breezes temper the tropical heat."
               "Well, mother, why do our people wish these islands for one of our States?"
               "I do not know. One reason may be because they are nearer the seas where the
                  whale's home is, than any other land, and the whalers go there for supplies of
                  fruit and other fresh provisions. In your aunt's last letter, she speaks of more
                  than a hundred vessels being then in the harbor.
               Formerly, whenever a vessel reached the shore, a quarrel occurred between the
                  sailors and the natives. The natives were ignorant, and the sailors took advantage
                  of them.
               A missionary has given us their description of the first white men they saw. 'The
                  men are white; their skin is loose and folding,' (mistaking their clothes for
                  their skin,)—'their heads are strangely shaped,' (supposing their hats to belong
                  to their heads,)—'they are gods, gods of the volcano, for fire and smoke issue
                  from their mouths,' (referring to cigars,)—'they have doors in the sides of their
                  bodies,' (their pockets,) 'in these openings they thrust their hands and take out
                  many valuable things,—their bodies are full of treasure.'
               One of their first missionaries attempted to preach to them. He gathered a group
                  around him and rose to pray. Instantly the people rushed from the house and hid in
                  the forest. They thought he was going to pray them to death.
               They were very wicked as well as ignorant. Whatever they could steal was sure to
                  disappear. They indulged in intoxicating drinks and committed every kind of
                  wickedness.
               As a natural consequence of their ignorance and wickedness, they were very
                  poor.
               If a native wished to build a house he went into the forest, and with the aid of
                  fire and a stone axe, succeeded in procuring some poles. These he brought home on
                  his shoulders, fixed them firmly in the ground and covered them with dried grass
                  or leaves, leaving one opening for a window and another for a door. He strewed the
                  ground with dry grass, on which he spread a coarsely braided mat. On this the
                  whole family lounged and slept, and ate from one calabash, their poi (raw fish) with their fingers.
               Thus, surrounded with everything calculated to make them happy, they were
                  miserable because sinful. The gospel, in removing their sinfulness, has removed
                  their misery, and raised this once degraded people to a place among civilized
                  nations."

               HARMONY OF SCIENCE AND REVELATION.
               FROM THE N. Y. EVANGELIST.
               
                  Observatory, Washington, Jan. 22, 1855.
               
               YOUR letter revived very pleasant remembrances. * * * Your questions are themes.
                  It would require volumes to contain the answers to them. You ask about the "Harmony of Science and Revelation," and wish to know if I find "distinct traces in the Old Testament of scientific knowledge," and
                     "in the Bible any knowledge of the winds and ocean currents."
                  Yes, knowledge the most correct and valuable.
               "Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades?"
               It is a curious fact that the revelations of science have led astronomers of our
                  own day to the discovery that the sun is not the dead centre of motion, around
                  which comets sweep and planets whirl; but that it, with its splendid retinue of
                  worlds and satellites, is revolving through the realms of space, at the rate of
                  millions of miles in a year, and in obedience to some influence situated precisely
                  in the direction of the star Alcyon, one of the Pleiades. We do not know how far
                  off in the immensities of space that centre of revolving cycles and epicycles may
                  be; nor have our oldest observers or nicest instruments been able to tell us how
                  far off in the skies that beautiful cluster of stars is hung, whose influences man
                  can never bind. In this question alone, and the answer to it, is involved both the
                  recognition and exposition of the whole theory of gravitation.
               Science taught that the world was round; but potentates pronounced the belief
                  heretical, notwithstanding the Psalmist, while apostrophizing the works of
                  creation in one of his sublime moods of inspiration, when prophets spake as they
                  were moved, had called the world the "round world," and bade it rejoice.
               You recollect when Galileo was in prison, a pump-maker came to him with his
                  difficulties because his pump would not lift water higher than thirty-two feet.
                  The old philosopher thought it was because the atmosphere would not press the
                  water up any higher; but the hand of persecution was upon him, and he was afraid
                  to say the air had weight. Now had he looked to the science of the Bible, he would
                  have discovered that the "perfect man" of Uz, moved by revelation, had proclaimed
                  the fact thousands of years before. "He maketh the weight for the wind." Job is
                  very learned, and his speeches abound in scientific lore. The persecutors of the
                  old astronomers also would have been wiser, and far more just, had they paid more
                  attention to this wonderful book, for there they would have learned that "He
                  stretcheth out the north over the EMPTY PLACE, and hangeth the earth upon
                  nothing."
               Here is another proof that Job was familiar with the laws of gravitation, for he
                  knew how the world was held in its place; and as for the "empty place" in the sky,
                  Sir John Herschel has been sounding the heavens with his powerful telescope, and
                  gauging the stars, and where do you think he finds the most barren part—the empty
                  places—of the sky? In the north, precisely where Job told Bildad, the Shuhite, the
                  empty place was stretched out. It is there where comets most delight to roam, and
                  hide themselves in emptiness.
               I pass by the history of creation as it is written on the tablet of the rock and
                  in the book of Revelation, because the question has been discussed so much and so
                  often that you, no doubt, are familiar with the whole subject. In both, the order
                  of creation is the same, first the plants to afford sustenance, and then the
                  animals, the chief point of apparent difference being as to the duration of the
                  period between the "evening and the morning." "A thousand years is as one day,"
                  and the Mosaic account affords evidence itself that the term day, as there used,
                  is not that which comprehends our twenty-four hours. It was a day that had its
                  evening and morning before the sun was made.
               I will, however, before proceeding farther, ask pardon for mentioning a rule of
                  conduct which I have adopted, in order to make progress with these physical
                  researches which have occupied so much of my time and many of my thoughts, and
                  that rule is never to forget who is the Author of the great volume which nature
                  spreads out before us, and always to remember that the same Being is also the Author of the book which
                  Revelation holds up to us; and though the two works are entirely different, their
                  records are equally true, and when they bear upon the same point, as now and then
                  they do, it is as impossible that they should contradict each other, as it is that
                  that either should contradict itself. If the two cannot be reconciled, the fault
                  is ours, and is because in our blindness and weakness we have not been able to
                  interpret aright either the one or the other, or both.
               Solomon, in a single verse, describes the circulation of the atmosphere as actual
                  observation is now showing it to be. That it has its laws, and is obedient to
                  order as the heavenly host in their movements, we infer from the fact announced by
                  him, and which contains the essence of volumes by other men, "All the rivers run
                  into the sea; yet the sea is not full: unto the place from whence the rivers come,
                  thither they return again."
               To investigate the laws which govern the winds and rule the sea, is one of the
                  most profitable and beautiful occupations that a man, an improving, progressive
                  man, can have. Decked with stars as the sky is, the field of astronomy affords no
                  subjects of contemplation more ennobling, more sublime, or more profitable, than
                  those which we may find in the air and the sea.
               When we regard them from certain points of view, they present the appearance of
                  wayward things, obedient to no law, but fickle in their movements, and subject
                  only to chance.
               Yet when we go as truth-loving, knowledge-seeking explorers, and knock at their
                  secret chambers, and devoutly ask what are the laws which govern them, we are
                  taught in terms the most impressive, that when the morning stars sang together,
                  the waves also lifted up their voice, and the winds, too, joined in the almighty
                  anthem. And as discovery advances, we find the marks of order in the sea and in
                  the air, that is in tune with the music of the spheres, and the conviction is
                  forced upon us that the laws of all are nothing else but perfect harmony.
               
                  Yours respectfully,
                  M. F. MAURY, Lt. U. S. N.
               
            
            
               PARENTAL DUTIES.
               IT is to be feared that few parents rightly apprehend the nature and extent of
                  their duties; therefore many children grow up without culture, without discipline
                  and restraint. We bespeak attention to this subject, as one connected with every
                  interest of time and eternity.
               The first which we mention is parental affection. This, so far as we know, is not
                  usually treated by moral writers as a branch of duty. The reason probably is that
                  it is regarded instinctive, and exercised by man in common with animals. It is
                  admitted that it is an instinct, beautiful and benevolent; but, associated as it
                  is in man, with a moral constitution, it is more: it becomes a moral affection,
                  and in some of its aspects the proper subject of praise or blame. This affection
                  is the foundation and stimulus of every other duty; and it must exist, or the
                  great end of the family constitution is defeated—parental duty, discipline, and
                  restraint are neglected, and a moral waste, cheerless and sad, is presented to the
                  eye. The Apostle, when describing the utter and universal abandonment of the
                  heathen world, mentions the fact of their being "without natural affection," as
                  one of the saddest marks of their hopelessness and ruin.
               This feeling may exist in either of the following states of mind. It may be
                  excessive—it may be defective—it may be correct, or there may be a predominance of
                  the instinctive over the moral impulse. When excessive, it leads to indulgence,
                  short-sighted, and often fatal is the result—when defective, to gross and criminal
                  neglect—when correct, parental treatment is regulated by enlightened principles,
                  and obedience and good order characterize the family circle. When there is a
                  predominance of the instinctive over the moral impulse, you will observe a blind
                  partiality, that defeats the end by the means, that gratifies at the expense of
                  real good, that mismanages the interest of the youthful mind and lays the
                  foundation of its future ruin. How important, then, that this feeling should be
                  correct—that it should exist in its harmony and beauty, impelling the mind on in
                  the appropriate sphere of its duty,
                  resisting its natural tendencies to selfishness, filling it with sympathy and
                  tenderness, and a feeling of good will, not only for the members of the family,
                  but for others who occupy the nearer and then more remote circles of society!
               We mention a competent maintenance of children during their minority, as a second
                  duty of parents. When we consider the helpless and dependent condition of
                  children, their relation to parents, the natural affection which plays between the
                  two, there can be no doubt that God intended the one to be the supporter of the
                  other. The duty of parents to provide for the maintenance of their children is a
                  principle of natural law, an obligation imposed on them, not only by nature
                  itself, but by their own proper act in their existence. One of the darkest
                  features of the Pagan world is the neglect and cruel exposure of children. In
                  Christian countries, where the natural impulses have full play, and are not turned
                  from their proper channel by the unrighteous demands of a false religion, children
                  are generally the object of parental care and solicitude, and are not exiled from
                  the parental roof until they are fully competent to provide for themselves.
               The duty of maintenance has of course a limit. It is generally limited to the
                  years of minority; after this parental obligation ceases. When a child has reached
                  a suitable age, he should be urged into the responsibilities of life and taught to
                  rely upon his own resources. Previous to this, the parent's duty to maintain the
                  child, is either partial or entire;—entire in the early years of the child's
                  minority, when it is physically and mentally incompetent to do any thing for its
                  own support; partial when the child is sufficiently matured to do much in
                  providing the means for its own sustenance. As manhood is approached, parental
                  obligation gradually ceases, and children should be taught to co-operate, by their
                  efforts and labor, with their parents, in providing for the family.
               If they are permitted to spend the latter period of their minority without
                  engagement in some species of useful and productive labor, they may become an
                  unnecessary burden to their parents, and will probably come into manhood with the
                  habits of idleness, and perhaps of dissipation fixed upon them. They should be
                  taught, as their physical and mental energies develop, to be industrious and
                  economical. They should be made to feel that labor is no disgrace, and that
                  self-support and self-reliance are honorable, and the surest means to success and
                  distinction in after life.
               We mention careful and constant inspection, as a third duty of parents. This is a
                  very important duty, and should extend to the feelings, the dispositions, and the
                  habits of children. The eye of parental watchfulness should be upon them in all
                  their outgoings and in all their incomings, guarding them against the perils to
                  which they are exposed—the evil dispositions which they are liable to cherish, the
                  enemies which ever stand ready to seduce them from the paths of purity and
                  rectitude. This vigilant inspection should extend to every thing connected with
                  the moral and intellectual good of children. It should extend to their amusements,
                  for recreations of some kind they should have—they are indispensable to a proper,
                  healthy, and harmonious development of their powers. But many of the amusements,
                  especially of our larger cities, lie along a dark and fearful ravine, beside a
                  yawning precipice, among dens of moral vipers.
               The theatre, where poetry, genius and eloquence, exert their magic spell—the opera
                  and the dance, "where eyes look love to eyes that speak again, and all goes merry
                  as a marriage bell:" these are places of most exhilarating pleasure, but full of
                  moral peril—the heart is open to evil as the flower is to the sun. And yet these
                  places are encouraged and patronized by too many professedly Christian parents.
                  They expose their children to the most fascinating, yet destructive influences, as
                  if it were not a law of the moral kingdom, "that whatsoever a man soweth, that
                  shall he also reap." It is the duty of parents to watch over their children—to
                  hold them back from those places of amusement, where a deceptive radiance is shed
                  around them, and vice is dressed in the beautiful attire of virtue.
               Their reading, too, should be carefully watched; especially in these days, when
                  books of all kinds are thrown indiscriminately from the press and scattered over
                  our wide extended country. Literature of a positively injurious character is
                  flooding our land, and sweeping away the good books of many generations. The taste
                  of the young is liable to be perverted, so as to lead them into an ideal world,
                  where they will be totally unfit to meet the high duties and trials of subsequent and real life;
                  let every parent, then, be upon his watch-tower, looking out for the enemy, in
                  whatever form he may approach his domestic citadel.
               He should also keep an eye of inspection over the society of his children,
                  remembering that "evil communications corrupt good manners," and that children
                  will conform to the character and habits of the society they keep. If that society
                  be coarse, skeptical or immoral, whatever may be their training at home, they will
                  degenerate: the barriers of virtue will be gradually broken down, and unless the
                  grace of God interpose, they will be thrown out, hideous wrecks, upon society, the
                  grief of their kindred and the curse of mankind. Parents may anticipate and
                  prevent such an end, by a cautious and constant inspection of the habits, the
                  pleasures, the reading, and the society of their children.

               THE STEPMOTHER; OR, HOW MRS. LEIGHTON "DID MANAGE THOSE TWO UNRULY
                  BOYS."
               THERE was a topic of unusual interest under discussion in Mrs. Harman's
                  sitting-room one afternoon, if one might judge from the animated looks of the
                  speakers, and the volubility of their tongues. And it was indeed so; for Mr.
                  Leighton, who had been a widower for some years, was about to marry again, and of
                  course it was a matter of interest to the neighbors, for when ever did such an
                  event occur in a country village, that it was not made an object of especial
                  supervision by the whole neighborhood, or a large portion of it?
               Miss Watson, the tailoress, was at work for Mrs. Harman's children that day, and
                  had brought the news of the engagement, and the appointment of the wedding day,
                  for she had worked the day before in Mr. Leighton's house, making new suits for
                  his two boys, and had been informed by the nursery maid when the event would take
                  place.
               Miss Watson did not approve of people's meddling with one another's affairs—oh,
                  no! not she; but then it was so natural that she should collect all the news,
                  going as she did from house to house; and so natural that she should retail the
                  said collection wherever she could find listeners, that in its naturalness, the
                  habit lost all its odiousness to her mind.
               Mrs. May, a visitor, was also Miss Watson's auditor as well as Mrs. Harman and her
                  husband's sister, Miss Rachel, who were quite as ready to listen as was Miss
                  Watson to relate; not that they desired to know anything about Mr. Leighton's
                  affairs, only they hoped he was going "to make out well," for Miss Rachel had
                  really felt a motherly interest in those two children, and Miss
                  Watson had evinced a most marked desire for their welfare, until she heard of Mr.
                  Leighton's engagement, since which her eyes were suddenly opened to their
                  faults.
               "I've never said anything," said she, "nor wouldn't, to prevent the poor
                  motherless things getting a good stepmother, but as long as he's to be married on
                  Sunday evening, there's no harm in speaking—and between us three, I think Mary
                  Warner little knows what she is undertaking, in marrying that man, for two such
                  dreadful boys I never did see, and I've had good opportunity to know, I've been
                  there so often."
               "True enough," chimed in Miss Rachel, when Miss Watson stopped for breath, "as
                  long as you have spoken out, I may as well speak my mind. It is really dreadful,
                  the conduct of those boys; and to see how they are growing up—and I believe Mr.
                  Leighton begins to think it his duty to have some one besides that Sarah to see
                  after them in his absence, and it's my opinion he ought to have done it before.
                  Miss Warner is a school-mistress, and used to managing bad boys, I suppose; but
                  that she will succeed there, is more than I can tell," and she drew a sigh.
               "Ah," said Mrs. Harman, with a doleful shake of the head, "for one I think the
                  poor children are to be pitied instead of the stepmother. I should dread the
                  thought of having my children to be ruled over by a school-teacher
                  for a step-mother. I hope their maid will stay with them, and see that they have
                  enough to eat, and shield them from the rod."
               "It's my opinion they will get no more of the rod than they deserve, if it is used pretty freely,"
                  replied Miss Watson, rather tartly.
               "Are you personally acquainted with Miss Warner?" inquired Mrs. May, who now for
                  the first time got an opportunity to speak.
               The ladies only knew her by "hearsay," they said.
               "I know nothing of Mr. Leighton or his children," continued Mrs. May, "but I am
                  happy to acknowledge Miss Warner as an acquaintance, and should consider Mr.
                  Leighton particularly fortunate in securing her for his wife and the mother of his
                  children. Two years ago I resided in N—, and Miss Warner was then the teacher of
                  my children, and a more faithful teacher they never had."
               Mrs. Harman was glad, for the children's sake, to hear so good an account of her,
                  and Miss Rachel and Miss Watson made no comments, but inly resolved to "keep an
                  eye upon her." The subject was therefore dropped for a time, to be resumed at the
                  earliest opportunity in some other neighbor's house, and as it had grown too dark
                  to sew, the ladies laid aside their needles, and thought over the matter upon
                  which their lips had been silenced.
               In a quiet little chamber in her boarding-house at N—, at this same twilight hour,
                  the young teacher knelt, humbly imploring of her heavenly Father, grace and
                  strength for her new and untried duties.
               
               "What are you thinking about, Alfred?" asked Willie Leighton of his brother, as
                  they sat together in the shed preparing some sticks for a kite. Alfred had not
                  spoken for fifteen minutes, and it was no wonder Willie inquired the cause of so
                  unusual a silence.
               "I am thinking about what Sarah told us this morning when we were at breakfast,"
                  replied Alfred.
               "Oh! about our having a stepmother very soon! I don't believe it."
               "I do, and I thought so before Sarah told us, and I've made up my mind not to have
                  her ordering me round. Sarah says stepmothers are always cross, and I
                  heard her talking with Miss Watson about it that day she worked here, and Miss W.
                  said that this Miss Warner was used to bad boys, and would soon teach us our
                  manners, and Sarah shook her head and said, 'poor things, I pity 'em.'"
               "Oh, dear! what shall we do?" sighed Willie. "Charlie Richmond says since he has
                  had a stepmother, he has not had a good time at all. His aunt, when she lived
                  there, let him do just as he was a mind to, and his new mother is real strict. I
                  don't know what we shall do!"
               "I'll tell you what we must do," said Alfred—and his bright black eyes showed firm
                  determination—"if she begins to order us and scold us, we must plague her all we
                  can. Perhaps she wont the first few days, for Charlie Richmond's mother didn't at
                  first, but in a little while she'll begin."
               "But she'll tell father," said Willie.
               "Well, we might as well be punished for her stories, as Sarah's—we
                  get whipped most every day now, and the cook is always boxing our ears; and at
                  first she did it because she felt like it, when we hadn't been plaguing her, and
                  now I vex her all I can."
               Alas, Alfred! He had not heard the step of the cook as she came behind him; he sat
                  on the step of the door leading from the kitchen into the shed, and had supposed
                  her up stairs; but coming quietly down, she stood and listened to the conversation
                  till her wrath boiled over, and then she dealt him a blow on the ear which nearly
                  stunned him, and taking her broom, she cleared the doorway of the pine
                     whitlings and the boys also.
            
            
               
                  "A WORD or a glance, which we give "without thinking,"
                  May shadow or lighten some sensitive breast;
                  And the draught from the well-spring is wine in the drinking,
                  If quaffed from the brim that affection has blest.
               
               
                  Then he kind when you can in the smallest of duties,
                  Don't wait for the larger expressions of love;
                  For the heart depends less for its joys and its beauties,
                  On the flight of the eagle than coo of the dove."
               
            
            
               
               THE STEPMOTHER.
               CHAPTER II.
               MRS. LEIGHTON had occupied her new sphere as stepmother three days, and she had in
                  that time carefully studied the characters of her little charge, and though she
                  found much to discourage, the prospect was not all dark. There were tiny germs,
                  scarcely perceptible it is true, yet they were there, which needed but careful
                  management, in those young minds, to be developed into life and beauty. Thus far,
                  however, the boys had resisted and thwarted all her efforts to gain their
                  confidence, and she sat alone in her sitting room at her sewing, revolving in her
                  mind the method by which she should gain their love, and at the same time secure
                  their respect sufficiently to enforce obedience, when looking up she perceived
                  Miss Watson approaching the house.
               Mrs. Leighton had seen this disinterested individual, and though scarcely yet
                  acquainted, she had an intuitive perception of her character.
               Miss Watson was soon ushered in, and but few words had been exchanged, when the
                  hall door was rudely thrown open, and Alfred and Willie appeared in sight for an
                  instant, and then darting back with a smothered laugh, they ran violently across
                  the hall. Mrs. Leighton, with ill-concealed embarrassment, stepped to the door to
                  speak to them, but they were out of sight. She had closed the door and hardly
                  resumed her seat, when the boys came shouting to the window, and again darted away
                  as before. Miss Watson seemed to enjoy Mrs. Leighton's confusion exceedingly, and
                  after a long call, during which the dreadful state of the rising generation, and
                  that neighborhood in particular, formed the staple of her conversation, she took
                  leave, and called on her friend Mrs. Harman, to relate the incidents of the
                  afternoon noon. The boys, in consciousness of deserving punishment, kept out of
                  sight until the tea bell rang. After tea, as they left the table, they discovered
                  some colored engravings lying upon the window-sill, and they lingered hesitatingly
                  near them.
               "Look at the pictures, children, if you like," said Mrs. Leighton, pleasantly. "I
                  left them there for you."
               The boys exchanged glances, and commenced examining the pictures. Now and then, an
                  exclamation of pleasure or surprise was heard from them, and sometimes a slight
                  discussion as to the subject of a picture. Presently there was whispering, and
                  then a "Let's ask her," from Willie.
               Mrs. Leighton overheard Willie's remark, and informed them with regard to the
                  picture, in a cheerful tone—one remark and question led to another, and in ten
                  minutes an animated conversation was going on between the three, which continued
                  until Sarah, the maid, came to put the children to bed.
               "Shall I go up with you to-night, instead of Sarah?" asked the stepmother.
               "Oh, yes," said Willie, "do go up with us, I should like it very much." Alfred
                  said nothing.
               Mrs. Leighton strongly suspected that the children had had little, if any
                  religious culture, since the death of their mother, but she forbore to ask any
                  questions, having seen from the beginning that the nature of her young charge was
                  such that any great reform must be gradually and gently pressed, so as to avoid
                  exciting opposition or disgust; therefore when the little boys had undressed and
                  leaped into bed, though the first thought was to require them to return and repeat
                  their prayers, she repressed the impulse, and sitting down beside the bed, she
                  asked them if they had ever heard any one read or repeat "Casabianca." The
                  children both replied that they had not; she then repeated the poem distinctly,
                  and with feeling, and waited at its close in silence for a remark. There was a
                  pause for a moment, and then Willie exclaimed,
               "I think that is beautiful, don't you, Alfred?"
               "Yes," said Alfred, "wasn't he a brave boy?" and the tone in which he
                  said it, gave Mrs. Leighton a glimpse of at least one spring to be played upon in
                  the boy's character.
               
               "Do you know any hymns or poetry?" she asked.
               "I don't," replied Alfred.
               "I know, 'now I lay me,'" said Willie.
               "That isn't poetry," said Alfred, "it's a prayer, a kind of a prayer, isn't it?"
                  he was going to say mother, but he checked the word on his lips.
               "Yes, it is a kind of prayer," said Mrs. Leighton, "but I suppose you both know
                  'Our Father.'"
               "I used to know it," said Alfred, "but it's so long since I've said it, that I've
                  almost forgotten it."
               "I will repeat it," said Mrs. Leighton; and with folded hands and reverential
                  tone, she repeated the familiar words.
               "Do you not say this prayer, Alfred?" she asked.
               "Not very often," said the little boy. "Sometimes Sarah is in a hurry, and she
                  wont stay to listen, and sometimes when she isn't, she tells us stories."
               "What kind of stories."
               "Oh! about bears, and giants, and fairies."
               "But you know, children, it is to our Father in heaven that we pray, and he will
                  hear us when we are all alone," said Mrs. Leighton, "and he is so good to us as to
                  let us live in this good country, where there are so many things to make us happy,
                  instead of in a savage country, and he protects us every day, and gives us all
                  that we enjoy; don't you think that people who are all the time receiving favors
                  ought to be grateful for them?"
               "Yes," said Alfred and Willie, simultaneously.
               "Well, if any one is really thankful for anything they have, don't
                  you think they will be willing to express their thanks? I think they will, and I
                  think if anybody only thinks how good our Father in heaven is, and how little we
                  do that is pleasing to him, he will wish to thank him for all he has enjoyed, and
                  ask his forgiveness for all the wrong things he has done and said, every
                     day, because every day we receive good gifts, and every day we do wrong
                  actions."
               "Will you hear us say our prayers to-night?" asked Willie.
               "Certainly, dear," replied Mrs. L., and the little boy repeated, "Now I lay me
                  down to sleep," with childish emphasis, and then added, "please to teach me 'Our
                  Father."
               When he had finished, Alfred commenced and repeated the same prayers. "If either
                  of you have done anything wrong today," said Mrs. Leighton, "I think you had
                  better kneel down after I go down stairs, and ask God to forgive you, and to help
                  you to-morrow to try to do right;" and after a little further conversation, she
                  bade them "good night," and left them.
               "I know of one thing we have done wrong to-day," said Willie, "we acted bad when
                  Miss Watson was here."
               "I know it," said Alfred, "but I don't like her, and I don't want her to come
                  here."
               "I don't either," said Willie, "but I guess our new mother was sorry we made such
                  a noise; don't you love her, Alfred?"
               "I guess I shall, if she is so good all the time," was the wary reply, and the
                  little voices were soon lost in a whisper. In her room the stepmother returned
                  thanks to Heaven, for the one ray of encouragement she had gained.
            
            
               AN INFANT'S PRAYER.
               
                  O LET an infant speak the praise,
                  Of God who dwells above,
                  Permit his little tongue to raise
                  An anthem to his love.
               
               
                  May not a child of tender age
                  Exalt his feeble voice;
                  In his Creator's praise engage,
                  And make God's ways his choice?
               
               
                  Lord, I am sure thy word is true,
                  That calls me to this task,
                  Nor more than I can surely do,
                  Wilt thou of infants ask.
               
               
                  Then teach me, Lord, thy will to know,
                  While I have life and breath,
                  And on my heart thy grace bestow,
                  Before I sink in death.
               
            
            
               
               THE STEPMOTHER.
               CHAPTER III.
               A FORTNIGHT had passed since the incidents occurred which were related in the
                  preceding chapter, and in that time-several new steps had been gained by the
                  earnest and hopeful stepmother. She did not expect violent changes to occur at
                  once in characters, which several years, and a diversity of influences, had helped
                  to form, but she did hope and expect a gradual and certain improvement; for that
                  she labored and prayed, and she was not disappointed.
               One great point gained, in fact the chief one, had been the affection of the two
                  children; that was established beyond a doubt. Willie called her "mother"
                  constantly, and Alfred, though he used the term less frequently, yet called her
                  "mother" occasionally with real feeling. They had both grown more polite and
                  gentle in their ways about the house, and Alfred, who had formerly taken delight
                  in annoying and irritating Willie, merely for the sake of using his power, had
                  been made to turn his power into another channel, and use it for Willie's
                  instruction and protection, having been shown that it was more manly
                  to do so. He had also been shown that it was more Christian, but for that argument
                  he at present cared but little.
               Mrs. Harman and Miss Rachel sat sewing in the back chamber. The window overlooked
                  a green meadow, through which at some distance flowed a brook. Miss Rachel had
                  been relating to Mrs. Harman, Miss Watson's account of her call upon Mrs.
                  Leighton, and she proposed that toward night, as it grew cool, they too should
                  call. Mrs. Leighton was a new neighbor, she said, and they ought to show her some
                  attention.
               "I declare," continued she, looking out of the window, "I do believe there are the
                  two Leighton boys, now, down in our meadow playing by the brook. They must be
                  'playing truant.' Here it is, the middle of a fine summer afternoon; school is in
                  session, and you may depend they have stolen down there in mischief, instead of
                  going to school."
               "So much for the stepmother's skillful management," said Mrs. Harman, "perhaps she
                  has let them go off to play. I dare say she is afraid to refuse them anything, for
                  fear of their mischievous pranks. Well, she had better be too indulgent than too
                  severe."
               "Not she, too indulgent," said Miss Rachel, "you may depend they are playing
                  truant, and she'll whip 'em within an inch of their lives," and Miss Rachel
                  thought she would go down to the meadow and get a handful of mint, and just see
                  what they were about.
               She had scarcely appeared in sight, when Alfred, looking up, discovered their
                  visitor, and intuitively discovered her intention too.
               "Scamper, Willie!" he exclaimed, "Miss Rachel is coming!" and scamper they did,
                  through the long grass, and over the wall, and when the discomfited lady arrived
                  at the place she saw a little dam in the brook, but no builders, and forgetting
                  the mint she retraced her steps in vexation.
               "I'm sorry we ran, after all," said Alfred, "I wish we'd stayed and braved it
                  out."
               That evening, just after tea, Mrs. Leighton received a call from her vigilant
                  neighbors. The little boys were out at play, and not a suspicion of their
                  delinquency had entered the mind of their mother. After some little general
                  conversation, Miss Rachel, who had been all the while watching for an opportunity,
                  blandly remarked,
               "Your little boys had a fine play down in our meadow this afternoon, I should
                  think, Mrs. Leighton."
               "I think not," replied Mrs. Leighton, "they have been at home ever since school
                  was dismissed."
               "Ah!" said Miss Rachel, who could ill-conceal her triumph over her victim, "but it
                  was during school hours that I saw them playing there, building a dam in the
                  brook."
               Mrs. Leighton changed color.
               
               "Now, Rachel," said Mrs. Harman, hypocritically, "you shouldn't have said anything
                  about it, and got the little fellows blamed for a little pleasure. It was only a
                  boyish freak, I dare say."
               "If the children have been absent from school, without permission, it is best for
                  them and for me that I should know it," replied Mrs. Leighton; but the shadow upon
                  her heart had fallen also upon her countenance, and she was glad when her visitors
                  departed, to be left alone with her children.
               When the hour for them to retire had arrived, she called them from their play and
                  accompanied them to their little room, and closing the door she drew them near
                  her.
               "Children," she said, kindly, "I have been told that you were both absent from
                  school this afternoon. If this is true I want to know why, and how it happened.
                  Alfred, you are the oldest, and I look to you for an account of it, and I hope you
                  have courage and love of right enough, to tell me 'the truth, the whole truth, and
                  nothing but the truth.'"
               Willie's face was crimson, his lip quivered, and he burst into tears.
               Alfred's face, too, was crimson, but not with grief. It was partly mortification
                  and partly rage against Miss Rachel, who he well knew was the informer. His
                  clenched hands and nodding head indicated the internal conflict.
               "Don't tell me now, dear," said Mrs. Leighton; "wait until you feel better about
                  it;" and Willie, with his head leaning on her shoulder, sobbed bitterly.
               At last he stammered out, "I didn't want to play truant, mother, truly I
                  didn't."
               "If my little boys have been led into temptation and wrong, and are suffering for
                  it now," said Mrs. Leighton, "the only way to be happy again is to confess all,
                  and truly repent of having done the wrong; to be grieved or angry, because we are
                  found out in a bad deed, you know is not to repent of it."
               "But I was sorry all the time," said Willie, "before you had found it out, but I
                  was afraid to tell you."
               "I am not afraid to tell," said Alfred, whose proud spirit was
                  touched. "I staid away from school this afternoon because I was real angry with
                  Miss Fitz; she scolded me and made me angry this morning, because I couldn't get
                  my arithmetic lesson; it was the hardest lesson in the book, and I failed, and she
                  said I should learn it this afternoon, and if I failed again she would punish me
                  with the ratan. I knew I couldn't learn it, for she would not explain it a bit,
                  and I wasn't going there to be flogged this hot afternoon, I know.
                  Then I asked Willie to go with me down the brook in the meadow; when we came to
                  Mr. Harman's field we began to build a little dam. Pretty soon Miss Rachel saw us
                  and she came down there, and then I suppose she came straight here and told
                     you, and she is a mean, old,"—
               "Stop! dear," said Mrs. Leighton, "don't call harsh names, I understand it all,
                  now; I am indeed very, very sorry that it has happened, but very glad
                  that it is all explained. Which, do you think, shows the bravest spirit, children,
                  to dodge a difficulty and shrink away from it, or to boldly meet it, and conquer
                  it?"
               "I could have given a solution to every question in that lesson," said Alfred,
                  with flashing eyes, "if she would only have explained a little at the beginning so
                  that I could get started."
               "Whenever you have difficult lessons, after this," said Mrs. Leighton, "bring home
                  the book; I shall not tell you the answers, but I shall put you in the way to
                  understand it, so that you can find them out. I want you to learn to battle with
                  the difficulties, and conquer them; it will make you strong minded and manly, and
                  I want to help you too, in a still better cause,—I want to help you to love
                     the right and to grow brave enough to do right, let
                  who will laugh, or ridicule you, or provoke you; but my dear children, you-know I
                  cannot make you good, I can only help you to be good.
                  Just in proportion as you try to drive away all evil out of your hearts, so much
                  will the good Father in heaven send you strength to do good, and put good feelings
                  and principles in your hearts."
               Under the influence of soothing words the storm in Alfred's heart had subsided,
                  and in softened mood he leaned upon the open window sill. Willie had dried his
                  tears, and put his arm around his mother's neck.
               Mrs. Leighton took a little hymn book from the table and read aloud a sweet hymn,
                  and then repeated a short selection from the Bible, which the boys repeated
                  together after her. The evening prayers
                  were then said, and the children, calm and quiet, lay down in their little
                  bed.
               Mrs. Leighton sat beside them a little while, talking of repentance, forgiveness
                  and resolution, and then stooping over them to give Willie a good-night kiss,
                  Alfred suddenly flung his arms around her neck and kissed her again and again, and
                  with quivering lip, exclaimed, "Mother! if everybody had tried as you do to make
                  me a good boy, I should never have been so naughty."
               Days, and weeks, passed on, and the stepmother's triumph was complete. Not that
                  she could govern, and remit her vigilance,—no—for it was a work of constant
                  watching, checking, encouraging; line upon line, and precept upon precept, were
                  necessary to retain the ground already gained. The work of reform was slow, but
                  constant,—sometimes it is true there would seem to be an occasional indifference,
                  or an old error would spring out in a new spot or with a new form, but the hopeful
                  mother knew she labored in God's vineyard, and so, undismayed by difficulties, she
                  labored on. The busy neighbors sought in vain for evidences of cruelty, though
                  they strove to discover weakness and laxity of purpose and government, but failing
                  here they were at last silenced; and even Miss Watson was forced to acknowledge
                  that Mrs. Leighton did "manage those two unruly boys."
            
            
               THREE THINGS TO BE AVOIDED BY THE YOUNG.
               BY REV. H. C. FISH.
               THE most critical period of human existence is that which elapses between twelve
                  and twenty-one years of age. It is such because then the character,
                  to a greater extent than during any other equal term of years, takes its
                  unchanging type, its abiding form. Prior to this the waxen tablet receives
                  impressions more readily, but they are also more readily effaced. Subsequent
                  thereto, the impressions received are comparatively few. In the one case the
                  melted wax is too soft, and marks upon its watery surface are easily lost. In the
                  other it is too indurated to take the mould with readiness. During
                     this period it is in the transition state; it is then
                  hardening, and whether it be the hand of virtue, or of impiety that would leave
                  its impress there, neither will again behold so favorable a time for success.
               Moreover, youth is the season of dangers multiplied and fearful. It is wisdom in
                  the young to be mindful of this, and kindness in those of more experience to point
                  out the sources whence spring those evils to which they are most
                  exposed. If we mistake not they are these; bad associates—bad
                     books—bad habits.
               
                  1. Bad associates prove the ruin of not a few.
                  MAN is constituted a sociable being. He loves company. He
                     deprecates solitude. If he becomes a hermit it is contrary to his nature. He
                     was not designed to be such by his Maker. God is not alone—he
                     dwells not without society. In his very nature there is a
                     plurality as well as unity; and for "his pleasure" he created, ages upon ages
                     since, angels to be his companions; and subsequently
                        men, who, though ruined, will, in part, be rescued and made to
                     dwell with God in heaven. Our Maker loves society. And then, in
                     distributing the works of his hand, he has arranged them upon the social plan.
                     The stars are not 
                        seperate
                        separate
                      and alone in solitude. They are found in clusters, grouped together
                     with matchless skill. The sun, the moon, the earth, the planets, as they roll
                     in space, or travel their long rounds at God's behest, have their attendants.
                     Each feels the influence of his
                     fellows. No, God has not deprived even his material creatures of
                     companionship, much less those that have the breath of life. The beasts of the
                     forests congregate—so do those domesticated. The birds of heaven, and the fowls
                     of the air and earth, flock together. Bees live in swarms, and the
                     myriads of insects that fan the air with their tiny wings, and make music with
                     their glee, float and sport in companies. The tribes of the deep are found in
                     herds, and wherever living beings are brought to view, this one
                     law is discoverable, the law of congregation; this one feature
                     characterizes them, a fondness for society.
                  In no race of beings is this propensity stronger than in man, and in no class
                     of mankind so prominent as in the young. This is their
                     spring-time. It is in the days of vernal loveliness that the
                     feathered tribes choose their mates, and chirp with merriest notes. So of man.
                     When the foliage of his life is sere, and moaning winds are singing beforehand
                     his requiem around his naked head, if he has not quite forgot the
                     days of sunny youth, and lost his love for the companionship of friends, he
                     scarcely deems it confinement to sit alone in "his old armed chair," and bend
                     in solitude upon the top of his staff to watch the decaying embers upon the
                     familiar hearth-stone, fit emblem of the decay of life's fire within. But in
                     youth it is far otherwise. Then, men dread confinement. Then, gay and jubilant,
                     they love to listen to each other's sweet voices, and reciprocate kind words
                     and looks of affection. Then, they are 
                        gladest
                        gladdest
                      when most in society; and as naturally are found together as the
                     rain-drops that form the clouds, or the particles of dew upon the tender rose
                     leaf. It is right that it is so—so their Creator designed it. Let them be
                     companionable—it is not good that they should be alone. But this propensity for
                     society, in itself harmless, is oftentimes the occasion of evils exceedingly
                     pernicious. And this, because it is not restrained by prudence, and accompanied
                     in its indulgence by discrimination. The young are inexperienced and
                     unsuspicious, and hence, too ready to become intimate with any and all who may
                     be thrown in their way. Besides this, there is a pride of spirit, which
                     inclines them to seek the good opinion of their equals or superiors, to imitate
                     their example and practice what they practice. The result is, that rather than
                     appear singular or unsociable, and perhaps break friendship with an
                     acquaintance, they are led to do that which their sober judgment ment condemns.
                     Many a one has made shipwreck of character from this circumstance. He thought
                     to take the social glass, to play the "innocent" game, to join in the harmless
                     amusement but once; and having once done it for want of resolution
                     to say "no," and courage to appear, if need be, "awkward and
                     singular," he was easily led on from one step to another to utter ruin.
                  Now from these considerations, and others that might be alluded to, the only
                     safety for the young is to avoid bad company altogether. And in this
                     designation we include all who are not virtuous, whose morals are not
                     commendable, who are intemperate, unchaste, or profane. And it should be borne
                     in mind, that all are not virtuous who generally are esteemed such. Besides the
                     openly dissipated, vulgar, and abandoned, there are persons "of decent morals,
                     polished manners, and interesting talents, but who, at the same time, are
                     unprincipled and wicked; who make light of sacred things, and scoff at
                     religion, and deride the suggestions and scruples of a tender conscience as
                     superstitious."
                  With such, we say, the young, who have the least respect for themselves, and
                     desire to possess a proper character, should not associate; no, not for an
                     hour.
                  "Evil communications corrupt good manners." No one, especially one whose habits
                     are not fixed, can be certain of not being corrupted by evil society. It is
                     contagious. One can scarcely avoid being infected by it. Can a man "take coals
                     of fire in his bosom and not be burned?" Can one become the companion of the
                     impure and remain pure? That is a trite proverb, "Show me a man's company and I
                     will tell you his character." "Decaying fruit corrupts the neighboring fruit."
                     The virus from one fleece infects the whole flock. "One sinner destroyeth much
                     good." A whole family, an entire neighborhood, and, in time, a city may feel in
                        morals as well as in physics, the contagious influence of a
                     single person.
                  We are so constituted that we must receive impressions from those about us. The
                     human soul is like the polished tablet in the operation of the daguerreotype,
                     catching impressions from every object that chances to pass before it. Mr.
                     Locke says, "we are all a kind of chameleons who take a tincture from the
                     objects which surround us."
                  Naturalists tell us that some insects and plants change their color and become
                     like the tree or rock upon which they live. It is so of man; he assimilates by a law of his nature to
                     those with whom he comes in contact.
                  A celebrated painter made it a rule never to look at a bad picture, having
                     found by experience, that whenever he did so, his pencil took a tint from it.
                     So a single hour's intercourse with a vicious person may imprint a stain upon
                     one's character for life.
                  If this tendency to assimilation is a principle of our nature, than which
                     nothing is more true, how can one, voluntarily become the companion of the
                     corrupt? The words of the author of the Proverbs are here in point. "He that
                     walketh with wise men shall be wise; but the companion of fools shall be
                     destroyed." "Make no friendship with an angry man, and with a furious man thou
                     shalt not go, lest thou learn his ways and get a snare to thy
                     soul." Nor less applicable the benediction pronounced upon "the man that
                     walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners,
                     nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful." Let the young, then, as they respect,
                     their own characters and regard the feelings of those anxious for their good,
                     avoid intercourse with the immoral. Select, first of all, and only, the
                        virtuous for your associates.
               
               
                  THREE THINGS TO BE AVOIDED BY THE YOUNG.
                  II. BAD BOOKS.
                  2. AVOID bad books. The historian Rollin narrates that the poems
                     of Archilocus, the inventor of the Iambic verse, which possessed an uncommon
                     force of expression, and were full of bold thoughts, notwithstanding their
                     excellences were banished from Sparta, because of being exceedingly biting and
                     licentious, which made them more likely to corrupt the youth than become useful
                     in cultivating their understanding. The writer thus comments on this decree of
                     the Spartans.—"Such a niceness in a heathen people with regard to the quality
                     of the books which they thought young persons should be permitted to read, is
                     highly worthy of our notice, and will rise up in condemnation of many
                     Christians." There can be no doubt of it. It is bad enough that corrupt
                     writings find detestable testable men to publish them; but far worse that
                     parents are so reckless as to the purity and welfare of their sons and
                     daughters as to permit these missiles of Satan to smite and destroy the fairest
                     portion of God's handy-work, and that directly under their own eyes, if not
                     encouraged by their own example. But what are bad books? What names do they
                     bear? Their name is legion, for they are many.
                  Can one number and name the locusts that invaded Egypt and destroyed every
                     green thing? or the frogs and vermin that came up in swarms into the houses,
                     overrunning their ovens and kneeding-troughs; aye, and entering their
                        bed-chambers? Then may one tell the names of these modern invaders,
                     that curse our country more bitterly than did the ten plagues the land of the
                     Nile. They are not to be named, but they may, to some extent, be described.
                  There are some books openly obscene, filled with representations and printed
                     matter, which are, as one says, "scooped out of the very lava of corrupt
                     passions." It is, at the same time, creditable to our country, and a cause of
                     gratitude, that, except in the high places of wickedness, the circulation of
                     such base productions is quite restricted.
                  Along side of this class of books, and not less exceptionable comes a
                        second class, a description of which we shall borrow from the
                     pen of a master hand. "France, where religion, long ago, went out smothered in
                     licentiousness, has flooded the world with a literature redolent of depravity.
                     Novels of the French schools and of English imitators, are the common sewers of
                     society, into which are drained the concentrated filth of the worst passions of
                     the worst creatures of the worst cities." And it is justly added concerning the
                     importing and reprinting of these, "it were a mercy to this, to
                     import serpents from Africa, and pour them out on our prairies, lions from
                     Asia, and free them in our forests, lizards, scorpions, and black tarantulas
                     from the Indies, and put them in our gardens."
                  Many of these productions, it is true, are rendered attractive. They present
                     not vice in such a form as to disgust; they are not entirely destitute of
                     literary merit, and most of them pretend to teach human nature;
                     and some morals, and some religion even! But, because of these
                     blandishments, their authors are more wicked, because more captivating, and the
                     works themselves the more to be deprecated.
                  
                  
                     
                        "As are those apples, pleasant to the eye,
                        But full of smoke within, which used to grow
                        Near that strange lake, where God poured from the sky
                        Huge showers of flame, worse flame to overthrow;
                        Such are their works, that with a glowing show
                        Of humble holiness, in virtue's dye
                        Would color mischief, while within they glow
                        With coals of sin, though none the smoke descry.
                        Bad is that angel that erst fell from heaven,
                        But not so bad as he, nor in worse case,
                        Who hides a traitorous mind with smiling face,
                        And with a dove's white feathers clothes a raven."
                     
                  
                  As to this class of books, also, we have confidence to believe of those who
                     peruse these pages, that they know little of them by the experience of their
                     baneful effects. Would that it were true of all the youth of our land! It was
                     lately testified in Court by the father of a ruined daughter, that the death of
                     her lover, the disgrace of the family, and her own infamy, were all occasioned
                     by "reading the impure works of Bulwer and Eugene Sue." It was but one
                     illustration of thousands, of the pernicious consequences of a familiarity with
                     writings of these and other like loathsome characters. We warn you against
                     these depositories of the virus of a moral leprosy. Avoid the slightest contact
                     with them—shun them as you would a rabid dog. The only safe course is to
                        let them alone. Your modesty once outraged, the imagination
                     once debauched, the appetite once enkindled, it may be like the introduction of
                     a fire-brand into a powder-house.
                  The third, class is made up of our common novels: (we employ the
                     word in its usual acceptation.) These books are widely circulated, and have
                     many devotees and defenders. Perhaps the sometimes indiscriminate and
                     unqualified denunciations of works of this kind, have not diminished their
                     number. It ought to be admitted, as it seems to us, that some
                     novels can be read by the young without injury. The number,
                     however, of those whose perusal would be safe and profitable is exceedingly
                     small. We would speak with caution; but this, we think, will be
                     generally admitted, even by the advocates of such reading, that for the most
                     part, they are, at least, fruitless of good, except it be mere
                     pastime or amusement. They do not inform the mind, or purify the heart. The
                     reading of this light literature may be thought, by some, necessary to the
                     accomplishments plishments of refined life; but in what respect is
                     it a valuable acquisition to one that he is acquainted with the multitude of
                     fictitious productions that teem from the press? He must, necessarily, sadly
                     neglect other books. And, to be honest, we mark it as a pitiable
                        "accomplishment" in a young lady or gentleman to know the names
                     of novelists, better than those of historians, theologians, and
                     scholars—to be able to converse very familiarly of their productions, but
                     remain so profoundly ignorant of the Bible, as to blush if
                     interrogated as to the number or names of the books it contains, or whether
                     Judith and the Maccabees belong to the Sacred Canon or the Apocrypha—to possess
                     a familiarity with the stories and exploits of Don Quixotte, or the Arabian
                     Nights, and the silly trash of some "favorite author," and know almost nothing
                     of the acts of prophets and apostles and the story of the cross. Is not such a
                     one, in justice, an object of pity, if not of contempt, rather than of
                     admiration and esteem? Does this fit one for the stern duties and
                     solemn responsibilities of life? Does it qualify one to be either happy or
                     useful? O! no. To testify the least of such writings, they do not
                     furnish the mind with valuable knowledge or elevate the noblest affections of
                     the soul. But are we not justified in saying more? Are there not, in most
                     instances, positive evils arising from, if not caused by, the perusal of
                     popular fictions? Do they not generally present character in a false light,
                     often causing the vile and detestable to appear attractive, and doing injustice
                     to the truly excellent? Do they not lead the reader to form a false estimate of
                     life; to lose sight of its true objects and aims, and throw a delusive vail
                     over its sober realities, and thus secure one's unpreparedness to meet them?
                     Readers of romances dwell in an imaginative, an ideal world, and
                     naturally enough discard the common duties and unexciting labors of
                     every-day-life. They live upon excitement; when this is furnished all is well;
                     when wanting, all is gone, and life is to them a sickening monotony. Moreover,
                     have those who entertain a passion for the perusal of fictitious works, a
                     relish for simple, unvarnished truth? Are such, in the main, deep scholars,
                     careful students of veritable history, and works of solid literature, and
                     useful science! Have they a fondness for reading the Bible,—that book, compared
                     with which, all others sink into insignificance!
                  We believe the well nigh universal history of novel-readers compels us to
                     answer in the negative. God's word becomes insipid; and with it other truly valuable productions, just
                     in proportion to the interest felt in these works of imagination. Again, the
                     reading of such works oftentimes stifles and dissipates serious and religious
                     feelings. The subjects of such feelings not unfrequently quench their anxiety
                     of mind by recourse to the novel. The cup and the romance are the two common,
                     aye, and but too fatal resorts, when an awakened conscience is an
                     unwelcome guest. But beyond this, we inquire, do not popular fictions tend
                     directly to corrupt the young?
                  It is not intimated that this charge can be brought against every
                     work of the imagination. But here is the evil: the reading of one
                     often leads to the reading of another. As with intoxicating drinks, (and there
                     is a striking analogy between the two, the one for the body, the other for the
                     mind,) one glass leads to a second, a small to a large one, and so on to ruin.
                     So in the case before us, he who reads one (grant that it is unexceptionable or
                     even, in itself, profitable) is in danger of desiring the excitement of
                     another, and another more highly wrought, progressing from bad to worse, until
                     he can unblushingly peruse the most objectionable books that are published.
                  That such is the natural result of novel reading is too apparent to admit of a
                     doubt; and hence, it seems to us, that the charge of a tendency to corrupt the
                     mind, may justly be brought against works of fiction, as a
                     class.
                  We have seen it somewhere stated that in one of our cities, three youths,
                     within as many months, were convicted of crimes committed in imitation of the
                     hero of a single novel. There is reason to believe that the expurgation of the
                     country of this kind of books would be a decided advantage on the score of a
                     sound morality.
                  We have not spoken of the waste of time in reading such works. Of
                        time, 
                        
                           "That stuff that life is made of;
                           And which, when lost, is never lost alone,
                           Because it carries souls upon its wings;"
                        
                      and every moment of which we are under obligation to improve, for some
                     useful end. Nor of the waste of time and intellect in supplying these
                     productions, which is, (where a great mind is employed in doing
                     it,) as Wilberforce says of Scott, like "a giant spending his time in
                     cracking nuts;" and which waste ceases when their productions cease to be
                     patronized. Nor has allusion been made to the cost of acquiring
                     them; which, although it is often trifling to the individual, is, in the
                     aggregate, not inconsiderable, for it is estimated that the pretty sum of from
                        twelve to fifteen millions has been expended in
                     the United States, upon works of this character within five years.
                  Of our advice, therefore, to the young, on this subject, this is the sum; (and
                     we believe the judgment of our respected readers is with us;) that, on the
                     whole, such books be avoided. The reading of a few might not, in itself, be
                     harmful, but may be the occasion of evil results. The
                        safer course is not to commence the reading of
                     them. In your more mature years, when the habits are rendered more fixed, and
                     the judgment more informed, you may select and read a few of the best, to
                     advantage; but in youth, abstinence is wisdom. There is enough, full enough, in
                     the real world to be learned. Earth and heaven are full of wonders, and he is
                     wisest who applies himself with greatest diligence to their study. Read
                     Creation's scroll—read the book of Providence—read the book of Grace.
                        This will have a tendency to perfect your moral and
                     intellectual powers, and qualify you for an existence of usefulness, happiness,
                     and peace.
                  Suffer me farther to remark on this point: avoid infidel and skeptical works;
                     also, those containing the lives and exploits of pirates, robbers,
                     and villains. These are baneful in their influence. Throw them
                     into the fire—they are fit only to be burned.
               
               
                  
                  THREE THINGS TO BE AVOIDED BY THE YOUNG.
                  III. BAD HABITS.
                  3. AVOID bad habits. Some one has defined man to be a bundle
                        of habits. It is not a bad definition. What has he, what is he, but
                     what he has acquired; and what becomes his but by use, by habit? True he eats
                     and breathes and sleeps, not because he is accustomed to do so, but because it
                     is a law of his nature. But how many actions he performs, how many thoughts of
                     a given character pass through his mind, how many impulses he feels, merely
                     because of their having been indulged in before. It is not too strongly
                     expressed, that old proverb, "Habit is second nature." Now, as has
                     been intimated, character takes its shape, for the most part, in
                        youth; and that too, oftentimes from apparently slight
                     causes.
                  
                     
                        "A pebble on the streamlet scant,
                        Has turned the course of many a river;
                        A dew-drop on the baby plant
                        Has warped the giant oak for ever."
                     
                  
                  True, men of mature years sometimes fall into new habits; but, mainly, their
                     conduct is what it was in youth. Habits of profanity, intemperance, lewdness,
                     or any vice have their origin here.
                  What we would then, impress particularly on the minds of our young friends, as
                     a matter of vast importance, is this; that they now indulge in
                     none of those vices so common to mankind.
                  On this point the anxiety of virtuous parents and friends chiefly terminates.
                     As they look upon beloved youth, so unconscious of the snares of the adversary
                     by which they are thickly beset, so ready to yield to every impulse or
                     suggestion, and forming mean-while their characters for eternity, they cannot
                     but inwardly exclaim, "O that I could take you by the hand and lead you safe
                     from danger now! O that I could throw around you some
                     shield, till you had passed the enchanted ground, till by manhood and womanhood
                     you had become less vulnerable to evil!" Luther used to say that he was well
                     known in three places; heaven, earth, and hell. So are you, ye
                     young; and never again will the attention of either place be more intently
                     fixed on you than at present. Satan knew Luther as well when a boy as he did
                     after he became a man. God and angels and good men are all interested in you
                     now; and the infernal world moves itself to plan and secure the destruction of
                     your future well-doing, by inducing you to early commence the practice of
                     vicious indulgences.
                  We know the path of evil practices does not present itself to your view as one
                     that is to be altogether evaded. It is pleasing to nature, for the time being,
                     to yield. "The way of vice," as the ancients used to say, "is down
                        hill." It is but to yield to follow it. But is it the
                     less to be shunned? Is it the less to be dreaded because its snares and
                     pit-falls are excluded from view under objects and scenes attractive to the
                     senses? Because sweet voices are singing around you, when tempted to do evil,
                     is it the less certain that they are to allure you to ruin? Because many an
                     inviting banquet is spread before you at evil's gate, is it the less certain
                     that poison is in every dish?
                  Have you forgotten that "there is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the
                     end thereof are the ways of death?" Be not deceived under a vain show. Enter
                     not the way of evil. Watch the beginnings of bad practices. Learn
                     to correct wrong doing before it acquires the force of habit.
                  
                     
                        "The course of evil
                        
                           Begins so slowly, and from such slight source,
                        An infant's hand might stop the breach with clay;
                        But, let the stream get deeper, and philosophy,
                        Aye, and religion too, shall strive in vain
                        To turn the headlong current."
                     
                  
                  Do you see that young man of eighteen, taking his first glass? Run, warn him of
                     his danger. Does he heed your admonitions? It is well. But he does not.
                     Associations return; he again and again indulges, till the bowl is his
                     companion. He is now thirty, or forty and five. But O! how changed! Look at him
                     now, the veriest slave of his appetite. He has lost self-respect,
                     and imagines that he is despised of all. He is sick of life. In his sober
                     moments he weeps in secret over his folly. He promises, he vows
                     reformation. But it is not an easy matter now. He is the
                     personification of Southey's picture of a man struggling with his vices.
                  
                  
                     
                        "Far from his shoulders grew
                        Two snakes of monstrous size,
                        Which ever at his head
                        Aimed their rapacious teeth,
                        To satiate raving hunger with his brain.
                        He, in the eternal conflict oft would seize,
                        Their swelling necks, and in his giant grasp
                        Bruise them, and rend their flesh with bloody nails,
                        And howl for agony;
                        Feeling the pangs he gave; for of himself,
                        Co-sential and inseparable parts,
                        The snaky torturers grew."
                     
                  
                  How different the position of things in the man described at eighteen, and at
                     forty-five! He may yet reform, but how sure that he will not!
                  It were easy to have destroyed the evil practice in its inception; but far
                     otherwise now. As Dr. Griffin was wont to say, you may defend the Thermopylæ by
                     which the enemy would penetrate into your country; but when he has once entered
                     and taken possession of all the strong holds, who shall dislodge
                        him? Take heed, then, as to what habits you form. They are to be your
                     companions for life. If virtuous, they will be your brightest ornaments and
                     richest sources of gratification. If otherwise, they will prove scorpions to
                     your bosom, and plant life's pathway with thorns. Nor forget this; that regard
                     to the two first mentioned sources of evil (bad associates and bad books) is
                     absolutely requisite in order to ensure success in this particular. You cannot
                     form habits of morality if your associates are evil-minded and immoral, and
                     your books the unholy productions of unsanctified minds. To do all this you
                     will require assistance from above. And this Heaven will vouchsafe to such as
                     heartily desire and early seek to obtain it. "They that seek me early shall
                     find me." Religion is youth's safeguard. Moreover, arm yourselves
                     with firmness of soul. Learn to resist. Exercise self-denial.
                     Maintain self-control. Surmount temptations. Meet the trials of your moral
                     fortitude courageously; and every new trial will add to your strength, and
                     exalt your character in the scale of being. It is Godlike to overcome. And let
                     any youth conscious of the beginnings of vicious indulgences cease
                        now, to do evil and learn to do well. The wax is cooling,—the
                     clay is hardening, and evil habits, if allowed to remain, will soon become
                     fixed, like footprints in the sand-stone, or bones petrified in the rock of
                     flint.
