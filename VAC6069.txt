            A STORY OF ENGLISH LIFE,

               OPINIONS OF THE PRESS:
               [From The Chicago Standard.] "Avondale is a book whose author has gained no
                  inconsiderable reputation as a writer, both of prose and verse. It has been well
                  received by the critics, and is, in fact, superior to much of the literature of
                  the day; and it is refreshing to get hold of a book that reads like nature in
                  life, instead of the stilted extravagances which constitute too much the style of
                  modern fiction. The teachings of Avondale tend in the direction of virtue, honor
                  and moral sentiment."
               [From the Chicago Evening Journal.] "Avondale is a novel of a high moral
                  character, and rich in valuable information and useful suggestions. It abounds in
                  classical allusions, but is not pedantic. The plot is deep, and is worked up in a
                  way to hold the interest. The tone of the work is ennobling, and the book is far
                  above the average of current romances."
               [From the Chicago Advance.] "Avondale is a story of English life pleasantly told
                  by Prof. Thos. Clarke. Its scenes are well described, its incidents natural, and
                  its conversations sensible and edifying."
               [From the Chicago Inter-Ocean.] "Avondale reminds us of Fielding in some respects,
                  and of George Eliot in others. There is a touch of Parson Adams in its classical
                     allusions sions, and
                  excellent debates on questions of political and social interest, while its love
                  scenes recal the authoress of Evelina and Cecilia. The author possesses a
                  narrative power, a knowledge of human nature, a wealth of reading and a clearness
                  of reasoning which must recommend his book to the notice of those who look beneath
                  the surface. His descriptions of Irish life and character, of Liverpool tailors
                  and London footmen, remind one of Richardson; and, in fact, the book is superior
                  to seven out of every ten novels we have perused during the last few years."
               [From The Western Catholic.] "Avondale is a work of much thought and information,
                  generally interesting and often beautiful in description. The author's deep
                  knowledge of human nature is traceable on every page. His love for rural scenery
                  is often realized in his attractive views of wood, flower-enameled vale and highly
                  wrought pen pictures of a country life."
            
            
               From Alfred Dutch, Esq., the well-known Scholar and Critic.
               
                  TO PROF. THOS. CLARKE:
               
               
                  Dear Sir:—I have just read your excellent novel, Avondale, with deep
                  interest and delight. It will stand the test of criticism suggested by Martial: "A
                  book that is destined to live must be pervaded by genius.' Avondale ought to be in
                  every library.
               Thus we see that AVONDALE ranks with the best novels of the past, and is
                  absolutely without a rival to-day.

               "'The Two Angels' essays the great theme of the origin of evil. The plot possesses
                  interest and power, while its influence is thrown upon the side of virtue and
                     religion."—Chicago Advance, (Congregational.)
               "Mr. Clarke's previous poems have all been well received by the press and the
                  public. 'The Two Angels' takes captive the reader, and carries him away in spite
                  of himself."—Chicago Standard, (Baptist.)
               "There is genuine poetry on every page, and whoever commences, the perusal of 'The
                  Two Angels' will not lay the book down till he has finished it."—Mrs.
                     Livermore in the New Covenant.
               
               "The story of 'The Two Angels' will bear witness to the learning and genius of its
                     author."—Chicago Evening Journal.
               
               "The best English critics have awarded to Mr. Clarke a high rank among the first
                  poets of the age."—Chicago Tribune.
               
               "The story of 'The Two Angels' is decidedly superior to 'Milton's Paradise Lost.'
                  Mr. Clarke has great facility in versification, his fable is ingenious, his fancy
                  fruitful, and his diction correct and elegant.—Chicago Republican.
               
               "The pleasure we derive from Mr. Clarke's volumes is enhanced by the fact that the
                  author is one of our most estimable citizens."—Western Rural.
               
               "Dear Sir: Your 'Two Angels' took me captive at the first introduction (as did its
                  author), and love-led me to the end with delight."—Alfred
                     Dutch, Esq., of Chicago.
               
               "Dear Sir: Your beautiful poem, 'The Two Angels,' I have read with the deepest
                  interest. It is concise, and in my judgment, more than beautiful, it is
                     perfect."—Hon. Judge Joseph Knox, of Chicago.
               
               "Mr. Clarke's works have received the stamp of public approbation; and having

               INTRODUCTION.
               
                  AVONDALE, September 6, 18—.
                  
                     TO FRANK DUNWOODY, ESQ.
                  
               
               WHEN the heart is oppressed with sorrow, or under the influence of deep emotion,
                  it naturally seeks solace in the sympathy of friendship.
               To you, my dear Frank, I turn, as my earliest friend, hoping that I shall find
                  that consolation for which my heart yearns, in pouring out my whole soul to one
                  whose love and kindness I have experienced under all circumstances, and who has
                  proved himself a true friend at a time when acts speak louder than words, and when
                  others who had made greater pretensions were found deficient when put to the
                  test.
               But your absence with your regiment in India has rendered it impossible for you to
                  become acquainted with the great calamity which has recently befallen our family.
                  This it is now my painful duty to acquaint you with.
               You are aware that I had almost finished my collegiate course when you left; but
                  you had scarcely touched at the port of your destination when the occurrence of which I write came suddenly and
                  unexpectedly upon us.
               I had passed my final examination with applause, and was awaiting the arrival of
                  my father and sister, to witness and participate in my triumph, when I was handed
                  a letter which stunned and, for the time being, utterly unmanned me. I am ashamed
                  to confess it, but friendship demands that nothing—not even our weaknesses—should
                  be concealed from a friend.
               The letter in question brought me the appalling intelligence that my father's bank
                  in Armagh had stopped payment, in consequence of a panic which had caused a run
                  upon it; that my beloved father himself had been thrown into prison for debt, and
                  that our worldly prospects were ruined beyond the hope of recovery.
               This blow was so sudden and unexpected that all who knew us stood aghast at the
                  news, as if such an event had been among the impossibilities. Nevertheless, it was
                  a fact—one that could not be disputed.
               As to the remote causes of it, it is not necessary now to enter upon the details.
                  I shall merely dwell upon the consequences, which were terrible to us, at least
                  for the moment. My poor father, lately so prosperous and honored, now reduced to
                  poverty and distress, and the inmate of a prison! and a family lately rolling in
                  wealth and luxury reduced at once to dependence and humiliation! What a
                  reverse!
               But, fortunately, the imprisonment of my dear father was of brief duration. It had
                  been unnecessary—the work of an over-zealous attorney, who had gone beyond the
                  limits of his orders; and it was regarded by all good men as harsh and cruel.
               Only a short time was necessary to place matters in their true light, and to
                  vindicate the character and honor of my father in the eyes of the world. He gave
                  up everything he possessed to his creditors, without the slightest reserve. It was
                  found that his assets would be sufficient to satisfy all just demands; and so
                  pleased were his creditors that they would have returned him a considerable sum,
                  in admiration of his integrity, but this he refused to accept, although he had
                  nothing left that he could now call his own.
               My sister and I were now the only consolation he had to look up to in this world,
                  for death had kindly spared our sainted mother the pain which this sudden change
                  of fortune must have caused her had she lived to witness it; and though we had
                  deeply lamented her loss, we were now grateful to Heaven that she had been removed
                  from the cares of this lower sphere and exalted to a higher and happier state of
                  existence in the eternal world.
               Philosophy is a good thing, but it generally fails to give consolation when it is
                  most needed. My sister and myself—young, ardent and hopeful—could not easily
                  reconcile ourselves to the sudden change that had thus blighted our fair prospects
                  in life and turned its whole current into darkness and tears; and, no doubt,
                  indications of such feeling were visible in our look and demeanor, though
                  outwardly we desired to assume a look of resignation and repose.
               Our beloved father was not slow in detecting these secret thoughts that were
                  preying upon our minds and sapping the foundations of our happiness, and he was
                  prompt in discovering and applying an appropriate remedy. Taking us, therefore,
                  aside, he addressed us in his usually mild but firm manner, as follows:
               "My children, although Divine Providence has deemed it right to take from us our
                  wealth, and with it that station in life which we have hitherto, I trust, usefully
                  and honorably filled, that is no reason why we should repine or be inconsolable
                  for our loss. Have we not still much left for which we ought to be thankful?
                  Health, a sound mind and a clear conscience, the greatest of all earthly
                  blessings, are still the possessions of each of us. As long as these are ours,
                  though we possessed nothing besides, we can never be poor; without them riches
                  were vile and loathsome poverty. In the time of our prosperity I trust I did not
                  neglect those duties which a parent owes to his children. I have endeavored to
                  cultivate your minds and to imbue them with
                  those principles of virtue and honor of which no casualties can deprive you. These
                  advantages aiding your natural gifts and talents, which are of a high order, will
                  enable you to wrestle successfully with the world in this your hour of adversity;
                  and it is incumbent on you to employ them now for your own support and that of an
                  aged parent who has labored all his life for your happiness, and whom no
                  imprudence of his own, but an unforeseen calamity, has deprived of all the fruits
                  of his toil. Why do I say calamity, since you, my dearest treasures, are spared to
                  me? All else I count as dross, so long as you remain to bless me, my darling
                  children."
               Here the old man threw an arm around each of us, and pressed us tenderly to his
                  heart, while the warm tears trickled down his furrowed cheeks.
               "Yes," continued he, as he kissed us repeatedly, "let it all go; let the world do
                  its worst—let the elements themselves conspire against us, if they will, so long
                  as I can fold you thus in my arms, while I can thus gaze upon your innocent faces,
                  and whilst my ears can drink in the sweet sound of your voices, I shall be
                  happy—too happy to think of aught besides. May Heaven in its mercy spare you to
                  me, my children, and may its choicest blessings accompany you in all the paths of
                  life."
               Long before our dear father had concluded his blessing both my sister and myself
                  were bathed in tears—tears of regret and shame mingled with tears of joy—regret
                  and shame at the consciousness of having repined at the will of Heaven, and joy to
                  think that we who had hitherto been a burden to our beloved parent should now be
                  deemed worthy to minister to his wants, and that, too, by calling on the resources
                  of our own industry; and, embracing him tenderly, we entreated him to inform us
                  how we could employ onr talents so as to be of service to him, assuring him that
                  we would be most happy to do anything, even submit to the greatest drudgery, to
                  gratify his humblest wish.
               "I have not been mistaken in my estimate of your characters," he replied; "you are
                  indeed the noble-minded, disinterested beings took you to be, and Heaven will
                  reward you for all this, both here and hereafter."
               "Dear father, we esteem it a great reward to have your approving smile, and we
                  consider it a great privilege to be called upon to labor for your comfort and
                  happiness," we both exclaimed in a breath.
               "I know it," he replied; "and now let us act, for there is no time to be wasted. I
                  will now acquaint you with the plan which I have formed for our future guidance
                  and direction. I suppose you are aware that my pecuniary resources are reduced to
                  the lowest ebb. The trifle that remains belongs not to me but to you. It was the
                  legacy of your dear departed mother, bequeathed to you, and to you alone. This
                  neither I nor my creditors could claim, which is fortunate, else it must have gone
                  with the rest. Justice must be done to you, my children, as well as to her who is
                  gone. Her gentle spirit in heaven would be grieved if her last request were not
                  complied with and her children should suffer in consequence.
               "With this wreck of our fortunes I propose, with your consent, to leave our native
                  land, beloved though it be, and to seek for fame and fortune on a foreign shore,
                  where we must sojourn at least till a better day, if such should ever visit us
                  again. The amount, however is not sufficient to carry us to the New World or any
                  of the colonies. We must therefore seek a home in England—great and powerful
                  England, which opens her arms freely to receive the oppressed and downtrodden of
                  all nations, and presents a field for talent and genius which excludes none that
                  are worthy to compete for the prize in any department of art, or science, or
                  thought.
               "Once there, I shall seek out some employment for each of you, suitable to your
                  talents and sexes; and I trust that by industry and prudence we may yet win for
                  ourselves competence and peace. I might indeed establish you here in your native
                  city, but it would be in a position so
                  widely different from what you have been accustomed to and taught to expect, that
                  the experiment would be painful both to me and yourselves. Better, therefore, will
                  it be to go amongst strangers, and there begin the world afresh; for I cannot bear
                  to see you looked down upon, especially by those who before our misfortunes would
                  have considered your slightest notice an honor. What say you to this proposition,
                  my children?"
               It is needless to say that my sister and myself acquiesced most willingly in this
                  proposition of our honored father, and assured him that in all things his will
                  would be our law; and so the matter was arranged and the time appointed for a
                  scene which we dreaded, and which I find it impossible to describe to you as I
                  would. I must therefore leave you to imagine it; and yet with you it is not all
                  imagination, for you, too, were forced to tear yourself from home and the bosom of
                  your family and friends, yet under different circumstances and far brighter hopes
                  for the future than we dared entertain. With us all was gloom, uncertainty and
                  sorrow; yet the cloud had a silver lining which has since shone forth to cheer and
                  comfort us in a most extraordinary manner;—but I must not anticipate.
               It is my purpose to unfold to you the whole story from the beginning—that is, from
                  the moment we took shipping up to the present time, and you will find many of the
                  incidents strange and eventful, but nothing distorted or unnatural—truth itself
                  being often more strange and startling than fiction; so that he who can do justice
                  to the one need never have recourse to the other for the purpose of giving a
                  higher color to his narrative, Nature's true colors being inimitable.
               
                  Ever your friend,
                  EDWARD MONTAGUE.
               
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               THE DEPARTURE.
               IT was on the 29th of May, 1829, when, after bidding farewell to our home, and the
                  few humble friends, the former recipients of our bounty, who were really sorry for
                  our misfortunes, that my beloved father, my sister and myself embarked on board a
                  steamboat in Carlingford Bay, at Warren Point, a few miles from Newry. It was
                  evening before the boat sailed, and the weather was delightfully warm. The surface
                  of the bay was as smooth as glass, scarcely a ripple disturbing the tranquil face
                  of the waters, save those which are produced by the gentle heaving of the tide.
                  The lower rim of the sun had just reached the horizon where it is bounded by the
                  Mourne mountains, and a flood of light was thrown from its broad disk over the
                  surface of the sea. For some distance it was one condensed stream, like a river
                  pent up between its banks; then it began to diverge in innumerable radii, and
                  finally to be spread over the whole breadth of the waters, as far as the eye could
                  reach, throwing into prominent light the tiny crests of the ripples, before
                  indistinct, and their intervening spaces into the most picturesque shade. I had
                  not then seen the beautiful evening pieces of Claude, but I have never since
                  looked upon those masterpieces without being forcibly reminded of the natural
                  picture which I gazed upon with such melancholy delight that evening. Hills
                  clothed in verdure and ornamented with trees up to their very summits; neat,
                     whitewashed cottages; gentlemen's
                  bathing-seats with gardens; groups of fishermen with women and children dressed in
                  the rough homespun of their native mountains, on one side;—the open bay
                  illuminated with the departing glories of the setting sun; innumerable boats
                  filled with gay, laughing parties taking their pleasure on its bosom; the
                  lighthouse, with its glaring red flame mimicking the blaze of the grand luminary,
                  with the open interminable sea view, on the other;—these were objects which could
                  not fail to attract the attention and awaken the admiration even of the dullest
                  and most insensible of mankind at any time: I leave you, therefore, to conceive
                  the impression they must have made on our minds at that peculiar moment, when
                  every object in that landscape, even the most minute, possessed a deep interest
                  for us, from the circumstance that we were about to lose all trace of our dear
                  native land, perhaps forever!
               While intent upon this picture we were scarcely conscious of receding from it
                  rapidly, and that the whole must soon vanish like a dream. Soon nothing but the
                  indistinct outline on the farthest verge of the horizon remained, like a cloud, to
                  mark the dear isle where all our hopes and prospects had once, and but lately,
                  centered. Our eyes remained fixed in that direction even long after the cloud had
                  ceased to be visible, and tears, which we would in vain conceal from each other,
                  dimmed them as we at length turned away to the contemplation of other objects.
               The feeling that I was now, for the first time, on the deep sea—narrow, indeed,
                  but yet a part of the great and boundless ocean by which all the countries on our
                  globe are connected together, and even brought close to each other by the skill,
                  the energy and the perseverance of man—that I was at that moment plowing its
                  surface by means of a machine of vast powers, which, though not yet fully
                  developed, was likely to create a complete revolution in the mode of intercourse
                  amongst nations, and in the arrangements of commerce and of war. This feeling,
                  with all its undefined and indistinct associations—the improvement of science, the
                  progress of knowledge and of virtue, the annihilation of bigotry and prejudices,
                  the perfectibility of the human race; then the starred canopy of heaven, in all
                  its stilly brightness, though infinitely distant, yet grasped, as it were, and
                  realized by the sublime and ambitious spirit of humanity; the beings that might
                  people the aërial space and the glowing orbs—until my mental vision penetrated the
                  mysterious veil flung around the throne of the Most High: these thoughts
                  overpowered me with emotion hitherto unknown, or known but faintly, and I became
                  conscious, in a certain degree, of possessing a more dignified state of
                  existence—a more noble motive of action than I had ever before conceived. The
                  glories of the heavens above, the wonders of the deep beneath, with all its living
                  myriads, were before me. The shadowy past, with all that ever breathed the breath
                  of life, either on the land or in the water—the grovelling beast, the mute fish,
                  and godlike man—were dwelt upon in silent awe. "Where now are all the creatures
                  that once lived, moved and had their being?" I inwardly exclaimed, "and what am I
                  amidst the wreck or the regeneration of nature?"
               While these thoughts were passing through my mind, my sister, who, shortly after
                  we lost sight of land, had gone down to the cabin with my father, now joined me on
                  the quarter-deck, and by her presence and gentle smile put to flight the reverie
                  in which I was indulging.
               "So," she said, with as cheerful a look as she could assume, "you have been
                  breaking our agreement! Do you forget the bargain I made with you before
                  embarking; namely, that you should not court solitude nor indulge in those
                  melancholy reflections—perhaps I should say repinings—to which you have of late
                  been so prone? Indeed," said she, earnestly, "you promised me that you would not
                  do so."
               "True," I replied, "and I have kept my word. My reflections have neither been
                  melancholy nor repining. The vastness, the beauty, and the sublimity of the
                     scene before me forbid the thought. My
                  soul but harmonizes with the rest of nature, and rises in praise above yon starry
                  sphere to nature's God! I was thinking of my own littleness and the short span of
                  human action and life, compared with the immensity of space and the duration of
                  eternity, and of the myriads of animated beings that exist in the cold watery
                  element beneath us, over which, unconscious of our very existence, we pass
                  silently and rapidly."
               "And yet the eye of God sees down into their lowest chambers," she answered. "His
                  hand scatters plentifully to them their necessary food. He forgets not even the
                  meanest of his creatures, and why should man, who is the noblest of all his works,
                  fear either for the present or the future? We may rest assured that if we trust in
                  God, and do our duty, he never will forsake us. But come, I wish you to explain
                  the steam engine to me. You have already taught me the theory, but as I have never
                  seen one in operation, you could not, of course, explain it so clearly as you
                  wished. You have now an excellent opportunity, and it is well to take advantage of
                  it."
               We then proceeded to the engine house, and I recapitulated the history of that
                  extraordinary invention, from its first rude elements to its then comparatively
                  perfect state, giving a full explanation of its working and everything I knew
                  connected with it, in language as concise and simple as possible, yet with a zeal
                  and earnestness which might appear extraordinary to a stranger, who would be
                  unacquainted with the enthusiasm of my character and the interest which I took in
                  that wonderful invention.
               While I was thus engaged many of the passengers, to most of whom the steam engine
                  was a mystery, flocked around us, attentive listeners to all I said. Amongst the
                  group my eye caught the countenance of a venerable man of pleasing aspect, whose
                  look was riveted on me with a deep interest, for which it would be difficult to
                  account. Though his hair was perfectly silvery he did not seem more than fifty
                  years of age. He was hale and vigorous, even for that time of life; and there was
                  a fire in his eye and a penetration in his look which bespoke him at once no
                  ordinary character. I felt abashed when I encountered his eager gaze; but soon
                  feeling somewhat proud of the general interest I had unwittingly created, and
                  being encouraged by the consciousness of a thorough acquaintance with my subject,
                  I pursued my theme, I might say lecture, with enthusiasm to the end. When I had
                  finished I was greeted with a low murmur of applause from the assembled group,
                  which, I confess, gratified my vanity considerably; and then, drawing my sister's
                  arm into mine, I led her back to the quarter-deck, with the intention of retiring
                  early to rest, in order to be up betimes in the morning, to enjoy the (to us)
                  novel sight of the sun rising at sea.
               I conducted my sister into the ladies' cabin, where, having taken a slight
                  refreshment, she retired to rest, while I went to join my father in that devoted
                  to the gentlemen. I found him discussing politics with the venerable gentleman who
                  was so attentive to my lecture on the steam engine. There were several others who
                  joined in the conversation, and amongst the rest two newly elected members of
                  parliament and a noble lord of the upper house, who were hastening to ST. STEPHENS
                  to oppose an important bill then before the legislature. The usual arguments pro
                  and con were entered into by the disputants, without much novelty, though with
                  considerable heat, until both parties seemed weary of discussion and manifested a
                  predilection for repose. As I did not take any part in the argument, and found it
                  rather insipid, I bade my father good night and retired to my berth, having told
                  him our intention to rise early in the morning.
               When I was gone the old gentleman, who saw from the affectionate manner in which I
                  took leave of my father, in what relation I stood to him, began to launch forth
                  diffusely and warmly in my praise. He said he had heard me that evening explain
                  the theory and operation of the steam engine, and that he had never listened to anything with greater pleasure; that he
                  was sure I possessed a mind not only stored with knowledge but imbued with a noble
                  enthusiasm and endowed with an originality of conception and power of illustration
                  which, if properly directed, might lead to important results; that I was a son of
                  whom any father might be justly proud; and then, in as delicate a manner as
                  possible, begged to be informed whether I had, or was likely to have, any
                  employment suitable to my talents, or that was at all likely to call my powers of
                  mind into active and useful operation.
               My father, who was struck with the earnest manner of the stranger, and the deep
                  interest which he seemed to take in me, though naturally proud and reserved,
                  candidly and unhesitatingly imparted to the gentleman the actual state of our
                  affairs, our past history and future prospects, and concluded by saying that he
                  had no other dependence to rest on, no other happiness to look up to, but the
                  goodness of Heaven and the talents and virtues of his, children.
               "And Heaven is good!" cried the venerable gentlemen; "and happy, too happy, am I
                  to be its unworthy instrument for good to those who require its aid. I can be of
                  service to your son and to you. I have a proposal to make which, if you condescend
                  to accept it, will make me truly happy. I am not rich, and I have a family; but,
                  thank Heaven! I have a sufficiency for all our wants, and something to spare. I
                  live a peaceful and quiet life, in a retired but beautiful part of the country. I
                  have three sons, aged ten, twelve and fourteen years, respectively, for whom at
                  this moment I require an efficient tutor. I know your son must have been well
                  brought up, and he is just the sort of person I would choose for the office. I
                  feel that he deserves something far better than this, but I have thought that, as
                  you are at present circumstanced, it might not be altogether unworthy of your
                  notice, at least till something better offers itself; and I assure you that when
                  such does happen I will do all in my power to promote your interests. In the mean
                  time you and your daughter shall have a good house with a garden, and, if you are
                  fond of farming, whatever quantity of land you may choose to cultivate, at a
                  reasonable rent. Everything shall be done to promote your comfort and happiness;
                  and do not suppose that I shall consider you under any obligation to me for this:
                  on the contrary, I shall be the person obliged if you accept my offer. The
                  services of your son will amply repay me for all, and leave him something to
                  spare. Besides, I have daughters almost arrived at the age of womanhood, to whom
                  the society of your fair and amiable daughter will, I have no doubt, be a great
                  acquisition. For their sake I would press this offer on you, even if I had not a
                  stronger motive in the education of my sons. These are at school at present, near
                  Liverpool, whither I am now going; but not being satisfied with their tutor, I
                  have determined to remove them and finish their education at home Providence has
                  thrown me in the way of your son and of you, and I sincerely hope that neither
                  party will have cause to repent of the meeting. I purpose staying a fortnight in
                  Liverpool, till the midsummer vacation commences, which will be about the 14th or
                  15th of June, and then we would all proceed together to Avondale, where I reside.
                  What say you to my proposal, worthy stranger?"
               "In your kind and generous proposal, sir," replied my father, who had listened
                  with admiration to the unexpected offer, "I can easily trace the hand of an
                  all-wise and all-seeing Providence; and it would be presumption in me, even if I
                  felt inclined, to offer any opposition to his will; and as for my son, I think I
                  can promise you that he will most willingly close with your offer at once, and be
                  thankful to Heaven and grateful to you, sir, for the means of performing duties of
                  the most sacred character. At all events I will take the earliest opportunity in
                  the morning of acquainting him with his good fortune, and of letting you know the
                  result."
               And here, having wished each other a good night, they parted and retired to
                  rest.
               
               Next morning my sister and I were introduced by my father to our new patron, who
                  was delighted that I made no objection to avail myself of his offer, and the
                  matter was soon arranged by us so as to please all parties.
               Mr. Worthington—for that was the gentleman's name—now entered freely into
                  conversation with my sister and me, and we were both pleased with his manners and
                  address. He seemed a most agreeable and amiable man, and indeed we have ever found
                  him to be so in reality.
               We were all walking together on the quarter-deck. The morning was fine, and we
                  enjoyed it exceedingly; but the sky soon became obscured, and although there was
                  no-appearance of a storm, it was evident we would have rain; we therefore
                  descended into the cabin.
               There was at one end of the cabin what seemed a small bookcase, containing what I
                  supposed would be a great treat on a wet day—"the Waverly Novels;" but when I
                  eagerly ran to take one down, I found it impossible to move it. The truth is, it
                  was only an imitation of a bookcase, with false books, shelves, etc. Mr.
                  Worthington and the other passengers laughed at me for my pains, and I felt some
                  little chagrin and disappointment.
               "You will not get much out of them," said that gentleman; "they are only wooden
                  novels, arid placed there more for ornament than use."
               "Rather for deception than either," said my sister. "I think they might just as
                  well have real books, for they would be a great treat on such a wet day as this,
                  to pass a dreary hour when one cannot go on deck and admire the deep blue waters
                  and the clear sky."
               "You are right, miss," said Mr. Worthington: "they might just as well have real
                  books, and I doubt not that in a few years the passengers will find every
                  accommodation of that kind; but you must consider that steam navigation is only in
                  its infancy, and that the public companies have not yet had time to think of
                  everything. Competition will soon render the cabin of a steamboat just as
                  comfortable as the drawing-room of the nobleman."
               "Those who are accustomed to read," said my sister, "would be glad of almost any
                  kind of book on such an occasion. How thankful we ought to be to those men who
                  spend their whole lives in furnishing us with a rich variety of good, substantial
                  fare! but we are too apt to overlook their merits, if we only can enjoy their
                  labors."
               "Very true," said Mr. Worthington. "We never know the full value of anything till
                  we feel what an annoyance and discomfort it is to be deprived of it. Even a second
                  or third rate author would now be hailed with pleasure, when we cannot have one of
                  any kind."
               "I shall never go to sea again," said I, "without being well provided with books
                  of amusement for such a contingency as this?"
               "You have plenty of books with you, Edward," said my father. "Why don't you try to
                  get us some of them?"
               "It is quite impossible; they are packed with other things entirely out of my
                  reach," I replied, "and we should be at our journey's end before I could get at
                  them."
               "I have often heard," said Mr. Worthington, "of the dullness of a country inn,
                  when one has the misfortune to be weather-bound at such a place for any length of
                  time, but I do not think it is quite so bad as a steamboat, because there at least
                  you could go out and take a walk in the country, but here you are confined to one
                  spot, without any hope of escape."
               "It is very strange," said I, "if we cannot find sources of amusement among
                  ourselves. Let us play at some game—chess, draughts, or even at whist; there are
                  four of us."
               "Bless you!" said Mr. Worthington, "you will find neither chess-board nor cards
                  here, unless you have brought them with you. But I will make a proposal: let each of us tell a tale—one which he
                  knows to be true and for which he can vouch."
               "Will you begin, Mr. Worthington?" I asked.
               "I have no objection," he replied. "We shall yet be on board for at least six
                  hours. I forewarn you, however, that my story is a long one, and that if I should
                  not have finished it before we arrive, that will not exonerate any of you from
                  your obligation to tell a tale in return; for this can be done, in Liverpool, at
                  the inn, in the long evenings after dinner,"
               "You must really excuse me," said Ellen, "for I know no tale except
                  such as I have learned from novels and romances."
               "And my experience of the world has Been so limited," I added, "that I am afraid
                  you will not be much edified by anything I have to tell."
               "Then, sir," said Mr. Worthington, addressing my father, "it seems the
                  responsibility of entertaining these young folks devolves upon us, without any
                  prospect of meeting a return."
               "So it seems," said my father; "but we will not let them off so easily as they
                  imagine, provided they confess they have been entertained by our stories. If, on
                  the contrary, they declare, when our tales are told, that they have not been
                  amused, then we shall let them go scot free."
               "I think we had better let them off at once," said Mr. Worthington, "and make no
                  bargain of the kind; for I assure you that I, for One, feel very diffident as to
                  their being entertained at all by my story; arid indeed I should not have made the
                  proposal if there had been even a second-rate author on board. I have volunteered
                  to tell a story merely to pass the time, and I dare scarcely venture to hope that
                  it will be successful even in doing that. Of one thing, however, I can assure you,
                  I shall tell you nothing for the truth of which cannot vouch. Indeed, the hero of
                  my tale is still living, and perhaps before many days I may have the pleasure of
                  introducing you to him."
               Having spoken thus he sat down in a retired corner of the cabin, and, our
                  curiosity being already excited, we eagerly took our places beside him, and he
                  commenced his tale, as you will see in the manuscript sent herewith.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER III.
               MR. WORTHINOTON'S STORY.
               SOME years ago a young man, a stranger of prepossessing mien and gentleman-like
                  manners, made his appearance in our immediate neighborhood. No one knew who he was
                  or whence he came, except that from a slight accent we judged him to be a
                  countryman of yours. He did not follow any profession, but, from his style of
                  living, seemed to be the owner of a considerable fortune. He rented a beautiful
                  cottage about a mile from my house, and surrounded himself with English servants,
                  not keeping in his elegant establishment a single soul from whom the slightest
                  information concerning his family or connections could be ascertained. He was very
                  retired in his mode of life, and seldom visited any of his neighbors except upon
                  particular occasions, when his presence could not well be denied to the few who
                  were slightly acquainted with him; but when he did visit he was sure to win the
                  affections and esteem of al] with whom he came in contact. He was tall, handsome
                  and well formed, and there was an intelligent expression in his countenance which
                  could not fail to favorably impress those who had once seen him. He was a great
                  student, and had an excellent library, with a fine collection of astronomical and
                  other instruments of scientific research, which, it was said, used to employ his
                  attention till a late hour in the night. He was, notwithstanding, an early riser,
                  for he was a lover of nature and a poet of no ordinary capacity.
               Though we are neither inquisitive nor impertinent as a people, yet the appearance,
                  the life, and the manners of this interesting stranger could not fail to excite
                  the curiosity of most of the families in the neighborhood; but the more they
                  sought to gratify that curiosity the less likely they were to succeed in their
                  wishes, for the stranger repelled every attempt to worm from him the place of his
                  birth or the slightest whisper of his history. At last he rather shunned than
                  courted society, however select; and if he perceived the slightest attempt, to
                  gratify impertinent curiosity, not only was he perfectly silent on the subject of
                  his own life, but took especial care to prevent a repetition of any further
                  questions for the future by avoiding altogether any intercourse with the
                  individual who would be likely to put them. Such was his exclusiveness or tact
                  that those whom he honored with his company thought themselves highly flattered by
                  such a mark of his esteem, and many proud families have been heard to boast of the
                  favor which his notice conferred upon them. This, at that time, seemed to me, and
                  to some others, strange and unaccountable; and therefore, far from imitating my
                  neighbors in running after this extraordinary individual, I took not the slightest
                  notice of him—no more than if he had never visited the neighborhood. I will not
                  deny that I felt some curiosity about, as well as interest in, the young man; but
                  I kept my feelings to myself, and never suffered them to betray my thoughts on the
                  subject. I have sometimes met him in the house of a friend and in general society,
                  when he always seemed cheerful, free, and highly intelligent on ordinary topics of
                  conversation; but I did not think of entering into any particular topic with him,
                  as I had learned from others the peculiarity of his character in that respect.
               His fine figure, his agreeable conversation and elegant manners—but, perhaps, most
                  of all, the idea of mystery that was associated with him—produced a considerable
                  sensation amongst the female portion of our community at that time. Nor is it to
                  be wondered at. He was to all appearance
                  everything which an elegant and accomplished woman would be likely to find
                  agreeable. Possessed of wit, of learning, of a taste for music and the arts, a
                  graceful dancer and a sweet and pleasing singer, it is not strange that he should
                  be an agreeable and welcome guest amongst that portion of society who know so well
                  how to appreciate accomplishments that are so rare in our sex—especially in the
                  country, where men generally make but an indifferent figure in company, and seldom
                  equal the other sex, at least in those lighter and more pleasing graces which
                  ought to be equally cultivated by all. Hence the name of Harcourt—so the stranger
                  was called—was in everybody's mouth, and nothing could be heard but the
                  enthusiastic admiration of his tastes and accomplishments when anything elegant or
                  fashionable formed the topic of conversation.
               He had been living in our neighborhood about a year when it began to be whispered
                  pretty distinctly that he had made an impression on the heart of a beautiful and
                  amiable girl, the only daughter of Sir Frederick Cumming, a wealthy baronet, a
                  near neighbor of ours, and that the father of the lady—at first entirely averse to
                  the match, for reasons which are evident enough—at length gave his consent on the
                  sole condition that Harcourt should declare who he was and how he was connected,
                  and that if he was of a genteel family and honorable connections no further
                  obstacle should be offered to the union so much desired by both; adding, at the
                  same time, that though he entertained no doubt whatever that all would be found
                  perfectly correct, yet that the happiness of his daughter and his own dignity
                  demanded such an inquiry, and that the mystery in which the stranger was hitherto
                  enveloped rendered it imperative.
               The brother of the lady, who had become Harcourt's most intimate friend, and who
                  indeed had promoted his suit with his sister, was charged with the very delicate
                  duty of imparting to that gentleman the only terms on which his father would
                  consent to their union; and though he naturally anticipated a joyful reception
                  from a consideration that those terms were not only reasonable but so easily
                  complied with that his, friend would find no difficulty in satisfying all doubts
                  on that point, yet, when he reflected on the peculiar care which Harcourt had
                  always taken to avoid the slightest allusion to anything that related to his
                  family and connections, and to the general suspicion, rather hinted at than
                  plainly spoken, by those who envied Harcourt his accomplishments and, success, and
                  even by many of his soi-disant friends, he felt
                  some misgivings as he entered the apartment of his friend to make him acquainted
                  with his good fortune.
               This, however, was entirely dissipated when he gazed upon the open, manly brow of
                  Harcourt, and the smile of ingenuous pleasure that lighted his countenance at the
                  approach of his friend. Without seeming to do so, he carefully scanned his person
                  and features, his figure and demeanor, trying to detect there some of those marks
                  which are said to betray a plebeian origin, but in vain. His figure and form were
                  faultless; his hands small, white and delicate; his feet and limbs of the most
                  perfect symmetry; and his whole person cast, as it were, in nature's most
                  beautiful mould. And then, when he reflected on his manners and good-breeding, the
                  purity and elegance of his speech, the exquisite delicacy of his taste, and the
                  extraordinary store of his knowledge and learning, he could not for a moment
                  entertain the unworthy idea which had haunted the minds of others rather than his
                  own, but felt quite assured that it could have no foundation in reality. He
                  therefore proceeded to perform his now pleasing mission with the greatest
                  alacrity.
               "To what lucky circumstance," said Harcourt, after tie first greetings were over,
                  "am I to attribute this unlooked-for pleasure—a visit from you at this hour? You
                  are not wont to be a rival to the sun in your regular motions; and see! he is but
                  just now beginning to raise his bountiful face above the horizon! You sigh and
                  look confused! Ah! I see it all! and being a sufferer by the same disease, I can read its symptoms and sympathize with the
                  patient. You are in love, my dear Charles. Come, do not deny it, but unbosom
                  yourself to your friend. Though he cannot find a remedy for his own disease,
                  perhaps he may be enabled to find some alleviation for the sufferings of another.
                  You are silent. Am I, then, right? Speak, I pray you, and remove my doubts. It
                  will at least be some consolation for each that he have a fellow sufferer in the
                  other, and to talk together of our feelings and the objects of them with mutual
                  sympathy."
               "Indeed, my friend, you are for once deceived," replied Charles, with a smile. "I
                  have not yet fallen into that snare, and I intend to keep free from it as long as
                  possible, seeing the havoc it produces in others. No, no! I will keep the tyrant
                  at a distance, I warrant him. But come,—attention! I bring you glad tidings."
               "Oh, speak them!" exclaimed Harcourt: "anything of my dear Charlotte? Has your
                  father?"——
               "Consented!" said Charles, "to your union!"
               "Good heavens! Are you in earnest?"
               "Yes; but"——
               "But what? For Heaven's sake keep me not in suspense, or I shall lose my
                  reason!"
               "On one slight condition; such as I know you can and will most readily comply
                  with."
               "Name it," said Harcourt, with a vehement energy.
               "Oh, it is a mere nothing—a matter of form—a whim in which my father wishes to be
                  gratified."
               "For God's sake name it at once!" said Harcourt, with still increasing
                  impatience.
               "Patience! my dear friend; it is really insufficient even to excite your
                  curiosity. But, however, you shall hear it. You are aware that ours is an ancient
                  and honorable family. We trace our line down to the Conquest; and my father, very
                  naturally, you will grant, feels a family pride which many people would condemn,
                  but which, I confess, I respect myself, as being no more than what he is justly
                  entitled to feel under the circumstances cumstances, for I am one of those who
                  think that we cannot too much prize the virtues and imitate the example of those
                  of our ancesters who deserved nobility, and even glory, by their achievements in
                  the field for the honor, of their, king and country."
               "Proceed," said Harcourt, in breathless anxiety.
               "Well, my father has declared to Charlotte that he is totally indifferent to her
                  husband possessing fortune or not, as she will have quite sufficient for both, but
                  that it is indispensably necessary that he should be a man of good family at all
                  events, and that though he feels quite satisfied that you will be able to show
                  yourself such a person, yet that from the mystery which has heretofore enveloped
                  everything connected with you, and (you will excuse me) from the suspicions of his
                  neighbors, he thinks it necessary that the truth should be made plain to all, as
                  well for your own sake as for the honor of a family who will be proud of your
                  alliance, and therefore he has commissioned me now to say, in his name, that the
                  moment this matter is cleared up satisfactorily he will offer no further obstacle
                  to your union with my sister. But, my dear friend, what is the matter? You are
                  deathly pale! Do you feel ill? Let me ring for your servant, and"——
               "No, no," said Harcourt, with a faint and forced smile; "I am subject to these
                  impulses when I am suddenly overpowered by any extraordinary emotion, whether it
                  be of pain or of pleasure. I—I—I shall speedily—recover my self-possession. I
                  am—so overwhelmed—with pleasure at your joyful—announcement that it has
                  almost—deprived—me of sensation, from the intensity of my feelings! You say—your
                  father wishes to know who I am, and all my connections. It is very natural he
                  should, and as far as lies in my power he shall be gratified. That there is
                  certain mystery hovering over my early life is too true; but this is my misfortune
                  rather than my fault, and has been the only source of sorrow and pain that has
                  marred the otherwise tranquil course of my past existence. But this shall no
                  longer stand in the way of my happiness
                  piness and the happiness of one more dear to me than life itself, for I am
                  determined to make you acquainted with my past history, as far as I know it
                  myself, which is only in part; but the time is fortunately at hand when the blank
                  in the history shall be fully made known to us; but for the present lend me your
                  patient attention."
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               THE MYSTERY.
               AS far back as I can recollect I was surrounded with comforts, and even with
                  luxuries. The house in which I passed my infancy was large and well furnished, and
                  in every respect adapted for the residence of a gentleman of property. The
                  pleasure-grounds in which I played at full liberty were, I remember well,
                  beautifully laid out and kept in excellent order, and even the surrounding scenery
                  is familiar to my mind, though I cannot now describe it. I think I should know it
                  again, should fate decree that I should ever revisit the country of my birth and
                  early years, which was Ireland. I can recollect lofty ranges of blue mountains in
                  the distance, and one was of so peculiar form that it has left a distinct
                  impression on my mind ever since, so as never to be forgotten. But I do not
                  recollect ever receiving the caresses of a mother as such, nor the endearments of
                  a father, and I was too young when I was removed from that place to remember in
                  what relation I might stand to the members of the family—an old gentleman and
                  lady, who always treated me with kindness, but I should think with coldness, for
                  they left no impression of affection and tenderness toward them on my mind. There
                  were also in the house, as domestics, a man and a woman, the former as general
                  servant and the latter as my nurse, to whom I was strongly attached; but, though I
                  knew not why, I hated the man as long as I can remember him. I was, at what period
                  I know not, removed to another part of
                  the country, and of course amongst strange people, except that my nurse still
                  clung to me and attended me with the most anxious care. At this new place I was
                  visited often by a lady of great beauty and sweetness, who used to caress me in
                  the most tender and affectionate manner, and who, I observed, always shed tears
                  when she left me. I loved her from the first moment I saw her, and it was with the
                  greatest possible difficulty that I could be separated from her when she wished to
                  depart. She used to bring me every little toy she could think of to amuse and
                  delight me, and nothing could give me greater pleasure or tended so much to please
                  and pacify me when I was troublesome as to tell me that she was coming. This is
                  the only impression of early attachment I ever entertained for any human being
                  except my nurse. But this was a strong and lasting one. Never shall the features
                  of that dear and beloved countenance be obliterated from my mind, though I could
                  not so define them as to be able to distinguish that lady amongst others; my
                  impression of them is shadowy.
               "I must have remained here for two or three years, but I cannot be certain, from
                  my own recollection, how long. At the age of seven I was removed to a preparatory
                  school some miles distant, kept by a lady, and I saw no more of my dear friend who
                  was so kind and affectionate toward me. I have never seen nor heard of her since,
                  except that she left that part of the country and went abroad. But my faithful
                  nurse did not forsake me; she followed me to the school, took a little cottage
                  near, and watched over and tended me still, like a guardian angel as she was. She
                  came to see me at every opportunity, and often took me, with permission of the
                  schoolmistress, to her neat little cottage, where she was as a mother to me, and I
                  think I loved her almost as well. There I often saw the man, too, whom I had seen
                  in the house of my infancy, and my hatred and antipathy toward him seemed to
                  increase with my years, and this feeling seemed to be mutual, for the very glance
                  of his eye was sufficient to make the blood run chill in my veins. My good nurse
                  noticed my horror at his sight, and henceforth she was careful to keep him out of
                  view as much as possible when she expected I should visit at her cottage.
               "At this school our holidays soon came on; and now, for the first time in my life,
                  I began to feel what it was to have no home to go to, and no one whom I could call
                  by the endearing name of father or mother. All the other boys were delighted at
                  the prospect of going home and seeing their parents and families, while I, who
                  knew not what it was to have either one or the other, began to reflect on the
                  meaning of it, and to inquire of my nurse where my father and mother
                  were, and whether I, too, could not go home.
               "The poor creature could not help shedding tears as she replied that I was to stay
                  at the school during the holidays, where Mrs. Town would do all she could to make
                  me happy, and I should come sometimes to see herself at her cottage, and that she
                  would come to see me; and when I repeated my question as to who or where my
                  parents were, she wept bitterly, and either could or would make no reply. I wept
                  also, I suppose because I saw her weep and that my inquiries were of no avail.
               "It is useless to dwell on what followed for several years, as the course of my
                  life at this time had a good deal of sameness in it. Suffice it to say, that at
                  the age of eleven I was removed to a public school in England, where I made such
                  progress as in a few years to rise to the head of the school without a competitor.
                  I had masters, too, in every accomplishment, and no pains were spared to render my
                  education such as the first gentleman in the land might be proud of. I was well
                  supplied with pocket-money, but whence it or the expenses of my education were
                  derived I knew not, nor did I then even think of inquiring. My nurse was still
                  near me and ever my friend, and whatever money I received was always given to me
                  through my schoolmaster. What had I to trouble me?
               "Thus I went on till I arrived at the age of eighteen, when I found myself an object of attention, not
                  only to my schoolfellows but also to my teachers, and even to strangers. My name
                  had gone forth as that of a youth of high promise, and many gentlemen of
                  respectability and learning took a pride in encouraging me by their notice.
               "It was only now that I began to be an object of interest to myself, and I
                  resolved to inquire diligently who my parents were, and what were my prospects. I
                  applied to my nurse again, as the only person likely to know anything of my
                  circumstances and connections; but the only answer I could get from her was that
                  she knew nothing whatever of the matter, except that I was heir to a considerable
                  property, the interest of which had been applied to my education and support; that
                  even if she knew, she was not at liberty to disclose the particulars, and that I
                  must have patience and hope, and all things would yet turn out to my entire
                  satisfaction.
               "I then inquired if she knew any person who was likely to give me information on
                  the subject. At first she said she did not; but when I pressed and entreated her
                  with tears in my eyes, she with much hesitation confessed that she thought she
                  did.
               "'Who?' said I. 'Oh, tell me, I beseech you, by everything that is sacred and dear
                  to the heart of man! by your own parents and relatives, if living—by their
                  spirits, if dead! I implore you to conceal nothing from me that you know on this
                  subject!'
               "'Do not ask me any further, I beg of you,' she replied; 'at some future time,
                  perhaps, I may tell you, but at present I cannot—indeed I cannot—I am bound
                  by'—and then she looked round mysteriously, lest any one should be listening—'I am
                  bound by a solemn and sacred oath not to reveal aught I know of the matter
                  yet.'
               "'But tell me—what time are you thus bound?' I eagerly inquired.
               "'For two years more,' she replied, 'and then'—
               "'You will disclose all!' I interrupted.
               "'Everything!' she replied; 'and then, my dear, good——. But I must say no more at
                  present. Two years from this time and my long and painful silence shall be broken;
                  and Heaven knows that it has been a painful one!'
               "I then embraced her with the utmost tenderness, delighted with the prospect that
                  in two years from that time all my fond hopes should be realized; I should,
                  perhaps, be restored to the embrace of my long-lost and unknown parents, to the
                  endearments of relations—perhaps of brothers and sisters, and to a wide and
                  respected circle of friends! How alluring was that hope! but alas! deceptive it
                  may prove!
               "It was now October; and as my name had been entered in the books of the
                  University of Oxford, I prepared to go thither directly. My nurse followed me and
                  watched over me, though she never would receive a farthing of money nor anything
                  except a trifling present occasionally, which I forced her to accept. I could not
                  help wondering how she contrived to live all this time; for she lived very
                  comfortably indeed, but always in a plain and humble way. I often went to see her
                  at a neat little house which she rented in the outskirts of the town, and on one
                  occasion I thought I saw the sinister eye of the man, her former fellow servant,
                  peering at me from behind a door; but perhaps I might have been mistaken.
               "At length came the long vacation; and as I had no friends whom I could visit nor
                  parents' home to go to, I resolved to spend it in a tour on the Continent, in
                  company with a college friend. But as I undertook nothing without the advice of my
                  good friend, my nurse, I resolved to ask her opinion on the subject. At first she
                  was very reluctant to part with me; but when I told her that it was only for a
                  short season, and that I must return before the end of the vacation, she no longer
                  opposed my wish; for such was my love for her and deference to her opinion that I
                  would not have ventured to go had she shown herself entirely averse to it.
               
               "The kind-hearted woman shed tears as she raised her hands to bless and embrace
                  me, and I took my leave with a full heart, for she was all that was really dear to
                  me in the country I was about to leave. As I turned round at her cottage door, to
                  take a last look and bid farewell for the last time, I was almost petrified with
                  horror at the glance of that eye which I had before encountered, but which now
                  expressed an exulting and diabolical malignity beyond my power to describe!
                  Surely, I thought with a shudder, that must be a demon of hell, or my evil genius!
                  and what connection or sympathy he can have with this excellent woman I know not,
                  nor can I account for it.
               "We now made preparations for starting, and in a few days found ourselves amongst
                  a strange people on a strange shore."
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               THE CONTINENT.
               NOTHING worth notice occurred to us till we had reached Paris, and nothing very
                  important even there. One incident, however, I cannot pass over in silence, from
                  its remarkable singularity, as exciting hopes in my heart which were destined to
                  be cruelly blighted. It was as follows:
               "One evening my friend and I were walking in the Palais Royal, amusing ourselves
                  by observing the groups of persons scattered over the place—some walking; others
                  seated in the open air around tables which were placed before the doors of the
                  beautiful cafés and restaurants, enjoying their coffee and conversation with a
                  peculiarly good grace; while others, again, were seated in chairs around the
                  fountain in the center of the garden, which played with a soft and pleasing
                  murmur, well calculated to soothe the feelings and even to lull to sleep. The
                  fountain is, I think, peculiarly graceful and pleasant. The water rises from
                  several jets to a height I should think of fifteen to twenty feet, in the form of
                  a huge lily, each jet forming an arch bending outward from the center, and when
                  the sun shines in the day, or the moon at night, a perfect rainbow is formed by
                  the spray, which has a pleasing effect. Add to this the marble statues in various
                  postures, but all graceful—some like wood nymphs leaning against trees; others as
                  Fauns, Pans and rural deities—their Parian whiteness contrasting finely with the
                  dark foli age, especially at night;
                  others with the sublime countenance of Jove, or the beauty of Apollo, or the grace
                  and elegance of Venus.
               "To be able to associate the idea of the country, its softness and repose, with
                  the bustle and confusion, the noise and tumult, the civilization and society of a
                  crowded city, is no small achievement, yet it seemed to be realized there almost
                  as far as that is possible on so small a scale.
               "Though that small square was crowded at various points, particularly along the
                  sides and in the center, yet such was the stillness that prevailed that the poet
                  or philosopher might muse there uninterrupted; the lover of art and nature might
                  be fully gratified in the graceful figures, the trees, and the soft murmur of the
                  waters; and the cosmopolitan would, if he chose to seek it, find within that
                  narrow inclosure all that is pleasing and select in society. Nothing that nature
                  or art could produce, or that commerce could command or procure, but could be
                  found there; and it seemed that everything elegant and beautiful, everything
                  calculated to amuse or to charm, was concentrated within that narrow space.
               "I had stood for a few moments riveted on the scene before me, in a sort of
                  reverie, almost unconscious of everything else, in the contemplation of its
                  beauties. My friend, equally absorbed, had gone on a considerable distance before
                  me. But he was soon aroused from his dream by an extraordinary apparition; for
                  presently he was by my side, breathless and agitated! He seized me by the arm, and
                  with a wild and bewildered look dragged me onward, with a force which seemed
                  supernatural, toward the fountain.
               "'What, in the name of Heaven!' I exclaimed, 'has happened to you? You are
                  certainly mad, to act with this violence! Let me go, and tell me what it is that
                  has thrown you into this excitement.'
               "But not a word of explanation could I get in reply till I was hurried with
                  irresistible force to within a few yards of the fountain, when he exclaimed with a
                  wildness of manner that confirmed my former suspicion of a sudden fit of insanity
                  having seized him—though, so far as I knew, he had hitherto been free from
                  anything bordering on excitement of any kind—
               "'Look! see there—there! Don't you see?' continued he, pointing with convulsive
                  energy to the form of a young man who was leaning against a tree, with his head
                  turned a little away from us.
               "'See what?' I answered. 'I see a young man sitting there opposite, with his head
                  turned against the tree, and near him I see a lady of a pleasing countenance, who
                  must have been beautiful once, though she is no longer young.'
               "'Yes,' he said, 'that is he! That is——good Heavens!'——
               "'That is who? What do you mean? or what has possessed you? Try to recall your
                  wandering thoughts. You labor under some strange hallucination!'
               "'Look at him! now—now! You see him! He is turning his head this way! Now—now!'
                  and he seized my hand with a violent and convulsive grasp. I looked, felt my head
                  turn dizzy, and in another moment I was stretched, pale and senseless, on the
                  earth!
               "When I recovered I found myself in our hotel, my friend watching over my couch. I
                  felt tolerably well, but strange recollections crowded on my mind. I thought I had
                  just had a dream, and that the object I had seen was only one of those
                  unaccountable freaks of fancy that often disturb our repose, but vanish with the
                  other reminiscences of the past, and which may all be counted as dreams of some
                  kind or other. But when I reflected a moment that illusion was dispelled, as well
                  by my own feelings as the assurance of my friend. It was no dream, but an
                  extraordinary reality! You will doubtless be anxious to know what object could
                  possibly create such emotion in a friendless and, I may say, desolate being like
                  myself, in a strange land and amidst an unknown people! I will tell you. The youth
                  whom I saw was the very image—the duplicate as my friend afterwards
                  affirmed—of——myself! The same lineaments! the same eyes! the same expression of
                     countenance nance!—in fact, both of us
                  felt assured at the moment that it was a phantom—a mere apparition—the messenger
                  to announce my speedy dissolution, according to the vulgar and pretty generally
                  received opinion and prejudice, particularly in our native country, though it is
                  not confined to it alone, but is more or less received in all the countries of
                  Europe, and, I believe, in other quarters of the globe as well. This it was,
                  doubtless, which caused me to swoon away, for I cannot account for it otherwise;
                  and this opinion—or prejudice, if you please to call it so—was strengthened by the
                  assertion of my companion, who declared that when he lifted his head to look
                  round, immediately after I had fallen, the young man was nowhere to be seen, and
                  the interesting lady had also vanished!
               "It struck me, however, that I had seen that lady somewhere before; but when or
                  where, I could have no distinct recollection. Yet her face seemed familiar, and
                  one on which I could have gazed long with pleasure; and as to the other figure
                  being an apparition or wraith, as it is called, that absurd notion was of course
                  instantly dispelled by the light of reason and philosophy. I merely mentioned the
                  vulgar prejudice to show the influence that early impressions have on the mind
                  when one is taken suddenly and unaware, which influence they could not have if
                  sufficient time were given for the operation of reason, and thus to account for
                  the effect this sudden and unexpected appearance had on my mind. For otherwise I
                  justly reasoned, what was there in a simple coincidence which ought to produce
                  this strange effect? Instances of extraordinary likenesses, even in strangers, to
                  each other are not uncommon, and why should this instance be regarded as a matter
                  so extraordinary? In fact, I reasoned thus till I became ashamed of my own
                  weakness, and for some time I felt a diffidence in entering into society, or
                  appearing in public, lest I should be recognized as the person who fainted away
                  like a woman in the garden of the Palais Royal at the mere sight of a man who
                  happened to resemble himself!
               "In a few days, however, I resumed my wonted equanimity and mingled in the
                  gaieties of the French metropolis as usual, and if I ever thought of this incident
                  at all, it was only to laugh at my own weakness in allowing myself to be unnerved
                  by a circumstance which, though certainly not common, was not so very uncommon as
                  that it should produce such an effect as this; and the whole would shortly have
                  been forgotten had it not been for another incident equally remarkable which
                  occurred about a fortnight afterwards.
               "My friend was confined to his room by a slight cold and occupied in reading one
                  of Victor Hugo's new novels, and I went to spend an hour or two, as was my custom
                  as often as I could get an opportunity, in the magnificent gallery of the
                  Louvre.
               "That princely gallery, though at that time stripped of its illgotten plunder, had
                  still sufficient treasures left to charm and delight the intelligent traveler. The
                  gallery itself, even if it were entirely stripped of the paintings, would be well
                  worth a visit, from its great length, its stately grandeur, and the magnificent
                     coup d'œil which it presents. To have seen it
                  when it was enriched with all the finest paintings in the world must have been a
                  sight never to be forgotton. Even as I saw it, it surpassed anything of the kind I
                  had ever before witnessed.
               "While I was examining the paintings and the visitors alternately, a young
                  gentleman, dressed in the first style of fashion, the moment he saw me from the
                  opposite side, came rushing towards me, threw his arms round my neck, and before I
                  could extricate myself from his ardent embrace, imprinted a shower of kisses on my
                  forehead, exclaiming:
               "'Mon Dieu! comme je suis ravi de vous voir, mon cher ami! Mais vous ne répondez
                  pas à mes chaleurs! Est-ce que je me trompe? Non! il est impossible! Vous êtes,
                  assurément, mon cher ami Dumont! n'estil pas vrai?'
               
               "'Non!' lui répondis-je, 'je ne suis pas la personne pour qui vous me prenez,
                  mais—'
               "'Quoi!' dit-il, 'vous n'êtes pas Dumont! mon cher Dumont! Ciel! quelle
                  ressemblance! Jamais n'ai-je vu une chose semblable! Ayez la bonté, monsieur, de
                  me pardonner la liberté que j'ai prise.'*
                  
               
               
                  *"'Heavens! how delighted I am to see you,
                     my dear friend! But you do not respond to my warmth! Can I be deceived? No!
                     impossible! You are assuredly my dear friend Dumont; is it not so?'
                  "'No,' I answered, 'I am not the person for whom you take me.'
                  "'What!' he replied, 'you are not Dumont! Heavens! what a resemblance! I
                     have never seen anything equal to it! Please, sir, to pardon the liberty
                     which I have taken.'
               
               "I begged that he would not make any apology, telling him that I had seen the
                  gentleman for whom he took me, and that I was even more surprised than he was at
                  the resemblance; 'but,' added I, smiling, 'such extraordinary likenesses do
                  sometimes occur, and we cannot account for them by any known laws. However, I
                  should very much like to become acquainted with the individual whom you call by
                  the name of Dumont, as it might be a gratification to both to see and speak to
                  another one of the species on whose external form nature seems to have impressed
                  the same stamp, however she, or circumstances, may have moulded the mind.'
               "He said that he would be extremely happy to be the medium of bringing us
                  together, but he feared it was too late, as Dumont was to have left Paris for
                  Italy a fortnight ago with his mother and sister, and hence his own surprise when
                  he thought he had found him lingering in the precincts of the Louvre.
               "'What! has he a sister?' said I, interrupting him. 'Is she handsome? is she good
                  and kind like her mother? Oh! she must, she must be so!'
               "'He has one sister,' replied the stranger, 'and she is a perfect angel for beauty
                  and grace and every endowment of mind and person; and is soon to become a wife,'
                  continued he with a smile which told a tale plainly enough.
               "'And I think I could guess who the happy man is to be,' said I, smiling also;
                  'but you have nothing to fear from any rivalry,' I added, looking at him with a
                  glance of admiration (for he was certainly as fine a figure and as handsome a
                  young man as ever I had set eyes on.) 'You cannot wonder, however, that I should
                  feel a little curiosity to know something of a family to one member of which I
                  bear so strong a resemblance, and you will, therefore, I trust, excuse the liberty
                  I take in requesting you to give me some further information concerning it.'
               "'You are perfectly welcome to hear all I know of them,' replied he, 'and I
                  believe that is everything material, for I have been their near neighbor from my
                  infancy. Gustave Dumont is the son of an ancient house in Lorraine, where his
                  ancestors have lived from time immemorial, and though the revolution has shorn
                  them of their ancient luster and much of their wealth, they have still sufficient
                  left to live in honor in their native province. His sister, Matilde, as I said
                  before, is a model of beauty and female excellence, both of which she has
                  inherited from her inimitable mother.'
               "'And she,' I interrupted, 'is she French? I mean the mother.'
               "'Oh! yes, certainly! and of as ancient and honorable a house as that to which she
                  is allied, and of the same province too,' said he.
               "'And has she never been out of France? never in Ireland?' I inquired with an
                  eagerness which to any one but slightly acquainted with my history would have
                  betrayed the feelings within.
               "'Never! that I am aware of or heard of,' he replied. 'Her father was, like many
                  French gentlemen of that disastrous period, obliged to seek an asylum in a foreign
                  land at the time of the revolution, but I am not aware that his daughter has ever
                  crossed the sea, and if she had I should have known it.'
               "You may form some conception of my feelings, my dear Charles," said Harcourt, "on hearing this
                  explanation. It must have been obvious to you that I expected to find a brother, a
                  sister and a mother in the persons who so much interested me, and what was my
                  disappointment on being told this plain and simple account. I had determined to
                  make diligent search into the history of the young man and the lady, his mother,
                  in order to find, as I felt assured I should, the long cherished hopes of my life
                  realized; but now that I had heard the truth from this stranger, that
                  determination, together with the hopes that suggested it, fled for ever! When I
                  had recovered a little from the surprise of disappointment into which his
                  announcement had thrown me, I thanked the stranger for his information, and after
                  we had exchanged cards I returned to my hotel and informed my friend of all that
                  had taken place. He agreed with me that it was a strange coincidence and no more;
                  and since that time I have endeavored to forget all about it. I have merely
                  mentioned it now as a remarkable circumstance."
               "Did either the lady or gentleman see you?" inquired Charles.
               "No!" replied Harcourt, "for my friend told me that he looked round immediately
                  after I had fallen in the garden of the Palais Royal and no trace of them was to
                  be seen, though many people flocked around me to ascertain what was the matter,
                  and it is very probable that the next day they left Paris. It is true I have the
                  name and address of the stranger whom I met in the Louvre, and through him I could
                  still trace them to their home, but for what purpose? I have already learned
                  everything about them that can possibly interest me and further inquiry would be
                  of little avail.
               "We traveled through the south of France slowly, in order to observe the manners
                  and customs of the people, as also the charming scenery that was unfolded to our
                  view as we proceeded. Nothing can exceed the richness and fertility of the soil,
                  or the beauty of the landscape in those regions. Hills covered with vines
                  producing grapes of the most delicious flavor, cornfields and meadows, meandering
                  rivers and shady groves, with the brown and sunburnt features of the hardy
                  peasantry, were the principal objects that attracted our attention. Every portion
                  of the soil seemed closely cultivated, more for use, however, then ornament; and
                  there was an absence of those delightful rural love-walks so common in England, as
                  also of noble mansions with beautiful parks; but then ample compensation for the
                  absence of these was made to the mind of the philanthropist by the reflection that
                  the cultivators, in France, were also frequently the lords of the soil, and that
                  their labors, however severe, were undertaken and performed with cheerfulness,
                  because they were for themselves alone and not for a master. This circumstance
                  invested the peasantry in my eyes as well as their own with a dignity with which
                  we cannot, unfortunately, invest our laborers at home, in England, though the
                  latter are less severely worked and harrassed than the former. But the severest
                  toil is borne with equanimity and even with pleasure when it is not imposed by the
                  task master; the lightest compulsory labor is intolerable to the mind of man,
                  however necessity may compel him to acquiesce, to all external appearance, in the
                  servile condition of his birth or circumstances.
               "We had got as far as Lyons, on the banks of the beautiful Rhone, when I received
                  a letter from England which instantly determined me to return with all possible
                  speed. It was from a medical gentleman, informing me that my good dear nurse was
                  dangerously ill, and that she requested to see me as soon as possible, as she had
                  some important intelligence to communicate to me alone; but that if I did not make
                  all haste back it was very likely I should not find her alive. When I examined the
                  date of the letter I perceived it had been written a fortnight before, and on
                  inquiry I found it had been waiting my arrival in Lyons for upwards of a week.
                  This was easily accounted for, for on
                  leaving Paris I gave orders that my letters should be forwarded to Lyons; but as
                  we had loitered long by the way, and had gone round to see several places, nearly
                  three weeks had elapsed before we arrived there. I now reproached myself bitterly
                  for this delay and determined to set out for England instantly, though with very
                  slender hopes of being able to arrive in time. My companion endeavored to dissuade
                  me from my purpose, but in vain, and I had not been more than two hours in that
                  city when I left it, and with a heavy heart found myself on my way homeward. Of
                  course I did not accept the offer of my friend, which he kindly made me, to
                  accompany me home. I knew he had set his heart on visiting Switzerland and
                  Lombardy, and as the vacation was hardly half spent at that time it would have
                  been very selfish in me to deprive him of the pleasure he anticipated from
                  visiting the principal objects of his tour. We parted in haste, but with the
                  warmest professions of mutual esteem and lasting friendship.
               "I traveled night and day without intermission or repose, except that which might
                  be snatched at intervals in a diligence, until I arrived in Dover, where, from my
                  extreme fatigue, the heat of the weather, and the want of sleep, with my mental
                  anxiety, I was taken suddenly so ill as to be unable to proceed! A burning fever
                  seized me, and I felt as if my head was rent and torn in pieces, so violent and
                  acute was the pain. Next morning I was in a raging fever, utterly unconscious
                  where I was, and raving, as I afterwards learned, like a madman. A physician was
                  sent for by the landlady, and, notwithstanding every attention possible was paid
                  to me, I remained a whole week in a state of perfect unconsciousness! At length
                  the fever abated, and I began to have some lucid intervals. I then inquired where
                  I was, and on learning the circumstances, requested my physician, who was very
                  attentive in his visits, and a kind-hearted man, to write to the medical gentleman
                  who attended my nurse, acquainting him with the cause of my delay, and entreating
                  a speedy answer to inform me how she was, and every circumstance since his last
                  letter. This he undertook to do with the greatest alacrity, and though very
                  anxious, I determined to wait the issue with as much patience as possible.
               "Never shall I forget one remarkable evening! It was twilight; the attendant,
                  thinking that I had fallen asleep, had left the room. I was not asleep but as
                  waking and conscious as I am at this moment. I never was superstitious. From my
                  earliest infancy I have despised and laughed at everything supernatural and at all
                  ghost stories. I have never felt the slightest fear of spiritual beings or
                  apparitions, because I did not believe they were visible to our senses, or could
                  have any purpose in being permitted to visit mortals. I therefore could not have
                  been predisposed by my fears or my beliefs for the reception of the scene which I
                  am about to describe to you, and which made so powerful an impression on my mind,
                  not only then, but for a long time afterwards! Perhaps this may be accounted for
                  by the state of my brain and nerves at the time.
               "It was twilight, as I said before, and rather clear; my candle had not yet been
                  lighted for the night. Everything was silent and still around me, so that I could
                  distinctly hear the throbbing of my own heart or the slightest sound or noise. It
                  was impossible I could be sleeping, because I remember well I was counting the
                  number of spots in each diagonal line of the paper on the wall, and comparing them
                  together, when I was startled by a deep and painful groan, as if from a person
                  close to my bed! I lay still for a moment and then I heard another still deeper
                  and nearer than the last! I was going to ring the bell or call out for some one to
                  come to the assistance of the sufferer, whoever it might be, when I saw a glimmer
                  of light near the chimney, which gave me great pleasure at the moment, for I
                  thought it was the servant coming in with a candle; but what was my surprise and
                  horror when, on looking towards the foot of the bed, I saw distinctly the form and figure of my
                  nurse! not such as she used to appear, with a sweet smile, but sad and dejected,
                  and as pale and livid as a corpse! There seemed to be an expression of agony and
                  suffering in her countenance beyond all powers of description; and feeling assured
                  that it was no earthly appearance, but a visitant from the tomb, either in reality
                  or such as my own excited imagination had conjured up, I made an effort to speak,
                  but found that impossible! I next tried to rise, but whether it was from weakness
                  or some unknown cause, I found I could not move, but remained fixed to the pillow,
                  with my eyes riveted on the frightful form that stood so plainly before me! It was
                  a fearful moment! but still my reason assured me that it could be nothing but a
                  mere phantom of the imagination, to the reception of which the severe fever from
                  which I was only just beginning to recover must have greatly predisposed my brain.
                  If I had had strength either to rise or speak, I would have assured myself of the
                  truth as far as that was possible. But then, when I again reflected that though my
                  sight might be deceived, as is very common under such circumstances, how could I
                  account for the pitiful groans which I but a moment before had heard? This
                  staggard me! I cannot tell how long I remained in that posture, with my eyes fixed
                  on that apparition; but at length the door was opened and my attendant entered. He
                  found my eyes riveted, as if on vacancy, and wildly staring in one direction at
                  nothing! (for he could not see the apparition,) and he naturally concluded that I
                  was beginning to have one of those temporary fits of mental alienation to which I
                  had been so subject during my illness, and he took the usual means resorted to on
                  such occasions, viz.: to divert my mind from some supposed object that absorbed
                  it. He therefore approached my bed gently and said something which I now forget,
                  merely to turn my thoughts into another channel, but in vain! I made him no
                  answer; but at length recovering ering a little strength, I raised my arm and
                  pointed to the figure, exclaiming in a wild and vehement tone:
               "'See there! look! there it is at the foot of the bed! It is my own dear! Look!
                  look! she glides away now! Now she is gone!'"
               "The man having been accustomed to hear me rave in this way often before, thought
                  nothing of it, but merely saying that my imagination conjured up strange phantoms,
                  recommended me to go to sleep. Reflection told me he was right, and I endeavored
                  to dismiss what I had just seen from my thoughts as quickly as possible and to
                  follow his advice. I accordingly closed my eyes, and in a short time fell into a
                  doze; but it was not a calm or peaceful one. That phantom haunted me all the night
                  in my dreams! First I saw my nurse with her fellow servant, whose name; which I
                  have not yet mentioned, was Denis McArdle, sitting together at a table on which
                  were several cups and saucers, as if it was for breakfast; then I saw them drink
                  from the cups, his sinister eye beaming with a hellish exultation, as if the demon
                  within him was gratified by some diabolical deed of darkness! Then I saw my dear
                  nurse on a bed in agonies and tortures, the man attending her with seeming
                  kindness and attention, but every time he averted his eyes from her look they
                  seemed to beam with a fierce and savage delight! Then I heard her groan most
                  pitiously and call upon my name, saying that she would die contented and happy if
                  she could see and speak to me only for a moment! I thought I tried with all my
                  power to approach her bed, but that I was held back by some powerful arm and
                  prevented from moving. I struggled with violence, and in my efforts awoke to find
                  it was but a dream! Whenever I closed my eyes again a similar scene would present
                  itself, till, at length, I thought I witnessed the last convulsive pang of my
                  dearest and only friend; gazed upon the mortal glance of her eye and her distorted
                  features until she sank down on her bed a pale and haggard corpse! A shock of
                  horror aroused me again from the painful
                  scene, which, however, was presented to my fancy anew if I allowed my eyelids to
                  close for a moment in slumber! At length the morning dawned, but the impression
                  left on my mind was of a painful and harrowing nature. I could not persuade myself
                  but that my dear nurse was dead, and that she had been murdered by the wretch
                  McArdle, who seemed to be somehow connected with her; but for what motive it was
                  impossible for me to conceive.
               "This idea haunted me day after day, and was strengthened by a repetition of the
                  same horrid scenes at night. I made frequent inquiries of my kind physician if he
                  had yet received a letter in answer to his inquiries concerning my nurse; but
                  several days passed by without any letter. I at length became impatient and
                  declared my resolution to remain no longer in bed, but to rise up immediately and
                  go myself to ascertain the truth; at the same time affirming my conviction that
                  some foul villainy had been perpetrated towards my nurse! The doctor became
                  alarmed for my safety, declaring that if I persevered in that resolution it would
                  be the cause of my death: but nevertheless I was determined to put it in
                  execution.
               "'I know,' said I, 'yes I feel assured, that she is dead, and that she has been
                  murdered, cruelly murdered! and I must go and punish the miscreant this moment,'
                  at the same time making an effort to rise.
               "The doctor very naturally concluded that my mind was still somewhat disordered by
                  the effects of the fever, and that it was necessary for my safety to impose a
                  salutary restraint on my actions till I should be perfectly recovered. First,
                  however, he reasoned with me on the folly of such an attempt at that particular
                  time, even supposing what I said to be true.
               "'For how,' said he, 'could you prove the fact? From dreams and apparitions seen
                  while you were laboring under a fever? Ha ha! what excellent proof this would be
                  before a jury?'
               "'I could have the body exhumed and examined,' I replied, 'to see if it exhibited
                  any marks of violence, or, as I rather suspect, any remains of the poison.'
               "'And is it possible,' said he, 'that a person of your sense and judgment can
                  place any dependence in dreams or visions under any circumstances?'
               "'Murders have been brought to light by that means before now,' I replied.
               "'Well, at all events,' said he, 'let me request of you to wait two days longer,
                  and if no letter should come before that time, I promise you my full permission to
                  depart, for I hope you will be then sufficiently convalescent to undertake the
                  journey. And besides, I can see that this affair preys upon your mind and retards
                  your recovery.'
               "I promised him that I would wait till that time, and he left me, giving strict
                  charge to my attendant not to quit my room on any account, and to take particular
                  care, lest I should attempt to make my escape.
               "How I passed the remainder of that day and the following night you may more
                  easily conceive than I can describe. Early on the following morning the doctor
                  entered my room with a letter in his hand. I tried to read its contents in his
                  countenance, but he had too much command over his features to allow a single
                  muscle of his face at any time to betray his inward feelings.
               "'Well, doctor, you are come to confirm my suspicions—my conviction; I know you
                  are. Nay, do not attempt to deny it! Let the truth be told at once without any
                  circumlocution! Is it not so? She is dead, and has been—'
               "'No! not murdered!' interrupted he, 'but that she is no more, is but too true! I
                  am utterly astonished how such a powerful presentiment could have found access to
                  your mind! You were at a great distance; you had no communication through the
                  medium of the senses! This is mysterious! Let me see!'
               "And here he paused for a full minute with his forefinger on his temple, in an
                  attitude of deep and profound meditation.
                  At last he exclaimed triumphantly:
               "'I have it! What a child I was not to have thought of it before! The first letter
                  you received at Lyons did it not say, that unless you made great haste you would
                  not see her alive?'
               "'Certainly,' I replied.
               "'Well,' continued the doctor, 'is it not self evident that you have reflected on
                  this so long and so intensely that it has become a reality, a bodily shape on your
                  mind, and that it has there assumed those frightful forms which you have already
                  described to me? Can anything be more plain than this? Surely vague imagination
                  ought now to give place to the sober dictates of reason; and this would teach you
                  that it is quite impossible the mind can receive any impression except through the
                  medium of the senses from some material substance. Now, as a spirit is an
                  immaterial, unsubstantial being, it is quite impossible that it could make any
                  impression whatever on material, corporal sense!'
               "'It seems reasonable,' I replied, 'but yet my conviction is opposed to reason and
                  philosophy.'
               "'Oh! that conviction will pass away with the return of health and strength,' said
                  the doctor. 'Yours is a very common case, and sufficiently familiar to us medical
                  men. I can assure you that it will soon pass away and be forgotten.'
               "'I question that,' I replied; 'but what in the mean time would you advise me to
                  do?'
               "'To make your mind easy under your bereavement and to remain here a few days
                  longer, till you are perfectly restored, and then to pursue your journey either to
                  join your friend on the continent, or else go on to Oxford, where you will hear
                  more particulars,' replied the doctor.
               "'I will take your advice,' I answered, 'and will adopt the latter of the two
                  courses which you propose.'
               "'But why!' I murmured to myself when he had left me, 'I have lost everything dear
                  to me or that cares for me in the world! I am a desolate, friendless outcast,
                  without home, without parents, without everything that is dear to the heart of
                  man, except money; and what is that? Would that I had been a poor, pennyless
                  beggar, in the lowest poverty and distress, but blessed with the smile of a
                  mother, or the protection of a father! How happy should I have been in comparison
                  of what I am now!'
               "Still, however occupied with the one idea, I inquired of the doctor on his
                  visiting me again in the evening, whether there were no suspicions of foul play
                  towards the nurse stated in the letter of her medical attendant, and he assured me
                  that there was not the slightest hint.
               "'Nay,' he continued, 'here is the letter, which you are at liberty to peruse for
                  yourself.'
               "I eagerly grasped it and ran through it with avidity; but it contained nothing
                  whatever calculated to confirm my suspicions, nor the slightest circumstance that
                  could lead any one to suppose otherwise than that she had died a natural
                  death.
               "In a few days I was pronounced by the doctor sufficiently recovered to proceed on
                  my journey, and after having thanked him kindly for his attention and rewarded him
                  for his trouble, I departed, but could not proceed the whole of the distance on
                  that day, as I was yet so weak as to be fatigued by the slightest exertion. I was,
                  in fact, obliged to make three days' journey of the small distance between Dover
                  and Oxford, where I at length arrived on the evening of the third very much
                  exhausted, so much so that I was obliged to go to bed. Here again my sleep was
                  disturbed by dreams of the same kind. The same phantom haunted my couch and seemed
                  to implore revenge for a black and murderous deed, and in the morning when I awoke
                  I was more impressed than ever with the conviction which all along haunted me. I
                  determined to have the affair searched into with the utmost scrutiny. I arose,
                  dressed and proceeded, unaccompanied, to the cottage where my good nurse had resided, and where she had often
                  gladdened my heart by her kind and welcome reception.
               "I knocked at the door. A hollow echo was returned from within, but no answer. It
                  was early, perhaps, thought I, the man McArdle, if he be here at all, is not yet
                  awake. I knocked again; still no answer, save a louder echo than the former. I
                  knocked a third time and with all my force. I heard something like a growl, but
                  from what kind of animal it proceeded it was difficult to determine. Encouraged,
                  however, by a sound from something like a living being, I knocked again, and
                  again; and at length I heard the sullen and gruff voice of McArdle, demanding, in
                  an exasperated tone:
               "'Who is there? What do yer want at this early hour? Go away! you shall not come
                  in!'
               "I now redoubled my efforts, and determined to give him no peace till I should be
                  admitted.
               "'Who are yiz, and what do yer want?' demanded he with fury, 'that comes to
                  disturb me in this violent manner. I will make yer repint of it whin I get on my
                  clothes!'
               "'Open the door this instant, you wretch!' I exclaimed, 'or I will break it
                  open!'
               "The moment he heard my voice he opened the door with a leer, fawning upon me like
                  a dog and making a thousand apologies for keeping 'my honor' standing so long
                  outside, protesting by everything sacred that he did not think it was I, but some
                  of the neighbors who had come purposely to annoy him; and immediately afterwards,
                  as he led me further into the cottage, closing and bolting the door behind him, he
                  burst out into a long, doleful and horrible howl, as he pointed out to me the
                  chair where my good nurse used to sit, and the room in which she used to sleep.
                  After which he gave a long rambling account of her sudden illness and death,
                  blending the whole with a mixture of eulogium, half English, half Irish, which it
                  would require a more skillful adept in these languages than I can pretend to be to
                  understand.
               "'Wretch!' I exclaimed, 'do you think to impose this story upon me, when you know
                  in your heart that it is false! You know well that she has been murdered, and you
                  are the wretch that has done the horrid deed!'
               "While I spoke I marked his countenance. It became at first deadly pale, then red
                  as fire, and then again pale. I saw a flame of mischief rapidly kindling up his
                  eyes, which glanced first at me and then around, as if in seach of some deadly
                  weapon which he could plunge into my heart. At length he made a spring to a
                  cupboard, opened it in an instant, and seized upon a huge knife—it was a kind of
                  hunting knife—with which he rushed upon me, aiming a deadly blow at my breast, and
                  if it had taken the desired effect I should not have been here now to tell the
                  tale which I would fain not have to impart to your ears. By bending timely to one
                  side I avoided the blow, which struck an interior door post opposite to which I
                  was standing, and the knife was buried in the wood several inches. While he tried
                  to draw it out I seized his arm; but he was a very powerful man, and in the weak
                  condition in which I then was I found my case would be hopeless should he
                  repossess himself of the knife. I therefore fell down on the floor and dragged him
                  after me, where we struggled violently for some time without either uttering a
                  syllable or a sound, except that of quick breathing. Notwithstanding all my
                  efforts, I found that I was so much exhansted that I could not hold him much
                  longer. He dragged me by degrees along the floor nearer and nearer towards where
                  the knife was still sticking in the door post. He was already close to it; his
                  hand grasped the handle, and in another instant I should have been weltering in my
                  blood! but just at the moment he was about to draw it, a brick which had been
                  loose on the top of the half wall, having been moved by the impulse of my feet
                  against the wall in attempting to pull him back, fell down with a violent crash on
                  his wrist, which it completely disabled, at the same time dashing the knife violently out of his grasp and
                  hurling it just within reach of my right hand. I seized it, and in turn became the
                  assailant. My antagonist, stunned with the blow of the falling brick and writhing
                  with agony, had sunk to the ground. I seized him by the throat with my left hand
                  and with my right raised the knife, as if about to plunge it in his breast. He
                  seemed to expect or hope for nothing else. I paused for a moment and said:
               "'Fiend! it was not enough for you to murder my dear nurse, but now you must
                  attempt my life also! Have you any reason to urge why I should not plunge this
                  knife into your heart and free the earth from a demon by sending you to your own
                  damned dwelling place?'
               "'Oh! I am in yer power,' he replied, 'but spare me life, I beseech you by all the
                  saints and angels of Heaven! spare me life and I will tell you something which you
                  have long wished to know. I am the only one livin now who knows the sacret of your
                  birth!'
               "'Demon!' I answered, 'confess to the murder at once! It is the only hope you have
                  left of life. I promise to spare your life for the present and consign you to the
                  justice of the law on this one condition! As to your knowing anything of my
                  secret, as you call it, I disbelieve it altogether, and I should loathe myself
                  ever afterwards if I thought you had any knowledge whatever of anything that
                  concerns myself or my fortunes. Be assured you shall not escape me so easily as
                  you imagine by your pretending to know my secrets! Confess instantly or you are a
                  corpse! Confess!' and thus saying I raised the knife as if about to plunge it into
                  his heart.
               "'Spare me! oh! spare me!' he said, 'if you value your own pace of mind and
                  contintment. You will be sorry for the rash act hereafter, whin you will be made
                  sartin that I am the only one now livin at all that can tell you what you want to
                  know. Sure enough it is myself that can tell you things at which you will be
                  astonished and surprised intirely, and wouldn't you jist be cuttin your own throat
                  if ye did me any bodily harm?'
               "'Confess!' said I.
               "'Sure,' said he, 'ye are no father confessor at all at all. If I have done any
                  harm, and God knows I am a big sinner intirely, it is the praist that will pardon
                  me. Now, listen to me. How do you think it possible that I could by any manner of
                  manes murder a poor ould helpless woman? For what purpose? She had no money, no
                  property of any kind! Do ye think I am such a fool as to put my neck in danger for
                  nothin at all at all? No, no! Denis McArdle is not such a simpleton as that comes
                  to!'
               "'Then why did you attempt to murder me? and why did you turn pale and of all
                  colors when I taxed you with the other deed?'
               "'Ha! do ye wonder at that? Is it surprisable that I should be ruffled a little
                  when my character was blackened without rason by accusin me of murder? You little
                  know me if you think my timper could stand sich an assult; and it is well I did
                  not get hould of the knife! I should have done a deed for which I would have been
                  very sorry. But it is all past and gone now, and though I would have killed you at
                  the moment, I am still your friend. So you may jist relase me and it will be all
                  at an end.'
               "'Heaven preserve me from such friends!' I replied. 'But will you, can you behave
                  yourself properly, if I release you?'
               "'On the word and honor of a gintleman,' said he, 'you shall have no cause to fear
                  me.'
               "'But first of all tell me what you know of me.'
               "'I promise to do that in good time.'
               "'When?' I eagerly demanded.
               "'Not yet! not yet!' said he, 'but it will be soon, soon enough, I warrant,' he
                  muttered to himself, with one of his malignant looks.
               "'I will have the time stated before I permit you to rise.'
               "'Well, if it must be so, I will say within a year from this time, provided you give me a proper
                  recompense.'
               "'Well I promise you anything you ask in reason, only name the day.'
               "'Let it be this day twelve months then,' said he in a calm tone.
               "'What! not sooner?'
               "'No! it will be impossible.'
               "'Well, agreed!' I replied, 'this day twelve months!'
               "'But,' said he, 'I have one other request to make of you.'
               "'Name it!'
               "'It is that you will not mention that foolish notion you have got in your head
                  about the nurse being murdered, as it might create suspicion and can sarve no
                  purpose whatsomiver. Ye must have bin dramin in your illness, and these hobgoblins
                  cam in yer head. Why, sur, the people would think ye mad, and I have too much
                  regard for your father's son to allow sich a report to be spread about ye. Now I
                  hope ye are quite satisfied!'
               "I really began to think now that I had gone too far, and to feel somewhat ashamed
                  of the figure I made, even in the eyes of this wretch; and having taken proper
                  precautions to guard myself against any sudden attack, I permitted him to rise,
                  promising to do as he requested.
               "He was now perfectly calm and showed no symptoms whatever of resentment or ill
                  will, but even appeared much more polite and civil than before; and he looked at
                  me with an attempt at benevolence in his eyes, as far as their sinister and
                  forbidding expression would admit of such a look.
               "I was about to depart from a scene at which I shuddered when I reflected on what
                  might have been the consequence had McArdle been able to grasp the knife in his
                  fury, when he called to me in a gruff, but for him the mildest tone he could
                  assume:
               "'Misther Harcourt!' said he.
               "'What would you have of me,' I replied sternly.
               "'I have known your honor whin ye was a little baby not that high; I have been a
                  faithful sarvant in your family; but now I am gettin ould and I have no frinds
                  left in the world.'
               "'Well, what have I to do with that?' I replied.
               "'I know,' continued he, 'that I niver was a mighty favorite wid you, but,
                  nivertheless, I could not help that. I am now poor and have no manes of livin;
                  take me into yer sarvice, I beg of yer honor.'
               "'Never!' I replied; 'but though I hate and detest you, as you well know, I will
                  not permit you to starve. You shall receive a sufficient sum for your support from
                  my own pocket till I see you again, which will not be before this day twelve
                  months; and if, as you say, you can inform me satisfactorily of what I have been
                  so long anxious to know, I will continue the pension for life, with perhaps some
                  additions.'
               "God bless yer honor,' said he; 'I always knew ye was good, altho it has not been
                  my good luck to be able to plase ye or gain your good graces; but nivertheless I
                  am still yer honor's best friend, and why shouldn't I? Sure no one has a better
                  right to be so at all at all! I am goin to flit from here, and I will let ye know
                  in a day or two where to find me when ye want me. Good mornin to yer honor and
                  good luck, and may ye be happy till we meet agin!'
               "'Good morning, McArdle,' I returned in as kind a tone as it was possible for me
                  to assume; after which I departed, in order to learn further particulars of the
                  doctor who attended my nurse.
               "I fortunately found him at home, but could not glean anything from the
                  conversation I had with him, (which, however, was guarded, in consequence of the
                  promise I had made to McArdle, as well as for the sake of my own character for
                  sanity,) that could, in the slightest degree, tend to confirm my suspicions. I
                  paid him liberally for his attendance on my nurse, and departed more satisfied in
                  my mind than I had yet been of the groundlessness of my fears, but still unable to divest myself of the conviction
                  that they were not entirely without foundation.
               "As I now felt very low in spirits, both at the loss of my dear friend, the nurse,
                  and because of the peculiarly isolated position in which I found myself, which now
                  began to prey upon my mind more and more every day, I was earnestly advised both
                  by my medical attendant and the few friends with whom I asssociated at college to
                  rusticate for some time on account of my health, which, they said, might be
                  irreparably injured by my usually intense study, if I remained at college during
                  the coming term. To these reasons, backed by the advice of my tutor, for whom I
                  entertained the warmest affection and whose friendship I was fortunate enough to
                  have gained, I acceded, though reluctantly, as I was ambitious of literary
                  distinction among my cotemporaries. But feeling assured that severe application to
                  study at that particular time would be injurious to me, I thought it better to
                  prevent in time what, if let go on, might turn out to be serious. I therefore, in
                  about a week before the commencement of the term, left Oxford, resolved to seek
                  out some quiet rural retreat where I might spend the time in pursuits agreeable to
                  my state of mind and to my general habits without interruption. These were studies
                  of a scientific, though not of a severe character, and absorbed in such amusements
                  I hoped to forget both myself, my own position and the external world, at least
                  for a season. But whatever place I should choose for my retreat I firmly resolved
                  to abstain from all intercourse with my neighbors there, for two reasons: first,
                  because solitude and the pursuits of philosophy were more congenial to my mind
                  than the society of my fellow men, however select it might be; and secondly,
                  because I felt acutely the peculiarity of my anomalous position. On this subject I
                  was nervously alive, and hence the slightest allusion to my family and
                  connections, or even to the family and connections of others, in my presence,
                  always excited the most unpleasant feelings in my mind, which the commonest
                  observer could scarcely fail to notice. For this reason particularly I determined
                  to avoid making any acquaintance whatever, but to live like a very recluse in
                  every respect. For the same reason, too, I resolved to have no attendants about me
                  but strangers, who had never even heard of me before, and to seek some place in
                  the heart of the country where there would be little chance of my meeting with any
                  one who knew me.
               "A few years before the time I speak of, I remembered, in an excursion I made with
                  a young friend, to have passed through a valley which from its solitude and
                  repose, and its great beauty, left a lasting impression on my mind. Thither I now
                  resolved to retire and to seek for a retreat. It is the valley now before us. None
                  other could rival it in beauty or seemingly could be better adapted for my
                  purpose. I accordingly came and found a cottage exactly such as I desired. I
                  furnished it, engaged servants of the neighborhood, and in a short time saw myself
                  surrounded by everything that could impart comfort and happiness, if the mind was
                  at ease. Books, instruments, a garden, a river, a delightful country and a lovely
                  landscape around me! what more could I desire or hope for? But yet I was not
                  happy! My lonely and desolate condition, the uncertainty that hung over my birth,
                  and the loss of my dear, kind friend, the nurse, with the suspicions and dreams
                  that still haunted me with regard to the manner of her death, all these things
                  were no small obstacles in the way of my full enjoyment of the otherwise congenial
                  scene around me, till plunged in scientific investigation and the pursuits of
                  wisdom, I banished these thoughts from my mind, and then I enjoyed a larger share
                  of happiness than I had ever experienced before. By degrees, too, my unpleasant
                  thoughts and feelings began to be absorbed in the objects of interest around me,
                  and I really think that had I been permitted to remain undisturbed in this repose,
                  I should, in time, have been as happy as it is possible for man to be on earth!
                  But it was ordained otherwise! That very
                  society which I shunned so much, and which was, in fact, my greatest bane, and
                  ought to have been avoided by me with the greatest care, sought me out in my calm
                  retreat, prevailed upon me in a moment of weakness to join it and has now undone
                  me for ever! Had I been truly wise I should easily have seen that I was not sought
                  after for my own good, as it was pretended, but merely to gratify a morbid
                  curiosity!
               "It was soon whispered about the neighborhood that an extraordinary character, a
                  stranger, a prodigy of learning, but a wild and eccentric recluse,
                  had taken up his abode in that vicinity, and that he was accessible and would be
                  accessible to no one! It would be endless to recount the innumerable conjectures
                  and opinions that were hazarded and spread abroad as to what could have possibly
                  led me, in the bloom of youth, rich as it was reported, and neither hideous to
                  look at, nor deformed, to adopt such an extraordinary mode of life! Some said it
                  was disappointed love; others that it was the love of letters; others that it was
                  in consequence of some quarrel with my family; and others hinted even at deeds of
                  wrong and violence! So that, in a short time, I became an object of the most
                  extraordinary and unaccountable interest to my neighbors. Many looked on me with
                  an eye of suspicion, and others thought I was deranged in my intellect; in short,
                  all seemed to busy themselves about my affairs, so that instead of enjoying that
                  solitude and repose which I so much desired, I was continually annoyed with knocks
                  at my door, carriages, calls and cards, not one of which visits I returned or took
                  the slightest notice of. It was in vain that I left orders to say I was not at
                  home. Sometimes a clergyman would come soliciting a subscription to a charity; the
                  amount would be sent him through my servant. Sometimes a neighboring gentleman
                  would send up his card, requesting to see me about some damages my cattle had done
                  in trespassing on his fields; I referred him to my servant. At another time a
                  farmer would call, requesting to know if I would sell him a horse that he had
                  taken a fancy to. But I was never to be seen by any one in a private conference;
                  but like a king transacted all business through the medium of my minister!
               "But in acting thus I had not the slighest idea that I was doing anything
                  extraordinary and still less of creating a sensation, as I was accused of doing,
                  in the neighborhood! My sole object was to be alone and tranquil, and this for the
                  obvious reasons which I have already given. But I was very much disappointed in my
                  expectation! for the most crowded city would have been more eligible in this
                  respect than the retired valley which I had chosen. What was I to do? It was
                  obvious I could have no peace as long as I remained perfectly and entirely a
                  recluse. There was a better chance for me if I mingled a little with a few of the
                  select families in the neighborhood. I might then, at a sacrifice of a small part,
                  enjoy the remainder of my time in my own way tranquil and undisturbed. This I
                  determined upon, and the first place I visited in the neighborhood was your friend
                  H's. The occasion was thought worthy of a large party. On that evening all the
                  beauty and fashion of the neighborhood were assembled. Though many were beautiful,
                  yet I was totally indifferent to the bright array as well as to the attentions
                  that were forced upon me. I felt that I had no tie there and sighed for my
                  accustomed solitude. At length a new name was announced, though it was late.
                  Curiosity directed my eyes to the newcomers. It was a tall, stately, middle aged
                  gentleman, leading in a lady young, beautiful and elegant, both in her form and
                  manners. Never had my eyes dwelt on such an object! I gazed upon her with surprise
                  and delight! My eyes refused to look on aught besides! I felt a new and strange
                  emotion take possession of my soul! My whole being was conscious of an impulse
                  hitherto undreamt of! My step was insensibly attracted to whatever part of the
                  room she moved, and the bystanders could not but remark the impression which she had made upon me. I was quite
                  a new creature both in their eyes and my own. My former reserve left me, and I
                  gave myself up, without restraint, to a seductive but unconquerable passion. I
                  sought the host in my eagerness and requested him to introduce me to the beautiful
                  stranger. He willingly complied, at the same time extolling your sister's mental
                  endowments even more than her personal charms. We were introduced. I requested the
                  honor of her hand for the next dance, and how my soul thrilled with ineffable
                  rapture when I heard the silvery tones of her voice, caught the sweet, mild
                  expression of her eye, which seemed to beam with pleasure, as she modestly gave
                  her consent! Oh! who would not give away a whole existence for the recurrence of
                  such a moment as that! We danced and seemed mutually pleased with each other, and
                  contrary to etiquette and seemingly regardless of opinion, we danced again and
                  again! The hours flew by on wings of lightning! Morning dawned, but my eyes were
                  not satisfied with gazing, my heart was too full of joy, of delight! Yet we must
                  part! The thought was harrowing! My emotions were too powerful! I led her into the
                  recess and thence on to the balcony. We were alone, the stars above and the early
                  dawn the only witnesses. I could no longer restrain my feelings, but throwing my
                  arm around her waist I pressed her to my breast! I felt the throbbing of her heart
                  against mine! She made no effort to withdraw from my embrace! Our lips met! The
                  tale of mutual love was told, more in sighs and tears of delight than in words!
                  Yet they were not wanting! We both confessed to the tender emotion, and from that
                  moment to the present we have lived only for each other!
               "That night I knew for the first time what it was to live, to love, to be loved,
                  to exchange vows of mutual and eternal affection! And that night I retired to bed,
                  not to sleep but to feast my memory with the lovely vision I had seen, with the
                  delightful emotions I had enjoyed! Her form, her look, her graceful movement in
                  the dance, the pressure of her hand in mine, and then the balcony scene! oh,
                  heavens! how could I close my eyes in sleep while such a remembrance blessed my
                  waking dreams? How often again was my arm in fancy thrown around her waist! how
                  often did I feel the throbbing of her heart! how often did I feel the pressure of
                  her warm, soft and ruby lips! Oh! would that I had then been arrested by the
                  merciful hand of death! I should have died happy, and she, my love, would have
                  been saved the pain of this doubt, and might yet have bestowed her heart on an
                  object more worthy of its tender and enduring affection!"
               "Speak not thus, dear Harcourt," said Charles, in a firm tone, "and do not repine
                  for her sake. You know that your love is dearer to her than life, and that she
                  will be happy with you if everything else is taken away from her; wealth, friends,
                  family connections, and, dearest of all, life itself, must yield to the lasting
                  love she bears to you. Then do not despair, my friend, you shall yet be happy; for
                  since honor and virtue must ever be yours, what matter if the world misjudges your
                  actions or your motives? Look to a higher tribunal for that justice which is
                  denied us by our fellow creatures here."
               "Angel of mercy, as you are!" exclaimed Harcourt, "how can I sufficiently thank
                  you for the expression of such noble feelings?"
               He would have gone on thus much longer had Charles not reminded him that the day
                  was far advanced and that he must bring his tale to a conclusion as soon as
                  possible.
               He therefore continued as follows:
               "Though overwhelmed with a flood of happiness and delight, yet, on sober
                  reflection, I could not help regretting the occasion which gave rise to it. I had
                  completely broken through the bounds and the rules which I had imposed upon
                  myself, and I could not help perceiving that in my present circumstances it was
                  next to madness to have formed any attachment which perhaps could never be gratified. The very
                  idea that I was totally ignorant of my own origin and connections struck a chill
                  through my heart which was never felt so acutely before, and I very justly
                  reasoned that it was worse than folly, it was cruel, to involve another person in
                  my fate, at least till that doubt should be cleared away. These reflections gave
                  me great pain and determined me to break off the acquaintance which I had just
                  formed, to make a precipitate retreat from this neighborhood altogether, and to
                  trust to time for an explanation of my motives to Charlotte and you, and an
                  exculpation from blame; but so powerful was the impression made on my heart, and
                  so feeble was my resolution that I found it utterly impossible to act up to it by
                  pursuing that which my reason told me would be the proper course. Besides, hope,
                  which never forsakes the most forlorn of mankind, whispered consolation to me from
                  the disclosure which I was promised from McArdle, and the time of that interview
                  was not very far distant then. Thus I reconciled my honor with my inclination in
                  keeping up a correspondence with your sister and your family, though my
                  conscience, on reflection, warned me that I was doing wrong. However the passion
                  which I found it hopeless to resist, took complete possession of my soul and of my
                  whole being, and stifled the voice of conscience and of reason within me. The time
                  fled by on golden wings like a pleasing dream. With her I could think of nothing
                  annoying or unpleasant; away from her I could think of nothing but her. Her image
                  was ever in my thoughts by day and by night, to the exclusion of every other idea.
                  What wonder if I became almost forgetful of myself!
               "From this state of torpor I was aroused this morning by your visit. I had asked
                  your father to consent to our union. He refused. I entreated the intercession of
                  you, her brother, and after much difficulty you succeeded in wringing a tardy and
                  unwilling acquiescence on one condition. This it was which you, so joyful and
                  delighted, have come to impart to me. Strange coincidence! It is the very day
                  appointed for my interview with McArdle! Yes, this day I shall know my destiny,
                  what I have to hope for and to live for. May Heaven grant that all things may turn
                  out well. But I tremble for the issue. Go back to Charlotte and tell her all;
                  conceal nothing. Bid her be prepared for the worst, if the worst should come; say
                  that I would have hurried to her presence and thrown myself at her feet had time
                  permitted. But I see by my watch that little remains to me. The place of
                  rendezvous is at some distance; I fear the stage will be here before I am prepared
                  for it. To-morrow I hope to explain everything to Charlotte herself. Adieu, my
                  friend, till to-morrow."
               So saying he hurried off to prepare for his journey, while Charles Cumming, having
                  bid a hasty adieu to his friend, bent his steps homeward to communicate to his
                  sister, and to her alone, the strange result of his mission.
               Charlotte Cumming, who really loved Harcourt with the most devoted affection, was
                  a girl of sound judgment, though of a very delicate and sensitive frame; and
                  though at first she entertained some hope at the recital of her brother, yet she
                  could not suppress certain misgivings when she reflected on the very mysterious
                  manner in which her lover had hitherto studiously avoided all allusions to his own
                  family during the whole period of their acquaintance, and the embarrassment and
                  emotion he betrayed when allusion was made to it by others. She pondered well the
                  account which her brother gave of the deadly paleness of Harcourt's countenance on
                  the announcement of her father's wish to him, and the seemingly reluctant answer
                  which he gave to Charles when he requested an immediate explanation, together with
                  the abruptness of his departure at a moment when she most expected his presence,
                  and that he would be eager to throw himself at the feet of her father in gratitude
                  and thankfulness for his goodness, and she could come to no satisfactory
                  conclusion in her own mind what to think
                  of the result. However she assumed a cheerful countenance and resolved to summon
                  all the courage she was able, in order to meet whatever events the coming morrow
                  was destined to bring forth.
               It will be more easy to conceive than describe her anxiety during the whole of
                  that night, and the contending feelings that struggled for mastery in her mind
                  during that to her tedions interval. At length, the often wished for morning
                  dawned and passed away, and noon came, long before which time it had been
                  Harcourt's usual custom to make his appearance at the hall, without bringing any
                  traces or tidings of her lover. The poor girl now became very uneasy. Her
                  patience, though great, began to yield to her fears and misgivings, and soon an
                  uneasiness and perturbation in her manner became so evident as to attract the
                  observation of her brother, who easily divined the cause, and felt some alarm for
                  the consequences. He volunteered to go over to Harcourt's house in the hope of
                  being able to learn something of him from the servants. He did so, but no one
                  could give him any information, and he returned, dejected, to communicate the
                  result to his sister. Reflecting, however, that the day was not yet more than half
                  spent, and that Harcourt had not mentioned any particular hour, he very naturally
                  concluded that he might be detained longer than he had expected by particular
                  business, and that as he was usually very punctual to his promise, he would yet
                  come before the day was entirely spent. This view of the matter had not escaped
                  the penetrating mind of Charlotte, who, for that reason, was, notwithstanding her
                  fears, enabled to look forward with some glimmering of hope to a happy issue. But
                  yet she could not help speculating on the possibility of some serious
                  disappointment. She was naturally nervous and a gloomy impression of some
                  impending ill had for some time past hung over her mind. She had had disturbed
                  dreams, in all of which Harcourt seemed to play a prominent, but always a
                  melancholy, part before her.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               THE DREAM.
               THOUGH I am not superstitious, yet I must confess that I cannot entirely divest
                  myself of a belief in dreams and impressions. This may be unphilosophical, perhaps
                  vulgar; but there are, I believe, many things for which philosophy cannot account,
                  that happen in the experience of every individual, and leave on the mind feelings
                  and persuasions of supernatural agents which few would venture to confess, in this
                  matter-of-fact age, even to themselves, for fear of incurring the imputation of
                  weakness or vulgarity, or both. Now it is possible to carry this affectation too
                  far, and hence we find that the most ignorant and presumptuous dabblers in science
                  are generally the first to laugh at those who profess some belief in other than
                  natural agency, as antiquated and unphilosophical dreamers. But the truth is, that
                  philosophy, with all its research and pretension, knows little or nothing of the
                  nature of things or the true relation between cause and effect, and therefore,
                  being capable of explaining nothing satisfactorily itself, it has no right to
                  condemn those as ignorant and superstitious who look to higher and more powerful
                  agents than any it can boast of. The relation we bear to the spiritual world is
                  little known, and still less is the government and mode of communication which the
                  Great Creator has adopted with regard to his creature man, in every age and clime;
                  for we find, if universal belief is any ground for faith, that dreams and
                     impressions sions have been very
                  powerful in their influence always and amongst every people of the globe. The
                  Jews, the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Romans, the Hindoos, the Chinese, and even
                  the Indians of North and South America, have been firm believers in dreams, and
                  many of them have handed down their convictions concerning them, that they were
                  sent down from heaven by the gods, to guide, direct, warn or reprove men. The
                  Bible abounds with proofs of this assertion; so do the Grecian and Roman poets and
                  historians, and the records and observations of our modern travelers.
               It is curious, too, to observe the extraordinary coincidences between dreams and
                  their fulfillment, which most people attentive to the subject may remark, even in
                  their own individual experience or in that of their friends; but it would require
                  volumes to record all that might be written on this theme.
               However men may differ as to their opinions on this subject, it is certain that
                  poor Charlotte Cumming was more powerfully influenced by her dreams and
                  impressions than she would willingly acknowledge. She had found by experience that
                  whenever her dreams were disturbed and unpleasant, something of an unpleasant
                  nature always followed to disturb her happiness; and this was a sufficient reason
                  for her to dread a similar result for the future. It may not, perhaps, be
                  uninteresting to relate here, as a striking illustration of what I have said
                  above, a dream which she had had a few evenings before the circumstance occurred
                  to which I now am directing your attention.
               She thought she was walking through a dense wood in company with Harcourt, on a
                  beautiful night. The moon shone with all its wonted brightness, and the stars
                  twinkled joyfully in their orbits, as if rejoicing in the loveliness of the earth
                  on which they gazed with seeming delight. The path in which they walked was at
                  first sufficiently broad for them to walk together, but after a while it became so
                  narrow and so entangled that only one could walk in it at a time. She thought that
                  Harcourt took the lead, and was busied in clearing a path for her, lest her tender
                  feet should be torn by the brambles and thorns with which it was almost literally
                  choked up, looking back ever and anon with one of his most tender and anxious
                  looks, to see if she was following in safety in the track which he had taken such
                  pains to clear for her, when all at once the heavens became involved in clouds,
                  the moon was obscured, and the whole forest was enveloped in utter darkness. Then
                  a stream of lightning broke through the gloom, followed by a loud crash of
                  thunder, which seemed to rend the earth itself on which they stood, and to break
                  and tear in a thousand pieces the strongest oaks of the forest. Immediately the
                  scene was changed! She seemed now on a lofty hill, surrounded by her brother,
                  father, and other friends, who were all in the wildest consternation, intently
                  gazing on the east. It was the conflagration of the world! The sun seemed like
                  blood, and was falling down into space from its orbit! The earth had caught fire,
                  and was sinking into an abyss of annihilation! Charlotte looked wildly around her
                  for Harcourt, that she might die in his embrace. He was nowhere to be found. She
                  screamed aloud, calling upon his name, and in her agony she awoke, thankful to
                  Heaven that it was but a dream! But then, what a dream! The impression it left on
                  her mind could not easily be forgetten. She shuddered when she thought on the wild
                  and fearful sublimity of the scene, and dreaded lest some terrible calamity should
                  befall her through him whom she valued more than life itself.
               In this state of anxiety and fear she spent the day. Her brother tried all he
                  could to comfort and console her, but in vain. The evening was already far
                  advanced, and no traces of Harcourt were any where to be discovered. Charlotte
                  listened eagerly to every sound, every footstep. The rustling of the leaves in the
                  arbor, or the shadow which a cloud passing over the moon cast on the lawn—every
                  object, however unimportant, attracted her attention and excited her hopes, but it
                  was only to dash them to the ground. She began now to give up all idea of his
                  coming that night, and therefore fore, at
                  the earnest entreaty of her brother, she retired to her own room.
               It was about eleven o'clock at night; the moon was full orbed and shining in all
                  her brightness in the calm cerulean sky. Sometimes a fleecy cloud would for an
                  instant obscure her luster, but soon sailing over her disc, would leave it pure
                  and spotless as before. The stars, too, shed their gem-like rays with unwonted
                  brilliancy, and the whole heavens seemed to smile in serenity and repose. From her
                  window Charlotte Cumming had a full and clear view of the surrounding landscape,
                  mellowed as it was by the radiance of the nocturnal luminaries, and idealized by
                  the peculiar mood of mind in which she then found herself. The house of Sir Fred.
                  Cumming, being situated on a rising ground at some little distance from the river
                  Avon, commands one of the most beautiful prospects, perhaps, in all England, and
                  never did that prospect appear more lovely or interesting than on that night. In
                  front of the house was a lawn, smooth-shaven and sloping down to the very brink of
                  the river, along the banks of which, to right and left, stretched a flower garden
                  and shrubbery of the most choice flowers and plants, whose perfume filled the
                  surrounding atmosphere with the most grateful and delicious fragrance. Beyond the
                  river, which at that spot was broad and deep, lay a beautiful green meadow,
                  skirted on the farther side by a grove of stately trees, and in the distance rose
                  the blue hills of Mendon, which seemed like dark clouds on the brow of the bright
                  horizon. Here and there the beams of the moon and stars fell upon the dark current
                  of the river, as it wound its meandering course through trees and meadows and
                  corn-fields in the distance, and tinged its surface with a bright silvery hue,
                  which contrasted finely with the shadows of the surrounding landscape. An
                  artificial cascade, whose distant murmurs, wafted to the ear at intervals by the
                  light and balmy zephyrs, and mingling its sounds with the low whispering of the
                  leaves in the arbor, gave an additional charm to the scene and impressed the mind
                  of Charlotte Cumming with mingled feelings of awe and sublime emotion as she
                  contrasted the peace and repose of nature with the grief and perturbation of her
                  own mind. Yet there was a solemnity in the scene which could not fail to make a
                  salutary impression on her by soothing her mind and elevating her thoughts above
                  the cares and anxieties of life. There is something in the bright and pure
                  countenance of nature that, when we gaze upon it in certain moods, makes us forget
                  our own sorrows and anxieties in our veneration for the presence in which we
                  stand, and causes us to look forward with a holy faith from the woes of the
                  present troublesome world to the full fruition of joys in a scene of eternal calm
                  and repose of which she at such times is the type.
               Such are the feelings that generally impress us when left to ourselves in the
                  solitude and repose of inanimate nature. We wonder why it is that we are generally
                  so little attentive to its surpassing beauties, and are influenced so much and so
                  incessantly by human passions and human sympathies; but no sooner do animated
                  creation, and especially human interests, present themselves to our attention than
                  we forget all we so much admired before, and mingle, both in heart and person,
                  with a more congenial association.
               Thus was it now with Charlotte Cumming. She gazed upon the scene before her till
                  her soul was beginning to blend and sympathize with it, even to the oblivion of
                  her sorrows. A calmness and repose succeeded to perturbation and emotion in her
                  mind, and she almost wondered why she could take such a deep interest in fleeting
                  and transitory passions, when all at once her attention was attracted to an object
                  of a different nature. She thought, as she gazed on the grove which skirted the
                  meadow on the other side of the river, that she distinctly saw the form of a man
                  moving cautiously in the shade. It advanced into the light for a moment, and then
                  shrunk back, as if in fear, and then it stole out again. She was not deceived. The
                  figure moved down timidly towards the water, and then stood still, gazing up at the window where she
                  sat, having forgotten to cover her light. She thought she recognized the form and
                  figure of Harcourt! but as he was wrapped in a cloak, with his face muffled, she
                  could not be certain; besides, he was still too far distant to enable her to judge
                  by the now dim light of the moon.
               In a moment, however, her doubts were removed. The figure sprang into a boat which
                  had been concealed amongst the bushes on the bank, dashed across the water, and in
                  a few momonts more Harcourt stood before her! Heavens! who can describe the joy of
                  her heart at that moment! Her sympathy for nature and all the thoughts that had
                  recently passed through her mind were dispelled by the presence of one whom a
                  moment before she had almost despaired of seeing, and for whose loss she was
                  endeavoring to console herself by her sympathy with the inanimate objects around
                  her.
               "Charlotte, dearest Charlotte!" exclaimed Harcourt, as he threw off his disguise
                  and approached the open window, at which she sat riveted to the seat with
                  astonishment and delight, "the clock has not yet proclaimed the arrival of another
                  day, and I am come to redeem the promise which I made to your brother
                  yesterday—that all would be 'set at rest to-morrow,' that is to-day."
               "But why, Harcourt, have you come at this late hour, and thus disguised, as if
                  there was any cause for concealment, when you are aware that my father has at
                  length consented to our union on one simple and easy condition?" asked Charlotte,
                  in a tone of gentle reproof. "Besides, I think it was hardly kind of you to keep
                  me in such suspense, and so long, too! You might have written, at least, or sent
                  some message, if you had business so important as to detain you all this time.
                  Indeed I must say that I am not half pleased with you."
               "It is for that very reason that I beg, I intreat your pardon," answered he, in a
                  supplicating tone; "and indeed," continued he, "I shall have great need of your
                  indulgence and forbearance with me on this trying occasion, for I am come with the
                  additional purpose of communicating something of importance to you, which I have
                  resolved to impart to you, and you alone, however it may impair the good opinion
                  you entertain of me, or expose my own weakness and folly. But I deserve the worst
                  that can happen to me!" continued he with a deep sigh, "which would be the loss of
                  your esteem and affection, Charlotte, for not having explained matters sooner, and
                  I should be unworthy of both did I seek to gain or keep them by falsehood or
                  deception; I shall therefore give you a full and distinct account of all I heard
                  and endured last night, and if you can see anything dishonorable or base in my
                  career, then dismiss me from your presence forever with scorn and contempt; but
                  if, on the other hand, you find there no fault of mine, but solely what nature and
                  necessity can be accountable for, then exercise your own excellent judgment, and
                  reflect whether the prejudices and pride of family and birth ought to weigh with
                  the inherent qualities and dignity of the mind, and judge between your father and
                  me.
               "I need not tell you that our birth and station in life are not in our own power,
                  but are ordered by an all-wise and all-seeing Providence, for his own holy
                  purposes, into which it were vain and presumptuous for man to scrutinize. Some are
                  ushered into the world surrounded with wealth and pomp, and every luxury that can
                  smooth the path of life; others, the wretched and forlorn offspring of poverty and
                  crime,—and of such latter class I am the unfortunate issue!"
               "Good Heavens! do not—oh, do not say so!" exclaimed Charlotte, with a shriek which
                  was suppressed by the very intensity with which it was uttered.
               "Listen to me," interrupted Harcourt, "and be calm. This is not a time for giving
                  way to vain emotions, but demands action. What I have said to you is but too
                  true," continued he. "I was born the son of poor peasants, not only wretched and
                  miserable, but guilty! for the hallowed words of the church had never sanctioned their union, nor were they received or
                  acknowledged as children within its sacred pale! You may look upon me with
                  surprise, with horror and contempt, but such is the fact, and who can alter the
                  decrees of fate or the order of nature? Yes! despise me if you will, but"——
               "No, no! I cannot—I will not—I could not if I would despise you!" said Charlotte,
                  bursting into tears. "Are you not the same gentle, kind and pure being who won my
                  love—to whom I have pledged my irrevocable faith and troth?"
               "You may recall those pledges if you will!" exclaimed her lover; "I absolve you
                  from all obligation, from every engagement; nay, if you will, I will depart from
                  your presence, for which alone I live and breathe! I will do anything to atone for
                  my error—in what?—in loving, in presuming to love, to adore, one so infinitely far
                  above me—one so good, so pure! Yes," said he with energy, "I would die to gratify
                  your humblest wish! Only say what that is, and it shall be gratified!"
               "Alas! Harcourt," said she, in a subdued tone of voice, "it is now too late to
                  recall pledges, when the heart is pledged and fatally bartered away! Could that be
                  restored all might be well; but I feel that whatever you are, whatever you have
                  been, or whatever you may be, I must continue to love you, and that my fate is
                  interwoven so intimately with yours that we must both stand or fall together! But
                  at least tell me something more of your history, and how it has happened that one
                  of your upright and honorable mind could reconcile your silence on this subject of
                  your family with your attention to me, knowing the temper and disposition of my
                  father and brother, who are so prejudiced in favor of birth and family that they
                  would sacrifice me to the tomb rather than to any man of an humble, much less to
                  one of disreputable or dishonorable birth and connections."
               "It is for this alone that I blame myself," replied Harcourt. "I ought at least to
                  have communicated to you all I knew on the subject myself, which, however, was
                  very little up to last night, when I heard the worst. Till then I only knew that
                  my parentage was uncertain, and that there was a mystery hanging over my birth,
                  which, however anxious, I could not penetrate before that time. I had not the
                  slightest hint, one way or the other; and as I had been brought up and educated as
                  a gentleman I had every reason to hope that the mystery would be cleared up to my
                  advantage and honor, and that I should at length be acknowledged the son of an
                  honorable family and not unworthy of forming an alliance with your ancient house.
                  This was the sole object of all my hopes—this was the aim and the end of my
                  highest ambition. Oh! then think of my sufferings, my agony and horror when I
                  learned the truth last night from the only person living who knew it! Think of
                  what an abyss was opened up to swallow me in its dark gulf, and then you may form
                  some notion of my love for you, which rescued me from the yawning chasm and
                  restored me again, if only for a moment, to your presence and your embrace."
               "Dearest Harcourt!" cried Charlotte, shuddering with horror, "how my soul pities
                  you! how my heart clings to you! In every fortune, good or evil, believe me to be
                  your own, your ever-devoted love—your servant, your slave, your consoler and
                  friend! I have not been deceived in you; you are everything which the purest and
                  fondest heart could desire, and nothing but death shall separate me from your
                  loved embrace!"
               "Oh! I am totally unworthy of such love, such disinterested love and devotion!"
                  exclaimed he; "but I feel conscious that whatever may be the decree of fate or the
                  turn of fortune, my heart is upright and honorable, and devoted to you alone. I
                  feel assured that no casualty, or calamity, or circumstance can change my feelings
                  for a moment or estrange them from you! But now listen to my tale, if it will not
                  give you too much pain to listen to the recital."
               "I can bear to hear anything of you or from you,' replied. Charlotte. "Pray go on, for the night is
                  advancing."
               "What I have to tell may detain us long; nevertheless, though painful to myself, I
                  shall not refuse to gratify you in this matter."
               So saying he took a seat beside her, and pursued his narrative as follows:
               "Yesterday I requested your brother to recapitulate to you the whole story of my
                  life, as far as I then knew it. I hope he has complied with my request."
               "He has faithfully," said Charlotte, "even up to the moment in which you stated
                  you had promised to meet that terrible man, McArdle, who pretended to be the only
                  person living who could throw any light on your parentage and connections."
               "Well, then," resumed Harcourt, "I shall take up the story at that point and
                  continue it to the end, if I do not exhaust your patience.
               "The place appointed for our meeting was in all respects suited to the mysterious
                  nature of our business—a lone barn or sheep-shed in the midst of a desolate
                  common, far removed from the dwellings of men, and the hour was that of
                  midnight—the only place and the only time that McArdle would consent to meet me at
                  all. What his motives were will appear in the sequel."
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               THE RENDEZVOUS.
               AS the place was full thirty miles distant and as, for the last five miles of the
                  way, there was no direct or open road, it was necessary to set out in good time,
                  in order to be able to keep my appointment exactly to the minute. Accordingly soon
                  after your brother left me yesterday morning, I set out by the first coach and
                  traveled without intermission the greater part of the day. In the evening I
                  arrived at the nearest point of the main road to the place of my destination, and
                  after having partaken of some refreshment at an inn, I set out alone and on foot
                  through byroads and footpaths for the place of meeting. The day had been fine
                  hitherto, but I perceived signs of an approaching storm, both from the appearance
                  of the setting sun and the clouds that were gathering in dark, thick masses on the
                  verge of the horizon. The air was sultry, and whether from this reason or the
                  eagerness and haste with which I hurried to the rendezvous, I felt a kind of
                  suffocating sensation and a palpitation of the heart, which very much retarded my
                  progress. Thus I was upwards of two hours in gaining the common from the time I
                  left the main road, as the darkness had set in, which was increased by the
                  gathering storm to the utmost degree. I could no longer perceive the slightest
                  trace of a path, but was obliged to grope my way through the rough furze and heath
                  with which the common was abundantly covered. It is true the place of rendezvous was only at a short distance
                  from that part at which I entered the wild, and I knew well the direction in which
                  it was situated, as I had visited the spot before for the very purpose of
                  acquainting myself with its exact locality, but such was the impenetrable darkness
                  and gloom around that it was utterly impossible to trace any object even at the
                  distance of two yards, and I was therefore literally obliged to grope about with
                  my hands and my cane, if by chance I could fall upon it in this way; but in vain,
                  for though I was most assiduous in my search, no trace of a house or any kind of
                  habitation could I find. I was anxiously engaged in this fruitless search for
                  upwards of an hour when the storm that had so long been threatening came on in all
                  its fury. The clouds opened and a blaze of light was poured forth which lit the
                  whole heath round me as far as the eye could reach, but it revealed nothing like a
                  dwelling to my astonished sight. I seemed to be in the midst of an interminable
                  and shoreless desert, without a path or a shelter, and exposed to the pelting
                  rain, large drops of which began now to descend, the forerunners or outposts of
                  the main body that was so soon to follow. I heard a wild rushing of waters like
                  that of a cataract above me in the heavens, and by the aid of a bright flash of
                  lightning which burst from the clouds at that moment I saw the torrent approaching
                  me like a furious and irresistible lion in pursuit of his prey, on which, after a
                  short flight, he springs with a fearful roar. In one moment I was literally
                  drenched to the skin; my breath was taken away, and I was compelled to stand still
                  and oppose my strength to the rush of waters to prevent myself being borne to the
                  earth by its resistless power!
               "The lightning ceased now to glare, saving at distant intervals, but the torrent
                  of rain was unabated, when happening to look round in a contrary direction to that
                  on which I had been moving, I thought I saw like a glimmer of light at a great
                  distance. It could not be the lightning, as it was in a different direction
                  altogether from the storm, and seemed also to have a duration and steadiness which
                  are no characteristics of the former. It might perhaps, I thought, be phosphoric
                  vapor from some swamp lighted up by the increased temperature imparted to the
                  atmosphere by the storm, but it might also be a light from some human habitation;
                  and therefore I resolved as soon as I regained a little strength and the fury of
                  the elements somewhat abated, to follow its direction and ascertain the truth.
                  This in a few minutes occurred, the violence of the storm abated, and I made all
                  the speed which my drenched clothes and the fatigue I had undergone permitted me
                  in the direction of the light, which burned more clearly as I approached it, and
                  as the vapors and mists produced by the heavy shower decreased. I found that it
                  was much nearer than I had at first supposed, for nothing is more deceptive than
                  our calculation of the distance of objects at night, especially of lights, and in
                  a few minutes I approached close to the building whence it emanated. It turned
                  out, as I expected, to be the one to which I was proceeding. Indeed it could be no
                  other, for, as I have already stated, there was no other within the distance of
                  several miles. On any other occasion I would have paused ere I entered it, but in
                  my present mood of mind and in the state of exhaustion and fatigue in which I
                  found myself I made no hesitation whatever, but entered at once with as bold and
                  daring a countenance and as determined a look as I could assume. I found McArdle
                  already there. He was seated and leaning over a few live embers in one corner of
                  the building, which was nothing more than a shed, almost roofless except at that
                  particular spot, and seemed to have been built as a retreat from the storm or
                  winter's cold for the sheep and cattle that browsed upon the common; but it was
                  almost useless even for that purpose now. McArdle had lighted a lamp and placed it
                  in a hole of the wall to guide me, as he said, to the hut on so dismal a night, as
                  well as to cheer the gloomy spot which he
                  had so unaccountably chosen for the rendezvous.
               "At my approach he rose from the rude log on which he had seated himself, and
                  holding out his rough hand, bade me kindly welcome, declaring himself delighted to
                  see me, and the expression of his countenance fully corroborated his words, for
                  never did I see such diabolical exultation depicted in the face of a human being
                  before. He seemed totally unable to suppress his savage joy, which I knew well
                  foreboded no good to those who should be so unfortunate as to be the objects of
                  it.
               "Instead of accepting the proffered hand, from which I shrunk with a kind of
                  instinctive horror, I pushed it back in disdain, saying in a determined tone of
                  voice:
               "'McArdle, I want no ceremony. We are here on business, and we know each other,
                  and we know well there is no love lost between us. Let us, therefore, lay aside
                  everything like hypocrisy and simulation and come to the point at once. You say
                  you know the history of my birth and of the mystery that hangs over me. If you
                  reveal it faithfully to me I promise you (and am ready to perform my promise) a
                  handsome recompense, an annuity suited to your condition while you live.'
               "'And what may you think suited to my condition?' said McArdle in a
                  peculiarly gruff and insolent tone.
               "'Why that can be determined at our leisure, and there is no fear of our differing
                  about the consideration of a few pounds, more or less,' said I in an impatient
                  tone.
               "'No time like the present, masther,' replied McArdle with a sinister leer.
               "'What do you demand?' I exclaimed. 'Name your demand that I may know how to deal
                  with you.'
               "'If I am the only person livin who can give you the information ye require,'
                  answered he, 'you ought, I think, to dale handsomely wid me. You could not think
                  it too much if I asked the one-half of your income? I mean what you come into when
                  ye are of age. That is a reasonable thing, eh!'
               "'McArdle you cannot be serious!' I exclaimed in astonisment, 'the half of my
                  income! Why, what would you do with it? No! you do not mean to take advantage of
                  my situation and be so exacting?'
               "'Well, if you are contint as you are, so am I!' he replied. 'Remember I don't
                  want any of it at all at all! Keep it all to yourself. Denis McArdle can live
                  without it.'
               "And thus saying he turned on his heel with the greatest indifference, as if about
                  to quit the shed.
               "'McArdle!' I exclaimed, 'come back; let me entreat you to listen to me!'
               "'No! it is no use, not one farthing less than what I have said; and if you say
                  much more about it I will not tell you a syllable for all the pelf ye have or may
                  have in the world!'
               "'For God's sake, tell me!' I exclaimed almost in despair, 'and take the half, any
                  amount you choose, but relieve me from this terrible suspense and doubt.'
               "'Now yer honor is talking like a wise man,' said Denis with a kind of sneer.
                  'That is jist how a rale born and bred gintleman should act. Sure enough ye have
                  got the breeding of a gintleman at all evints, and that is something, yer
                  honor.'
               "'What do you mean?' I inquired with eagerness mingled with displeasure.
               "'Oh! nothin at all, but that ye will plase jist to be after puttin yer name to
                  this bit of paper or parchmint, I think they call it, that is all, and sure as ye
                  are a good scholard ye will not have much thrubble in doin that same! Here is a
                  pin and ink, sign away; but wait jist a minute, I think a witness or two would be
                  no bad move in these threacherous times. Ho! Barny and Phelim! are yis awake?
                  Shure the tunder is a great sporifier, as ye learned folks call it! Ho, rise up,
                  ye lazy rampscallions, and come and witness this honest thransaction between two
                  honest min!'
               
               "So saying he ran to another corner of the shieling, in which a heap of straw and
                  rubbish seemed to be deposited, and giving it a kick with his toe while he
                  muttered a curse, he aroused two grim looking beings of gigantic stature and
                  powerful frame, who seemed just then to have been awakened from sleep, for they
                  both rubbed their eyes and then stared round them wildly, as if trying to
                  recollect where they were, and having become conscious of their whereabouts and
                  the cause that brought them thither, they came up to where I was standing,
                  grinning and bowing in a most hideous manner, at the same time holding out their
                  hands as if to bid me welcome. But I repulsed their insolence with a look of
                  contempt, and then they seemed all deference and respect, taking off their hats
                  and going through a variety of gestures, as if in mockery of the gentility and
                  aristocratic exclusiveness I had assumed. Then having performed this pantomine,
                  they both burst into a loud, horse laugh of derision, as if to let me know there
                  was little respect paid to rank or wealth in the place I then stood, or that I had
                  little pretensions to either. I took little notice of these insults, but put my
                  hand to my breast to feel if my pistols were all right, which action they
                  imitated, and not in vain, for my eye caught the butt ends of a pair of horseman's
                  pistols in the breast of each, with a short dagger, or rather knife, concealed
                  within their coarse great coats, none of which they took the least pains to
                  conceal, but on the contrary seemed desirous that they should be seen as it were
                  by stealth.
               "'Why have you brought these men here?' said I to McArdle, 'you promised to come
                  alone as I did; but I have kept my word and you have violated yours!'
               "'I have not!' answered McArdle in an altered accent and speaking good English,
                  'any more than you have. I suppose I have as good a right to be considered a man
                  of honor as yourself. I did come here alone, and the two men you see came by
                  themselves two or three hours before me.'
               "'But why did they come armed in the manner I see they are? for the purpose of
                  insulting, perhaps murdering, an innocent victim of too much confidence in your
                  promises?'
               "'Make yourself easy on that head,' replied he, 'they have no intention of
                  murdering you; your death would be a great calamity to us now, and as for their
                  being armed that is no novelty with them, I warrant you. It would have been far
                  more suprising if they had come here without arms. They are here to be witnesses
                  of our bargain, and when they have done this work I will send them about their
                  business; that I will, I assure you. Sign this paper.'
               "I looked it over and found it was a regularly drawn contract, with blanks, which
                  I was now to fill up by giving away the one-half of my income for value received,
                  and that value was to satisfy my curiosity with regard to how I came by that
                  property and to whom I owed my being. Though doubtful and hesitating as to the
                  course which I should adopt, I determined at last to sign, reflecting that the
                  possession of the whole would be of little value to me, or even ten times as much,
                  unless I could obtain the object for which I would sacrifice the whole, and not
                  that only, but life itself!
               "Making, therefore, a virtue of necessity, I seized the pen, and in the presence
                  of the two witnesses above mentioned signed the contract. They, in their turn,
                  signed also, and I was surprised to see the excellent hand in which they wrote, as
                  well as McArdle. At a sign from the latter they immediately afterwards quitted the
                  shieling and we were left alone.
               "'Now,' said McArdle, 'as you have performed your share of the contract, it only
                  remains for me to do mine, which I will execute faithfully, beginning with an
                  occurrence which took place even before you were born.'
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VIII.
               THE SOLUTION.
               SOME twenty-one years ago, or thereabouts, I was living in a wild and lonely part
                  of the west of Ireland, close to the shore. It was on the coast of Galway. I
                  gained a scanty livelihood by fishing, in which I was assisted by my only
                  companion and friend, a young woman to whom a kindred disposition and feeling had
                  united me, without the aid of any legal or religious tie to bless our bridal.
                  Though of a dauntless spirit and affectionate character, she was the most mild and
                  amiable being that man was ever blessed with as a ministering angel. No two could
                  be more happy than we were in each other's affections. We had lived together
                  nearly a year when I began to perceive that I should very soon have a stranger to
                  provide for, which gave me at first some little uneasiness, as hitherto our united
                  exertions had barely enabled us to gain a scanty subsistence, and how much more
                  must we be pressed now, when I, by my single exertions, must provide for an
                  increased family, whose powers of assisting me would be diminished by the very
                  means that increased their number!
               "One day in September, when I was sitting in my cabin, perplexed by these
                  harassing cares, and looking out on the troubled oeean, which was lashed to fury
                  by the raging storm, I thought I saw, on the farthest verge of the horizon,
                  something like a sail. At first this made little impression on my mind, as it was
                  no uncommon occurrence; but when it approached somewhat nearer I could perceive
                  very distinctly that the vessel was disabled by the storm, and that it was rapidly
                  drifting towards the dangerous coast, seemingly without any exertions of the
                  unfortunate mariners being able to arrest their progress to inevitable
                  destruction. By-and-by I could discern the people on board, and the attitudes of
                  despair, supplication and frenzy into which they were thrown, according as they
                  were severally affected by the prospect that awaited them. They all, however,
                  seemed to give themselves up for lost. My first emotion was that of pity and
                  horror—the next of self-interest, for in the general wreck of the fortunes of
                  others I might gain some alleviation of my own poverty and anticipated distress.
                  This thought aroused me. My companion was in the last stage of pregnancy, and we
                  expected every moment that she would be seized with the pains of childbirth. She
                  was therefore unable to accompany me in the effort which I told her I was about to
                  make to assist the unfortunate beings in danger, and to recover for our own and
                  their use some of those precious things which no doubt they carried with them, but
                  which the sea was about to swallow up in its unsatiable jaws.
               "I hastened down to the beach. It was fearful to gaze on the sea in its fury! How
                  much more so to look upon a number of our fellow beings about to be swallowed up
                  in its dark and roaring gulf! The spray was driven around me, and for miles over
                  the country, like a fall of snow. The foundations of the rocks trembled to their
                  center with the mighty shock of the billows. The wind howled like the roar of ten
                  thousand wild bulls in all their fury, and the tops of the mighty waves seemed to
                  kick and lash the indignant and lowering sky in the distance! In fact, a dense
                  spray mingled the sea and the clouds together, and a seething and hissing sound
                  like a boiling cauldron or the violent rushing of steam from an engine pipe burst
                  forth from all sides. At the distance of about half a mile from the shore appeared
                  the dark outline of the vessel's hull. No
                  sail or mast was any longer visible, all having been carried away by a heavy sea.
                  Sometimes it rose to the surface of a wave, and hung there for a moment, as if
                  suspended between heaven and earth, with nothing to support it but a thin pillar
                  or ridge of foam; again it sank in the trough of the sea, as if never to rise! and
                  again, when I thought I should never behold it except as a shattered and dispersed
                  wreck, it burst upon my sight within a hundred yards distance, and then I could
                  distinctly hear the agonizing cries of despair from the wretched creatures on
                  board! Down she sank into the abyss once more; and being now upon the hidden rocks
                  near the shore, she suddenly struck, as I expected she would, and the next moment
                  she was dashed into a thousand pieces! for nothing that could be constructed by
                  the ingenuity and powers of man, however strong and massive, could have resisted
                  the shock of the contending elements and the rocks at that moment! I saw several
                  of the crew buried in the gulf at that instant, never to rise again with life!
                  indeed the greater part perished in this manner; and when I looked towards the
                  spot where the vessel had disappeared, I thought at first that every soul must
                  have perished! The feeling of sympathy, which actuated me while they were yet in
                  danger, now gave place to that of avarice, which was, after all, the more
                  predominant as I saw casks, and chests, and apparel heaved by the billows towards
                  the shore, and some of these I hoped to secure for my own use.
               "I had already landed one or two small casks containing spirits, as I supposed,
                  and was just stretching out my hands to seize a casket, which I also succeeded in
                  bringing to shore, when I observed a plank close at hand, which I did not notice
                  before because I was so intent on the plunder, with two human beings seemingly
                  lashed to it with cords, but to all appearance quite dead! As it came close to my
                  hand I could not resist the impulse of landing them on the dry part of the beach,
                  though I had no sooner done so than I felt angry with myself for interrupting my
                  labor, as several valuable articles had been dashed to pieces on the rocks in the
                  mean time. However, I now redoubled my efforts, to make up for lost time, and
                  succeeded in saving a great many boxes and valuables from the destruction which
                  must have happened to them if permitted to be dashed against the rocks. Everything
                  else disappeared!
               "As I was busily engaged in dragging several of the articles farther up from the
                  spray, I came in contact with the bodies that were lashed to the plank; and now,
                  having more leisure to examine them closely, I was struck with the richness and
                  splendor of their apparel, and the noble appearance which they exhibited. I
                  approached more closely, and to my astonishment—I may add my utter
                  disappointment—I perceived that the gentleman was not dead, but warm and breathing
                  as if in a soft slumber! 'Heavens!' I exclaimed to myself, 'this will never do! My
                  toil, my labor and my exertions will all go for nothing, and my hopes and
                  prospects for the future are utterly blasted, if this man should recover! He is
                  the owner of all this property, doubtless, and he will claim it of the
                  authorities; and I, for all my labor and pains, shall be loudly praised but
                  slightly rewarded! No, no; it will never do for him to recover! and I see there is
                  no time to be lost! No one will suspect other than that he met with his death like
                  the others, either from the sea or from the rocks; there is therefore no danger
                  in"—
               "Good Heavens! Monster!" interrupted I, "surely you did not, you could not, murder
                  him!"
               "I had a great temptation," replied McArdle, calmly, "and I could not resist it. I
                  seized a stone that was lying on the beach, approached him gently, and struck him
                  one blow on the crown of the head! His limbs quivered only for an instant, and he
                  was no more!'
               "Cruel, heartless murderer! why do I listen to this and not take vengeance?"
               "I little fear you, replied be, with a malignant grin, for having such a tale to
                  unfold, I have taken good care to tell it in a place where your most violent
                     rage (and it has not yet come to the
                  height) will be utterly impotent; so you may as well make yourself as easy as
                  possible, or if you think proper to be sentimental, I can easily withhold the
                  remainder, should you suppose you have heard enough already; but I am still
                  willing to perform my contract to the letter, if you conduct yourself
                  properly.
               "You may imagine, my dearest Charlotte, what torture I endured while compelled to
                  listen to this monster! but my curiosity overcame my disgust and loathing, and I
                  determined to restrain the outward expression of my feelings, however violent, at
                  least till I should hear the end, whatever that might be; I therefore promised him
                  to listen without interruption, and with much difficulty I persuaded him to go on,
                  which he did in the following terms:
               "I next proceeded to examine the lady, and to my horror found that she, too, was
                  alive! but breathing so low and softly that at first sight any one would think her
                  dead. Without hesitating a moment I took up the stone approached her, and—
               "Murdered her, too! I exclaimed, with a shudder of horror, quite unable to
                  suppress my feelings.
               "You had better keep your promise, said McArdle, else I shall think myself
                  absolved from all obligation. No, I did not murder her! for at the moment I had
                  drawn back my hand for the purpose of inflicting the fatal blow, she opened her
                  eyes and smiled unconsciously upon me, more like a being of another world than an
                  inhabitant of this. My arm was paralyzed! the instrument of destruction fell from
                  my grasp, and I felt it impossible to do the deed. Besides this, she seemed far
                  advanced in pregnancy, and that circumstance, joined to the other cause, made me
                  feel for her situation and spare her life. I even felt a pang of remorse for
                  having deprived her of so noble-looking a companion as lay stretched in death by
                  her side, for he was doubtless as dear to her as life itself, and he seemed worthy
                  of her love. But it was no time then for the indulgence of vain regrets. There was
                  much to be done; night was approaching, and there was no time to be lost. Having
                  therefore determined to spare the lady, or rather being unable to inflict the
                  fatal blow, I made a merit of necessity, and took every means to insure her
                  gratitude and the approbation of my own mistress, who would have never forgiven me
                  had she known the deed of which I was guilty. I therefore took my knife, cut the
                  lashings from the plank, carried the lady in my arms to my cabin, and confided her
                  to the care and attentions of Norah (such was the name of my mistress), who used
                  every exertion to restore her by cordials and other means usually resorted to on
                  such occasions, while I hastened to secure and conceal as much of the wreck as was
                  possible before any of my neighbors should come to share it with me. I was indeed
                  surprised that no one had made his appearance that afternoon or evening on that
                  part of the coast; but this was fully accounted for by the news which I heard on
                  the following day, of the total wreck of a large vessel at some five miles further
                  down the shore, which had attracted and held the attention of all the wreckers in
                  that neighborhood, for no one had noticed my vessel or knew anything at all of the
                  transaction till all my plunder was secured.
               "When this was done I returned weary to the cabin, but loaded with several
                  luxuries and articles of immediate use, which I knew would be highly agreeable to
                  Norah in any circumstances, but particularly acceptable in her present condition,
                  and still more so as she had to exercise her hospitality towards a stranger
                  evidently of high rank and great distinction; but when I entered the cottage a
                  scene no less surprising than the other remarkable scenes of that eventful day and
                  night awaited me. I heard the cries of a new-born infant on entering the door, and
                  when I advanced still further I saw the strange lady stretched out in the bed,
                  apparently dead, and my wife sitting beside her, crying and holding in her arms an
                  infant which she seemed scarcely able to support, for she was pale and exhausted.
                  On the other side of the bed lay another newly born infant, quite dead, and it naturally struck me that
                  the lady had borne twins, one of which came still-born into the world; but on
                  inquiring of Norah, she had sufficient strength to give me the following
                  account:
               "'You had not been gone out more than an hour,' said she, 'when the lady recovered
                  her strength and color far beyond anything I had expected; but just at the moment
                  she seemed most blooming and well she was seized with labor pains, and as I happen
                  to know something of nursing, from having lived in the service of a famous midwife
                  and occasionally practiced in this wild neighborhood, I knew how to manage the
                  birth. It was quite fair, however, and there was not much difficulty; but I found
                  that the child was unfortunately stillborn.'
               "'What!' I interrupted McArdle, 'do you mean to say that child was stillborn, and
                  that I am not the son of that strange lady?'
               "'I am merely telling you what Norah told me,' continued he, with a sneer, 'but
                  patience, boy, and you will hear all soon enough.'
               "I could do nothing but listen.
               "'Well,' continued Norah, 'the lady was quite unconscious of what had occurred and
                  has remained in a state of stupor ever since, which I do not well understand, as I
                  have never seen a case like it before; perhaps it is in consequence of what she
                  suffered from the wreck. But however that may be no sooner was she delivered than
                  I felt myself seized with the most violent pangs, which I immediately recognized
                  to be similar to those from which the lady had only been freed by the stillbirth
                  before you, and I scarcely knew what to do. You were gone out and I had no
                  messenger to send for assistance. However, I took courage from the knowledge that
                  unsophisticated and unpampered nature is always more efficacious under these
                  circumstances than the most consummate art, and that kind and merciful Heaven
                  would not withhold its support from God's creatures in their emergency. I suffered
                  much for a time, but nature, Heaven assisting, soon triumphed, and behold the
                  healthy boy with which I have the happiness to present you! All is well as far as
                  I am concerned, but your attention must be devoted instantly to this lady, lest
                  she perish from exhaustion and neglect.'
               "Having thus spoken," said McArdle, "she gave me directions how to make a cordial
                  for the patient, which would refresh and cheer, without stimulating her over much,
                  and I had the satisfaction to perceive that she began rapidly to regain her
                  strength on its being administered to her in small quantities. At length she fell
                  asleep, and Norah prognosticated favorable symptoms when she should awaken. She
                  hoped she should then be able to impart to her what had occurred without any
                  danger to her nerves from the shock, and seemed highly delighted at the turn
                  affairs were now likely to take from such unfavorable beginnings.
               "It was now that a strange idea took possession of my mind. It was to make a
                  gentleman of my son by substituting him as the offspring of the lady instead of
                  the stillboy to which she had just given birth, which latter would be acknowledged
                  as the child of my wife. Nothing could be more easy than this if Norah would
                  consent; but that was the difficulty. I feared she would not be willing to resign
                  her own boy to a stranger, but when I pointed out the advantages that would accrue
                  both to him and to ourselves from the fortunate circumstance, and the likelihood
                  that she would be chosen as his nurse and taken into the service of the lady to
                  watch over and take care of her own son, who would be brought up in wealth and
                  luxury, and would doubtless be the means of raising his humble parents at least
                  above the necessity of gaining a scanty and precarious livelihood by the hard and
                  dangerous life to which they were now exposed; and when I added the joy it would
                  give the lady, whose only and chief desire and longing might be to have an heir to
                  her great estates, and that Providence would send us perhaps more children than we
                  could provide for, because we were poor,
                  she at last, with reluctance, consented, more however because she saw me bent on
                  it than from any inclination she had to comply, because she had a conscience and
                  did not like to do what was an evident wrong to another, though she was not so
                  scrupulous in doing what she knew to be morally wrong, if that wrong did not
                  affect others than herself. Such is the inconsistency to be met with in the
                  characters of individuals.
               "It was then agreed that this exchange should be made; and accordingly in the
                  morning, when the lady awoke to consciousness, as Norah had predicted, I imparted
                  to her the occurrences of yesterday at the wish of the latter, at the same time
                  placing our own living child in her arms instead of the dead one, which she
                  received with a seeming mixture of fondness and sorrow, allowing it to nestle in
                  her bosom and presenting to its lips the first nourishment which nature prepares
                  for the young of our species. The child sucked the breast eagerly and soon fell
                  asleep in her arms; and thus a few days passed by without any particular
                  occurrence. A coffin was procured and the stillborn child was buried without any
                  ceremony at the lower end of a triangular field, and there is a large, rude stone,
                  without any epitaph, which marks the spot where the infant reposes in peace."
               "'Happy infant!' I exclaimed, 'to have escaped from the wickedness of this world
                  before knowing it, and from the indignities and sorrows which have strown my path
                  and to which I must soon fall a wretched victim! I see what you mean to
                  insinuate,' I added, 'that I am your son! but you will not succeed in your
                  diabolical machinations, for he that could commit murder for gain would not stop
                  at telling a lie or an infinity of lies for the same selfish purpose, or if he
                  could make it answer his own ends. No! no! you will never persuade me of that! So
                  your wretched malignity is entirely abortive in its aim. But I have made up my
                  mind and can now endure to hear you to the end; proceed.'
               "And if you do," he replied, "I will convince you that you and that child are
                  identical. In the course of a week my Norah was able to get out of bed and wait
                  upon the strange lady, who by this time began to recover something of her
                  self-possession and memory. Then it was that Norah told her of the pretended fate
                  of our boy and congratulated her on her good fortune in bringing a live child into
                  the world under such extraordinary circumstances."
               "'Alas!' said the lady, who did not seem more than seventeen years of age and was
                  most beautiful, 'what you would have esteemed a happiness is to me a misery!'
               "While she spoke the tears ran down her cheeks like rain; but recovering herself a
                  little and gazing upon Norah with a confiding look, she said:
               "'You are good and kind; your husband saved my life and you have preserved it; but
                  had it pleased Heaven, which however has otherwise ordained, how I should have
                  preferred to have died in the arms of my beloved, my adored Henry! Then we should
                  all have been together! But you have done all for the best, and therefore no less
                  gratitude is due to you for your kindness and exertion. Why then should I withhold
                  my confidence from you? You are deserving of it, and it may perhaps ease my mind
                  and bring me some consolation if I unburden it to some one who will sympathize
                  with me. I wish too to speak of one who can never be obliterated from my thoughts.
                  But now he is no more and I am left alone and desolate! The world is a wilderness
                  without him and I cannot endure the light of Heaven when it no longer presents his
                  noble features to my view. I feel that but for this innocent babe I must follow
                  him to the tomb!'
               "Norah entreated her to compose herself and not yet enter upon a subject which
                  would be too much for her to bear in her present weak condition; but she persisted
                  in her intention of telling her the following particulars:"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IX.
               THE MOTHER'S STORY.
               I AM a native of France (she said) and the only daughter of a nobleman of large
                  property in one of the interior provinces, which it is not necessary to mention by
                  name. My mother died when I was a child, and I was left to the sole management of
                  an austere father and a gouvernante, who was at first devoted to his interests,
                  but whom I gained over to my own in the course of time by large bribes and large
                  promises. I was loved at the age of sixteen by a gentleman in the neighborhood,
                  one of the most noble and disinterested beings that ever bore the name of man. Our
                  love was in secret, for it would have as soon consented to my death as our union.
                  This did not arise from any inequality in our condition, but from a long cherished
                  feud that existed between the two families. We met and were privately united by a
                  priest under the sanction of the most solemn vows, which were as good and as firm
                  in the sight of Heaven and in law as the most open marriage at the altar. My
                  gouvernante was alone privy to our loves. My Henri would have openly avowed our
                  union to the world and defied the consequences; but knowing well that it would be
                  his inevitable destruction I was determined to sacrifice honor, fame, and life
                  itself, rather than I should run the slightest risk of injuring him, perhaps of
                  losing him forever. It was in vain he entreated me on his bended knees to be
                  permitted to call me openly by the endearing name of wife. I would not hear of it;
                  but expressed my readiness to yield him everything else. The temptation was too
                  great, and in a short, too short a time alas! I found that I must become a
                  mother!
               "In the mean time my father, as a matter of course with us, had provided a husband
                  for me of his own choosing, and it would have been utterly vain to offer any
                  resistance to his will. I was now in a state bordering on distraction, when a
                  stratagem occurred to my mind which would give me a chance of avoiding disgrace,
                  by at least putting off my marriage to another time. It was the plea of bad
                  health. In this scheme my governess and Henri joined, and all we wanted now was a
                  medical man to recommend a change of air, particularly to the sea shore, for my
                  recovery, and that without delay. I knew well that it would be utterly impossible
                  for my father to accompany me at that time, as he had a most important business
                  which would keep him at home at least for six months longer. But my health would
                  admit of no delay. The physician was then procured to give the recommendation, and
                  my governess, in whom my father placed the greatest confidence, was entrusted
                  exclusively with the charge of me. We came to Havre, where, according to the
                  recommendation of the same medical gentleman, frequent sailing in a boat or yacht
                  was particularly recommended as a powerful restorative of health in my peculiar
                  circumstances. Henri took good care to be at the same place, but never took the
                  slightest notice of us when anyone was present, but was very assiduous in his
                  visits at all times when he could be so prudently. He had a beautiful, large
                  yacht—the same which was wrecked on your coast—in which we were in the habit of
                  making frequent excursions to various parts of the coast, where we often spent two
                  or three weeks, and then returned, so that little notice was taken of the
                  circumstance, as he always passed for my brother wherever we were seen together.
                  At last the time came when it was necessary for me to leave Havre, as the acquaintances we sometimes met there
                  could not fail to observe the change which I had so suddenly undergone in person
                  and appearance; and my beloved Henri thought the best place for me to retire to
                  for my accouchement would be some wild, unfrequented port on the western coast of
                  Ireland. We accordingly made everything ready and embarked before day on the
                  morning of the 2d instant, and made all sail for this coast, when, just as we were
                  in sight, the storm began to rage which has proved so fatal to all but her who has
                  had the misfortune to survive and to this hapless infant! The sailors all declared
                  they had never witnessed so furious a gale, and in less than two hours after its
                  commencement they lost all control over the vessel and gave themselves up to
                  despair. Indeed it appears that no exertion could have saved the vessel. When this
                  news came to my ears I was not terrified, but content to die with him for whom
                  alone I could live. We both expressed our mutual joy at a circumstance which
                  tended to prove the sincerity of our love, and clinging together to the last, and
                  even lashing ourselves together with cords, we awaited with resignation the shock
                  that was to send us together to a watery grave! At length it came with all its
                  fury! It was indeed tremendous! My senses were taken away without pain! I fell
                  asleep, as I hoped forever, in the arms of my love! but oh! what pangs have I
                  endured to awake and find I am left alone with this child of supposed sin as the
                  world's charity will name it!
               "What course to pursue, I know not. The intention of my lover was to have made a
                  handsome provision for the child and leave it to be properly educated in this
                  country, under the guardianship of some one in whom we could confide. And for that
                  purpose he had deeds of settlement drawn in its favor upon his own estate, which
                  he intended to place in the hands of some respectable lawyer here, who would act
                  also as guardian, without however knowing anything whatever of his charge. But
                  alas! these deeds must have been swallowed lowed up with all our other effects
                  when the yacht was dashed to pieces on your coast, and I am utterly at a loss how
                  to provide for my poor unfortunate child. I cannot take it back with me, and I am
                  entirely dependent on my father for everything I have or may possess, and even
                  should I be able to return home uninjured in character and reputation, to perform
                  his will, by sacrificing my feelings to worldly interest, I should still, I fear,
                  be unable to escape the vigilance of a jealous, perhaps tyrannical husband, in my
                  attempts to devote a portion of his income to the use of my child."
               "'Were the deeds you mention contained in a small casket?' eagerly inquired
                  Norah.
               "'Yes, yes! do you know anything of it? It contained besides a quantity of gold;
                  but that is of little importance compared with the papers.'
               "'My husband,' said Norah, 'saved a small casket from the wreck. He took out the
                  gold and threw the casket into the sea.'
               "'And the papers?'
               "'I know not what he has done with them, for as they were written in a foreign
                  language, we knew not what they might contain. They were lying about the room for
                  nearly a week, but lately they have disappeared altogether, and I know not what
                  has become of them, but I fear they are destroyed.'
               "'Alas! then my misfortunes are at their height, and the hopes you have just
                  raised are blasted forever!'
               "At this moment I entered the cabin, (continued McArdle) and on learning the
                  nature of the papers in question I went to a hole in the wall that was stopped up
                  with a brick, which having removed, I put in my hand and drew out a scroll of
                  parchment; for on reflection I thought the papers I found in the casket might be
                  of service to me one day or other, and therefore I preserved them, contrary to my
                  first impulse, which certainly was to burn them. I presented the scroll to the
                  lady, who opened and examined it with the greatest est eagerness. I watched her countenance. On the
                  first glance at the papers it beamed with joy and hope.
               "'All may be well yet!' she exclaimed. 'These are the papers which I feared were
                  lost, and which secure an honorable independence to my otherwise unfortunate
                  child. But it is one consolation to a mother to reflect that her offspring can
                  never want the necessaries of life, or can never be exposed to the cruel charities
                  of the world, though he be rendered unhappy in never being destined to know his
                  parents or feel what it is to be the object of a mother's love.' She then remained
                  silent for a minute or two, as if in deep thought, when all at once her
                  countenance assumed a look of decision, as if she had arrived at a result which
                  she was determined to act on, and in a firm voice she said: 'I see my way clearly
                  now! I know how I shall act. I shall endeavor to find an honest and respectable
                  lawyer of this neighborhood, to whom I shall intrust the entire management of my
                  son, according to the original design of his deceased father; but he must know
                  nothing whatever of the relation in which he stands to me. You,' she said,
                  addressing herself to Norah, 'shall be his nurse and kind foster-mother while you
                  live, with a suitable annuity; and you,' she said to me, 'shall be his attendant
                  with a like provision. I shall direct the lawyer that you shall both be attached
                  to him permanently, and I shall give him certain rules with regard to his
                  education, which must be attended to punctually, or if he should fail to do so you
                  must write to me instantly, and I will have him withdrawn from his guardianship
                  altogether, for you shall have a copy of the same rules; on the other hand, though
                  I do not mistrust either of you, yet, for my own satisfaction as well as yours, I
                  must direct the lawyer to give my agent a full account of your behavior towards
                  the boy from time to time, so that you will be a mutual check on each other; and
                  if I should hear any complaints substantiated against you, I must dismiss you from
                  your employment, notwithstanding all I owe you; but as this will depend entirely
                  on yourselves, there is not, I hope, much danger of such an occurrence ever
                  happening. By these deeds a suitable allowance is made for my child till he is
                  twenty-one, and then, if his father should die without other children, which you
                  know has alas! already happened, then the whole of his property reverts to him,
                  for he had the power so to dispose of it, and my son will be at full liberty to
                  act for himself. There is one thing, however, to which I must bind you by the
                  solemn obligation of an oath, and that is that you will never, on any account,
                  till you shall receive my permission, divulge, either to himself or any other
                  person, the slightest hint concerning his birth. He must pass for an orphan in the
                  eyes of the world—one whose parents both died when he was young, and left him well
                  off. But as it will be impossible when he grows up to impose this story on his own
                  mind, as you cannot introduce him to any respectable relations or connections,
                  which would in this event be the case, he must be content to know merely that a
                  mystery hangs over his birth, which may one day or other be cleared up to his
                  credit and advantage. We must trust to the natural pride of the human heart for
                  the result. This mystery is absolutely necessary when we reflect on the ardor and
                  enterprise of youth; for if you only hinted the possible country of his parents,
                  he would leave no land unexplored, nothing untried, to satisfy his doubts on a
                  point which all are so anxious to know—the nation of their own origin, and the
                  history of their birth! and hence, though the particular province in which I live,
                  and even my name and every other clue that might lead to a discovery, shall be
                  carefully concealed from you and every one else for the present, yet a chain of
                  circumstances might arise from any rash information given to him which might lead
                  to inquiry and my utter ruin and disgrace! Are you willing to swear? The
                  obligation will only be binding till he has attained the age of twenty-one, or
                  till you have received my permission, for then, if it is properly imparted to him,
                  his own discretion will dictate the line of conduct he ought to pursue, and
                  circumstances by that time may render an
                  open acknowledgment of his birth and a recognition of his claims highly
                  probable.'
               "We both willingly swore to the secrecy required of us, more particularly as it
                  was so much for our own interests to avoid all inquiry on the subject, and when we
                  had done so the lady asked me if I knew of any lawyer in the county who had the
                  reputation of being honest and humane, which were considered so rare in the
                  profession, but which at the same time were essential to success in that as in all
                  other callings of life.
               "I replied that I knew a man by repute who, if he could be pervailed upon to
                  undertake the charge, would answer her purpose admirably, but that he lived at a
                  considerable distance from us, in the county town.
               "She inquired how far that might be off, and I said I thought about twenty miles,
                  but I was not quite certain as to distances, for they were never accurately
                  measured nor marked, but as near as I could guess from having often traversed the
                  ground with my fish, that was about the distance. 'But,' I said, 'that does not
                  matter much; I will go to Galway myself and bring the lawyer here to you, which
                  will save you much trouble and inconvenience.'
               "'By no means,' she replied; 'that would betray all! No, no; I must wait till I am
                  perfectly recovered, and then go myself and see him personally. I can then tell
                  him that having heard a high character of his honor and integrity, I had come to
                  place under his care the orphan child of a deceased sister, whose dying wish it
                  was that he should be carefully brought up in Ireland, under the guardianship of
                  such a man as he was reputed to be; and then I will hand him the deeds and the
                  power to receive certain moneys, which I shall take good care to have deposited
                  with proper securities to his account, by the agent of his deceased father. At the
                  same time I shall have the agreement drawn up with regard to you both; and having
                  settled everything thus in the most satisfactory manner, I will depart for my
                  native land, and there relate to my father a story of romance, in order to account
                  for the loss of my nurse, and to relate the narrow escape from destruction which I
                  had encountered, and the loss of all our crew. I will tell him that, according to
                  the recommendation of my doctor, we were sailing for pleasure in a yacht; that we
                  were driven by a violent storm on the coast of Ireland, where we were wrecked, and
                  every soul perished but myself, and how I escaped through the heroic conduct of a
                  poor fisherman, who at the risk of his own life succeeded in saving mine. In this
                  way I hope to lull all suspicions, and to become even dearer to my parent than
                  before, on account of the imminent danger I had just escaped; and if I can ever
                  arrange it so as to return, you may depend upon it that I will take the earliest
                  opportunity of visiting you, my good friends, and seeing again this my beloved
                  child, when I trust I shall have no reason to complain of the treatment it will
                  have received at your hands.'
               "In about a month after this time she was sufficiently recovered to undertake the
                  proposed journey, and having taken leave of Norah, and tenderly embraced what she
                  thought her own son, she accompanied me to Galway, where, after some difficulties
                  from bad roads, we at length arrived. We sought out the dwelling of the lawyer,
                  where the lady arranged everything to her own satisfaction and that of all
                  concerned; and having done so she embarked for France in a vessel then in the bay,
                  which was bound for Nantes; and I returned to my wife and child, rejoiced in the
                  success of our scheme and the new and easy mode of life it had insured to us.
               "It was arranged that Norah and I should, as soon as possible, remove to the house
                  of your guardian. It was situated at some distance from the city, in a beautiful
                  rural retreat. The inmates were only the lawyer and his wife, who were
                  considerably beyond middle age, and a few domestics, of whom Norah and I were the
                  chief, and here the time passed as pleasantly as we could desire. You grew up very
                  rapidly, and showed every promise of vigor and manly beauty, and both your mother
                  and I took a just pride in such a son, though we could not acknowledge you as our
                  own."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER X.
               THE PARTING.
               WE had continued in this tranquil state (continued McArdle) for nearly four years,
                  when I one day received a letter dated from Cork, directing me to proceed directly
                  with Norah and the child to that city. It was from the strange lady. Your guardian
                  received another at the same time, from the same person, making a similar request,
                  and the following morning found us on the road. We took up our abode in the
                  suburbs of the town, and there we were visited by your supposed mother on the very
                  evening of our arrival, and her joy and gratitude were unbounded when she clasped
                  you in her arms, and surveyed with a mother's pride your rosy cheeks and buoyant,
                  sturdy limbs. She was still more delighted when you responded to her tenderness,
                  and wept when we tore you from her embrace. This she attributed to the mysterious
                  sympathy of nature, and certainly nothing could be more like it!
               "She now told us that her story had succeeded even beyond her hopes with her
                  father, who received her with open arms, as one returned from the jaws of death.
                  That some inquiry was set on foot by the extraordinary coincidence of her lover
                  having perished about the same time, but that was easily quieted by the suggestion
                  of the fact that he was continually at sea, that he no doubt happened to be out at
                  the same time, when not only his, but many other vessels perished without a soul
                  having survived to give an account of the manner or place of their destruction,
                  and as no one survived from his vessel but herself, she might give just what
                  account she pleased, without any danger of contradiction.
               "She then proceeded to state that in due time she was obliged to redeem her
                  promise to her father by giving her hand to the man whom he had chosen for her
                  husband, and that they had since lived together as comfortably as most people do
                  who marry without any choice of their own, or the slightest affection for the
                  individual forced on them; that her husband, though inclined to be jealous, was
                  upon the whole, good natured enough, and would willingly gratify her in every
                  thing that did not trench on his own selfish enjoyments; that they had just
                  arrived in Ireland on a tour to which she had urged him, in the hope of seeing
                  again her beloved boy, whom she had longed to behold once more, and that they were
                  likely to remain in the country for some time; but that the utmost caution must be
                  observed lest he should find she had any acquaintance there. She must visit us by
                  stealth, she said, and we must on no account breathe a syllable of the matter, or
                  of inquiry or curiosity to any one living!
               "During her stay, which she contrived to prolong to nearly three years, she made
                  frequent visits to our cottage, at every opportunity, and gave many instructions
                  about our future proceedings, as well as made numerous inquiries about the past;
                  particularly how your guardian behaved to us, and whether we were happy in his
                  house. I had no particular complaint to make, but, at the same time, I suggested
                  that I thought it better if there was no communication at all permitted between
                  you and the guardian personally, but only through some third person; alleging as a
                  reason that there would be less danger of a discovery, but having my own
                  particular views, as you shall see presently. I urged my arguments so strongly
                  that she soon came into my views on the subject, and finally determined that
                  matters should be so arranged. 'But,'
                  said she, 'do you not fear that the old gentleman will be offended at this
                  proceeding?"
               "Not in the least," I answered, "for he has so much to think of besides that he
                  will not have time even to reflect on the matter at all; besides he does not like
                  too much trouble in things which are not exclusively professional; and therefore
                  it is my firm belief that he would rather rejoice to be rid of us altogether, if
                  he could be so honorably. All you have to do, therefore, is to hint your wish to
                  that effect, under a pretext that you think the boy ought to have a change of air
                  for his health, and he is sure to comply without a murmur. Besides, too, he will
                  still have the direction of affairs as before, till you shall think fit to
                  transfer it to other hands, which you may find it expedient to do in the course of
                  time; for, added I, when the boy grows up, he will begin to inquire of his
                  guardian about his friends and connections, and it will seem rather odd that the
                  latter will be able to give him no information on the subject; and this will make
                  him reflect on the matter and perhaps render him suspicious and inconveniently
                  inquisitive of me and others."
               "That is very true," she replied, "and the bare possibility of such an occurrence
                  must be guarded against with all possible care! He must have no communication
                  whatever with his guardian, and all things must be transacted through yourself,
                  McArdle, for I know you to be trustworthy, and I will take the necessary steps in
                  order to effect this purpose, which she did accordingly, and I have ever since
                  been the only means through which you have received every blessing you have
                  hitherto or do now enjoy!
               "At length the time came when urgent business compelled her husband to return to
                  his native France, and she accompanied him. The attempts were vain to paint the
                  scene of parting from you, and you seemed little less affected than she; but while
                  you were permitted to give full vent to your sorrows in tears, she was obliged to
                  stifle hers and put on gay smiles, lest she should betray the secret of her heart.
                  She departed, and from that day to this I have only heard from her twice.
               "And what might be the nature of the communication?" I inquired.
               "That I will tell, perhaps, at another time; at present it is not relevant to our
                  object, and we must not waste the little time that remains in vain discourse."
               "Well, proceed with your story."
               "It is already told! you must know what has occurred since you were seven years
                  old."
               "And do you mean to palm this story on me for the truth?" I exclaimed. Do you
                  think I am silly enough to believe myself the son of a vile and base murderer like
                  you, on no other authority than your own base lying assertion? I did not think you
                  quite so foolish as that," I said, calmly, "whatever credit I may have given you
                  for dishonesty and every thing that is knavish and wicked! If what you assert is
                  true, you ought at least to have preserved some authentic proofs from better
                  authorities than yourself, if that kind and honest woman whom you mention as my
                  mother (and I should not be ashamed to acknowledge such a mother!) had only
                  uttered in my hearing one syllable in confirmation of what you assert, I could not
                  for a moment have withheld my belief; but on the contrary, when I have spoken to
                  her on the subject, she entreated me to make myself quite easy on that head, as
                  the whole mystery would yet be cleared up to my entire satisfaction, and she must
                  have known my abhorrence even of your sight or presence too well to suppose it
                  would be to my entire satisfaction to hear that I was connected with you, even by
                  the most distant tie of relationship, much less that of father! Go and impose your
                  fabrications on silly children, but do not attempt any of your practical jokes
                  upon me, for you are quite mistaken if you imagine you will succeed."
               "Well, now it happens that I can convince you by a document the most indisputable
                  and the most satisfactory factory that
                  could be presented to the senses or judgment of a rational being, though such
                  proof ought not to be necessary for a person of your penetration and good sense,
                  if you reflected a moment on the past and the conduct of that woman whose truth
                  you so justly extol towards you from your earliest recollection. Could any mother
                  have loved you more or tended you with more affectionate and enduring solicitude?
                  Did she not at all times and in all places display those feelings towards you
                  which none but mothers possess? Did she not cling to you with a mother's grasp
                  wherever you went, and did she not watch over your sick couch and your sleeping
                  pillow with the watchfulness and devotion that characterize a mother's love? Oh!
                  Ungrateful youth! not to perceive the true relation you stood in towards her even
                  from the dictates of nature, without having it forced on your reluctant and
                  mistrustful reason! But you know her handwriting?"
               "As well as I do my own," I replied,
               "And you would believe anything she would assert, you say?"
               "As firmly as the gospel of truth," I added.
               "Well examine that," at the same time handing me a folded paper which he took out
                  of his breast pocket, "whose signature is that attached?"
               "That is certainly the signature of Norah, my dear departed nurse."
               "Mother! you should say," exclaimed he in a voice harsh and gruff as the distant
                  bellowing of thunder. "Read the whole document."
               "I immediately glanced over its contents and was struck with horror and conviction
                  on its perusal. It ran as follows:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "I, Norah Connor, being, as I believe, on my deathbed, and expecting
                              soon to render my soul to God, who gave it, and feeling sorrow and
                              compunction for my sins in general, which are grievous and burdensome
                              to my soul, do now, before God and in the presence of his servant and
                              holy minister, my lawful confessor, make humble and penitent
                              confession of one sin in particular, in which I took a part and which
                              now overwhelms my soul with a load of guilt which is intolerable, in
                              the humble hope that the Lord will pardon me, through the intercession
                              of the Holy Virgin and by means of the absolution of his minister and
                              holy servant, this good priest, in whose presence and to whom I
                              confess. It is this: Being led wickedly by my own evil heart and the
                              temptation of the devil, I did, on a certain night some twenty years
                              since, impose my own natural born child, now living under the name of
                              Henri Alexandre Harcourt, entered of the University of Oxford, but now
                              traveling, as I believe, on the continent for his own pleasure, upon a
                              lady, a native of France, who had in the same house and on the same
                              night given birth to a stillborn child, as her own; and appropriated
                              as mine her stillborn child, in order that I might promote the
                              interests of my own son by cheating the lady and inducing her to
                              confer that patrimony or endowment on my son which she would have done
                              on her own had it been born alive and not been changed. For this and
                              my other sins I feel sorry at heart, and may God in his infinite mercy
                              pardon my soul through Jesus Christ. Amen!
                           "In testimony of which I affix hereto my hand and seal.
                           
                              NORAH CONNOR."
                              Witness:
                              PHELIM OMORE, Confessor.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "On glancing over this document, which was, to my mind, an indisputable
                  confirmation of the truth of all McArdle had said, I was struck with utter
                  amazement and horror. I could not utter a syllable. I was riveted to the ground,
                  and for some time was perfectly unconscious of everything passing around me. As I
                  recovered my self-possession a little and reflected on my position and prospects,
                  I was struck with loathing and despair. Life was a burden, and I instantly
                  resolved to release myself from it. Without noticing any object and intent only on the execution of my design, I
                  rushed out of the shed into the open air. The morning was just beginning to dawn,
                  and a calmness and repose reigned over all nature, which was in strange contrast
                  with the storm that raged in my breast. I rushed on, maddened by my thoughts,
                  towards some lonely spot or deep pitfall, where I might bury my miseries and my
                  shame forever in oblivion. I heard that that part of the country abounded with
                  coal-pits that were no longer worked, and into one of these I purposed plunging
                  myself unknown to all the world, that I might never be heard of more. I hastened
                  on, looking on all sides for something of this kind, but could find no traces of
                  them. At length I came to a river which seemed deep and still, and into this I
                  resolved instantly to plunge to avoid the approaching light of heaven, which was
                  now becoming intolerable to my eyes.
               "It was yet obscure twilight and the stars were reflected in the dark mirror of
                  the river, which, with a low murmuring sound, alone announced the proximity of its
                  waters. My mind was made up, and delay was worse than the death which I so eagerly
                  sought for. I hurried towards the bank, and the next moment after I gained it I
                  should have been buried in the depths of its watery current, had I not been
                  arrested on the instant. An iron grasp seized me from behind. I turned round to
                  see who or what it was, when I recognized the face of one of the men who had acted
                  as witnesses in the shed. The other also was standing near. The man who had seized
                  me dragged me with herculean force from the bank of the river, and, without
                  uttering a single syllable, led me back like a child to the shed whence I had
                  come. He went out and left me there alone, at the same time signifying by his look
                  and gesture that it was in vain to attempt self-destruction or flight. I then
                  searched my breast for my pistols; but they were gone—which, from my state of
                  mind, I had not noticed till that moment. I was maddened to fury and would
                  probably have dashed my head against the wall in my frenzy had not McArdle that
                  moment entered the shed. He was calm and undisturbed in countenance, and seemed as
                  if he pitied my condition, which added to my distress and fury. I would have torn
                  him to pieces, but I saw his two gigantic attendants close by ready to interpose
                  and save him. As they were armed at all points I made use of every provoking
                  expression I could think of in hopes that they might be impelled to murder me on
                  the spot. I even, at length, condescended to entreaties that they would put an end
                  to my suffering and my life together; but the fiends only laughed at my prayers
                  and entreaties and scoffed at my sufferings! I confess, my dear Charlotte, that I
                  had forgotten everything else, even yourself, in the humiliation and fury of that
                  moment.
               "At length I became quite exhausted with rage and madness, and sank down on an old
                  bench, when I got some relief to my mind by a flood of tears. Then it was that
                  McArdle mentioned you, my Charlotte. He painted your feelings and suffering if I
                  should persist in my design, and even went so far as to upbraid me with moral
                  cowardice, in seeking to hide my grief and shame from the world, and in
                  sacrificing the happiness of a young and innocent girl who loved me dearer than
                  life itself! Your name recalled me to myself. I acknowledged the justice of the
                  accusatiou, and on the instant determined to make all the amends in my power by
                  recounting to you the whole truth without concealing anything. No sooner was the
                  resolution taken than I determined to put it in execution. I started instantly for
                  the inn whence I had set out the evening before, took the coach there, traveled
                  all the day, and arrived in this neighborhood late in the evening, where I
                  determined to conceal myself till the dead of night, when I hoped to be able to
                  see you alone and unobserved. Yonder wood afforded me a covering whence I could
                  observe all that was passing here without being seen. I waited patiently till
                  eleven o'clock, when all the lights were extinguished but one. I knew well whose that was, and divined the thoughts
                  that kept its owner awake. I stole out from my cover as you have seen and now I
                  sit beside you, the most wretched and unhappy of men! save that my conscience has
                  been lightened and my mind somewhat relieved by imparting the sad story of my life
                  to her who alone deserves to hear it, because she alone feels an interest in the
                  wretch whose painful task it has been to relate it, and be at the same time the
                  melancholy subject of his own melancholy tale!"
               "I am, indeed, surprised and grieved at what you relate," said Charlotte; "but
                  that, however humiliating, should not hurry you to despair. You had no part
                  whatever in the atrocities and villainies of those to whom you have rather the
                  misfortune than the blame of being united by natural ties only, and your mind
                  being pure and your feelings honorable will make full amends in my opinion for the
                  fortuitous and inevitable circumstances of humble birth and depraved parents. To
                  me you must ever be the same, whatever the world may think of you."
               "But your father and brother, what will they think?" asked Harcourt with
                  breathless anxiety.
               "That is the difficulty," she replied. "Their pride of birth is so great and so
                  deep-rooted that it is hard to expect they can consent to my union with the son of
                  an humble and disreputable peasant. But they are just and generous. When they hear
                  your extraordinary story and that till yesterday you were as totally ignorant of
                  your birth and connections as we have been, they may judge more favorably of our
                  union. The strict principles of honor which characterize you, my dearest Harcourt,
                  the tenderness and gentleness of your disposition, your heart that is framed for
                  love and happiness, will and must have their due influence upon them. I will tell
                  your whole story without disguise; I will paint your feelings and your sorrows; I
                  will enumerate your virtues and your worth, and to all this I will add the prayers
                  and entreaties of an only daughter and sister pleading for the man she loves; and
                  if they have not hearts of stone, if they are not callous to every feeling of
                  humanity, if they are not more cruel than the wild savages of the desert, they
                  will yield to my prayers and my tears! Yes, my love, do not be discouraged, we
                  shall yet be happy in each other's love, for though all the world should be
                  against us, Heaven will lend a favorable ear to the prayers and the sighs of the
                  heart-broken and the wretched!"
               "Would you then hope to succeed by telling them all?" replied Harcourt. "Alas! I
                  fear it would be worse than vain, for they will never consent!"
               "What else can I do?" said she. "You would not, surely, wish me to sacrifice my
                  duty to my parent to any other feeling or passion however violent? You are too
                  honorable I know to wish to conceal anything seemingly unfavorable to yourself,
                  which, when known, will only give you an additional claim to the respect and
                  veneration not only of my relations but in the eyes of the world. Men respect the
                  noble simplicity of virtue, however humble, more than the pomp and parade of birth
                  or riches, which are only the gifts of fortune and the mere accessories of
                  circumstances, and I cannot be persuaded that my noble-minded father can be
                  blinded to that which all good men prize by the narrow minded prejudices in which
                  he has been educated. No, no! I will go to him, fall at his feet, and tell him all
                  candidly, as a dutiful child ought to do; and I am sure he will not, he cannot, be
                  unjust or deaf to the voice of reason and of nature!"
               "Well do as you please, but I have a strange presentiment that you will not
                  succeed. Your pure and disinterested heart knows little of the pride of the human
                  soul; but go, try what you can do—and should you fail?"
               "Nay, Harcourt, speak not that discouraging word! It cannot be; it is not
                  possible!"
               "It is not only possible, but highly probable, and to guard against the worst is
                  the prompting of prudence and wisdom. Supposing, then, that you should fail, what
                  am I to hope for?"
               
               "Why, if my father could be so unjust, so ungenerous,—the very thought is too much
                  for me!—then, my love, I am yours at all hazards! Nothing shall separate me from
                  you, save death alone!"
               "Noble and generous girl!" exclaimed Harcourt, "how can I ever pay you the debt of
                  gratitude under which you have placed me?"
               "By continuing faithful and honorable as I have ever found you," she replied.
                  "That will amply repay me for anything I may have to suffer for your sake."
               "But," he replied, "you do not yet know the full extent of what that suffering may
                  be; and I should indeed be unworthy of the confidence you repose in me, and the
                  high opinion which you entertain of my honor, did I suffer you to remain ignorant
                  of the whole. You must know, then, that I am as poor in this world's wealth as I
                  am humble in birth! It is true that if I could reconcile it to my feelings to live
                  under a false name and on the property of others, as I have hitherto unconsciously
                  done, I should be rich; but I cannot do that, and therefore everything which I now
                  possess shall be immediately restored to its proper heirs, and the wretch McArdle
                  will be frustrated in his aims and hopes. He doubtless reckoned on a principle too
                  common in our nature, self-interest in me, for the concealment of my true name and
                  birth, and the preservation of his part of the spoil in mine; but he is mistaken,
                  as he shall soon find to his cost, and the justice he so richly deserves will at
                  length overtake him. I am therefore from this moment penniless, in addition to the
                  other complicated misfortunes that surround me; so that an appeal to your father
                  under such circumstances must be hopeless, and it is almost folly to attempt it.
                  You have shown yourself so generous, so noble, so disinterested in everything
                  hitherto that I should upbraid myself forever afterwards if I permitted you to
                  make the sacrifice to which your love and devotion would urge you. No, no! my
                  beloved Charlotte, it cannot be! Fortune has otherwise decreed, and I must submit
                  to my fate. Ought I to be less self-denying ing, less disinterested, less pure in
                  motive, less heroic in making a self-sacrifice than you? It must not be! for
                  however painful to my feelings to tear myself from your embrace, perhaps forever,
                  stern and inexorable necessity demands that such should be the case. We must part,
                  Charlotte! and let us part with firmness! I could never endure to see you so
                  humiliated, so humbled, as to share my poor fortunes, and the pang which I should
                  suffer from the bare contemplation of it must wound my peace forever. Farewell!
                  and may the Great Ruler of human events and Protector of those who trust in Him
                  watch over and protect you, and so direct all things for your happiness that the
                  bitterness of this moment may soon be lost in the bliss that awaits you!
                  Farewell!"
               "Stay, Harcourt! stop! It must not—it shall not be so! Would you
                  forsake me thus, and forever? And for what? There is nothing in the circumstances
                  to warrant such a step. As for your poverty, I care not for that; I am
                  sufficiently rich for both—independent of the world—which riches I inherit from my
                  dear departed mother, and over which no one can have the least control. Why, then,
                  should we part on that account? It is right, and my heart applauds you for your
                  resolution, to relinquish everything which is not your own and to which you can
                  have no just title. Yes, relinquish, at once and forever, that ill-gotten wealth,
                  and let those who are guilty meet with the punishment they deserve; but do not—oh,
                  do not rob me of that which is dearer to me than all the world's riches—your own
                  presence and your love, which is the treasure wherein my soul delights, and I
                  shall be well content to forego all the rest! for what were the whole earth to me
                  if I were deprived of your love? You must not—you shall not leave
                  me!"
               "To leave you, dearest Charlotte, will indeed, I confess it, be worse than death
                  itself; for, apart from you, I feel it impossible to be happy in this dreary
                  world. But what can be done? Is not death better than dishonor? and who that knows
                  what it is to love as I love could fear
                  death if torn from all his soul loves to dwell upon? Yet I can see no remedy for
                  this. Two insuperable barriers stand in the way: the duty you owe your parents,
                  and that which I owe to you and myself; and let us see whether we can break
                  through these with any rational hope of permanent happiness. If you should commit
                  an act for which your conscience might ever afterwards upbraid you, where are you
                  to look for internal peace, without which there can be no true happiness? and if I
                  should so far forget myself as to urge you to that act, or encourage you in it, I
                  should thereby be not only an accessory to your misery and wretchedness, but also
                  a participator in the crime which caused it. Besides, the respect I feel for your
                  honor and character, and for your position in society, would, apart from any
                  personal regard, prevent me from sanctioning any step that might compromise
                  either. This feeling would at first, had I known my history, have effectually
                  prevented me from seeking your acquaintance, or that of any young lady in similar
                  circumstances; for I am convinced that equality of condition is essential to the
                  happiness of a matrimonial connection. Taking all these things into consideration,
                  I have no doubt you will agree with me in feeling that the path of duty and honor
                  is the only path in which we need expect peace of mind and permanent happiness,
                  and that it will be better for both in the end to submit to the dispensation of a
                  wise and a just and a benevolent Providence. I feel convinced that proper
                  marriages are ordained of God, and are at his wise disposal. Seeing, then, that it
                  is evidently in opposition to his divine will that we should be justly and legally
                  united in the holiest of unions, let us resign ourselves to his decree, and submit
                  to the fiat of his holy will, and time will show us that we have acted
                  properly."
               "You are right! you are right!" exclaimed Charlotte. "Alas! how my passion, but
                  for you, would have hurried me into error, perhaps crime! You are right, and I
                  must yield to your just, your kind, your benevolent counsel; yet is there no hope
                  for the future? Must I resign all thought of you forever? But I deceive myself!
                  Your mind is intent on some dark deed—some scheme against your own life! and I
                  shall soon be left alone in the world to deplore your loss! But I shall not stay
                  behind, but follow soon to the tomb, for this world will indeed be a wilderness
                  when you are gone! Say, dearest Harcourt, is it not your intention to die? Do not,
                  I intreat you, conceal this from me, for now I could look upon death with a
                  friendly eye, as a relief from the cares and miseries of this unhappy world, and I
                  would willingly be your companion to the tomb!"
               "Heaven forbid!" cried Harcourt, "that either of us should harbor such an impious
                  thought! In a paroxysm of frenzy I had indeed the weakness to attempt
                  self-destruction, nor can I say what I might be driven to do again under similar
                  circumstances; but to resolve deliberately to deprive ourselves of the gift of
                  life, which none but God could give us, would be to treat his goodness with scorn
                  and ingratitude. No, no! we must heroically endure whatever we are ordained to
                  suffer in this world without flinching, like soldiers stationed at the post of
                  danger and difficulty, and pray to Heaven for strength to support our trials. How
                  wrong and foolish I felt I was in having made the attempt on my own life I think I
                  have already shown by the manner in which I received a just rebuke, even though
                  coming from the most vile and despicable of men, though it required the magic of
                  your name to save me from myself!"
               "Are you certain that he did mention me by name?" demanded Charlotte, in
                  surprise.
               "He did! and it is now, for the first time, a matter of astonishment to me how he
                  knew anything whatever of you or the relation in which you were likely to stand to
                  me," answered Harcourt; "and indeed it leads me to suspect that he must have had
                  spies about us, of whose presence we were not aware. However, his machinations are
                  at an end, as far as I am concerned
                  cerned; for from this moment I am resolved he shall neither see me nor hear from
                  me again while either of us lives. I intend immediately to leave this
                  neighborhood, assume a disguise and another name, to abandon all my property, and
                  to become a wanderer through the world, earning a livelihood by whatever honest
                  means I can. But before I go I must make one request of you, which I trust you
                  will not refuse me, and that is, that you will not admit having seen me, but deny
                  all knowledge of me from every one. The people will talk of and calumniate me for
                  a season; your friends will congratulate you on your happy escape from the hands
                  of an 'adventurer;' but in a short time all will be quiet again, and in the course
                  of time, yielding to the entreaties of your friends and the merits of a new lover,
                  you will become happy and"—
               "Never!" exclaimed Charlotte. "From this moment, in the presence of all-seeing
                  Heaven, I dedicate myself entirely to you, and you alone! and should I not be
                  blessed with you, then I swear that no other man shall ever be listened to, no
                  other ever be looked upon as worthy of my heart or my hand!"
               "And I, too," said Harcourt, solemnly, "in the same holy presence swear and pledge
                  myself to you alone, though well assured that I can never enjoy you as my wife!
                  and should that assurance prove correct, then I swear in addition that no other
                  woman shall ever share my love or receive the pledge of my hand!"
               Scarcely were these words uttered when a deep groan was heard issuing as it were
                  from the next room! Both were surprised and terrified at the unwonted sound.
                  Harcourt thought it was the same which he had heard on a former occasion, when he
                  was recovering from the fever at Dover. He was awe-struck, but concealed both his
                  thoughts and emotions as much as possible from Charlotte.
               "Did you hear anything?" said she, with some emotion.
               "Yes," he replied; "it is only—Hush! hush! There is a sound of footsteps on the
                  stairs!"
               "What? Yes! Oh, Heavens! you will be discovered, and we are undone! Haste! haste!"
                  she continued; "I will open the window, and do you descend the arbor steps as
                  quickly as possible or you will be observed. There is no time to lose! One last
                  embrace—fare—well! farewell!"
               "Adieu!" he replied, as he waved his hand when he had gained the garden walk. He
                  then quickly disappeared amongst the shrubs on the bank of the river. Soon,
                  however, he emerged again from thence, and appeared in the boat in the middle of
                  the stream. In an instant he reached the other side. He waved his hand once more,
                  and then finally disappeared and was lost in the wood that skirted the upper rim
                  of the meadow.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XI.
               THE CRISIS.
               WHEN the alarm which had so unexpectedly separated the lovers, had somewhat
                  subsided in the mind of Charlotte, she was affected with sorrow and emotion almost
                  to the brink of despair. It seemed to her as if her very soul had been torn from
                  its tenement and that her sufferings could not possibly be increased by any thing
                  that could now happen to her. The light of heaven was burdensome to her eyes, and
                  life had lost all its charms for her; but she had sworn to live, and she would not
                  break her vow, though to die would have been the greatest of all boons. She
                  remained with her eyes riveted to the spot where she had perhaps for the last time
                  seen the retiring form of her lover, till daylight dawned upon her, unconscious of
                  its presence. At length the sounds of the family rising for the day, with the
                  accompanying bustle of the servants aroused her from her painful reverie, and
                  suggested the necessity for repose. She threw herself upon the bed but was unable
                  to sleep, or if she closed her eyes, gloomy and disturbed dreams robbed her of all
                  its refreshing power, and she awoke in the pain and excitement of a violent fever,
                  whose paroxysms increased so rapidly that before the evening of that day she was
                  in a complete phrensy, raving of her lover with the wild, incoherent expressions
                  of a maniac. Medical aid, though called in in good time, seemed powerless to
                  afford relief.
               It was now the third day of the fever, and the doctor, despairing of her recovery,
                  had given her up for lost. Every one who saw her foreboded a speedy dissolution.
                  Her breathing became quick and oppressive; her pulse so feeble as to be scarcely
                  perceptible; her extremities cold, her eye riveted on vacancy, and her countenance
                  fallen into that fixed and marble paleness which marks the hand of the great
                  destroyer, she heaved a deep sigh, and her gentle spirit seemed to depart from its
                  beautiful house of clay and wing its flight to Him who gave it!
               The last test to demonstrate the cessation of the vital functions was applied, but
                  no stain of human breath was visible on the clear, bright surface of the mirror.
                  The medical attendants pronounced to her bewildered friends that her mortal
                  sufferings were over, that she had breathed her last!
               Poor Charlotte Cumming! so young, so beautiful, so loving, and so beloved! was
                  this to be the end of all thy hopes and aspirations! Was it for this that nature
                  crowned thee with so many graces, so many virtues?
               She was decked out in the cerements of the grave, and the young maidens of the
                  village came with offerings of fresh flowers to adorn her bier; and they lamented
                  her early fate, wondering how death could be so cruel to one so fair, so
                  beantiful, so good!
               And the wretched father! What consolation could he find for the loss of so fair a
                  child; his only daughter? Sir Frederick stood over the lifeless corpse and
                  pondered. He could not weep.
               And her dear brother Charles; what were his thoughts and feelings under this cruel
                  bereavement? Ah! those only who have been similarly afflicted are qualified to
                  answer. Let them do so if they can.
               But Charlotte Cumming was not dead! She had only fallen into a trance from which
                  she awoke that night; but oh, how changed. Memory and reason had fled, perhaps
                  forever; and her friends' temporary joy was soon overcast with a deeper gloom.
                  Death itself were preferable to her new
                  condition, if it should last. Was there any hope of a cure?
               Time, the universal healer, could alone answer this question. But cruelly the most
                  sanguine hopes of her friends had been disappointed. She still lingered, not in
                  pain, but in apathy. Nothing seemed to attract her attention, to move, to soften
                  her heart. It was locked, and there seemed to be only one key in all nature that
                  could open it. But that key was lost. Alas! was there no hope of finding it?
               A year passed away after this mournful event and not a whisper was heard of
                  Harcourt or her who was suffering for his love, save that now and then parents
                  would point them out as an example to their children, in order to save them from
                  indulging a passion which could not be gratified, but might hurry them to a
                  similar fate. People looked with feelings of awe and of pity on the scene of this
                  tragedy, and on those unhappy relatives who had been bereaved of their treasure,
                  and abstained from all uncharitable remarks on either side, and thus the whole
                  matter was gradually hushed up, and every thing wore a smiling and tranquil face
                  as before, save the countenances of the father and brother, where traces of their
                  sorrow were engraved in characters too deep ever to be obliterated.
               Chance alone, or perhaps I should say Providence, made me acquainted with the
                  remainder of Harcourt's story.
               My three boys, whom I have already mentioned to you, had arrived by this time at
                  an age when it was necessary to send them to school. I made inquiries of many
                  parents about a proper place to send them, and I was warmly recommended to place
                  them with a clergyman named Lovechild, in the neighborhood of Liverpool. This
                  recommendation was given by a friend of mine in whom I placed and still place the
                  greatest confidence, (for he knew nothing whatever of what I have learned from
                  other sources since then,) and accordingly I took them down a year ago last
                  Easter, and found Mr. Lovechild and his wife so very plausible and kind in
                  appearance that I was well pleased with my choice.
               As Mr. Lovechild was taking me around the grounds he descanted in high terms on
                  the advantages which his pupils enjoyed; the salubrity of the situation; their
                  extensive play ground; but above all the excellence of his system of instruction;
                  for he never, he asserted, retained any but the best masters that could be found,
                  and at that time in particular, he said, he was fortunate enough to have secured
                  the services of one preeminently qualified in every respect for such a situation.
                  Indeed, he said, the situation was far beneath his powers, for that he was fully
                  competent to a professorship in any of the universities, and that he could not
                  account for his accepting such a place at all. He is quite a gentleman, both in
                  manners and feeling, he continued, and I am almost certain that some mystery hangs
                  over his history, which, if we knew all, would show that he was born to a far
                  different position.
               My curiosity was excited to see this gentleman, and as we were now about to enter
                  the school-room, which was detached from the dwelling, I requested that he would
                  point him out to me; but what was my surprise and astonishment when I discovered
                  in this stranger the person and features of Harcourt! I could not be mistaken in
                  him, for I knew him well. The moment I entered the room his eye caught mine, and
                  the color came slightly to his cheeks; but soon regaining his self-possession, he
                  became composed and dignified, with the same air of haughty reserve which I had
                  formerly remarked in him. My feelings towards him were those of contempt and
                  disgust, as I had been accustomed to regard him in no other light than that of a
                  base and needy adventurer, who practiced upon the feelings of others to gratify
                  his vanity or appetites, and I turned away with the intention of quitting his
                  presence, which, to my mind, could not fail to contaminate all with whom he came
                  in contact, and to relate his history, as far as I then knew it, which was that
                  portion only which he had told Charles Cumming, to his employer; but I had only proceeded a few
                  steps when I felt some one tapping on my shoulder. I turned round and saw it was
                  Harcourt, who had now assumed the name of Hardy. I intended at first to repel his
                  advances with disdain, but when I saw the painful expression of his countenance,
                  his worn and haggard look, and heard the melancholy music of his voice, imploring
                  me to give him a private interview for only a short time, and he would explain
                  all, and convince me of his innocence and the preservation of his honor, my heart
                  relented, and I could not resist granting a request which was so just. It would be
                  time enough, I thought, to condemn when I had heard all he could say in his own
                  defense, and I told him in as mild a tone as I could, that I was ready to hear him
                  then, if he chose. I apologised to Mr. Lovechild, saying that I wished to converse
                  with Mr. Hardy privately, and begged that he would excuse him for the remainder of
                  the day. I then walked with Harcourt along the shore, where I heard from him the
                  account which I have already told you, and, in addition, his history up to the
                  moment we were then conversing together, and you may judge how my opinion of him
                  was changed. I now not only pitied him, but loved and honored him for his virtues
                  and heroic conduct, and offered him every assistance in my power to give. But he
                  would accept of nothing, saying that he was too happy to suffer for the sake of
                  her who had died for him, (for he had learned her fate from the public papers, but
                  not of her revival and present condition,) and that nothing which the world could
                  do would be able to alleviate the sorrows that must soon, he said, bring him to
                  the grave, and happy would be the hour of his deliverance when he should go to
                  join her that was gone before to that place "where the wicked cease to trouble and
                  the weary are at rest." I had not the heart to acquaint him with her actual
                  condition, as this was so hopeless that it might add to instead of alleviating his
                  sufferings. The account he gave of himself, after having torn himself from
                  Charlotte Cumming, is as follows.
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               HARCOURT'S STORY CONTINUED.
               WHEN I arrived at the wood (continued Harcourt) on the other side of the meadow, I
                  paused to look back, and fancied that even from that distance I could see
                  Charlotte at the window, waving her small, white hand. Feeling that if I gazed
                  much longer I could not resist the temptation to return, I resolutely pursued my
                  way through the dense and pathless underwood till I reached the other side, when I
                  found that my clothes were all torn and my hands, face and limbs bleeding from the
                  briers and thorns which I met in my way, for I had never thought of following the
                  beaten track. In this state I went on with a heavy heart, but running like a
                  madman, to avoid as much as possible the pain of reflection by bodily suffering
                  and agitation. At last I came to the open road, but did not dare to pursue it,
                  lest I might be met and recognized by some one in the neighborhood. I can scarcely
                  account for the horror I had of being seen, but I know that I dreaded it worse
                  than anything else that could have befallen me. The shame, perhaps, of appearing
                  in the eyes of my acquaintance other than I had appeared to them in the time of my
                  prosperity and happiness might be assigned as the reason. At length morning began
                  to dawn, and this reminded me that if I would remain concealed I must find some
                  wood or empty dwelling where to remain during the day. I looked about on all
                  sides, and saw at some distance what appeared to be a barn in the middle of a field. I made my way as speedily as
                  possible to the spot, entered it cautiously, and found it exactly suited to my
                  purpose. It was filled with hay, so that I lay concealed till night in the most
                  perfect security and secresy. During the time I was forced to remain here,
                  overcome with fatigue and mental suffering, I slept a good deal, and on awaking I
                  found myself much refreshed, though I now began to feel the cravings of hunger, as
                  I had neither eaten nor drunk for the space of twenty-seven hours! but as yet it
                  wanted some hours of night, and I dared not venture out; I had therefore some time
                  to reflect on the course which I ought to take with regard to restoring my
                  property and all I possessed to its proper owners, and I found that it would be a
                  difficult matter to accomplish, seeing that I knew no person to whom I might
                  apply, nor did I know who the right heirs were, or how to find them. If I
                  advertised it might expose the foreign lady to the danger of being disgraced, and
                  it must, at all events, expose myself to the world, which I dreaded more than
                  anything else. I could endure poverty, the loss of friends and of every worldly
                  possession, but not of honor; and having hitherto lived and been considered a
                  gentleman, I could not bear to be regarded as the low-born son of a vile and
                  vicious peasant. The thought stung me to the quick, and I wished above all things
                  to have it believed that I had perished by some unknown and extraordinary
                  accident, or even by suicide in a fit of insanity, rather than it should be
                  imagined I should live in disgrace. This weakness it was which impelled me to
                  request Charlotte to deny all knowledge of me to every one, that it might be
                  supposed I had been destroyed in some dark and mysterious manner, and this it was
                  which induced me to lie concealed in the barn, though suffering severely from
                  hunger, rather than run the risk of being seen by some one who should know me in
                  the neighborhood.
               "At length the long-wished-for night came, and I stole out of my hiding place as
                  softly as possible, and looked carefully round, lest some one might see me, and
                  finding all safe in that respect, I pursued my way through by-roads and fields and
                  entangled lanes, without ever daring to procure anything to eat in the houses
                  which I passed, till I had arrived at what I thought a long distance from all
                  danger. By this time I was so hungry and fatigued with my exertion that I was
                  almost ready to faint with weakness, and I determined to go into the first house I
                  should come to and buy myself some refreshments. Accordingly I soon noticed a
                  solitary light at some distance from the path I was then pursuing, and followed
                  its direction. It led me to a low, neat cottage in the fields, surrounded by
                  trees, and with a small garden in front. I did not venture to enter till I should
                  ascertain who were its inmates; I therefore went to the back window, where I could
                  see everything without being seen. There was no cause for fear, for I saw only an
                  old man and woman, with a young fellow of about eighteen, who seemed to be their
                  son. They were sitting before a cheerful fire, with a table before them, which was
                  covered with a clean white cloth, on which was placed their frugal evening meal,
                  consisting of coarse bread and some cheese, with a nice piece of fresh butter and
                  a jug of beer. As I had never seen any of the faces before, I ventured in; for the
                  supper, to a person so hungry as I was, looked very tempting. They were rather
                  startled at the appearance of a stranger, and especially one of my forlorn and
                  care-worn aspect; but when I told them that I had lost my way in attempting to
                  pass through a thick grove in the neighborhood, where my clothes, my hands, face
                  and feet were torn by the brambles and thorns, they expressed their pity and
                  begged me, with a politeness and attention quite natural, to take a seat at their
                  fire. I did so, and moreover informed them that I felt very hungry, and that in
                  fact my principal object in troubling them was to purchase, if possible, some
                  refreshments. They pointed to the table, saying that what it contained was all
                  they had to offer, and if I would condescend to partake of their humble repast I
                  was very welcome, 'unless,' said the old woman, 'you might, perhaps, prefer fer an egg or two, which I will boil
                  for you directly.' So saying she went to a cupboard, took out some eggs, put on a
                  saucepan, and in a short time laid on the table the most delicious fare I had ever
                  yet tasted, for never before did I feel what it was really to want food. I did
                  ample justice to their delicacies, and the good people seemed surprised at my
                  voracity, and delighted that they had it in their power to appease my hunger.
               "When the first cravings of ravenous appetite were in a certain degree appeased, I
                  could not help admiring the peculiar and, to me, strange aspect which this little
                  group of three persons presented to my observation. Never before had it been my
                  lot to mingle thus in intimate association with, or even to think of, persons of
                  this class—the laboring poor, whose feelings and comforts are of such little
                  consequence in the minds of the rich and the proud; but many a proud family, had
                  its members been in my place, would have learned that felicity and content are not
                  confined to their own peculiar sphere, and many a self-righteous Christian would
                  have learned a lesson of true christianity and religious feeling from the humble
                  instructors whom it was my fortune to mingle with in heart and feeling on that
                  evening. Before beginning the meal the venerable father invoked an impressive
                  blessing, and at its close returned, not the vain offering of the lip, but the
                  truly greatful out-pourings of the soul, in brief but impressive language. And
                  then, how delightful it was to see the love and attention of the mother to the son
                  of her love! He was her only child, her chief support, and a good and dutiful
                  youth he was. Young, cheerful and healthy, he worked all the day for the common
                  support, and at night, instead of going to the ale-house, as many others in his
                  circumstances unfortunately are in the habit of doing, he staid at home and
                  conversed with his beloved parents or read for them a portion of that Book which
                  is the poor man's chief consolation, because it points out to him a brighter and a
                  happier world than that in which he is condemned to perpetual suffering, privation
                  and toil, and it teaches him to endure dure with patience the brief evils of the
                  present, in the hope of meeting eternal happiness in the world to come. And the
                  poor man alone seems capable of appreciaing its sublime and cheering truths, for
                  he is the child of misery and suffering, and none other can feel the full force of
                  what is contained in that blessed book; for how can the rich man and the happy in
                  this world look up with earnest longing to the bliss of a future? He will rather
                  look on his latter end with horror, as a period to be avoided, even in thought;
                  for it will take away from him everything which distinguished him among men and
                  made him happy in this world, and will place him on a common level with the rest
                  of the children of Adam. Adversity is indeed the best teacher of the proud human
                  heart, and happy is that man who can turn the lessons it inculcates to good
                  account.
               "I was agreeably surprised to hear this youth read. The piety, the feeling and the
                  goodness that were conspicuous in his whole character could not fail to impress
                  the most indifferent and trivial mind with feelings of respect for him; and I
                  confess that on that night, for the first time in my life, I knew what it was to
                  pray with heartfelt and lively devotion, taught by an ignorant and unsophisticated
                  youth, the child of nature! After supper a portion of scripture was read, and the
                  young man prayed with fervor and devotion, and without the slightest affectation
                  of spiritual pride or superior sanctity, but with a simplicity and touching appeal
                  to Heaven, as if he felt himself in the presence of his Creator and his God.
               "Never shall I forget the impression which was made upon my mind that evening. I
                  arose from my knees with renewed courage and a firm reliance on the goodness and
                  protecting care of Divine Providence; and, recruited in body and cheered in
                  spirit, I resolved now to pursue my way. Having therefore thanked my kind
                  entertainers, I presented them with some money, but they would not accept it. I
                  threw it down on the table, saying that they were poor, and I could not think of
                  accepting their refreshments for nothing. I then inquired whether they could sell me an old smock
                  frock or something of that kind, to protect my clothes from the thorns and briers,
                  and having obtained one for a small sum, I bade them a warm adieu, and departed,
                  resolved to travel the whole of that night, and to rest the next day, as I had
                  done the day before, after which I hoped there would be no longer a necessity for
                  traveling at night, as I should by that time reach a part of the country where no
                  one would be likely to know me, especially disguised as I now was; for my hat was
                  all bruised and torn so as to answer the purpose of completing my disguise.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               AN ADVENTURE.
               I TRAVELED on for several hours without meeting with anything worth relating, till
                  about the hour of twelve, or it might be half past. The lights in all the houses
                  were extinguished as I passed along, and darkness, relieved only by the dim light
                  of the stars, seen at intervals through a dense and drizzling mist, with perfect
                  stillness, prevailed over the whole face of nature. Nothing could be more dismal
                  or lonely than my journey on that night. It seemed as if I was the only being in
                  creation which could not enjoy the sweets of repose, and my heart sank within me
                  as I contrasted the loneliness and unfriended state of my position—even with the
                  smiling hearth, the loving parents and the humble roof of the poor peasant boy,
                  whose hospitality and piety I had but recently experienced, and I should have been
                  happy could I have changed conditions with him! While occupied with these
                  melancholy thoughts I imagined I saw a glimmering light amongst some trees before
                  me. I looked again, and all was dark. I proceeded, but had not gone more than a
                  few paces when I saw the same flickering light as before. I now looked up towards
                  the murky sky, thinking that it was either a flash of lightning or the reflection
                  of a shooting star. That moment I saw it again amongst the trees; but this time it
                  continued longer than before, and then suddenly disappeared. I cautiously
                  approached in the direction of the place where I had seen the light, and when I reached the clump of trees I saw it
                  again, for a second or two, at a short distance from me. I now redoubled my pace,
                  until I was abruptly stopped by a high wall, which seemed to be the inclosure of a
                  garden. I groped around me for some time, to try to find a path, but could not
                  succeed in extricating myself from the underwood and brambles, amongst which I had
                  stumbled in the dark. At length, while I was occupied in this way my hand came in
                  contact with something like a ladder. Curiosity tempted me to ascend, which I did
                  with perfect ease; but I found the top of the wall covered with spikes and broken
                  glass, which cut my hands a good deal before I was aware of it. At that moment I
                  saw the same glimmer of light as before; but now it seemed to issue from a house,
                  and this time it remained steady about a minute. I thought I discovered the shadow
                  of a man reflected against the wall of it, and it instantly struck me that there
                  were robbers about to plunder the house, and perhaps murder the inmates! At all
                  hazards, and indeed quite regardless of the consequences, I resolved to give the
                  alarm, and for that purpose sought for a place where I could descend into the
                  garden. Another gleam of light directed my attention to another ladder placed on
                  the inside of the wall, and this removed all doubt as to the contemplated robbery.
                  I descended immediately, and was proceeding up the garden, with the express
                  purpose of giving the alarm, when I heard the report of firearms, followed by a
                  loud shout. The people of the house had perceived that an entrance was attempted;
                  and, taking the alarm, fired at the depredators. Several shots were fired by them,
                  and returned by the robbers; when the latter, despairing of success and fearing
                  detection or instant death, took to flight in the direction in which I was
                  advancing. I heard their approaching footsteps, and determined to prevent their
                  escape, if possible, though I was unarmed, and in order to surprise them drew back
                  behind a tree. I could not tell how many there might be, but I hoped to be able to
                  secure one, at least, in the confusion and terror of a precipitate retreat, which
                  might be a clue to the detection and punishment of the rest. I already heard the
                  footsteps, and soon the quick breathing, of a man approaching, who was followed at
                  some distance by another. I could not hear any others. I determined instantly to
                  let the first pass, and to seize the other when he came up. The first man, who
                  seemed tall and powerful, and whose face was masked, flew by me like lightning.
                  The other came up breathless, and on him I sprang like a tiger. He uttered a wild
                  shriek at the sudden surprise; but I soon found that he was too muscular to be
                  long held in my feeble grasp even without the aid of weapons; but he had a pistol
                  in his hand, and drawing it he struck me with all his force a blow on the shoulder
                  which so completely stunned me as not only to compel me to let go my hold, but
                  laid me senseless at his feet! Had he struck me on the head, at which he aimed, he
                  would have killed me at once; as it was, even, he very nearly succeeded in doing
                  so. When I awoke to consciousness I found myself on a wretched pallet, in open
                  daylight, surrounded by strange faces, which seemed to look upon me with all the
                  horror and disgust that the right-minded can conceive for the deepest and darkest
                  guilt. I thought the scene of the night before was only one of those frightful
                  dreams with which my sleep of late had been so constantly disturbed; but when I
                  heard those around me express to each other the fervent wish that my life might be
                  spared in order that justice should not be robbed of its due, I immediately
                  perceived the very critical position into which my own imprudence had hurried
                  me.
               "It seemed that immediately after I was stunned by the blow of the house-breaker,
                  the people of the house, who were drawn to the spot by the shriek he had uttered,
                  hastened where I was lying, and finding me there senseless, they very naturally
                  concluded that I was one of the gang who had attempted to break into the house,
                  with an intent to rob, perhaps to murder, especially as they found lying beside me
                  the pistol, which the robber had let
                  fall in his flight. They carried me in triumph into one of their out-houses, where
                  there was a kind of bed, and set a guard over me till daybreak, in the mean time
                  sending for a surgeon to examine my wounds, for though I was senseless I did not
                  seem to be dead. The surgeon came, and finding me uninjured except by a severe
                  bruise on the shoulder and some cuts on the hands, pronounced that I should soon
                  be in a condition to undergo an examination before the magistrates, when he hoped
                  my accomplices also might be brought to light. But the severity of the blow gave
                  such a violent concussion to my whole nervous system, already predisposed by
                  excitement, sorrow and fatigue, as to throw me into a violent fever, and three
                  weeks elapsed before I was in a condition to appear before the magistrates, who
                  were extremely anxious to examine and punish me.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               THE LAW
               AT length the day arrived when I was to be conducted to the neighboring town for
                  that purpose, and long before the hour of departing a crowd assembled round the
                  place in order to catch a glimpse of "the robber," as all were unanimous in
                  pronouncing me. When I made my appearance, handcuffed and attended by two
                  constables, and a large party of armed men to prevent my escape, although my pale,
                  haggard and care-worn countenance might have excited compassion, I was assailed
                  with groans and hisses, and the most fierce and threatening looks from the crowds
                  of people assembled, not even excepting the females, who seemed to have forgotten
                  the natural kindliness of their feelings, in their horror of one whom they
                  doubtless supposed guilty of the blackest crimes, though he was as innocent as any
                  of themselves. The same demonstration of feeling assailed me on entering the
                  magistrate's room, which, however, was partially suppressed by respect for the
                  presence in which I was about to be placed.
               "Several witnesses were brought forward to prove that on the particular night in
                  question a burglary and robbery had been attempted on the house and property of a
                  gentleman named Hawsworth; that though an entrance had been effected, the
                  burglars, after a short though fierce resistance, by which, however, one of the
                  inmates was shot dead, had been foiled in their attempt and put to flight by the
                  members of the family; that in the
                  pursuit I, the prisoner, was found lying senseless on a walk in the garden; that
                  the others, whose persons and number were unknown, had made their escape by means
                  of ladders over the garden wall; and that, though diligent search had been made,
                  no traces of them could be discovered. And then they went on to state my illness,
                  the incoherent expressions in my ravings, and every little word or look, which
                  they interpreted so as to strengthen the belief of my guilt. Indeed there was no
                  need of such minuteness of detail, for appearances were against me, and when I was
                  called upon to account for myself, and stated the truth, as you have already heard
                  it, the whole court was in a roar of laughter and derision to think that I could
                  hope to impose upon them so improbable a story. I gave another name from that
                  under which I was hitherto known, for I did not wish to disgrace myself in the
                  eyes of my former school-fellows and college acquaintance, and also from that
                  which I now bear, because I have found it necessary, even for my very existence,
                  to change it since. But I refused to give any other account of myself, my
                  parentage, the place of my birth, my circumstances, or to say anything else than
                  that I was entirely innocent of the crime laid to my charge, or of the intention
                  to commit that or any other crime whatever, and my committal was made out
                  accordingly without any hesitation, and I was sent to the county goal to await my
                  trial at the next general assises for a capital offense of which I was not only
                  innocent, but which I even risked my own life to prevent. But I confess I do not
                  know how the magistrates could have acted otherwise than they did, for I am sure
                  that had I been in their place I should have done the same thing myself. I
                  therefore cannot blame them for the unheard of calamities which it has been my
                  fate to suffer, both in mind and body, under the severe discipline of a prison and
                  the stigma of a horrid crime, and can only attribute it to my own evil destiny
                  which seems to persecute me without mercy wherever I go, or whatever I do. But
                  with the assistance of heaven nothing shall tempt me to despair, or even to
                  repine, or to swerve for a moment from that rectitude of purpose which has
                  hitherto been the guide of my existence.
               "To describe to you what I had to undergo during my three months imprisonment
                  before my trial would not only be tedious but disgusting; but I may remark that
                  neither the felon's garb nor the menial offices that I was obliged to perform, nor
                  the cold damp cell, nor all the other evils I had to endure, could for a moment be
                  compared, for the excrutiating torture they inflicted, to the society of the
                  wretches with whom I was obliged to herd in common. Had I been left to myself, my
                  imprisonment, however severe in other respects would have been tolerable; but to
                  be obliged to listen to the low ribaldry, the disgusting levity, the atrocious and
                  open avowal of hardened and guilty fellow creatures; to be subject to their scoffs
                  and contempt; to be the perpetual object of their derision and insolence, because
                  I seemed to listen with an unwilling ear and an uncongenial mind to their filthy
                  and abominable disclosures, is surely the utmost punishment that the mind of man
                  can endure, and well calculated, if anything can do so, to make it forget the
                  impress of the Almighty Being which it bears, and rush headlong into perdition and
                  misery! Great God! I am almost maddened with the bare remembrance of what I then
                  endured, and wonder that my mind was not completely unhinged and distracted by the
                  abominations I was forced to listen to, and that for a space of three long months.
                  Oh! who would endure the torment of fire for one hour, one minute, and yet this
                  would be even less painful to the body than that companionship to the mind.
                  Surely, if there is to be a punishment for the wicked in another world, (and who
                  can doubt the fact?) there is no need to have recourse to a material fire for that
                  end, when the immaterial fire which scorches without consuming the soul is all
                  sufficient for the purpose. But amidst all my sufferings, it was one consolation
                  to me that my beloved Charlotte was
                  ignorant of my fate; that she remained in happy unconsciousness of the sufferings
                  I endured. For as yet I knew nothing of her death; how could I? no papers, no
                  books of any kind were allowed me, and what short moments of quiet I could steal
                  from the impious mirth around me were spent in reflecting on her; but it was a
                  bitter and painful reflection, for I could not help thinking that we were
                  separated for ever, as I had now no hopes of seeing her again, whatever little or
                  vague hopes I might have entertained before, for not being able to give any
                  account of myself on the evening of the robbery, and having such clear testimony
                  of my guilt against me, I must, doubtless, fall an innocent victim to the strict
                  severity of the laws. I fully made up my mind that this must be the case, though I
                  could not help regretting that it must be in so ignominious a manner. However
                  death in any shape would be a boon to such a forlorn and friendless wretch as I,
                  though but a few months before I was the happiest of men, with every prospect of
                  success and worldly prosperity in view. All that gave me any sorrow now was that
                  there was one being in the world who would, if she knew it, sympathize in my
                  sufferings and deplore my fate; and it would have been no small consolation to me
                  at that time to have learned that she had gone before me, and that we should soon
                  meet in another and a better world. But even that consolation was denied me."
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               THE TRIAL AND SENTENCE.
               THUS the time passed painfully slow, every day seeming a month and every hour a
                  day, till at last I was so worn with suffering, both mental and physical, and so
                  pale and emaciated as scarcely to appear the same being. But the hour of my
                  deliverance was fast approaching, and I was beginning, as it drew nearer, to feel
                  a restless impatience till death should rescue me from all my sorrows. The assises
                  at length came. I was arraigned at the bar of justice, tried and found guilty by a
                  jury of my countrymen, for the facts were too plain to admit of any other defense
                  than the simple assertion of my innoeence, in which I persevered to the last; but
                  against such palpable evidence as seemed to add effrontery to crime and to call
                  forth the reprobation and disgust of all present. And as I either could or would
                  give no account of myself whatever, I was pronounced to be the most hardened and
                  obstinate criminal that had ever come within the experience of the learned and
                  venerable judge who tried me.
               "The sentence of the law was therefore pronounced upon me, which was, that in a
                  few days I should be led forth to execution for the crimes of willful murder,
                  house-breaking and attempted robbery, and no hope of pardon was to be thought of
                  by me, or indeed was possible. I bowed my head meekly, at the same time protesting
                  my innocence again, and was supported out of the dock to my condemned cell, where
                  I was to pass the short interval between my trial and execution.
               
               "This was a narrow dungeon, damp and foul, but yet to me it was a paradise
                  compared with the hideous den to which I had hitherto been confined, because now I
                  was alone. Shut in from a cruel and insulting world, I now enjoyed a foretaste of
                  that repose which, in a few days, would be perfect; and far from feeling my
                  situation a miserable one, I considered it a friendly retreat from the cold,
                  suspicious eye and the cruel charities of my fellow-men, and rejoiced in the
                  prospect of eternal enlargement which its gloomy shade, the precincts of the tomb
                  and the shadow of death must soon lead to! Now, my very loneliness, my
                  friendlessness was a matter of the deepest consolation to me, for I alone should
                  suffer in my approaching ignominous death! I should pass away unknown and
                  unlamented from the world, and not an eye should be moist, nor a heart sorrowful
                  at my fate! Had I parents, brothers, sisters, or relations, how great would have
                  been my pangs of sorrow and distress in the prospect of bidding them an eternal
                  farewell, in tearing myself from their loved embrace! How many deaths should I
                  have endured in witnessing their desolation and misery? But now I was the only one
                  who was to suffer, though innocent; but then that suffering was sent me from
                  Heaven to release me from a greater. It was a precious boon, and I blessed the
                  hand that inflicted it, and the more so still because my conscience told me that I
                  died innocent of any crime. To the stranger, if any wasted a thought upon me at
                  all, I must have appeared the most wretched of mankind; to myself I seemed the
                  most happy in that lonely and dismal cell of the condemned, so great is the power
                  of circumstances in making the happiness or misery of men and influencing the
                  feelings of individuals at different times.
               "The greatest interruption to this tranquility and calm was the bold and indecent
                  intrusion of men calling themselves ministers of the gospel and servants of
                  Christ, who worried me with entreaties to confess my guilt at once, 'as no one,'
                  they said, 'entertained the least doubt of it,' and to repent in time, 'as God,'
                  they said, 'was ever willing to receive the repentant sinner to his bosom!' All I
                  could say to the contrary would not convince these reverend gentlemen of my
                  innocence, and after hours of vain remonstrance they have often departed in the
                  greatest anger, anathematizing the depravity of the human heart, because I would
                  not confess to that of which I was not guilty, nor inculpate associates of whom I
                  knew nothing. These made very unfavorable reports of my spiritual condition, and
                  some of them did not hesitate to affirm that I was a spirit of evil that had
                  assumed the human form to execute some diabolical machination of Satan. At last
                  they became so insolent and importunate as to induce me to exclude them
                  altogether, and if they persevered in tormenting me, to close my ears and take no
                  notice of their presence whatever. I even went so far as to tell one of them that
                  if I had no hope of being saved except through his charitable
                  interference and that of his meek brethren, I did not desire salvation at all. I
                  never would even attempt to pray in their presence, for I scorned their hypocrisy
                  and wished to mortify their insolent presumption; but when I was left alone, then
                  did I fall on my knees before my Creator and my God! then did I pour out my whole
                  soul in the presence of my Maker and Redeemer, and derive that inward consolation
                  and support which He never refuses to those who place their confidence in Him! I
                  was resolved to be religious in my own way and according to the dictates of my own
                  heart, without the vain pomp and parade of outward show and hypocritical
                  ceremonies.
               "With the exception of these petty annoyances, I now felt comparatively happy and
                  resigned entirely to my fate. I slept soundly at night and took my meals with
                  regularity, and thus regained some of that strength of frame which I had lost from
                  the uncertainty in which I was placed before and the companionship with which I
                  had been forced to associate.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVI.
               THE REPRIEVE.
               AT last the morning dawned which was to be my last in this world. I hailed its
                  friendly light with heartfelt gratitude. I arose, dressed and prayed in silence
                  and alone to my God, into whose hands I was so soon to resign my weary spirit.
                  Presently I heard a key in the door of my cell; it was opened and the officers who
                  carry into effect the last sentence of the law made their appearance, accompanied
                  by the chaplain of the prison. They found me in a firm and tranquil frame of mind,
                  awaiting their arrival with anxious expectation. My chains were struck off and I
                  was led to the scaffold, the chaplain reading in a solemn tone the service
                  appointed to be read on such occasions by the church of England. I mounted the
                  scaffold with a firm step, my arms pinioned. I glanced around the multitude
                  assembled to witness the last agonies of a fellow creature, and I thought I saw a
                  savage joy depicted on their countenances. It seemed that an execution would be a
                  rich feast for them. The executioner was just beginning to adjust the instrument
                  of death when all at once a cry was heard amongst the crowd of 'Stop! stop! a
                  reprieve! a reprieve!' and the sound was echoed along through the dense mass of
                  human beings and was repeated with increasing power till the whole crowd pealed
                  forth with one universal voice the (to some) joyful sound, 'reprieve! reprieve!'
                  but to many it seemed a great disappointment, and murmurs, and even hisses, were
                  mingled with the cries of exultation for depriving the people of a sight which
                  they had that day made so many sacrifices of personal comfort to see; and the mass
                  were departing with an air of sullen dissatisfaction, when it was announced by the
                  sheriff that 'the criminal had received a free pardon because he was found, from
                  the confession of the real culprit, who had been taken in the act of committing
                  another robbery, to have been completely innocent!'
               "I must do the great mass the justice to say that when the announcement was made
                  fully known to them that I was innocent, a universal cheer of exultation swallowed
                  up the incipient signs of previous discontent, and all seemed rejoiced at the
                  happy turn which events had taken in so short a space of time. I was just on the
                  brink of eternity and one minute more and I should have been irrevocably plunged
                  into its dark and unfathomable abyss! but Providence overruled this catastrophe
                  for the sake of human justice, which would have been so grossly outraged by this
                  deed of blood!
               "As for myself, I was, I may venture to say, the only person who remained unmoved
                  in this general, this universal ferment of minds. Though it was a matter of
                  rejoicing to me to be cleared from all suspicion of crime in the presence of my
                  fellow men, yet knowing already how I stood in the presence of my God, and that
                  ere now I should have been happy in his bosom, there to dwell forever more, I felt
                  regret that the reprieve had arrived so soon and thereby condemned me again to
                  encounter the storms and tempests of this black and gloomy world!
               "I was now warmly congratulated on my escape, not only by my fellow prisoners, but
                  also by the officers of the prison and the sheriffs, who all seemed delighted at
                  the issue of an affair which but a few moments before had seemed gloomy and
                  hopeless! The reverend chaplain alone seemed morose and sulky, either because he
                  had the mortification to find his dogmatical assertion of my guilt contradicted,
                  or that he was sorry that one so
                  hardened and obstinate should escape a punishment, if not due to his guilt, at
                  least richly merited by his unbending and independent demeanor, and he alone
                  retained the stiff and unbending attitude which characterized him."
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               FREEDOM.
               I WAS now told that I might go whithersoever I chose; and though pleased to regain
                  my liberty, yet, having neither money nor clothes, nor a single friend in the
                  world to whom I would apply, I knew not what use to make of my liberty. The trifle
                  of money which I had on my person on being sent to prison, was taken away from me,
                  and when, on being liberated, I demanded it of the turnkey, I was told that it was
                  barely sufficient to pay the ordinary fees.
               "What!" I demanded, "must a man who has been falsely imprisoned for upwards of
                  three months with the vilest characters, and felons of the worst description, who
                  has suffered all the agonies of a condemned cell, who has been subjected to the
                  ignominy of standing before the public gaze on a scaffold, and who, when on the
                  brink of eternity, was found to be innocent of every crime, must he be compelled
                  to pay the last farthing he has in the world for such favors, and at last sent
                  out, naked and penniless, to beg his bread from door to door?"
               "Such is the law," I was answered.
               "It may be law," I exclaimed, "but it is certainly not justice. Ought not the law
                  be made for the protection of the community, and the terror and punishment of
                  evil-doers? And who are the community? Is it not composed of individuals who, from
                  their blameless life and unimpeachable characters, are entitled to the protection
                  of the laws? and if any such are
                  falsely accused and persecuted to the death, even though innocent of crime, surely
                  the law ought to hold out to them some means of redress for these wrongs."
               "It does," I was answered.
               "What redress?" I inquired; "it is this only which I wish to know."
               "If the accused," said my respondent, "has the good fortune as you have had, to
                  escape the gallows, and can prove that a false accusation had been maliciously
                  preferred against him, and he was thereby exposed to personal or pecuniary injury,
                  he can bring his action, and a jury will return him suitable damages."
               "What compensation," I asked, "can money make to the man whose being has been
                  blighted, whose spirit has been seered, whose character and prospects have been
                  utterly ruined?"
               "There is no remedy for this," he replied, "and the evil must be borne to secure a
                  greater good. For though some from a peculiar concurrence of circumstances, may
                  run the risk of being falsely accused, as you have done, and even of suffering
                  death, which you have escaped, yet such instances are very rare, and not to be
                  compared with the advantages arising from the state of the law to the community at
                  large; for if none could be put to inconvenience but those whose guilt was
                  manifest, how few would meet the punishment they deserve, and how many abandoned
                  and depraved wretches would be let loose on the world!"
               "True," I replied, "but is it not enough for the unfortunate wretch, who, though
                  innocent, happens, from circumstances, to be the object of strong suspicion, and
                  who for that reason is subjected to every mental and bodily suffering, is it not
                  enough for him to suffer these inflictions as long as he is an object of
                  suspicion, but must he be subjected to the consequences perhaps for the remainder
                  of his life afterwards? Must he be cast out on the world, naked and abandoned,
                  merely because he has had the misfortune to suffer unheardof calamities already
                  for the sake of justice; and must he continue to suffer after the necessity which
                  first placed him in that position was entirely removed? One would think that the
                  wisdom and mercy and kind consideration of legislators would have made some
                  provision for such a case; for surely society ought not to abandon and cast away
                  the man who has suffered so much in its behalf, no more than she would abandon the
                  soldiers who fought her battles, or the sailors who guarded her interests in
                  distant regions. But it seems she not only abandons him to his own resources when
                  his energies are broken in her service, but she robs him of the little he
                  possessed. And what does it matter whether the law expressly sanctions such
                  injustice or not, if, like a careful guardian, it does not take care that no such
                  abuse can occur either through those who administer it or through those more
                  mercenary tools who only look to their own interests in executing its final
                  decisions, who, in direct opposition to its spirit, take advantage of every
                  loop-hole to creep through its meshes, and to prey upon those whom it was framed
                  to protect as well as to control. I may be told that custom, either local or
                  general, sanctions the practice from time immemorial, as well as acts of the
                  legislature. But, if this is the case, I have done. It may be that both custom and
                  the legislature sanction it. I say it may be, for I am ignorant of the law on this
                  point; but one thing I will say, if it is so, both custom and the legislature are
                  opposed to justice, which ought to be the only end and aim of all law. This is but
                  too evident, if an innocent man falsely accused, falsely imprisoned, falsely
                  condemned, is, in addition to this, robbed of all he possessed, and sent into the
                  wide world naked and penniless.
               "But though I could obtain no redress for my wrongs, my case excited universal
                  pity amongst all who heard it, and as the English people are ever ready to relieve
                  the distresses of the wretched, a subscription of a very liberal character was
                  immediately set on foot on my behalf,
                  and a handsome sum would have been presented to me had I not immediately, on
                  hearing it, put a stop to it, declaring that though my gratitude was unbounded, I
                  could not possibly accept a farthing.
               "No," I said to the gentlemen who were deputed to inform me, "tell the people that
                  I shall feel grateful for their kindness and benevolence while I live, but that
                  this bounty would be showered in vain on a wretch like me, whose miseries no
                  wealth or worldly circumstances could alleviate, and that since I cannot obtain
                  what is my just right, I must decline to accept the kind offer which they have
                  made me.
               "While I yet spoke, several of the gentlemen were moved to tears, others seemed
                  lost in astonishment and wonder that one like me could refuse such a munificent
                  gift as the people proposed to offer me, and when they reported my answer to the
                  towns-people it excited universal curiosity and interest.
               "I was now about to retire to bed for the night, when I was informed that my
                  refusal to accept any relief had created such a sensation in the town that
                  hundreds had expressed their intention of visiting me next day with a desire to
                  become more acquainted with my character and history, if possible. I therefore
                  resolved to steal away privately from the inn at which I stopped, in the middle of
                  the night, and thus disappoint a curiosity which it was impossible for me to
                  gratify. Accordingly, having left some little article of dress sufficient to pay
                  for my lodging, with a note for my landlord explaining the reasons for my abrupt
                  departure, I collected together the few things which I had left and took my
                  departure privately, when all the household were locked in the arms of sleep.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               COLD AND HUNGER.
               IT was a cold, frosty night in the beginning of January. The north wind was keen
                  and piercing, and the stars twinkled with extraordinary brilliancy in their
                  orbits. Not a cloud was seen to obscure the deep azure of the heavens, and the
                  whole earth was buried in silence and deep sleep. Man, and beast, and bird, and
                  fish were at rest, and their repose seemed like that of the dead. I alone was
                  awake and in motion amidst this universal torpor of Nature. I and the starry host;
                  for, though silent, their bright beams were not quenched, neither did they for a
                  moment cease their regular and never tiring dance in their spheres. And their
                  music; oh, it must have been sweet to the ear attuned to hear it; but mine was
                  deaf to every sound save the sigh of sorrow; and my weary heart, though it felt,
                  yet it heeded not their sweet harmony.
               "As I walked down the streets of a city that seemed deserted, no sounds assailed
                  my ear save those of my own footsteps on the pavement, echoed by the surrounding
                  walls; but these seemed so loud and so multiplied as to be likely to awaken the
                  sleepers, however soundly they slept. I therefore endeavored to tread more
                  lightly, which, from the nature of the shoes I wore, was a somewhat difficult
                  task. At length I cleared the town and found myself in the open country, but so
                  thinly was I clothed, and so keen and piercing was the cold, that I felt now for
                  the first time what cruel pangs the
                  naked and homeless wretch is exposed to in the severity of the winter. I attempted
                  to run, in hopes of gaining a little warmth from muscular exertion, but so thin
                  and emaciated had I become, and so stiff and benumbed were my limbs, both from my
                  long confinement and the intense cold, that I found it quite impossible to
                  continue it for a minute only. I must therefore content myself with going on
                  slowly, and endure the cold with as much patience and resolution as I could summon
                  to my aid.
               "I know not how long I may have traveled in this state of torpor and suffering,
                  when daylight began to appear. The ground was covered with a hard frost, and the
                  landscape revealed to my eyes was one of the bleakest I had ever seen. In addition
                  to the cold I now began to feel the pangs of hunger, for the keen air of the
                  morning was well calculated to produce that effect. But though I passed by houses
                  of refreshment, none of their inmates were yet stirring, and if they had been I
                  had not the means of purchasing even a morsel of bread. What could I do? I had no
                  other resource but to beg a scanty meal of the charitable; and though I shrunk
                  back with shame at the bare thought, yet when I reflected that had I not been
                  unjustly robbed of my own, I might, at least for some time longer, have been saved
                  from the humiliation it implied. But (I exclaimed to myself) let the shame rest on
                  those who have driven me to it, and upon laws which sanction what is unjust!
               "But before I could resolve to ask for alms I determined to seek some employment,
                  even in the most laborious drudgery that my delicate frame and the weakness of my
                  condition would permit me to undertake; and should I fail in this, then I
                  determined, as a last resource, to have recourse to the charity of my fellow
                  men.
               "I had scarcely formed this resolution when I observed a farm house at some little
                  distance from the main road. Thither I directed my steps, sad and dejected, but
                  urged on by the powerful cravings of hunger ger. I knocked at the door and
                  inquired for the master of the house. I was told kindly to walk in, and that he
                  would be down directly and would see me. I took my seat near a large fire that
                  burned most cheerfully in the kitchen, and the heat which I received from its
                  benign influence was gratefully diffused over my whole frame, and restored me to
                  myself and to life. Oh, how delightful are the most ordinary comforts when we have
                  long suffered under a deprivation of them! All around I saw unequivocal signs of
                  plenty. The beams of the kitchen literally groaned with the load of ham, bacon and
                  cured beef which they supported; the farm yard sent forth a merry sound from the
                  intermingling voices of the fowls, ducks, geese and turkeys which it contained;
                  and in fact everything indicated wealth and rural abundance. I augured well of the
                  master and mistress of the house from the kind looks and kind conduct of their
                  servants and dependents—even towards such a forlorn and wretched being as I was;
                  for I have invariably found, as far as my own observation has gone, that when the
                  servants in a house, whether that house be the abode of the peer or of those in
                  the middle and upper classes of life, show themselves considerate and attentive to
                  strangers of all grades and conditions, they but act at second hand the part of
                  their master; and when, on the other hand, the servants are uncivil either in
                  their words, actions or looks, they but mimic and echo those whose will they are
                  hired to obey and whose wishes it is their interest to fulfill.
               "I had only been seated a few minutes when the farmer made his appearance. He was
                  a tall man, well made, and rather inclining to be stout, though by no means more
                  than was becoming. He had a most benevolent countenance, and his voice and manner
                  were in perfect accordance with his appearance. In a mild and gentle tone he asked
                  me whether I had any particular business with him, and whether he could do
                  anything to serve me.
               "I then told him that I was a poor, miserable wretch, without a farthing in the
                  world to buy me a mouthful of bread,
                  though I was almost starving with hunger; that I was most willing to work for my
                  living in anything I was capable of doing, if I could get employment; and that,
                  seeing his house on passing along that morning, I had ventured to call, in hopes
                  of procuring something to do, for which I should consider the smallest pittance a
                  sufficient requital.
               "He surveyed me for some time, as if half-doubtful of the truth of my story; then
                  all at once he muttered aloud, as if unconsciously—
               "'Yes, it must be so! His very looks show that he has suffered from starvation,
                  and his countenance is not that of a liar!' Then aloud to the maid: 'Ho! Janet!
                  bring this young man some breakfast directly. Be quick, you jade, for he is sorely
                  in need of it.'
               "Janet was not slow in obeying the command of her master, for she seemed as eager
                  as he to do all that a benevolent heart could suggest. She quickly placed on the
                  large oaken table a round of beef, some fresh eggs, broiled ham, and the most
                  delicious tea I had ever tasted. Both she and the benevolent farmer gazed with
                  astonishment and delight at the justice which I did to their fare, and at the
                  pleasure which I enjoyed from their bounty. Had any one, even the most selfish and
                  hardened sensualist, seen the glistening eyes of the farmer and his humble
                  dependent that morning, and the internal satisfaction they derived from that which
                  gave happiness to another, though an utter stranger, he would be compelled to
                  confess that there is indeed some 'luxury in doing good.'
               "When I had finished my meal the farmer took a seat near me, and began to question
                  me as to what I could do and what I had been accustomed to do. 'But I see,' said
                  he, 'from the delicacy of your frame and the extreme whiteness and softness of
                  your hands, that you have not been much inured to the ungentle labor of the plow
                  or the spade.'
               "'I confess,' I replied, 'I have not; but I am young and willing to learn, if you
                  will have the kindness to place me under instruction, and I will demand no pay
                  till I have thoroughly learned to perform the part of a man in whatever department
                  you wish to place me. Like many others, I have been brought up too delicately, and
                  with lofty ideas of life which I had not the means to support. These I would wish
                  to unlearn now, and to acquire in their stead some honest calling that will enable
                  me to gain a living by my own exertions, independent of the world's charity, and
                  continue as I have hitherto lived—an honest man. But I entreat you,' I continued,
                  'do not question me about my parents or my former station in life, for of these I
                  can not speak, and it hurts my feelings to enter on the subject at all. If,
                  therefore, I am to enjoy your kindness and protection, let it be on this one
                  condition; in every other respect treat me as you will.'
               "'Fear not, young man,' he replied, 'I will not seek to dive into your secrets, if
                  such you have; it is enough for me to know that you are wretched, and that I can
                  be of service to you, without wounding your feelings. You may rest assured that no
                  one under my roof or in my employment shall ever mention the subject, if you wish
                  it; but the best way is to say nothing at all about it, and no one will ever think
                  of it, for wherever there is any appearance of mystery, there human curiosity will
                  be at work, trying to unravel it. But come now,' he continued, 'what do you think
                  you are fit for? I think tending sheep, under the direction of Johnny Downshire,
                  my shepherd, would not be amiss, at least for some time at first, and then if you
                  find it too inactive a mode of life you might change it for some other.'
               "'Yes,' I replied, 'with your kind permission I should very much like to learn
                  every branch of farming besides, and to work at everything in turn, in order that
                  I may become a proficient in a profession which I so much admire, and at the same
                  time furnish myself with the means of earning an honest livelihood by my skill and
                  labor.'
               "'A very laudable ambition indeed,' said the farmer, 'and one which ought to be
                  gratified as fully as possible ble.
                  Yes, it shall be done; I am determined it shall,' he continued; 'so from
                  henceforth consider yourself engaged in my service—more, however, as an apprentice
                  than a servant, for if you behave well I assure you you shall be treated as one of
                  my own family, but if not, then that moment our engagement is at an end.'
               "I thanked him kindly for his good intentions towards me, and remarked that since
                  he was good enough to give me a trial, it must be my own fault if I proved
                  unworthy of his confidence, but at the same time I hoped he would never have cause
                  to complain, and I begged that he would give me an opportunity immediately of
                  showing my gratitude and my zeal in his service by setting me to work
                  forthwith.
               "'Pooh, pooh!' he said, with a significant glance at my figure and a sportive
                  smile. 'you must lie fallow for some time, till we get you into good heart,
                  otherwise you will never produce a crop worth the mowing. No, no; such a bag of
                  bones as you are must be stall-fed before you are in condition for the knife—eh?
                  and you must get on a fleece that will stand the weather, boy, and then we will
                  try what sort of bell-metal you are made of!' So saying he went off, laughing, to
                  give an account to his wife and family of the wild and famished colt he had caught
                  that morning, and of the plan he had laid to break him in, and left me to enjoy
                  the comforts of a warm kitchen and a good breakfast, seasoned with the simple but
                  kind-hearted conversation of Janet.
               "In a very few minutes she told me all the affairs of the family, the number of
                  children of both sexes, their various dispositions, the number of men-servants and
                  of maid-servants employed, and, in short, everything she could think of, without
                  the slightest inquiry on my part. She said her mistress was both a handsome and an
                  excellent woman, and that she had two daughters as good and as amiable, and as
                  handsome, too, as herself. She told me also that their only son, having taken an
                  unconquerable liking for the sea, had gone abroad, and thereby almost broken his
                  mother's heart, and that the eldest daughter, Fanny, was soon to be married to a
                  great match in the neighborhood, one farmer Muckleworth, who was very rich; that
                  the other, Jane, had a great many admirers, but had not yet made a choice; that
                  both daughters would have a good fortune, and that we should have jolly fun in
                  dancing at their weddings.
               "She had scarcely finished this history when the farmer, whose name was Ringwood,
                  returned to the kitchen and beckoned me to follow him. I did so, and we proceeded
                  to a little back parlor, where we found his wife and two daughters seated at
                  breakfast. They rose to receive me, which they did with the greatest kindness, at
                  the same time observing my features and person with the keenest scrutiny, though
                  by no means with a vulgar stare, but gradually and as it were by stealth when they
                  imagined I was not observing them. Mrs. Ringwood did indeed seem a very kind and
                  pleasing woman; and her two daughters, though not handsome, were distinguished for
                  an expression of good nature and kind feeling in their countenance, which partook
                  both of the benevolent smile of the father and the placid, mild look of the
                  mother. They were perfectly at their ease and lady-like, and it was evident they
                  had received a good education. They all looked on me with a smile of approval
                  mingled with compassion; and when they had satisfied themselves with examining my
                  looks and occasionally questioning me, the old gentleman whispered to me that I
                  had better accompany him now to the tailor's, in order that I might be equipped in
                  a manner suitable to my new duties. I therefore took my leave of the ladies with a
                  low bow, which was cordially returned, and then I followed Mr. Ringwood to the
                  tailor's, where I was measured for a new suit of clothes, which were to be ready
                  as soon as possible.
               "In a few days I was decked out in a new suit of clothes, which, though coarse,
                  were very well adapted to that cold season of the year; and now, expressing my
                  wish to be employed immediately, I was placed under the tuition of John Downshire, the shepherd,
                  whom I found to be not only a kind but a very agreeable companion, taking all
                  things into consideration. He possessed a fund of legendary lore and of anecdote,
                  and had a very happy manner of telling his stories, which served to beguile the
                  long winter evenings and to turn what was irksome in my novel pursuit into a
                  source of pleasure and delight. He soon became very partial to me because I
                  received his instructions eagerly and profited by them so well that in a very
                  short time he pronounced me as capable of managing a flock and preserving them
                  from the various diseases incident to cattle and sheep as himself or any man in
                  the country. He was, like myself, fond of music, and often, as the season advanced
                  and the spring began to grow genial, have we made the fields re-echo with our
                  strains, playing and singing in concert, for he had an exquisite though
                  uncultivated voice, which I taught him to modulate so as to accompany my flute
                  beautifully in a short time.
               "But I did not rest satisfied with knowing how to manage a flock. I put my hand to
                  the plow, the spade, the axe and the scythe; and when the yellow harvest waved its
                  golden locks in the breeze I manfully took up my sickle and mingled with the
                  foremost in this interesting though severe rural labor, until I became an adept in
                  every species of husbandry. The management of bees also claimed a portion of my
                  attention, with the cultivation of flowers and gardening generally. The manuring
                  and enriching of soils, liming, draining, the planting of trees, and the breeding
                  of horses and cows, the operations of the dairy and the tenants of the farm
                  yard—in short, every department comprised within the knowledge of the farmer, was
                  studied by me with unremitting attention, and I labored at all in turn with my own
                  hands; and that labor was amply compensated, not only by the approbation of my
                  employer and the esteem and kind attention of his family, but by the fund of
                  knowledge which I gained of things and of persons, and the feeling of noble
                  independence pendence with which it inspired me. I felt that though moving in an
                  humble sphere of life, I was of some utility in the world and of service to my
                  fellow men, and not spending my time in listless idleness, like the children of
                  wealth and luxury, but in accordance with the will of my Creator, who, knowing
                  that it would promote the good of fallen man to labor, pronounced the merciful
                  sentence upon him, saying: 'In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till
                  thou return unto the ground.'
               "At no period of my life had I felt so much at ease as at that I am now speaking
                  of, and my happiness would have been complete had it not been for the remembrance
                  of the past. My history previous to my last meeting with McArdle had been involved
                  in such obscurity as to be a perpetual source of torment to me from the first
                  moment I could reason upon it or feel my position. I knew not how it might turn
                  out, though I hoped for the best, and therefore I lived in perpetual dread of the
                  worst also, for hope is inseparable from fear; but the moment all was made known
                  to me I knew the worst that could happen, and though the blow was a terrible one,
                  yet when I recovered from the violent reaction of its first impulse I determined
                  to bear it manfully. Labor, instead of being an evil, I felt would be the greatest
                  blessing, for it might teach me in some measure to forget the woes of the past by
                  keeping my attention occupied on the pressing necessities of the present; and this
                  was fully realized by experience. The constant attention which I was now obliged
                  to devote to a multiplicity of objects, and the interest which I took in
                  everything around me began to wean my mind from the contemplation of the past, and
                  in a certain degree to lull it into repose. I now looked on by-gone scenes as it
                  were in a dream. I had fallen from some high eminence, or was disappointed in my
                  attempt to possess myself of some precious jewel, but I awoke to reality and found
                  it only a phantom of the imagination! My aim now was to forget all about that, and
                  to conform to my true condition in life, in which fortune tune, but for one of her freaks, would originally
                  have placed me.
               "I had now been about nine months with the good Farmer Ringwood, and so rapidly
                  had the time glided away that its flight seemed to me almost imperceptible. I had
                  witnessed almost every operation—of putting in the crop, of weeding it, and of
                  reaping the harvest, and in that one season I had learned the management of a farm
                  so completely that the farmer declared he had never witnessed anything so
                  extraordinary in the whole course of his life, and that if I persevered in the
                  course I had begun I could not fail to become eventually a prosperous man. I was
                  informed, too, by my kind friend, Janet, that I was looked upon with a favorable
                  eye by others of the family besides her master and mistress, which indeed I knew
                  too well already; for it was with no little pain that I had remarked the interest
                  which the farmer's younger daughter, Miss Jane, took in my welfare from the first
                  moment of our acquaintance, though no word of courtship had ever passed between
                  us; and it may be well believed that, far from paying her any attention, I
                  discouraged her advances by every means in my power, for I could not forget the
                  merits of her whom I loved more than life, nor, if I could even do that, could I
                  forget the oath which I had sworn in her presence and that of all-seeing Heaven!
                  At first I hoped that this passion on her part, if discouraged on mine, would in
                  due time work itself out, and be thought of no more. But I was mistaken. At every
                  opportunity she threw herself in my way for the purpose of conversing with me. At
                  dinner and our other meals her eyes were riveted upon me, and I sometimes detected
                  a tear stealing down her cheek as she gazed upon me with a mingled look of
                  pleasure and pain. I could not help feeling for her. I could even have loved her
                  had not my heart been so completely filled with a passion which time could not
                  dislodge, however it might mitigate its effects, and I reasoned with myself that
                  the best way to insure her peace of mind would be for me to quit the house of her
                  father and seek some other master, though I might not hope to find his equal.
                  However, I determined to sacrifice my own interest for the happiness of his child,
                  and though he might blame me for ingratitude I thought he would be well satisfied
                  with my conduct when he should know the motives which impelled me to adopt it,
                  which, however, out of tenderness for her, I did not intend to tell him at
                  present, but to make some other excuse for the course I was about to pursue.
               "But there was another cause besides, which urged me to this step, and that was a
                  certain restlessness of disposition which would not allow me to remain entirely
                  satisfied with my new condition. I had learnt every thing there was to be known,
                  and I could not bear the idea of sitting down quietly to a drudgery and routine of
                  the same kind without any variation. As long as there was anything new to engross
                  the mind, and keep it in active employment, so long was I perfectly satisfied; but
                  when this ceased, which from the confined circle of the pursuits in which I had
                  been occupied, must soon be the case, there was little to make me feel an interest
                  in it any longer. The motives which actuate the great mass of men in that sphere
                  of life were entirely wanting to me; I mean the desire of gain and a permanent
                  establishment. To me that inactivity and torpor of mind which must succeed the
                  novelty and attraction of a new pursuit were, even in prospect, intolerable; and I
                  resolved to seek for excitement, without which I found my whole energies would
                  dwindle away to nothing, and become worse than useless. Whether this was a feeling
                  peculiar to myself, or common to all of the same temperament, I cannot undertake
                  to say, but I should think the latter the more likely. What right, I thought, had
                  I to enjoy the calm and tranquil sunshine of life? What had I, in common with
                  those around me that could influence me to imitate their example or to think with
                  them? Nothing! I felt, therefore, that I must encounter the storms of the world,
                  for which fate seemed to have ordained me, and that in mingling with my fellow
                  men, and exposing myself to their
                  contumely and rebuffs, I was only fulfilling my destiny which it were worse than
                  vain to oppose.
               "Impelled, therefore, by these various and conflicting considerations, I sought an
                  interview with my kind master and in as delicate a manner as possible, and with
                  every demonstration of the most lively gratitude, imparted to him the resolution
                  which I had just formed, without, however, mentioning any of the reasons which
                  urged me to the step. At first, indeed, he seemed surprised, but soon collecting
                  himself, he said:
               "Well, Hardy," for that was the new name I had assumed, "I need not wonder that
                  such is your determination; and if I had had as much sense as I ought, I should
                  not have so fondly counted on your staying very long amongst us. You are worthy of
                  a far different sphere of life, and are well calculated to adorn any. I had hoped,
                  however," he added, "that your stay would have been longer than it is likely to
                  be, and that we should not so soon lose the pleasure of your society; but pursue
                  your own course, and follow that which you may deem agreeable to your interests,
                  and I shall be happy to do all in my power to assist you, either by word or deed;
                  you may always rely upon me as a friend."
               "I thanked him for this additional proof of his kindness, enumerating at the same
                  time all the benefits I had already received at his hands, from the time that he
                  confidentially received me, a poor, forlorn, and penniless outcast, into his
                  house, till that moment, and declared that the memory of his goodness and
                  confidence should never be obliterated from my mind. As to bettering my condition
                  by leaving your service," I continued, "that is very doubtful, indeed, for I may
                  travel long before I meet with such a master, and as yet I know of no one who
                  would require my services. The truth is," I added, "that I am a miserable and
                  restless man, and that perhaps I am only rushing on to my own destruction!"
               "Oh, then," he replied, "if that is the case, let me entreat you to remain, at
                  least till you have some place to go to, and do not again throw yourself naked
                  upon the world, lest you should be reduced to extremeties still worse than when
                  you entered my house. Let me beg of you to remain, and the moment any thing offers
                  that will suit your purpose, you shall be dismissed with my blessing and many
                  thanks for your zeal in my service, and the interest you have taken in my
                  prosperity."
               "For that I am more than amply repaid already," I replied, "by the knowledge I
                  have gained in your service, and the kind and indulgent treatment I have
                  experienced from you and your family; and as to the danger of exposing myself to
                  the chance of difficulties, that is the very thing I am sighing for. I want
                  excitement, and I cannot have this unless I am placed in circumstances of
                  difficulty and danger. Do not, therefore, my kind and worthy friend, give yourself
                  any uneasiness concerning me. I am the child of caprice and the sport of fortune,
                  and must fulfill my destiny."
               "Well," he said, "if you are determined, I will not oppose your wish; but always
                  remember that you have a friend in time of need in old farmer Ringwood, and a
                  shelter under his roof, should you ever require one." While he spoke, I saw a tear
                  spring to his eye, which he dashed away, and seizing me by the hand, while I was
                  thanking him again and again, he exclaimed: "No more of this, Hardy; it is too
                  much for me, and I cannot endure it! I know not how it is, but I always feel a
                  kind of silly weakness when likely to part from a friend. Well, God bless you
                  whensoever and where ever you go."
               "I was so overcome with the earnest, kind manner of his address that I could not
                  utter a word in reply, but turning away to hide a tear that was glistening in my
                  eye, I was relieved from my embarrassment on finding, when I turned round again,
                  that he had been called off on some business. Before this, however, we had arranged that I should take my
                  departure on that day month.
               "When my resolution was made known to the family and the farm servants, it created
                  much surprise and sorrow, but particularly with my kind friend and companion, John
                  Downshire, the shepherd, who was affected even to tears when he was assured of its
                  truth. The good-natured Janet, too, was grieved to hear that which, at first, she
                  would not believe, for she thought it would be impossible for me to resist the
                  attraction of a young and pleasing girl who loved me, and who possessed the
                  additional charm of a good substantial fortune. But poor Janet knew little of my
                  feelings, or the motives which regulated my conduct.
               "At length the day of my departure arrived; when having bidden a warm farewell to
                  all my friends, and having thanked Mr. and Mrs. Ringwood and their daughters,
                  (poor Miss Jane was bathed in tears, and her eyes were swollen and red, which
                  effects of sorrow she in vain endeavored to conceal,) I took up my little bundle
                  containing some changes of linen and a good suit of decent Sunday clothes and
                  departed from the only place where I had ever enjoyed true happiness for any
                  length of time. Besides a good wardrobe, I also possessed a small sum of money,
                  which, being the fruits of my own industry, of the labors of my hands, and the
                  sweat of my brow, I prized more than all I had ever before possessed.
               "It was a sweet autumnal day in the early part of October when I took my
                  departure. The morning was clear, and there was an exhilirating freshness and
                  buoyancy in the air, which quickly dispelled the melancholy of my mind in parting
                  from those with whom I had become familiar by a friendly intercourse for upwards
                  of nine months. The trees, though beginning to exhibit signs of the season, still
                  retained much of their verdure and beauty; and the fields and meadows, relieved of
                  the bountiful harvest which they had yielded to the husbandman, smiled in repose
                  under the influence of the genial light, like a man who reposes after the fatigues
                  of the day, or the mind of the scholar which takes the needful relaxation after a
                  hard-fought and victorious collegiate campaign. Herds of fair cattle were browsing
                  peacefully everywhere around, and sheep let loose from their pens seemed to exult
                  in their boundless freedom over the open plains; for, instead of grazing and
                  eating down the grass as they proceeded, the leaders of the flock would just
                  nibble a mouthful here and there, under the pretence of feeding, but in reality to
                  gratify their ambition for ruling their mates and leading them where they chose;
                  and these followed first in twos, then in threes, and in still more extended
                  files, until the whole exhibited one mathematical figure of a spheroidal form,
                  which kept pace with their chief as regularly as an army obeys the voice of its
                  commander and the prescribed step of time. Here and there were to be seen enclosed
                  paddocks tenanted by draught horses, let loose to rest and fatten after the toils
                  of the year; and sometimes a foal sporting round its mother, and on the slightest
                  alarm erecting its mane and tail, and scampering off with a graceful motion for
                  some little distance from its dame, then turning round to listen for a moment, and
                  to see the cause of its fear, and then again hastening back to her in the same
                  graceful manner. It ever kept hovering around her in a certain circle, as if it
                  was held by an invisible chain of which she was the centre, and so she is, for
                  that chain is the bond of nature, stronger than any material tie, and more certain
                  is its operation than chains of iron, brass or gold. In a distant field a solitary
                  plow would sometimes be seen preparing the soil for the crop of the coming year;
                  but its movements, slow and measured, seemed to speak of repose and the absence of
                  all hurry, as if to signify that there was time enough yet to come in which to do
                  the necessary labor without pressing either man or beast, who, in order to avoid
                  total idleness, appeared to be rather voluntarily employed for their own amusement
                  and recreation, than that there was any thing to be done which required particular
                  attention. Then came the homestead,
                  with its immense ricks of hay and corn, near which the farmer was to be seen with
                  his hands in his pockets and a smile on his countenance, as if fully satisfied
                  that his winter's store was safely housed, and that the labors of the long year
                  were not in vain. Yet, sometimes, mingled with the smile, was to be noticed a
                  sudden start of fear lest his precious heaps should become the prey of the
                  merciless incendiary, who, like a malignant spirit, prowls about in the dark with
                  his hidden fire, seeking what he may destroy. Then appeared the orchard, bending
                  down to the earth under its load of fruits, which it required the aid of props to
                  enable it to sustain; and now the sound of the flail, the vans, and the other
                  implements necessary for preparing the grain for market were distinctly to be
                  heard, and mingled harmoniously with the other sights and sounds which give a
                  variety and a peculiar interest to the labors of rustic life at this season of the
                  year.
               "Next would appear the broad and stately park of the squire, or the noble, the
                  resident proprietor of the soil; then his mansion would gleam on the sight through
                  an avenue of stately trees, where perhaps he himself would be seen in the honest
                  pride of his worth, with his gun and his dogs, just going out in pursuit of the
                  wild tenants of the hills; or perhaps mounted on his hunter, which bounds and
                  springs forward at the cheering sound of the huntsman horn, or the wild echo of
                  the pack reverberated from the hills. Then on each side were to be heard the
                  frequent sounds of the gun, which, perhaps, at every shot brought down a bleeding
                  victim to the earth; or in the distance was to be seen the pack in full cry at the
                  heels of reynard, and followed close by the venturous and the brave, whom no
                  obstacles could impede in this eager pursuit until both sight and sound vanished
                  in the distance, and nothing was left but the brilliant image on the mind. 
                     
                        "Then came still evening on and twilight gray,
                        Had in her sober livery all things clad,"
                     
                   when the sun had sunk beneath the horizon and tinged the clouds with a purple
                  hue, and silence and sweet repose reigned over the whole earth. What a picture was
                  there presented to the eye! It cannot be described, but may perhaps be faintly
                  shadowed forth in the language of the poet: 
                     
                        
                           "And others soft and sweet,
                           As the mild eve in autumn, when the sky
                           Is melted towards the west to one broad sea,
                           All crimsoned as of roses; and their hues
                           Fade imperceptibly; each beauteous shade
                           More lovely than the last, more delicate,
                           Until the whole bright vision dies away,
                           And darkness drops its curtain o'er the scene."
                        
                     
                     A Day in May, Book 5th.
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIX.
               THE ADVERTISEMENT.
               ON the evening of such an autumnal day, wearied with the exertion of walking, but
                  soothed in mind by the repose and beauty of the objects I had witnessed in its
                  course, I arrived at a small country inn, where I proposed remaining for the
                  night. There was an air of cleanliness and comfort about the place which, though
                  by no means uncommon in England, I hardly expected to meet with on that retired
                  and unfrequented line of road—for I have always preferred by-ways and green, shady
                  walks and footpaths to the open and frequented roads, whenever I have traveled
                  alone and not been in haste to arrive at my journey's end. I ordered some supper,
                  consisting of fresh eggs, butter, and a sallad; and while I was sitting alone,
                  waiting its being served, I happened to take up a Liverpool paper that was lying
                  there, and my eye fell upon an advertisement in its columns, for a gentleman to
                  undertake the principal desk, after Christmas, in a classical school in or near
                  that town, to whom a liberal salary would be given if he could furnish suitable
                  testimonials as to ability, character, etc. It immediately occurred to me that
                  such a situation might perhaps suit me, if I could procure the necessary
                  testimonials, but under my present peculiar circumstances that was quite
                  impossible. I resolved, however, to pursue my way direct for Liverpool, and if I
                  could get employment in a school there it would be well, if not I could easily, I
                  thought, procure employment in some other way, as there were but few things which
                  would come amiss to me, and accordingly I arrived in that town on the evening of
                  the next day, without meeting with any adventure worth relating.
               "My first care on arriving in that huge seaport was to seek for some cheap
                  lodgings, as my means were very scanty, and I knew not how long I might be out of
                  employment. It was necessary, therefore, to husband my little money with all care
                  and precaution. I searched long before I could find a place suitable to my taste
                  and my purse at the same time. There were two classes of lodgings that might suit
                  my means, but it was a difficult matter to find one amongst them that had any
                  pretensions to cleanliness or comfort. One class were dark cellars, of which there
                  are great numbers in this town. It is stated that there are upwards of seven
                  thousand eight hundred, occupied by more than thirty-nine thousand persons, being
                  one-fifth of all the working classes in that town. This would give on an average
                  five persons to each cellar; but some of them are far more crowded, containing
                  eight or ten persons each, huddled together like sheep, and for these they pay
                  about one shilling each per week, if they are lodgers. The next class of lodgings
                  are those occupied by poor people, but not so crowded together as the others,
                  where each lodger pays about two shillings weekly, and they sleep two in a bed. It
                  was one of these that I took the first evening of my arrival. No references were
                  either sought of or required by me. The person who kept the house was the wife of
                  a sailor who had been absent for several years. She had one son grown up, who was
                  apprenticed to a ship-carpenter, but had gone away from his master to America two
                  or three times, though he had now returned. With this youth it was arranged that I
                  should sleep. There were no other lodgers in the house. I soon found that the
                  mistress of the house was a great gin-drinker; but I did not suspect her honesty
                  at first, till I began to perceive that whenever I changed a sovereign (I had just
                  six altogether) the money disappeared in a manner for which I could not account, and I began to grow very
                  uneasy about it. Both her son and I were very sound sleepers, and it was requisite
                  for her to come into the room early every morning, in order to rouse him to go to
                  work in the docks, and I determined to watch whether she went near my clothes to
                  take money from them as I suspected. But it was a long time before I could detect
                  her, though my money was going fast. At length, when it was all nearly gone, I
                  awoke one morning with anxiety about the future, when I heard the door open softly
                  and saw the old wretch steal gently to where her son's clothes and mine were
                  thrown together on one chair. She removed his, and, coming to mine, began to put
                  her hand into the trousers' pocket, when I leaped out of bed and seized her in the
                  act.
               "'Bless me, child! what is the matter with you? You almost frightened me to
                  death!' she said in a calm tone, quite unconscious, seemingly, of doing anything
                  wrong.
               "'You wretch!' I said, 'you have been robbing me for a long time, and I have
                  caught you at last!'
               "'You are mad!' she replied; 'why, man, I was only looking for my son's trousers,
                  to mend them before he goes out; and look! here they are, still in my hand, just
                  as I first took them up! You must be dreaming!'
               "And certainly when I examined more closely it was her son's trousers, and not
                  mine, which she held in her hand. I did not know what to say, but held down my
                  head, unwilling even to look her in the face.
               "'You may well be ashamed of yourself!' she said. 'But, howsomever, I don't want
                  such folk in my house, so you may cut your stick as soon as ye likes from here. No
                  one hever suspected me afore. You shan't sleep any more here, I'll warrant!' So
                  saying, she slammed to the door and departed in a rage, forgetting to awaken her
                  'dear John,' as she called her son.
               "But the latter, hearing the clatter of her tongue, and thinking she had come to
                  scold him out of bed, began to move, opened one eye and then the other, then,
                  stretching himself and yawning so as to be heard across the street, inquired,
                  seeing me up and half-dressed, what was the matter.
               "'Nothing particular,' I said. 'I have lost some money out of my trousers' pocket
                  occasionally, and I wished to find out the thief, but I fear I have been
                  mistaken.'
               "'The ould woman has taken it,' said Jack. 'I can't keep a penny for her unless I
                  lock it up, and even then she contrives to get at it by some devil's trick or
                  other. On my soul I believe she's an ould witch, though she is my mother!'
               "'Well, John,' said I, 'let this matter rest for the present, and remember she is
                  your mother.'
               "I forgot to mention to you (continued Harcourt) that soon after my arrival in
                  Liverpool I wrote again to the schoolmaster, and in due course received an answer.
                  He stated in his letter that if I proved sufficiently qualified to attend to the
                  duties of his school, it was all he required, and that he would be glad to see me
                  on the following day.
               "Next day, accordingly, I called upon him, and I had the good fortune to please
                  him. We agreed for a certain sum—indeed I may as well tell you the sum at once; I
                  was to receive forty pounds a year, with board and lodging. According to the
                  suggestion of a friend, I endeavored to stipulate also for washing, but this he
                  would not concede. I agreed to his terms, however, and was very well satisfied,
                  and thankful to Heaven for giving me the means of getting an honest livelihood by
                  my own exertions."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XX.
               THE POOR LABORERS.
               IT yet wanted several weeks of the re-opening of the school, when, as I have
                  already stated, I found myself almost destitute of money, owing to the dishonesty
                  of some one, but whether of Mrs. Sweetbriar or not I was not quite certain, though
                  I had strong suspicions. This was a very awkward predicament, and I scarcely knew
                  how to act. I thought of several means of getting some money in the mean time,
                  none of which would answer my purpose. At last I communicated my circumstances to
                  my friend, Jack Sweetbriar.
               "'Make yourself aisy,' said he, 'you can live here, any how, till the time comes
                  for going to work (meaning the school), and you can pay the ould'ooman when you
                  gets the blunt; and as for the pocket money, you shall have share with me.'
               "'Why, Jack,' I replied, 'you are only an apprentice as yet, and havn't got much
                  to spare, and your mother is too poor and too fond of gin to be either able or
                  willing to do as you say. Indeed I could not think of such a thing, even if it was
                  convenient for her; and as for robbing you of your trifle of wages, that I cannot
                  think of. No, no! I can work, if I could get any thing to do in the mean time. Do
                  you think I could get employment, Jack?'
               "'I don't know that,' he replied; 'it requires interest with the lumpers or ship
                  captains, who are a set of vile scamps and employ none but blustering Irish
                  wagrants, who won't allow any but their own countrymen men to be employed; or if
                  they do, they lead him such a devilish life that he is soon glad to get away from
                  them. I wud advise you not to try it at all,' continued Jack, 'but to stay quietly
                  where you are till you are wanted at the school. Working in the docks will spile
                  your clothes, dirty and blacken your ands, and make you unfit for anything
                  genteel. Take my advice and don't try it at all.'
               "'But, Jack,' I replied, 'I have got working clothes with me, and as for blacking
                  my hands and making them rough or hard, that doesn't matter. It is no disgrace,
                  Jack, to have hands hardened with honest labor; besides, I have been used to it
                  lately, and I prefer work to idleness.'
               "'Do you?' says Jack. 'Well, now that's quare enough! By my soul, I'd rather play
                  than work any day of the week, and Sunday into the bargain. But as you say you
                  like work, I see no reason why you should be deprived of the sport, if you can get
                  it and be paid for it. That is the difficulty. Do you know anybody in town who
                  might plead for you with some fat, ill-fared lumper?'
               "'Not a soul!' I replied.
               "'Then I don't see much chance for you. I'll tell you what you might do though.
                  Take a spade in your and, put on your working clothes and go down towards the
                  docks at six o'clock in the morning, and stand amongst the men waiting to be
                  himployed there, or at Nelson's monument, in the exchange, and take your chance
                  with the rest. Some one may take pity on you, and give you a day's work.'
               "'But if Mr. Lovechild should happen to see me there, Jack, what would he
                  say?'
               "'Him see you! not lackely! God bless you! nobody ever lucks at poor laborers,
                  except them has wants to ire them, and then it is only to see wether they are
                  strong and sturdy, and able to do their work.'
               "'Do you think I have a chance, Jack?'
               "'I don't know; you luck too slim and genteel like. If anyone does employ you they will give but little
                  wages."
               "'That's very consolatory, Jack; but can you tell me what I can get a spade
                  for?'
               "'I don't exactly know. I don't dale in them are kind of tools; but I should think
                  you might get one for five or six shillin.'
               "'Well, then, I've just got the price of one, with a shilling or two besides, and
                  this is my whole fortune. I will buy a spade and try my luck.'
               "Accordingly I went out that evening and bought a very good, new spade, and rose
                  early next morning, dressed in my working clothes, and directed my steps, with a
                  sick heart, towards the exchange, in hopes of meeting with a day's work.
               "It was a dull, dark December morning, and I could with difficulty find my way
                  through the narrow streets and lanes I had to pass, till I came to the mart, where
                  I was to set myself up to the highest bidder for my services during the day. As I
                  passed along the empty streets I could not help reflecting on the loneliness and
                  desolation of my condition, and the instability of human affairs and the strange
                  inequality in the various states of men. In the quarter I had just left were
                  thousands of human beings doomed, like myself to wretchedness and toil, and
                  unable, even if they would, to extricate themselves from an atmosphere of
                  degradation and sin. In that into which I soon came were splendid houses, whose
                  inmates, like the gods on the top of Parnassus or starry Olympus, enjoyed and
                  revelled in all the blessings of life, undisturbed except by imaginary evils, and
                  these were of their own creation. Yet what peculiar merits did these possess to
                  render them apparently the objects of God's bounty and abundance, or in what were
                  the others deficient to doom them to the perpetual torments of poverty and
                  despair? Was the Lord of the universe a partial or unjust judge, or did he frown
                  without a cause on his innocent children? It could not be. There was, I justly
                  concluded, wisdom, justice and mercy in His chastisements, which the future would
                  sufficiently develop, and I bowed my head in meekness to the yoke which, doubtless
                  for my own good, he then imposed upon me.
               "I arrived at length at the exchange, where I found already a few ill-clad,
                  shivering wretches, with pale faces and hungry looks, waiting to be employed, and
                  assuming as cheerful and resigned a look as possible, I joined them.
               "We soon entered into conversation with each other, but I could hear nothing but
                  murmurs and complaints. What I heard from them almost disgusted me with human
                  life, human pride, and human degradation. Several told me that they had been
                  standing there for whole weeks together without meeting with a soul to employ them
                  or even to glance at them, and if it had not been for the goodness of God, who
                  supplied them some way or other with food,—they scarcely knew how,—they must have
                  perished with hunger! There were several old men amongst them, and they complained
                  that the young and active were always employed in preference to them; and again
                  the young complained that they could not earn enough to supply the simplest wants
                  of nature.
               "The morning now began to get brighter and the exchange to be somewhat more
                  frequented than when I first arrived. Many a smart, well dressed clerk, hurried
                  past us going to his office, or neat dress-maker to her work, without even casting
                  a glance towards the poor, despised laborers! We were joined, too, every few
                  minutes by more of our brethren in misfortune, which rendered our chance of
                  employment proportionately less. At length a very important little gentleman made
                  his appearance among us. This caused a sensation on 'change and my companions
                  crowded round him, touching their hats and putting themselves forward, each in
                  hopes that he would be fortunate enough to be chosen. I alone had not yet learned
                  those arts. The great man glanced around him with an experienced eye, and having
                  picked out six of the stoutest young
                  men he could find, he walked away, bidding them to follow him; but alas! I was not
                  amongst the number. I had, however, many companions in misfortune, which they say
                  is a consolation; but I cannot say I found it so, for there were several there
                  whom I should like to have seen employed, even in preference to myself. One old
                  man in particular, who, when the morning was already far advanced and there
                  remained small hope of employment for that day, threw himself down on the steps of
                  the statue in an agony of despair, wringing his hands and weeping most bitterly. I
                  pitied him from my heart and tried to console him. I found that he had been a
                  respectable farmer in his day in Ireland, but owing to the termination of his
                  lease and the rack rent he was consequently forced to pay by his tyrannical
                  landlord, he was soon reduced from affluence to beggary.
               "'I would not care so much for myself,' said the old man, 'I can bear privation
                  and suffering, but for my poor son and my wife and two daughters, who are in a
                  state of starvation in our poor lodgings and unable to do anything, for they are
                  only just recovering from illness, and God knows what will become of them! What
                  makes the matter still worse,' said he, 'they have all been well brought up, and
                  not accustomed to hardships or hunger till lately, and now they have plenty of
                  both,' and here the poor old man was unable to proceed from weeping.
               "'Here,' said I, 'take these two shillings. It is all I have in the world, except
                  my new spade. But do take them, and as far as they will go procure food for you
                  family. I have no one but myself to provide for, and I am young and able to work,
                  thank Heaven!'
               "'May Heaven reward you,' said the old man, his eyes beaming with joy through his
                  tears. 'May Heaven reward you, and it will reward you for this! You have saved the
                  life of a whole family and given gladness to the heart of a poor old man, who,
                  with that whole family, will never cease to pray for you and bless you!'
               "Having thus expressed his gratitude, he was preparing to depart when one of those
                  men called navigators came up and addressed me, inquiring what I could do.
               "I told him what I had been accustomed to, but that I had no objection to try my
                  hand at anything he chose to put me to.
               "'You are but slim,' he said, 'and hardly fit for the work, which requires
                  strength and agility. It is wheeling barrows of mud across a plank in the docks,
                  and requires a steady hand as well as head, for if you became dizzy or missed your
                  footing, your brains would be dashed out instantly.'
               "'I am willing to try it,' I replied. 'I think I have a steady hand and head too;
                  but if I fail it will, at all events, be my own fault, and I alone will have to
                  suffer the consequences.'
               "'Well, I engage you; but mind you have been forewarned of the danger. I want
                  another man.'
               "'Oh!' said I, 'engage this poor man; I will vouch for his willingness to do all
                  he can.'
               "'What, that old man! why he would be of no use whatever. The person I want must
                  be able to wheel the barrows in turn with you, for it would be too much for one to
                  wheel the barrow every time. My plan is that one should fill while the other
                  wheels, and that alternately.'
               "'Well,' I replied, 'engage him at all events. I will undertake to wheel all the
                  barrows, and he may fill them, which will be lighter work; and, moreover, if we do
                  not do between us as much work as any two men you have in your employment, then
                  you may stop it out of our wages.'
               "'Well, with that understanding I will engage him. Come along both of you. I must
                  tell you, young man, (addressing me,) that I have lost a man this morning already
                  on the job you are going to undertake. But then, as the work is rather dangerous,
                  I give higher wages than usual.'
               
               "'Lost a man!' I inquired in amazement; 'what do you mean?'
               "'It was entirely his own fault; he was careless and fell off the plank, and was
                  killed; but there is not much danger if you take proper care.'
               "We now arrived at the docks and were set to work. It was indeed a fearful
                  undertaking, and few could be found to attempt it, except those whose
                  circumstances were desperate, or who, like me, were almost weary of life, for I
                  cannot conceal from you the fact that I was now quite disgusted with existence and
                  almost hoped that that day might be my last on earth.
               "The other workmen stared at us in amazement as we entered upon our arduous
                  duties, and there was almost a suspension of labor for some time till they saw me
                  overcome the difficulties of my dangerous position, which I will endeavor to
                  describe to you.
               "You must have observed that a large quantity of mud and sand is carried into and
                  deposited in the docks with every tide. This would soon accumulate in such
                  quantities as to stop them up altogether if it was not removed. There are certain
                  men called navigators, or lumpers, who contract with the companies to remove it,
                  but as they are generally very ignorant, and entirely uneducated, their method of
                  proceeding is often awkward and unscientific. In this instance it was particularly
                  so.
               "The mud was raised up from the bottom by means of several platforms, one raised
                  above the other, so that the men below threw it up a stage to those above, who
                  again advanced it a stage, till it arrived at the top, where it was wheeled off in
                  barrows, over planks most awkwardly arranged, which rendered it extremely unsafe
                  for those who were employed in wheeling it, which happened to be my lot at this
                  particular time. This plank was at least twenty feet from the bottom of the dock,
                  which was quite bare underneath, so that the flags appeared and rendered a fall
                  upon them instantly fatal. The plank, or rather planks (for there were two in
                  breadth) were sufficienly broad for the purpose, but then they shook so, from the
                  elasticity of the boards, to overcome which no means had been used, as to render
                  it extremely perilous for any one to attempt to cross, even with an empty barrow.
                  This I instantly perceived the very first trip I made, and I saw at once how it
                  might be remedied with very little trouble and expense, so as to render it as safe
                  as any other part of the work, for I had, both at school and college, paid
                  sufficient attention to mechanics as to enable me to understand much more
                  complicated matters than this. I therefore immediately went to my employer and
                  told him how it might be remedied. At first he started as if in doubt, but being a
                  man of an acute perception naturally, he very soon saw I was right, and instantly
                  adopted my suggestion, which it did not require more than an hour's work to put
                  into execution, with the aid of a carpenter and a couple of transverse pieces of
                  wood, and this done, the labor afterwards became quite easy.
               "Even the old man now ventured across with the barrow, which he did with the
                  greatest safety, and the other men were astonished at the change which had been
                  effected so suddenly, merely by the use of one upright and a couple of cross-bars,
                  which they all said a child might have discovered, but which none of them ever
                  dreamed of till they saw it before their eyes, and then of course any of them
                  could have done it!
               "My poor old companion was now in much better spirits, since he could relieve me,
                  as he expressed it, by taking on himself a share of my toil, and something of the
                  energy of youth seemed to have been awakened in his heart. We had not much time to
                  talk, it is true, but occasionally we would exchange thoughts when we came in
                  contact with each other and our taskmaster turned his attention elsewhere. On one
                  of these occasions the old man said to me in a low tone:
               "Look at that young man there on the bank; how attentively he gazes on our labor,
                  as if he wished to be a participator in it!"
               "What! that young gentleman?" I replied. "He a partaker of our toil! Fortune has been more
                  favorable to him than to render misery and degradation necessary to prolong a
                  wretched existence. And yet, when I look at him again, he does not seem entirely
                  free from the common lot of humanity, sorrow and suffering. But what are the
                  sufferings of the rich compared with the tortures of the poor! They are only as a
                  single drop of water in the immense ocean; as one sand compared with the
                  innumerable millions on the sea shore!"
               "How deceitful are appearances!" said he. "I can assure you that the young man you
                  see before you is more truly wretched at this moment, both in mind and body, than
                  either of us, if that be possible."
               "What," said I, "do you happen to know him?"
               "Don't be astonished; don't look at him when I tell you that is my own son!"
               "What!" I exclaimed, "dressed like a gentleman! while you and your family are
                  starving, and while you are working here like a slave! Why, it is intolerable; and
                  a young man, too!"
               "When you know all," said the old man, "you will both love and pity him; but I
                  cannot tell you now. You will come home to my lodgings, and share the meal which
                  your own goodness has procured for me and mine, and as we go along I will tell you
                  all; and the dinner hour will soon be here now."
               "Presently the bell rang for dinner, and having slipped on my coat, I accompanied
                  my new acquaintance towards his home; and while we went along, he told me the
                  following brief history of his son, in explanation of what I had seen:
               "In common with my other children, I gave this youth a good education in the time
                  of my prosperity. As he was quick at learning, and seemed to have extraordinary
                  talents, I resolved to bring him up to one of the learned professions, but before
                  I could accomplish it adversity overtook me. I was not slow in informing him of
                  his altered prospects, and he instantly determined on a plan for himself.
               "'Father,' he said, 'I can easily foresee how affairs must turn out with you in a
                  few years. I will therefore be no longer a burden to you, but endeavor to do
                  something for myself; and I fear the time will soon come when both you and the
                  rest of the family may stand in need of my utmost exertions. It is therefore
                  better to try my luck in time, and if I fail I must learn to endure
                  disappointment.'
               "Though loth to part with my only son in whom I had placed all my hopes, I could
                  say nothing to dissuade him from his manly purpose, so both I and his mother and
                  sisters acquiesced in his wish, and though nearly heartbroken with grief, we
                  suffered him to tear himself from our embrace. He came to England, and after many
                  vicissitudes, he at last got an engagement as clerk in a merchants' office in this
                  town, at a good salary, where he was happy to have it in his power to relieve our
                  necessities; for already we were reduced to the utmost poverty, and but for him,
                  God knows, what would have become of us."
               "The moment, however, he found himself comfortably situated, he sent for us, and
                  we all came over here two years ago, where we have lived ever since in happiness
                  and comfort, with the means which he furnished us with till about three months
                  ago, when, from over attention to business, he was taken ill, and forced to resign
                  his situation. Ever since that time he has lingered and pined away, and we feared
                  at first he would not be long spared to us. Having been so kind to us, he was
                  unable to save anything for this emergency, and we were all involved in his
                  calamity. First, poverty assailed us, and then disease, its usual attendant; and
                  in a short time I was the only one left in health to minister to and comfort a
                  poor and sick family. I had no other means of supplying their most common
                  necessaries but the labor of my hands; and grateful did I feel to heaven when I
                  could find employment, which from my age and weakness I found it difficult to get.
                  All the little furniture and clothes we had by us are gone to supply us with food;
                  and the only things left are those
                  clothes which you saw on my son to-day, and these we cannot part with; for unless
                  he has good clothes he would find it out of the question to obtain another
                  situation."
               "I think," said I, "the merchants he served so faithfully for two years, ought not
                  to see him in want now, when he is prevented by illness from serving them any
                  longer."
               "Ah," he replied, "merchants have too much to think of to give themselves any
                  trouble about a poor disabled clerk. When you cease to be useful to men, they, for
                  the most part, cease to remember you. And though he has served them faithfully, no
                  doubt they think he has been sufficiently paid for it already, and that he might
                  have saved enough for casualties; so he might, if he had not had such demands upon
                  him, but men who are prosperous attributing all their good fortune to their own
                  exertions, seldom make allowance for the failures of the unfortunate, which they
                  attribute to their negligence or extravagance. But, indeed, to do the merchants
                  who were his employers justice, they are not aware of our actual state of
                  suffering and poverty, or if they were I am sure they would relieve it. But my
                  son, though poor, is of a proud spirit, and does not like the idea of stooping to
                  ask charity, and only longs for the time to come when by his labor he can save his
                  poor old father from poverty and toil. Did you see with what a wretched look of
                  suffering and sorrow he looked upon my labor to-day? Ah! well I know how rejoiced
                  he would have been could he have taken my place at that moment. I saw the tears
                  trickling down his face like rain when he looked at me. His heart was like to
                  break with agony and despair. But, poor fellow, it would kill him if he ventured
                  on such hard toil after his recent illness; besides he has never been accustomed
                  to this kind of labor, and I hardly know whether he could do it."
               "But I hope," said I, "the merchants, at all events, will employ him again when he
                  recovers."
               "Why, I don't know that, it is doubtful; you see they were obliged to get one to
                  fill his place, and they cannot well send him away; but I have no doubt they will
                  do all they can to procure him a situation as good. But you know it is impossible
                  to make situations; we must wait till they are vacant. If my wife and daughters
                  were recovered, they could get a little by sewing, which would assist us; but just
                  at present we are reduced to terrible straits."
               "Well," said I, "if I can get work, you shall not starve, at all events, I promise
                  you."
               "The old man expressed his thanks rather by looks than words, as we entered his
                  humble lodging."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXI.
               THE SUFFERING FAMILY.
               FATHER! father!' exclaimed his two daughters as he entered, 'dear father, have you
                  been successful? Our mother is very weak, and stands in need of some nourishment
                  immediately, and we have nothing to give her!'
               "'Here,' said the old man, 'go and buy her something directly,' at the same time
                  handing his eldest daughter the two shillings which I gave him that morning. 'God
                  has sent us this money through this young man, who has robbed himself to save us.
                  Go directly and buy something for us also, for we are hungry.'
               "She took a tin can and went out instantly, and in less than five minutes she
                  returned, bringing two large loaves and her can full of tolerably good soup, for
                  the whole of which she only paid one and sixpence, and there was quite enough to
                  satisfy the hunger of all! Indeed for my part I felt as strong and refreshed after
                  that meal, and even more so, than I had felt on former occasions after the
                  greatest delicacies, and all the rest had sufficient, and there was even some
                  left! It seemed blessed to our use, like the poor widow's oil and meal when it
                  received the benediction of the prophet.
               "Great was the change produced in this poor family even by this small relief, and
                  the joy and happiness it diffused can hardly be described. When I entered hunger
                  and suffering were depicted on the countenances of the inmates, and every
                  appearance of the most abject poverty and distress was but too evident; but now a
                  cheerfulness prevaded every face, and every eye was raised in gratitude—first to
                  God, and then to me, when the old man told them, in fervent and grateful language,
                  the manner in which I had given away all I had to them, and how I had assisted him
                  in the burden and heat of the day, by taking upon myself the severest part of the
                  toil.
               "I was overwhelmed with thanks the most sincerely expressed that I had ever yet
                  listened to, and they almost worshiped me as a divinity. The young man was as
                  fervent in the expression of his gratitude as his sisters and father, and never in
                  my life did I experience in my soul such tumultuous, such sublime joy, purchased,
                  too, at so cheap a rate! Ah! I thought, if the rich and great, instead of spending
                  thousands on a vain banquet or gaudy toy, would devote but a small portion of
                  their princely fortunes to relieving the distresses of the poor, the sick and the
                  unfortunate, how much greater would be the pleasure and happiness they would
                  derive from it, than that which they now derive from their luxurious profusion,
                  their senseless extravagance!
               "'You see,' said the old man, 'what good you have done, what happiness you have
                  created in a brief space of time, in one short morning! But I perceive you are
                  just as happy yourself as you have made those around you. This, however, is but a
                  small reward in comparison of that exceeding great reward that awaits you
                  hereafter. In another world God will reward you eternally.' And here the old man's
                  eyes filled with tears of gratitude as he seized me fervently by the hand.
               "'My friend,' I replied, 'it is to Heaven alone your thanks are justly due, and
                  not to me. Can you not trace the hand of God evidently in the whole of this
                  affair? It seemed indeed mere chance that I went to the exchange this morning
                  rather than to the dock; it seemed indeed a chance that I came out at all; but God
                  directs the secret thoughts of men for his own holy purposes. He guides their
                  footsteps to do his will, and you may be assured that had I not met you this morning he would have sent some
                  other messenger of mercy to your relief. It is I, therefore, who ought to be
                  thankful to Heaven for being so highly favored as to be the instrument of so much
                  good with such small means; and I shall always look upon this day as one of the
                  happiest of my life, though in the morning it seemed so gloomy and dull as to cast
                  a shadow of grief and sorrow over my soul, such as never clouded it before, even
                  in the most trying situations and most imminent perils.'
               "'But surely,' said he, 'our gratitude is due to the messenger of good, next after
                  the giver or sender, who I believe in all cases is no other than our merciful
                  Father in heaven.'
               "'Certainly,' I answered, 'but in a much inferior degree. Indeed we are sometimes
                  too prone to forget the real giver altogether in our gratitude for the agent or
                  steward. Sometimes men confer a favor on the impulse of the moment, or when they
                  are very much importuned, or forced by shame or some such motive, and immediately
                  afterwards are sorry for having done it. They sometimes part unwillingly with
                  their money as if it was drawn by some invisible magnetic power out of their
                  pockets. Do they really deserve any credit or gratitude for this? In all such
                  cases it is God alone who is the giver, taking it from the rich and giving it to
                  the poor; and it is to him alone the poor are to lift the beaming eye and the
                  heart burning with gratitude and praise. But when the giver is actuated by the
                  true and godlike feeling of charity, of love and sympathy for his fellow creature,
                  then he is entitled to secondary thanks, as being a faithful and true steward of a
                  kind and ever-bountiful Master.'
               "It was now time for us to return to work, and I bade this family adieu, loaded
                  with their thanks and their blessings; and we now pursued our labor with unabated
                  zeal till the evening, when we received our wages, and each returned to his
                  respective lodgings, hoping to see each other again on the morrow—for we were
                  continued in the same employment till the job was finished, which was about a
                  fortnight.
               "Every day was passed in the same way till the end of this time, when the job was
                  finished and we were obliged to seek work elsewhere. But as the season advanced we
                  found it more difficult to procure; happily, however, the absolute necessity for
                  it was greatly diminished to both, for the old man's family were now recovered
                  from their illness, his son was again employed, and his wife and daughters were
                  able to work; so that by their united exertions they were enabled to procure the
                  necessaries and comforts of life, and to spare the old man the necessity of
                  working at such an inclement season. I had the satisfaction of visiting them in
                  comfortable lodgings, of seeing them well clothed, with plenty to eat and drink,
                  and a cheerful fire to keep them warm. Their son was restored to his wonted health
                  and spirits, and never was there a more cheerful or a more truly humble and
                  grateful family to Heaven for their altered condition than this poor family at the
                  time I am speaking of, and they continued to be so as long as I knew them.
               "As for me the time drew nigh when I was to enter on my new employment. I did not
                  exactly know the day fixed for the re-opening of the school, and I therefore wrote
                  a note to inquire when the schoolmaster would expect me.
               "I received an answer stating that he would be able to dispense with my services
                  for another fortnight. This was astounding intelligence. Work was now become so
                  scarce that I did not know where to find any, and I scarcely knew what to do. I
                  had saved a little of my wages, but that was necessary to procure me some clothes
                  and shoes, etc., for my outfit. What must be done? I had recourse to the advice of
                  my old friend again, which was the same as before—namely, to remain quiet and
                  never mind work.
               "'Indeed,' he said, 'you can do nothing else, for there is no work to be had at
                  this dull season of the year, so you must content yourself.'
               
               "I was obliged, though sore against my will, to follow his advice; but I was not
                  sure whether his mother would acquiesce in it, so I took the earliest opportunity
                  of asking her, saying that if she would trust me for lodging and a little to eat
                  for a fortnight I would pay her handsomely as soon as I got money.
               "'Certainly,' she replied, 'for three weeks or a month, if you like. I think I
                  have good reason to trust you.'
               "I thanked her very sincerely, though I was at a loss to know what she meant by
                  the last sentence, so I asked Jack's opinion.
               "'Why,' said he, 'it means, to be sure, that she owes you more than that, for
                  without doubt she has taken your money. Indeed,' continued he, 'mother wud take
                  money of the Lord, if she could come at it at all, when she is in need of a drop,
                  and that is pretty often. Now, to tell the truth, I think she wud like to pay it
                  back, if she cud; at least she always says so when she stales mine, but I tell her
                  she's a liar when she says so, and that she is a thief and intends to keep it. But
                  this she always denies, and then says she, 'Jack, it's only a weakness I've got; I
                  don't intend to do it.' 'You do, mother,' says I. 'I don't, Jack,' says she; and
                  upon the strength of this, ye see, we quarrels sometimes; but, after all, I think
                  it's only an amiable weakness of mother's, and that she doesn't intend it. At any
                  rate,' continued Jack, 'I can assure you you shan't pay a far-thin' for sleepin'
                  and eatin' here for a fortnight, or three weeks, or a month, for I guess you have
                  paid the piper pretty well already.'
               "'Well,' said I, 'we shall see when the time comes, Jack. At present it is not of
                  much use to talk about payment, when there is no money forthcoming.'
               "'Money, money!' said Jack; 'it's the root of all evil!'
               "'Yet it is a root, Jack, that most people are fond of,' I replied.
               "'Aye,' said Jack, 'that's very odd now, when one thinks of it. Everybody says as
                  how they detest evil, and the parsons are constantly preachin' aginst evil, and
                  sin, and the devil, and they says as how money's the root of all evil, and yet
                  they all likes money, even the parsons themselves! Isn't it very odd when one
                  thinks on it?'
               "'It certainly is rather curious, Jack; for even, as you say, the very parsons
                  themselves, who preach so much against it, are as anxious to obtain it as other
                  men. But money, Jack, may be the root of good as well as evil, if it is placed in
                  good hands. It has been called the root of all evil, I suppose, because it is so
                  powerful an instrument to persuade men to do evil, when those who possess it would
                  have evil done; but it has also been used as an instrument of much good, in
                  promoting charitable institutions and relieving the distresses of poor or
                  afflicted men. It is, like most other things, given to mankind for good, though
                  often abused and perverted to evil purposes. But though it has undoubtedly been
                  the root or cause of most evils, yet there are other roots or causes of evil
                  besides money; so that that must not be taken in its literal sense any more than
                  the same kind of expression by Saint Paul, when he said that all the Cretans were
                  liars. It means merely that money is the root of most evils, as the other sentence
                  means that the general character of the Cretans was that of liars.'
               "'Why don't people say what they mean at wanst,' said Jack, 'without this humbug
                  of explaining them?'
               "'Well, Jack, that is a question I can hardly answer to your satisfaction. All I
                  can say is that in every country there are particular modes of expression, and
                  each person, besides, has a way of his own.'
               "'Why don't they all speak out plain, like us, and then we wud understand their
                  lingo?' asked Jack.
               "'I can't tell that either, Jack.'
               "So here our very interesting conversation ended for the present.
               "Nothing worthy of notice occurred till the morning came on which I was to take my
                  departure for Mr. Love-child's school. That long-wished-for morning at length came, and I rose early, in order to be
                  ready in good time. My kind friend, Jack Sweetbriar, offered his services to
                  assist in carrying my luggage (for he had made me a small box to put my clothes
                  in), which was not a very difficult matter, as far as the coach, and we were both
                  just on the point of leaving the house in triumph when the postman entered and
                  brought me a letter. It was from Mr. Lovechild, informing me very briefly that he
                  was enabled to dispense with my services altogether, without assigning any reason
                  whatever!
               "This was a blow to my cherished hopes. What was I to do now? What was to become
                  of me? But, above all, what could this mean? I was almost in despair, so was my
                  poor friend, who took almost as deep an interest in the matter as myself. At last
                  I found a vent to my feelings in a flood of tears. 'Alas!' I exclaimed, 'was there
                  ever such a poor wretch as I! Nothing I put my hand to prospers, and all my hopes
                  are blasted as soon as they arise! I am now utterly undone, and know not what to
                  do. May Heaven direct me, if indeed I am worthy of its direction; but I begin to
                  fear that even Heaven itself frowns upon me, and has marked me out for
                  destruction. What would you advise, Jack?'
               "'Go down and ask the lubber what he means by it. You made a reg'lar agreement,
                  and you can make him stick till his bargain, barin' and except he shows good cause
                  why, or that you ain't quite sound and seaworthy like.'
               "'Do you think I can make him abide by his agreement, Jack?'
               "'Sartainly! Go down and threaten him with the law if he doesn't put you on his
                  ship's books directly.'
               "'Well, Jack, I think I will take your advice. Indeed I must know why he acts
                  thus—without even assigning a reason for his conduct.'
               "Accordingly I went down instantly by the coach, without, however, taking my
                  luggage with me. I soon arrived at Lovechild House, and found the schoolmaster at
                  home. He received me with one of his benevolent smiles, of which indeed he seldom
                  divests himself, and to my inquiring look, rather than words, expressed himself
                  very sorry that he must dispense with my services.
               "'I think,' said he, 'I and my old assistant will be able to manage the business
                  very well ourselves. Indeed I expected to have had a great increase of pupils this
                  half [half year], but I have been somewhat disappointed—not more than four new
                  boys having come, though six promised. This, you see, makes a great
                  difference.'
               "'Had I known this before,' said I, 'I might, perhaps, have been able to procure
                  another situation; but not having heard of it till all the schools are supplied, I
                  could not now look out for one with any prospect of success.'
               "'I really was so much occupied that I never once thought of you,' he replied.
                  'But I will tell you what you can do.'
               "'What is that?' I asked.
               "'When you were here last,' he said, 'as I am an enthusiastic admirer of poetry
                  and poets, I happened to ask you whether you ever wrote verses, and you were good
                  enough to show me an elegy written after the manner of Gray, in Saint James's
                  cemetery of this town (In my leisure hours I used to wander out there
                  occasionally, and I believe scribbled some verses about it,) which I admired
                  exceedingly. Now the people of Liverpool are very poetical, and they particularly
                  admire anything that celebrates their own town, their wealth, their commerce, etc.
                  There is a young friend of mine, the daughter of a Captain Butler (you must have
                  heard of Ada, the young poetess), who has sold the second edition of one of her
                  works to a bookseller here for a considerable sum, to my knowledge. Now it strikes
                  me that if you could obtain a number of subscribers, and publish that elegy with a
                  few other poems, which you have doubtless by you or might soon write, you would
                  make a pretty good thing of it, and that you know would be much better than the drudgery of a school.'
               "'Do you really think I could get subscribers?' I eagerly inquired.
               "'Oh, nothing more easy in the world! Go first to the company to whom the cemetery
                  belongs; get them to subscribe, and hundreds will follow their example.'
               "'Indeed! I should like that amazingly! But where am I to find them? I do not even
                  know the names nor places of abode of the proprietors.'
               "'I will manage that for you. Go to Mr. Fitzsurleigh, the clergyman residing in
                  the cemetery, and he will give you a list of the owners. Should he hesitate you
                  may mention my name; he is my friend, and will do anything to serve me.'
               "At that time I knew little of the world, especially of the literary world, and
                  much less of my own claims to success as a candidate for poetical fame and
                  emolument; but I was flattered by the opinion of a clergy-man and a teacher of
                  some repute, who I thought must be a good judge of those matters, and could have
                  no interest in the opinion he gave, and I resolved to follow his advice; I
                  therefore thanked him for his kindness, and took my leave with the intention of
                  proceeding direct to the abode of the Rev.Mr. Fitzsurleigh, in the cemetery,
                  first, and then to the houses of the respective owners afterwards. As I was going
                  Mr. Lovechild said to me:
               "'Do not forget to let me know the success of your undertaking.'
               "I assured him that I should acquaint him with it in due time, and departed.
               "What a sanguine and hopeful creature is man! Though often disappointed, he
                  eagerly grasps at every new project that is held out to him; but, like the
                  drowning man grasping at straws, how often is he foiled in his hopes till at last
                  he is driven to destruction at the moment when he fancies himself almost out of
                  the reach of danger!
                     
                        "And thus from year to year is past
                        In hopes which years succeeding blast;
                        And though each hope like vapor flies,
                        Yet not for aye its radiance dies.
                        From infancy to boyhood led,
                        From boyhood to the blooming prime,
                        No sooner has one pleasure fled
                        And left its register with time,
                        Than we with ardor others seek;
                        Changed through the object of our dream,
                        'Tis now fair Beauty's mantling cheek—
                        'Tis now the eyes with love that beam;
                        But still the same result we find—
                        Sad disappointment, care and grief,
                        Dejection, sorrows of the mind—
                        The bliss of life—alas! how brief!
                     
                  
               
               "So it was with me on the present occasion. New visions of glory and profit
                  floated before my imagination, and I put out my hand to seize them, as Ulysses did
                  the shade of his mother; but, like that ghost, 'they flew from my grasp as a
                  shadow or a fleeting dream.' 
                     
                        "'Thrice from my eager hand the shadow fled
                        Like to a fleeting dream!''
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXII.
               THE POETIC CHAPLAIN.
               I SOON arrived at the cemetery and inquired for the abode of the good and pious
                  chaplain. The dwelling of Mr. Fitzsurleigh was pointed out to me. It was a goodly
                  dwelling, neat and comfortable, not far from the chapel, and I believe he receives
                  good pay for doing little work; but then he is one of the saints. I entered,
                  confidently expecting a kind—at least a civil reception, and asked of a gruff
                  servant whether Mr. Fitzsurleigh was at home.
               "'I don't know, but I'll go and see if you will give me your name or card, sir,'
                  said that important personage.
               "'I do not think he knows me by name, but my business is about the cemetery.'
               "'Oh, indeed! sir, my master is at home. Please to walk in here, sir,' at the same
                  time opening the door of a very neatly furnished parlor and ushering me into it
                  with much pomp and ceremony. I took a seat, waiting the arrival of the holy
                  man.
               "He was not long in making his appearance; for, supposing I was come to bring
                  grist to his mill, the reverend gentleman lost no time in coming down stairs. He
                  entered the room and made a low bow, his eyes beaming with delightful
                  expectations, as far as a most sordid and forbidding expression is capable of
                  imparting such a feeling to others.
               "'Your servant, sir,' he said, in most gracious speech but with no very gracious
                  look.
               "'Your most obedient, sir,' I replied.
               "'Is there anything I can do to oblige you, sir? You have only to command me; I am
                  entirely at your service.'
               "'I have come,' I replied, 'to ask a favor of you, which if you would be kind
                  enough to grant I should feel much obliged.'
               "'Pray, sir, name it. I shall be extremely happy to do anything I can to oblige a
                  gentleman of'——
               "'You have a list, I think, sir, of the subscribers to this cemetery,' I
                  interrupted.
               "'Yes, sir; would you wish to see it? Perhaps, sir, you would favor us with your
                  name and patronage. It is a lovely valley of the dead! Nothing like it in
                  Europe—so calm, so retired, so sweet a retreat; one would almost wish to die to be
                  buried in it!'
               "'Why, sir,' I said, 'your feelings are exactly congenial to my own; your
                  enthusiasm is elevated even to the language of poetry! If I should form an
                  opinion, sir, you are quite a lover of nature and of poetry, perhaps a poet
                  yourself?'
               "'You are right,' he replied; 'I am indeed a lover of the divine, the noble art of
                  poetry. What can be more sublime and thrilling than the immortal strains of an
                  inspired and enraptured bard! Indeed I must confess that my enthusiasm has carried
                  me so far even as to perpetrate, or rather to attempt to perpetrate, a few
                  verses.'
               "'Indeed!' I replied; 'on the cemetery? It is a noble subject. How sweet and
                  touching is Gray's 'Elegy in a Country Churchyard!' which of course could not
                  afford such lofty thoughts and imagery as this beautiful mecropolis.'
               "Certainly it is a noble subject, and one which I should like to see well treated.
                  But my verses were not written on the cemetery—oh, dear no! but on a much more
                  interesting subject still; one that was universally loved and admired by all who
                  knew him. Poor fellow! nothing could save him from the ravenous jaws of
                  death!'
               
               "'Some dear friend, I suppose?'
               "'Yes, but not of the human species, though a biped nevertheless. In short, it was
                  on a very favorite and dearly beloved cockatoo! Would you like to hear the verses?
                  I will read them for you.' And here, without waiting for my reply, the reverend
                  gentleman ascended to his study and brought down a very ponderous-looking tome,
                  which seemed to be filled with manuscript, both in prose and verse; and after
                  coughing and hemming a good deal, and turning over the leaves again and again, he
                  at length began to read his elegy on his favorite cockatoo. It was a very long
                  one, and consisted, as he told me with an air of triumph, of no less than one
                  hundred and twenty-seven stanzas! each stanza of eight lines! and it cost him, as
                  he declared, many a sleepless hour, both in the composition and correction. I
                  could easily believe him, for he must have been half asleep during both processes,
                  for never did I listen to anything so dull and prosy.
               "When he had finished reading, he looked at me for an opinion, but I declined
                  giving one, saying that a work of such weight and importance, which had caused so
                  many sleepless hours, ought not to be judged of rashly, and that I required time
                  to reflect before I could pronounce positively. There is one merit, at all
                  events," said I, "which it can boast of; there is plenty of it, and every one of
                  its numerous images is exhibited in so many various points of view that he must be
                  very dull indeed who cannot catch the meaning of the author."
               "You have hit upon it, exactly," he replied, with a look of great satisfaction.
                  "That is the very thing on which I pique myself, perspicuity; I have always been a
                  steady advocate for, and let me add, a firm adherent to, perspicuity. It matters
                  not how often you repeat the same idea; indeed the oftener you repeat it the
                  better, if you wish yourself to be clearly and thoroughly understood. It is for
                  that reason I admire the lucid language of the law so much; one idea is explained
                  in so many different ways, and by so many varying expressions, that it is quite
                  impossible to mistake the meaning. Indeed I remember when I was in my clerkship to
                  Mr. Jenkins, (for I must inform you, if you are not already aware of the fact,
                  that I studied law before I entered the church, a thing that every one ought to do
                  who would acquire a clear, distinct, lucid and perspicuous style or manner of
                  eloquence,) what struck my attention most of all was this very beautiful and
                  perspicuous language, in which the wisdom of our ancestors deemed it right, fit
                  and proper to guard and protect the rights, privileges, and immunities of the
                  subject, by having the terms of the law clearly, plainly, and perspicuously
                  expressed. Perhaps you may not be aware why I left the law, to which I was so
                  partial, and entered the church. I will tell you; I was struck with the good which
                  a new and improved style of preaching, borrowed from the law, would do if adopted
                  by an intelligent minister, and as my clients were falling off, and as a friend
                  offered me his patronage in the church, I thought my time and talents would be
                  more usefully employed, and therefore I changed. But to return to the elegy, you
                  are right, you are right! I think I may venture to say that it is indeed
                  perspicuous."
               "After this rambling speech, you may be sure I said of him, in my own heart,
                  'There is more hope of a fool than of thee.' Nevertheless, I gave him credit for
                  some good qualities of heart, and therefore I did not quite despair of obtaining
                  the favor I sought of him.
               "But with regard to the cemetery," said I, "I suppose there are some eminent men
                  among the subscribers; men of taste and judgment, who feel an interest in this new
                  and beautiful burying ground, and who, therefore, would be delighted to hear it
                  celebrated far and wide over the country."
               "Yes," he replied, "we have amongst our subscribers all the wealth and talents of
                  this vast and flourishing community, men who would do honor to any city in the world, and whose taste is excellent
                  and liberality boundless."
               "I am delighted to hear it," I said.
               "Shall I show you the list?" he asked.
               "Thank you, and I should feel obliged, in addition, if you would allow me to take
                  a copy, and to put down your own name at the head of the list; you are well worthy
                  of the honor. Indeed your liberality and just pretensions to be numbered among the
                  votaries of the muses demand such a homage being conferred upon you."
               "I protest, sir, I do not well comprehend you," he replied, with a look of
                  surprise.
               "You will be agreeably surprised when I tell you," said I, thinking I should quite
                  overwhelm him with delight and amazement, "that I, too, am a poet. I have moreover
                  written an elegy on your cemetery which will doubtless confer upon it a deathless
                  fame."
               "Indeed, sir," said he, with a very cold and indifferent look, at which I was
                  thunderstruck.
               "Yes, but as I cannot afford to publish it without aid," I added, "I am going to
                  apply to the owners of the cemetery for subscriptions, who, no doubt, will be
                  quite delighted to comply, and I have been recommended by Mr. Lovechild to come to
                  you for a list of the subscribers."
               "Indeed! so Mr. Lovechild recommended you to come to me, did he?" said the pious
                  parson, with the look of a rhinoceros.
               "Yes, and he said moreover (which he did,) that, being a poet yourself, you would
                  be most happy to lead the way in the subscription."
               "Oh, indeed! Mr. Lovechild said so, did he? Is this all you have to say?" said the
                  pious man, his squinting eyes burning in their deep sockets with badly suppressed
                  rage.
               "Yes! this is all."
               "Go back to Mr. Lovechild," said he, bursting out into a rage, which he was no
                  longer able to control, "and tell him he is a fool and an ass for his pains. Is it
                  for this I have spent my time? talking about nothing to a pauper, an itinerant
                  beggar! Leave my house, directly," he shrieked, in a voice almost choked with
                  fury; "leave my house, directly! How dare you presume to pass yourself off for a
                  gentleman, and even have the impudence to come into my best parlor and sit down!
                  Insolent wretch! begone. Halloa, John!" and then he ran to the bell and rang it
                  with fury, as if the house was on fire. "Halloa, there, John, quick, quick! show
                  this fellow the door. He is an insolent, presumptuous beggar! Show him the door,
                  instantly!"
               "Do not put yourself into such a passion," I said, scarcely able to restrain a
                  risible emotion which took possession of me at that moment. "I can find my way out
                  without the assistance either of your servant or you, Mr. Fitzsurleigh! by the by,
                  a most appropriate name; but with regard to the list, Mr. Fitzsurleigh, do you
                  refuse to give me a copy of it, Mr. Fitzsurleigh?"
               "Leave my house, directly; John, put him out by the shoulder; he is insolent! He
                  will rob; perhaps murder; put him out, directly; send for the police! Ho, thieves!
                  robbers!" howled out the reverend and pious gentleman at the top of his voice, but
                  before his alarm extended to a great distance, I bade him good evening and slowly
                  walked out of the house, scarcely knowing whether to laugh or grieve for poor
                  humanity.
               "Here," thought I, "is a pretty specimen of the genus homo and the class sacerdos christianus, a little ugly pugnosed baboon,
                  dressed up in a little brief authority, and in the sacerdotal vestments of the
                  poor man's religion, gets into a violent rage at a fellow creature, and calls him
                  pauper, beggar, robber, and murderer, because that fellow creature happens to be
                  poor! as if poverty alone was the great sin against the Holy Ghost which can never
                  be forgiven either in this world or the world to come! It reminded me of that
                  remarkable expression of Sallust: "Paupertas probro
                     haberi; innocentia pro malevolentia duci cœpit," which so well
                  describes the degeneracy of the people
                  of whom he treats, which, from having once sought its dictators and rulers from
                  the humility of the plow and the pursuits of rustic labor, and looked upon poverty
                  in a private individual as an honor; had now, in a more depraved and luxurious
                  age, begun in the beautiful and concise language of the historian, "to esteem
                  poverty a disgrace, and to look upon innocence and simplicity of life as downright
                  hypocrisy and malevolence." If this, thought I, is the practice of a class of men
                  whose religion commands them to despise riches and the things of this world, and
                  if this is the tone of feeling which pervades society, then let the degenerate
                  nation look to itself, and beware lest its glory be departed and its power
                  transferred to one more worthy of it, the great Republic of the West!
               "With these and similar reflections, I retraced my steps back towards
                  Lovechild-house. I entered it and found Mr. Lovechild at home. He seemed surprised
                  at my sudden return.
               "What!" said he, "have you not been successful?" "I here recounted the whole
                  scene, not omitting the complimentary message which Mr. Fitzsurleigh had entrusted
                  to my keeping for him, at the whole of which he appeared very indignant.
               "Is it possible," he said, in seeming astonishment, "that Mr. Fitzsurleigh could
                  have made use of such language? This is not to be borne! And he would not give you
                  the list of subscribers to the cemetery? He had no right to refuse it, and I shall
                  see into this matter, and perhaps make him repent his conduct sooner than he
                  reckons upon. But now, with regard to your own business, what's to be done? you
                  see I really have no occasion for your services; I am very sorry, but I can't help
                  it."
               "Well, then," I replied, "if you have not, you ought to have thought of that in
                  time. It is not fair that I should suffer for your negligence; you must either
                  find me another situation or remunerate me for my time till I shall be able to
                  procure one."
               "My dear," said Mr. Lovechild to his wife, who at that moment entered the room,
                  and jerked her head towards me without looking at me, "my dear, what can we do
                  with Mr. Hardy? you know, my love, we don't want him, and yet it is a hard case
                  that he should be unemployed, for it seems he depended upon us, and did not look
                  out for another situation."
               "Well, Mr. Lovechild, I cannot help that; you are always making such blunders. You
                  know as well as I do, Mr. Lovechild, that I have no separate room for him. If you
                  think proper to keep a person for whom you have nothing to do, he must sleep where
                  he can, with the boys, or any where."
               "Would you have any objection, Mr. Hardy, to that arrangement, if we could so
                  contrive to manage it?"
               "Oh, not at all," I replied, quite delighted that there was some prospect of
                  coming to an arrangement without appealing to law, for which I was little
                  prepared, having only two shillings, a sixpence and two penny pieces in the world,
                  and being moreover a few pounds in debt. "Not the least," I replied, "I am very
                  easily satisfied with regard to accommodations, and am very willing to sleep in a
                  room with a few boys."
               "Oh, indeed! well, but you see, Mr. Hardy, I do not want your services at all,
                  being well supplied with assistance already."
               "It is very hard upon me," I answered, now as much depressed as I had been elated
                  with hope a moment before, "to be thrown idle at the moment I expected to be
                  employed, and I cannot submit to it; indeed I cannot afford it."
               "I tell you what I will do for you, then," said Mr. Lovechild, "I will engage you,
                  but I cannot give you near so much wages as I promised before. Schools are very
                  uncertain things, Mr. Hardy, and as I engage you merely to oblige you, and not
                  from any need I have of your services, I think you may be very well satisfied if I
                  pay you at the rate of twenty pounds per annum."
               "Twenty pounds!" I echoed. "That is indeed very little; but if I can get no more, of course, under
                  my present circumstances I shall be obliged to accept it."
               "Well, agreed; you can bring your luggage when you choose; this evening, if you
                  think proper." So saying, Mr. Lovechild, with many smiles, bowed me very politely
                  out of the room.
               "Notwithstanding all the difficulties I had had to encounter, and the injustice of
                  this proceeding, not to talk of its paltry meanness, I was so harrassed with
                  poverty and the dread of poverty, that I was very glad to accept the situation,
                  even on such disadvantageous terms, and I returned to town for my luggage, quite
                  delighted, and in the highest spirits imaginable. My good friend, Jack Sweetbriar,
                  was not at home; so I took my box on my shoulder and carried it with a gay heart
                  down to the coach office, and in less than an hour I found myself safely
                  domiciled, for the present, in Lovechild-house."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               THE SCHOOL-ROOM.
               ENTERING upon this new species of employment (said Harcourt) I felt a degree of
                  pleasure and satisfaction in my mind of which it would be difficult to convey an
                  adequate conception to those who had not experienced the miseries from which I had
                  just escaped. I hoped now to be useful to others, and this was to me a most
                  gratifying reflection. I had long felt that my sphere of usefulness was not
                  amongst the class who are doomed to toil and perpetual bodily labor, but rather
                  amongst those whose pursuits in life, though still humble, were directed to the
                  development of the mental faculties and the elevation of the moral nature of our
                  species. But in this I was doomed to be sorely disappointed.
               "To others whose prospects in life and whose walk in the same had hitherto been
                  more elevated, such a situation as that which I now filled would indeed have
                  appeared revolting and almost intolerable; but to me who had recently been inured
                  to such cruel hardships, it seemed a paradise in comfort, and even luxuries.
                  Everything was good and clean, and nothing was wanting to satisfy the reasonable
                  wants of nature. What more could anyone desire? It is true there was hard work to
                  be done, but what of that? It was just such as suited my taste and for which I was
                  well prepared, if I had been permitted to do it in my own way; but here was the
                  difficulty.
               "During the first week of my sojourn at Lovechild-house house there was little to do but to ramble along
                  the shore and over the country with the few pupils who had yet assembled. After
                  that time we entered upon the regular business of the school.
               "Although Mr. Lovechild had hesitated to engage me, because 'he had no occasion
                  for my services,' as he pretended, the truth is, he would have required two more
                  assistants in addition to me and the only one he had before, who was merely a
                  writing master, to have done anything like justice to his pupils, who were very
                  numerous, and I soon became perfectly satisfied that his motive in treating me in
                  the humiliating manner he did, was no other than the paltry one of cutting off a
                  few pounds from my otherwise very scanty salary. This at once gave me an
                  unfavorable impression as to his moral character, which impression was deepened
                  more and more every day.
               "His false and hollow system of instruction and of moral discipline soon began to
                  develop itself, and from the moment I became fully acquainted with it, I began to
                  lose all hope of being useful, though I never ceased to employ all my energies to
                  counteract its cruel and pernicious tendencies, for I conceived myself, in a
                  certain measure, called to a trust of no small importance by Divine Providence; no
                  less a trust than the education of many of my fellow creatures, at a time when
                  every impression, whether good or evil, is indelibly fixed on the tender mind and
                  gives it its own mould during the whole period of not merely this transitory life,
                  but, perhaps, influences its happiness throughout an eternity of ages. Had Mr.
                  Lovechild been a master potter or carpenter, an iron founder, or any other
                  mechanical calling, and I employed under him as a workman or journeyman, then I
                  should have considered it my duty to follow his directions implicitly, whether
                  they were right or wrong, because I could thereby do no injury to others, my
                  materials to work upon being inanimate and brute matter; but when I saw him
                  entrusted with a charge, for the proper management of which he was totally
                  incompetent, I felt I should be acting very wrong if I co-operated with him in
                  ruining that whose loss would be so great, and, what is worse, so irreparable. I
                  mean the rational mind of man. But it will be necessary to give you some
                  explanation of his system.
               "It was one of those modern inventions, or new lights, which the 'march of
                  intellect' has introduced amongst us and which profess to teach everything within
                  the compass of mental capacity to children and mere babes without the least
                  coercion or pain; but, on the contrary, with the greatest possible pleasure and
                  delight to the learners. Corporal punishment and everything like fear were
                  banished as barbarous and totally unworthy the enlightenment and philosophy of the
                  age. Kindness and mildness alone were the great principles and characteristics of
                  this system as to discipline.
               "I confess when I first saw this system on paper, I was rather struck with it as
                  being very desirable, if it could be accomplished, of which I had serious doubts
                  from my knowledge of human nature; which doubts my subsequent experience has not
                  tended to remove, but greatly to strengthen.
               "I soon perceived that the fear of punishment being removed, nothing was done, and
                  that boys of the finest intellect were losing their precious time in idleness or
                  worse, and I ventured to remonstrate with Mr. Love-child on the subject. When I
                  had given the new system a fair trial and had clearly perceived the results, I one
                  day went up to Mr. Lovechild and told him that after the lessons of the day were
                  over I should like to speak to him for a little time on something of importance.
                  Accordingly, that evening he was disengaged and he sent for me to go into his
                  study. I went directly, and found him, with his usual smile on his countenance,
                  ready to receive me. He seemed in very good temper and I entered upon the business
                  at once.
               "'I have taken the liberty, Mr. Lovechild,' I began, 'of requesting a few minutes
                  conversation with you on a subject which gives me no little uneasiness.'
               
               "'Well, what is that, Mr. Hardy, are you uncomfortable in any respect? Is your bed
                  not to your liking, or have you any fault to find with your treatment, your
                  living, or anything else? I am ready to do all I can to remedy anything of which
                  you may have just cause to complain.'
               "'I am quite happy,' I replied, 'and perfectly satisfied in every particular you
                  mention. Indeed, I have not for a long time felt so comfortable, and I feel very
                  grateful to you and Mrs. Lovechild for your kind treatment of me, which is more,
                  perhaps, than I deserve. No, I have nothing to complain of as to myself, my
                  uneasiness is quite of a different nature.'
               "'What is it?' he replied. 'I am quite at a loss to guess; explain yourself.'
               "'Why,' said I, 'it gives me much uneasiness to find that the boys you have placed
                  under my care are not making that progress in their studies which I should wish,
                  owing, as I attribute it, to the system you have adopted, and I should be much
                  obliged to you if you would allow me to adopt another, and to my mind a much
                  better, though not so novel a one.'
               "'What! you would recur to the old, barbarous system of drudgery and labor, and
                  reject all the helps and facilities which the superior skill of the moderns has
                  imparted for the good of the rising generation? Why, that would be like renouncing
                  our civilization and returning to the barbarism of our ancestors. My system has
                  been propounded by Locke, improved by men of the highest talents and advocated by
                  the philosophers of the Edinburgh Review. Why, Mr. Hardy, he who would propose
                  such a thing must have very antiquated ideas, begging you pardon for the
                  observation. But really I considered you a young man of more sense than to think
                  of such a thing.'
               "'I care not,' I replied, 'who has propounded or who has endorsed the system; I
                  have no hesitation in saying that it is a bad one and will never succeed in
                  practice, which is, after all, the best test of theories. What did Locke know of
                  education? What do the philosophers of the Edinburgh Review know of it? What does
                  any man know of it who has not been engaged in it? It is easy for men to
                  promulgate visionary theories; but no theories, save those which are founded on
                  experience and the nature of things, are really of any value. There is no royal
                  road to the dead languages any more than to the mathematics. Ptolemy Lagus thought
                  that some easy, golden rule might be invented to lead the royal mind through the
                  abstruse labyrinth of mathematical science without subjecting it to the vulgar
                  drudgery and toil of ordinary minds. No doubt he had formed a very plausible
                  theory of it in his own mind; but how must this theory have been scattered to the
                  winds when Euclid, who was no visionary, but a plain, practical man, declared to
                  his royal pupil, bluntly, that there was no royal road to the mathematics?'
               "'But you forget the difference in the respective ages. Euclid flourished, I
                  believe, about two hundred and eighty years before the Christian era, and we live
                  in the nineteenth century after that period. Surely this ought to make some
                  difference.'
               "'It certainly does make a difference, but that difference is by no means in our
                  favor, for if the mind of an infant, as your favorite Locke says, is as a 'sheet
                  of white paper' till it is filled with the ideas which are presented to it, and if
                  the mind of an infant is precisely the same in that respect now, as that of Euclid
                  must have been when he was an infant, in what other light can the immense
                  storehouse of ideas which have been treasured up in every department of science
                  and knowledge since then be viewed but that of a weighty burden which our minds
                  have to bear in addition to what those of that age had to bear; and instead of
                  allowing ourselves any relaxation or rest, would we not require additional mental
                  exercise and discipline to enable us to carry the greater load which our peculiar
                  circumstances have imposed upon us?'
               "'That is the very reason why this rational system has been adopted. There is so
                  much to learn in the present age that
                  we cannot afford to spend seven or eight years, as formerly, in poring over dead
                  languages, which, after all, are of little value when acquired. By the means of
                  those close and literal translations which I use in my school, a boy may be made
                  acquainted with the ideas of all the principal Latin and Greek authors in
                  one-fourth of the time that was formerly employed, and then he will have much time
                  to devote to other useful and important subjects, such as botany, chemistry,
                  mineralogy, geology, etc. Is not this much more rational? On these pleasing
                  studies the pupil will enter with delight; whereas, according to the old system,
                  boyhood was spent in misery and continual torture, shocking to humanity. Nothing
                  but the sound of the lash and the wailings and sobbings of the poor victims were
                  to be heard from morning till night. But we have changed all these matters now.
                  Nothing of the kind is heard at the present time, and the boyhood and youth of
                  pupils of these enlightened days are passed in that ease and freedom'——
               "'For which they will suffer in maturer years,' I interrupted. 'All you have said
                  is very plausible, and well calculated to arrest the attention of tender mothers
                  and indulgent papas, but it can have no weight with those who are endowed with
                  common sense, or who have the slightest knowledge of life or the nature of man. Is
                  it not notorious that man generally is inclined by nature to the indulgence of the
                  present moment, unmindful of the past and regardless of the future? This is
                  particularly remarkable in boys and young people, who, having no experience of the
                  world themselves, are placed under the care and guardianship of those whose duty
                  it is to teach them the way they should go, that when they grow up they may not
                  depart from it. Now what boy, except such a prodigy as Pascal, has ever been known
                  to enter upon an abstruse and dry study of his own free will, and to persevere in
                  it till he attains to the end? Not one in ten thousand! But then, you say, such
                  dry studies are to be made plain, and easy, and agreeable. Then they are no longer
                  studies at all, and are completely useless for the end for which they were
                  intended. You have spoken of the dead languages, of learning them by an easy
                  method; but why learn them at all? Might not the pupil as well read the Greek and
                  Roman authors in translations?'
               "'I do not know but that he might, except that it is fashionable for a gentleman
                  to know something of the dead languages—to be able to understand a sentence or
                  quotation occasionally. This is the only use I see in them.'
               "'If that is the case I do not at all wonder at your adopting the new system,' I
                  replied, 'it is quite in keeping with your views; but I hold quite a different
                  opinion on this subject altogether.'
               "'What might that be?' said Mr. Lovechild.
               "'I have always looked,' I replied, 'upon the dead languages more as a discipline
                  for the mind, a means to an end, than in any other light. I think we could very
                  well dispense with most of the ideas contained in the classical authors, and even
                  with the languages themselves, for any great advantage their acquisition per se confers upon us. Indeed I am of opinion that
                  the time and trouble we expend in learning those languages and in reading those
                  authors would be almost entirely thrown away had we no other object in view but
                  the mere acquisition of words and phrases, or the ideas of the authors who wrote
                  in them. But such is not the case. It is the very difficulty in
                  mastering them, of which you seem to stand in such dread, the close attention, the
                  diligent and patient research which we must employ in the pursuit—in short, the
                  toil and excitement of the chase, not the dead game itself, which is our chief
                  reward, which you and all who follow your system lose entirely by having the game
                  hunted down for you, and nothing left for you to do but put it in your bag and
                  walk quietly home, crammed with the fruits of other people's toil, and unable to
                  digest that which you had gorged, and for which you had no appetite excited by
                  healthy and manly exercise. This was
                  Locke's error, and this is the error of the Edinburgh Reviewers, and of all such
                  dreamers who forget or overlook the main business, and attack and harp upon
                  something of minor or no importance at all. I say, and I assert it fearlessly,
                  that the dead languages are worth nothing unless acquired with much labor and
                  trouble, and that one page of an author studied thoroughly, according to the old
                  system of analysis and synthesis, by the dint of labor and reflection, is of more
                  value, for the essential purposes of education, than the whole circle of the
                  classical authors, read in your reading-made-easy way, put together.'
               "'Would you, then, have a boy spend seven or eight years in learning dead
                  languages, when there is so much to learn beside?' said Mr. Lovechild.
               "'I would have his mind most thoroughly disciplined by the best possible means in
                  his early years; and perhaps there is no means so good at that time of life, or
                  that would answer this purpose so well as those very languages against which we
                  hear such an ignorant and inconsiderate outcry. For what, I would ask, can be done
                  with a youth till he is fourteen or fifteen years of age but prepare him by a
                  proper course of judicious training for entering upon that career for which the
                  bent of his genius may fit him? Till that time, and perhaps later, it is
                  impossible to tell how his genius may develop itself; and if his mind has
                  previously been confused and dissipated on a multiplicity of varying pursuits,
                  under the false name of sciences, we will find that it will have gained weakness
                  instead of strength. I apprehend that instead of attempting to make him a
                  universal genius prematurely, it would be better to concentrate his mental powers
                  to one or two points, so that he might have it ready and in full vigor to direct
                  it to whatever pursuit the great business of life may require, for it is
                  impossible for one man to be perfect in such a multiplicity of pursuits as present
                  themselves to the modern aspirant. In schools, particularly preparatory schools
                  like yours, Mr. Lovechild, there ought to be one fixed standard of education for
                  all, and that standard ought to be the classics properly studied, which are not
                  only an excellent, perhaps the best, discipline for that early age, but also the
                  best key to the arts and sciences, which the youth may one day be expected to
                  study, and to the modern languages also.'
               "'In my school they study the arts and sciences now, sir,' said Mr. Lovechild,
                  proudly.
               "'Indeed they do,' I replied, 'after a certain manner; but it is of that I
                  complain. They will study nothing but mischief, Mr. Lovechild; and I would venture
                  to say that not one boy in your school can answer me a single question unless I
                  ask him in the precise words in which he got it off by rote. This is not learning,
                  in my opinion, but loss of time. What they do acquire is mere dogmatism, the
                     ipse dixit of others, without any exercise
                  whatever of their own reason, which faculty, indeed, seems completely proscribed
                  from the school altogether. You talk of doing everything by kindness alone! That
                  would be very well if it were accompanied by firmness and a wholesome admixture of
                  fear; but as it is it will not answer, I can assure you, and I, for one, protest
                  against it.'
               "'I have heard you very patiently for a long time, Mr. Hardy. Pray, how can this
                  affair interest you? may I be allowed to ask,' said Mr. Lovechild, in a somewhat
                  harsh, displeased tone.
               "'Because I feel an interest in the boys intrusted to my charge, and, let me add,
                  in the prosperity of my employer's establishment, which cannot be permanent if
                  this system is persevered in.'
               "'You really think so, conscienciously?' said Mr. Lovechild, with a look of
                  inquiry which would seem to doubt my sincerity.
               "'Most decidedly,' I replied. 'Do you think me capable of giving expression to
                  sentiments which I do not feel?'
               "'Oh, certainly not,' he answered, with a smile; 'but I tell you candidly I would
                  advise you not to give yourself any more trouble in these matters; they belong long to me, and I am not in the habit
                  of allowing my assistants to dictate to me.'
               "'I do not wish to dictate to you,' I replied mildly; 'my object has been, if
                  possible, to convince you of the utter futility of the method you have adopted and
                  of the impossibility there is of it ever succeeding.'
               "'If the parents of my pupils are well satisfied,' he answered, 'I think my
                  assistant might easily be so.'
               "'I have given your system a full and fair trial,' I replied. 'I have labored
                  zealously to do all the good in my power, but I find my efforts useless. I hoped
                  to prevail upon you to permit me to try my own method with my own class; but since
                  you refuse me that favor, I must inform you that I cannot conscienciously
                  undertake the duty any longer than the end of the present half year, after which
                  it is my intention to leave; so I take the opportunity of giving you this early
                  notice, that you may suit yourself in time.'
               "'Thank you,' said Mr. Lovechild. And here the conversation ended. This took place
                  only a few days ago.
               "If I could have entered upon the subject of religious and moral instruction
                  imparted to his pupils by Mr. Lovechild," continued Harcourt, "I would have shown
                  him that he was equally at fault on that head; but the matter was too delicate to
                  touch upon, and therefore I omitted it altogether. I could have shown him that his
                  system was as false and hollow, applied to religion and morals, as it was in every
                  other respect, and that the most unfavorable results must necessarily follow
                  equally from both."
               "And what is that system he uses in teaching religion?" I asked.
               "Why," replied Harcourt, "if it may be called a system which is none, and has not
                  even the likeness of a system, I would define it as that which is calculated to
                  pervert the mind and the morals, and destroy the very essence of man as a rational
                  and accountable creature.
               "He teaches, both in the pulpit and in private, that man is not accountable for
                  his actions; that he has no free agency, but is the creature of a blind and
                  inevitable necessity; and, forgetting the beautiful language of Christ, when he
                  took up a little child, placed him in the midst of the people, and declared to
                  them that unless they became like little babes in innocence and purity, they could
                  not enter the kingdom of heaven, he is constantly impressing on the minds of his
                  pupils that they are born in sin, that their hearts are desperately wicked above
                  all things, that they must be regenerated or born again or they cannot enter the
                  kingdom of heaven, and that unless they are predestined from all eternity to
                  salvation they must inevitably perish everlastingly. He tells them there is no
                  good, but even sin, in morality, that it is as filthy rags, and tries to warn them
                  against placing any confidence in good works, which, he declares, are often an
                  abomination to the Lord, and the offspring of Satan!"
               "This," said I, "as you must be aware, is not a doctrine peculiar to Mr.
                  Lovechild; it is that promulgated by John Calvin, long adopted in Scotland, and of
                  late years it has become very general in this country with a party in the church
                  who style themselves Evangelists. They are the Puritans of the nineteenth century,
                  and the only true and genuine saints of Christendom. This is the sect which
                  declares that the morality inculcated by Addison in the 'Spectator,' however well
                  adapted it might have been for the neophites of the age in which he wrote, is not
                  suited to the loftier views of the more enlighted and spiritual Christians of the
                  present time."
               "I only speak," replied Harcourt, "from having witnessed its effects in those to
                  whom it has been preached. It makes them either insufferably proud, as considering
                  themselves the favored ones and the elect of God, or desperately wicked and
                  abandoned, as despairing of all salvation because of their non-election from
                  eternity and the absence of God's grace! These are its effects in adults; but when
                  it is preached to boys and children it gives them a ready excuse for every error
                  or fault they may commit. How often have I been answered, when reproving a boy for some
                  misdemeanor, 'Well, I could not help it; it was not my fault. Mr. Lovechild says
                  that we can do nothing of ourselves, and that we are not accountable for our
                  actions, and he quoted scripture to prove it;' and when I have replied that indeed
                  they were accountable for their actions, quoting several passages of scripture to
                  prove the assertion, they have merely laughed at me in derision or scorn,
                  exclaiming: 'What! I suppose you know better than Mr. Lovechild, who is a
                  clergyman!' and thus I found it was no use to proceed any further.
               "The result of all this is," continued Harcourt, "that they forget their duty both
                  to God and their superiors, they are disobedient and contentious, and so
                  completely unmanageable and refractory as to render it a difficult task to get
                  through the day with any sort of pleasure or quiet. It is more painful than all to
                  witness their hypocrisy when Mr. Lovechild appears, which is seldom. They are then
                  as quiet and meek-looking as saints; but the moment he turns his back they show
                  themselves, and all our efforts are totally inadequate to restrain or control
                  them. To complain to him is of no avail, for he will not punish them; and if we
                  attempt to do it ourselves, both he and his wife raise such an outcry as to give
                  us no peace of our lives!
               "These are my chief reasons," continued he, "for having given Mr. Lovechild notice
                  to leave. As for myself I have been very kindly treated, both by him and his wife,
                  except in the first instance, which I have described to you already; but his
                  school is in such a state of insubordination and confusion, there is so little
                  doing in it, or indeed that it is possible for the most zealous to accomplish
                  under the circumstances, that I find it very irksome, and even painful, to remain
                  any longer."
               Here Harcourt ended his story. I took my leave of him with feelings of pity for
                  his sufferings and admiration for his firmness of character and his constancy in
                  suffering the ills of outrageous fortune. I left my sons with Mr. Lovechild, but
                  in a few days I wrote to him stating that circumstances rendered it necessary that
                  I should remove them at midsummer next, and I think you will agree with me that it
                  was not without good reason.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               THE LANDING.
               THEN Mr. Worthington had got thus far in his interesting story, it was announced
                  to us that we were approaching the shores of England, and the weather having now
                  become fine, we all went on deck to enjoy the scene. On our right rose the lofty
                  range of the Welsh mountains, blue and shadowy on the extremest verge of the
                  horizon. For some time no other object was visible. Soon, however, the low and
                  level shore of Lancashire appeared on our left, which as yet presented no object
                  of interest. By and by we could distinguish a cloud of smoke, as of a great city,
                  and every moment it became more and more distinct as we approached. Now
                  innumerable windmills presented themselves on the rising grounds, and next farm
                  houses and country seats and villages along the shore in great abundance. But at
                  that distance these objects appeared dull and gloomy, and not half so smiling or
                  romantic as the villas and houses that ornament our own sweet bays and harbors,
                  This I afterwards learned arose from the English houses in those parts being built
                  with a dull, dark colored kind of brick, which gives a heavy appearance to the
                  exterior of their dwellings, and to an absence of trees and shrubs along this line
                  of coast; whereas in most places along the shore in Ireland, at least as far as I
                  have seen it, the houses are neatly whitewashed and often embowered snugly in
                  trees of the richest foliage, to which they present a pleasing contrast as you
                  catch a glimpse of them through open vistas, tastefully arranged, in order to
                  produce an effect while you enter the harbor or sail along the coast. Add to this
                  that the Irish shore presents, for the most part, a romantic background of lofty
                  mountains or rugged peaks, whose stony and frowning summits rise from a basement
                  clothed in verdure or adorned with cultivated fields and gardens, villas and
                  villages, where art corrects the exuberance of nature, and gives it a more
                  humanized aspect. At other places nothing is to be seen but the solitary grandeur,
                  the unreclaimed wildness, or the forlorn barrenness of mountain, marsh and moor,
                  which impart an idea of vastness and gloomy sublimity not often to be met with
                  elsewhere, and impress the mind with feelings more easily conceived than
                  expressed. These natural beauties which we left behind us are sufficient to assure
                  you that our ideas at the first glimpse of the English coast were not of the most
                  lofty or sublime.
               But then the element on which we were then gliding was every moment as we
                  proceeded presenting us with additional proofs of the wealth, the commerce, and
                  the industry of the people, the appearance of whose country did not fill us, by
                  presenting a bold and prominent outline, with any enthusiasm or admiration. The
                  sea was literally covered with shipping, and every object we beheld, whether
                  animate or inanimate, seemed to be imbued with the restless, unromantic spirit of
                  enterprise. It seemed that we were approaching a bold, industrious people, and
                  this gave us a respect for their power and their talents.
               Nothing can be more extraordinary than the difference which appears between the
                  two countries, even at the first glance. In Ireland everything seems stationary
                  and every one listless, and even in the largest seaports commerce seems to flag,
                  as if its votaries were only half in earnest, divided between its paltry gains and
                  the mere gentlemanly pursuits of pleasure. In England every one is in active
                     and earnest motion, intent on his
                  business, and that alone in the most systematic manner, till he has realized a
                  fortune, and even then he pursues pleasure according to system; and this tendency
                  to action communicates itself in idea with every object that meets the eye.
               At length, after many soundings and much caution, (for it is a dangerous harbor,
                  and it was almost low water as we were several hours behind our time,) we arrived
                  at the mouth of the river Mersey, on which the town of Liverpool stands. We passed
                  by the lighthouse, and in a few moments afterwards were alongside the pier, which
                  was crowded with people who had come there from curiosity, as I thought, to gaze
                  on our boat and its passengers, but who, in reality, were nothing more than the
                  ordinary promenaders, who are to be seen in the same place every fine day, and our
                  boat, far from being an object of attraction to them, was hardly noticed by any
                  but the porters and hackney coachmen, and even these seemed very independent and
                  regardless of our patronage. How different again in Ireland. There 1 have seen
                  passengers almost plagued to death by the crowds of ragged, starving wretches, who
                  have flocked around them on the landing, pushing, jostling, and fighting with each
                  other, to get near them to carry their luggage, while all the honorable titles,
                  such as your honor, your lordship, your reverence, etc., which they could think
                  of, have been unsparingly poured forth to attract the attention of the stranger to
                  the peculiar merits of each candidate.
               Neither did we meet with any of those importunately persevering creatures who, in
                  other countries solicit travelers to go to particular hotels or inns; not even one
                  to present us with a card, and had we not been under the direction of a gentleman
                  who was well acquainted with the place, we might have found it somewhat difficult
                  to choose a suitable inn; but we had nothing to trouble us on this head.
               What struck me on my first landing in England was the air of comfort which
                  pervaded all ranks of the people. I seemed to have reached a happy land whence the
                  demon, poverty, was banished, or where emaciated objects, the victims of
                  starvation and disease, were removed altogether from the sight—such as in our own
                  unhappy country mar, by the spectacle of actual suffering which they present in
                  every possible variety, and at every step—the happiness which the sensitive or
                  philanthropic might otherwise enjoy in the natural scenery, or in the resources
                  with which a more bountiful Providence had endowed him individually. For who that
                  possesses the common feelings of our nature can revel undisturbed in the gifts of
                  fortune, while thousands of miserable wretches around him are suffering from want
                  or disease? Even our own countrymen, transplanted to this genial soil, had
                  undergone a great change for the better, both physically and morally. They seemed
                  here to be well clothed, well fed, and in a certain degree to participate of that
                  noble independence of mind which characterizes the English peasant, and points him
                  out as the denizen of a free and happy state, but this is too apt to degenerate
                  into insolence, with those unaccustomed hitherto to its enjoyment.
               Notwithstanding that we had counted two hundred and fifty-seven merchant vessels,
                  met in the bay, which had sailed by that morning's tide, yet the extensive docks
                  were still so crowded with ships that, as I was told, scarcely one could be missed
                  out of the mass, and that any one who had viewed the docks the evening before
                  would be at a loss! to account for the fleet which we had met, whence it came. For
                  upwards of three miles along the banks of the river a perfect forest of masts,"
                  dense as an American wood, presents itself to the astonished gaze of the stranger,
                  and the bales of goods, hogsheads of wine, spirits, etc., heaps of iron, piles of
                  cocoa-nuts, the masses of indigo, Brazil wood, logwood, and every species of
                  merchandise with which the quays are loaded; with the innumerable hands that are
                  employed in loading or unloading the vessels, the discordant jabbering of
                  languages, the cries of sailors about
                  to depart to foreign shores, or the cheers of those returning home; the weighing
                  of anchors, the hauling of ropes, the turning of innumerable capstans, with the
                  cheering songs of the sailors, the furling or unfurling of sails, the columns of
                  smoke from the steamers, the clatter of their paddles in the water, the sound of
                  the sledge and the hammer, with innumerable other sights and sounds, the one-tenth
                  of which it would be impossible to enumerate, leave such an impression on the
                  mind, first of inextricable confusion, then of regularity, order, and untiring
                  industry, of commercial enterprise and prosperity unprecedented, that it is quite
                  impossible ever to forget it.
               Having got our luggage out of the steamboat, and ordered a coach, we proceeded to
                  a first class hotel on Lord street, which we were recommended to by our new
                  acquaintance, who also took up his abode at the same place. We had only arrived at
                  the inn and arranged our plans for that night and the next day, when our friend,
                  Mr. Worthington, impatient to see his sons who were at Mr. Lovechild's school,
                  said that at some other opportunity he would take me with him and introduce me to
                  Mr. Harcourt, but that at present he would leave me to accompany my father and
                  sister, as they would doubtless be curious to see every thing worth seeing in the
                  town, and he at the same time apologized to us for not being able to conduct us in
                  person, and requested the landlord to procure us a faithful guide who would lead
                  us at once to the most remarkable objects, and explain those things which required
                  explanation, But we preferred sallying out by ourselves, as we should see quite
                  enough that day to amuse us without the services of a guide, and as we had
                  sufficient time to explore the place at our leisure, seeing that we would be a
                  whole fortnight in the town, we should not require his guidance for the
                  future.
               Wherever we went we were struck with the signs of wealth and commercial
                  prosperity. Whatever truth there may be in the theory of "the wealth of nations,"
                  Liverpool, and, I may add, the whole of England, has been able to arrive at the
                  desirable result. Individuals and companies must certainly act on fixed and
                  defined principles, but enterprise seems to me to be the grand secret of acquiring
                  wealth. Without this no people, however enlightened on the theory of commerce or
                  of wealth, can ever arrive at commercial prosperity. In the history of the past we
                  find the most enterprising people the most prosperous from the times of the
                  Phœnecians down to our own period. The sea and the ocean have, in all ages, been
                  the great and almost only sources of wealth to those nations and peoples who had
                  sufficient energy and enterprise to avail themselves of the advantages to which
                  they invite; may I not add that they have been the grand sources of social and
                  political liberty? He who by his skill and perseverance, by his courage and
                  energy, succeeds in buffeting the mighty billows of the ocean, and in exchanging
                  the skill and productions of his native country for the rich commodities of
                  foreign lands will not easily succumb to domestic tyranny. The same undaunted
                  resolution which caused him to brave the sullen tempest or the burning clime, will
                  impel him to the assertion of his just rights. His intercourse with the human
                  family will give him extended views on things both human and divine; and while it
                  enlightens his mind, will give strength and purpose to his resolution. Is a man a
                  bigot in religion from a conviction that his own is the only true faith? let him
                  visit foreign shores, he will there find people just as bigoted as himself, from
                  the very same conviction, and if he has common sense, or the powers of reason, he
                  will at once perceive that it is just as possible he himself may be wrong as the
                  people amongst whom he has arrived. This consideration will induce him to think
                  that man generally is a creature of circumstances, and by no means responsible for
                  the faith in which he may have been educated; and this reflection will cure him of
                  his bigotry, and render him more charitable towards his fellow men. Is he a
                     political partisan, an admirer of
                  the institutions of his own country and a despiser of all others? he will discover
                  by travel that there is something worthy of imitation to be met with in other
                  countries also, and that the political management of states and kingdoms goes on
                  very well without one of the principles for which perhaps he would have shed the
                  last drop of his blood; but if the institutions of his native land be really
                  excellent, he will learn to appreciate them the more by contrast.
               Thus it is that commerce is a great enlightener of men, by opening a wide field of
                  knowledge and specution to their view; and hence, too, it has been, and will ever
                  be, the political and moral regenerator of the nations when they are in danger of
                  being extinguished by tyranny and despotism. It is the natural tendency of
                  countries subsisting solely by agriculture to produce and extend the system of
                  social and civil thraldom every where; and although in this state men may enjoy
                  more peace and sluggish repose, yet in it they invariably degenerate into tyrants
                  and slaves. The natural energy of the human mind loses all its force for want of
                  that healthy excitement which commerce and the arts generate, and it sinks down
                  into a species of listless torpor from which it rarely can extricate itself. Men,
                  by degrees, from the natural indolence of their physical frame, come to prefer
                  ease and sloth with slavery, their usual attendant, to freedom with activity, its
                  necessary adjunct, when they cannot find a field of exertion adequate to the
                  powers within them, rather than exert those powers gratuitously they prefer total
                  inactivity and ease.
               How clearly is this fact illustrated, not only in our own countrymen, who, by the
                  by, are not differently organized from other men, but in all men in all countries,
                  just as circumstances have been favorable or otherwise to the development of their
                  energies. What a difference, for example, is to be traced between the Phoenecians
                  of early times, when commerce and navigation flourished amongst them, when they
                  planted their colonies along the shores of the Mediterranean, at Carthage, Hippo,
                  Marseilles, Utica, the coasts of Spain, both within and without the columns of
                  Hercules, when their trade penetrated all parts of the Palus Mœotis and Euxine,
                  reached even the British Isles, and extended itself along the shores of the
                  Baltic—what a difference, I say, is to be traced between them at that flourishing
                  time and the same people afterwards, when they were subdued by the Persians and
                  became tributary to the successes of Alexander and the Romans in turn. When their
                  great source of wealth and power was cut off their industry and energy sank also,
                  and they, from being the lords of the sea, became the slaves of their conquerors,
                  abject and poor.
               What was it that gave Athens such a preponderence in the affairs of Greece
                  immediately after the invasion of Xerxes had been so nobly repelled by the united
                  exertions of themselves and the Lacedemonians. Was it not the possession of naval
                  power; and did not their influence and their wealth, and I may add, their military
                  glory, fall with the loss of that power? for their little territory of Attica, and
                  their silver mines at Laurium, through the means of which they had built their
                  navies, could be of little service to them divested of all their colonies and
                  ruled by the iron hand of thirty tyrants.
               What shall I say of the Carthaginians, the Syracusans, and in modern times, of the
                  Venetians, the Portuguese, the Spanish, the Dutch? Is not one history, with little
                  variation, applicable to all? As long as their energies were kept alive by so
                  ample a field as the ocean presented, so long did they acquit themselves like men,
                  and enjoy those liberties and immunities which their noble exertions justly
                  merited; but when, through luxury, remissness, corruption, or evil fortune, that
                  field was irrevocably lost to them, did they not sink down to the condition of
                  slaves? so that as each sank in its turn men marvelled what could have become of a
                  people that once gloried in one or the other name.
               
               Since circumstances make men, it is plain that those which call their activity and
                  energies into virtuous and noble action, are the most desirable. No nation has
                  ever yet become great or famous which did not strenuously cultivate those arts, by
                  which an impulse is given to the human mind, and by which all its powers are
                  likely to be brought into vigorous exertion. Man is so constituted that unless he
                  be employed in useful or honorable pursuits, he will either become vicious and
                  depraved, or he will sink down to idleness and abject imbecility. He requires a
                  constant and powerful stimulus, or rather a series of stimuli, to keep him in
                  action, and just in proportion as he is employed or not will he be happy or
                  miserable.
               Now, the question seems to be, which is the best mode of calling forth and keeping
                  alive this tendency to action in man? Various nations have adopted various methods
                  of attaining this desirable end with different success. The sagacity of one man
                  discovered a means as extraordinary as it was successful of directing the common
                  mind of a whole people to one paramount object, and of exciting an enthusiasm and
                  perseverance to attain that object the most remarkable in the annals of the human
                  race. Lycurgus, the famous Spartan law-giver, conceived and executed the
                  stupendous project of reversing the order of nature, as it were, by eradicating
                  the principle of selfishness in the Spartan youth and implanting in its stead
                  patriotism and the love of glory. War and conquest were his principal aim; but no
                  matter what the object in view, if a legislator can so inspire each individual
                  with enthusiasm as to cause him to make that object his own, the summit of his
                  ambition, the source of his happiness, the goal of his existence, then is he
                  certain to have it executed according to his most sanguine wishes. But Sparta, in
                  the time of Lycurgus, was a very small state. Rulers then had great power, and
                  wise men and philosophers still more. In the constitution of modern society, the
                  habits of thought, the notions of liberty are so changed since that period that we
                  may never expect to see such a phenomenon on our globe again. If any king or ruler
                  now attempted such an experiment, he would signally fail. Besides, even granting
                  him success so far as his own kingdom was concerned, of what importance would he
                  be with his iron money and his black broth in the eyes of other nations? Would
                  these purchase the sinews of war or render him formidable to his neighbors? Could
                  he wall round his capital city with the naked bodies of his new Spartans? Alas! so
                  changed is the material and physique of war that the brave heroes would all
                  inevitably perish, even before they could see whence their destruction came. I
                  fear, however humiliating it is, we must look for permanent national power and
                  prosperity to a different principle from that which animated the breasts of the
                  Spartans.
               And what is that principle? Must I write it? Yes, however unwilling, I must write
                  down the great—and yet, after all things are considered, not very degrading—truth.
                  It is selfishness, the only constant agent and perpetual motive in
                  the universe!
               Place before every individual an object to be attained by which he hopes to be
                  aggrandized and enriched, and whatever difficulties may stand in the way, he will
                  labor with extraordinary pains and perseverance until it is gained. The excitement
                  and the reward only prepare him, merely whet his appetite, for further enterprise;
                  and even if he fail he does not despair, but tries again and again. Having
                  acquired wealth and importance, the fruits of his industrious exertion, will he
                  surrender them without a struggle to the enemy? No! Having an important stake in
                  the country, he will fight boldly to preserve it; nay, he will go forth to meet
                  the foe, while he is yet at a distance, and sacrifice his own life rather than
                  that his heirs should be robbed of their just rights by the rapacious hands of the
                  plunderers. But the hardships he has endured in acquiring his riches, the labors
                  he has undergone, and the difficulties he has encountered, have inured him to toil
                  and danger, have inspired him with courage to fight and with hopes of returning, having purchased
                  a glorious victory; and such confident hope is generally rewarded with success,
                  because it calls forth proportionate action.
               The very same motives will make him a loyal and dutiful subject, a supporter of
                  the laws and a terror to evil-doers; they would also make him a tyrant were he not
                  checked and controlled by a thousand circumstances which have raised a thousand
                  others by the very same means by which he himself has been raised to wealth and
                  consequence, and who have, therefore, rendered a monopoly of these good things
                  impossible, though a community of them is attainable by all who have industry and
                  talents to attain them.
               But though he who is potentially a tyrant may love his country, yet he who is one
                  actually cannot do so, because a tyrant cannot love his neighbor, whom, because of
                  his tyranny, he rather fears and hates, and the love of our country, as Cicero
                  beautifully expresses it, "embraces the love of our parents, our children, our
                  relations and all our fellow citizens, without distinction."
               The best way, therefore, of raising up true patriots, loyal subjects and well
                  conducted citizens is to give to all who desire it or earnestly seek for it the
                  means of possessing a stake in the country of their birth or adoption, and I know
                  no way by which this can be done so well and so innocently as through the means of
                  commerce open to the enterprise of all.
               I am the more convinced of this since I have seen with my own eyes the effects
                  which such a system has produced in this country and in this city particularly,
                  and when I reflect more closely on human affairs and the capabilities of men, my
                  hopes for the regeneration of our own dear native country begin to revive.
               When I reflect on the position of Ireland, so admirably adapted to commerce, its
                  innumerable harbors, its navigable rivers and noble lakes, I cannot help thinking
                  that nature intended it as a commercial country of no small importance. Moreover,
                  the spirit, courage, intelligence and capacities of our countrymen offer a
                  powerful guarantee that if they had once the means in their power they would not
                  be last in the race of competition with the best of their neighbors; and why
                  should they? Have they not as much sagacity and perseverance as other men? Have
                  they not as much energy and strength of purpose? Have they not as much resolution
                  and hardihood to perform whatever they undertake? Yes, and much more of those
                  qualities than most of their neighbors, even where their opportunities have been
                  but very small.
               It has often been dwelt upon as a stigma on our country that the people are
                  indolent and trivial, inattentive to the business of life, unsteady and uncertain
                  in their resolution and vacillating in their purposes; that the peasantry are lazy
                  and filthy, ignorant and superstitious, and a thousand different causes have been
                  assigned for their abject poverty, amongst which not unfrequently figures their
                  natural indolence and their recklessness about their condition. But men are often
                  deceived in their reasonings on the subject, because they do not take a
                  sufficiently wide and extensive field of inquiry, but content themselves with
                  things as they appear on the surface.
               That all the appearances and vices above described and objected to the Irish
                  character appear to the eye of the stranger in Ireland, I will not attempt to
                  deny; and that many more exist, I will freely confess, for that man must be devoid
                  of all truth who would attempt to gloze over that which ought to be diligently
                  inquired into, till the cause of the evil is detected and the evil itself
                  eradicated.
               But is it not evident that this torpor and listlessness, this seeming indifference
                  and apathy, this want of energy and steady purpose, etc., are common, and have
                  been common, to all people so situated, and have I not shown that nations once the
                  most renowned for their enterprise and energy, who were in fact the envy of the
                  world, sank down to a state of torpor and listlessness quite as bad as that of the
                  Irish as soon as the cause which had
                  aroused and sustained their energies ceased to exist. What has become of the
                  Phoenecians and Athenians now? What of the Lacedemonians and Syracusans? What even
                  of the Romans themselves, once the lords and masters of the world? Whither is the
                  glory of Venice, queen of the waters, departed? Whither that of the Portuguese and
                  the Spaniards? And what of greatness, of grandeur of character, of respect, of
                  ambition, has that departed glory left behind it amongst the numerous people whom
                  it once elevated to such a height over the nations of the earth? Are these people
                  much superior now in character or principles to the Irish people? I think not. Yet
                  the Irish never have had the advantages which they possessed but shamefully
                  abandoned to more powerful or more virtuous competitors.
               The Irish require the stimulus of manufactures, commerce and capital to excite and
                  sustain their energies, without which they must ever be slaves. Such a
                  disproportionate multitude, distributed over and depending exclusively on the
                  soil, must necessarily keep the great mass poor. A few despotic landowners, the
                  most merciless and tyrannical of any others on the globe, feed upon their thews
                  and sinews, and treat them as the most abject slaves, who dare not even complain,
                  because that would bring utter ruin and misery on themselves. In England landlords
                  are humane from two causes: first, from a dread of public opinion, which is loud
                  enough to make itself heard over the whole kingdom, and feared by the most
                  powerful in it; and secondly, because manufactures and the immense commerce to
                  which it gives existence and support, open various channels for the speculation of
                  the capitalist or the exercise of talents, which relieve the land from that
                  competition to which it would otherwise be subject, and allow the farmers a
                  respectable and honorable subsistence from the soil which they cultivate by
                  opening a home market for all they can spare. Thus the English have innumerable
                  objects of enterprise, worthy of their utmost ambition, to keep their energies
                  awake, while the Irish have only one, and that a most hopeless and heartless one.
                  How, therefore, can it be expected that the latter, with all these disadvantages
                  against them, can be other than what they are or be compared with the former in
                  steadiness and perseverance.
               But in this country (and I have now been here sufficient time to form an opinion
                  on the subject) wherever the Irish are employed they exhibit quite a different
                  character. They are both strenuous and persevering, and almost always give perfect
                  satisfaction to their employers. They are honest and industrious, and peculiarly
                  trustworthy, as fewer defaulters have been found amongst them, according to the
                  numbers employed, than amongst the same number of the English or any other nation,
                  a proof that the character by which they are distinguished at home is the natural
                  effect of their condition and by no means peculiar to them as a people. But there
                  is a good time coming for Ireland, as her own bard beautifully expresses it: 
                     
                        "The nations are fallen, but thou still art young;
                        Thy sun is but rising when others have set;
                        And though slavery's cloud o'er thy morning hath hung,
                        The full noon of freedom shall beam on thee yet!"
                     
                  
               
               The above reflections were suggested to me by the walk which I took the day after
                  my landing in Liverpool in company with my father and sister. At our return we
                  found Mr. Worthington waiting dinner for us. He was highly pleased to witness the
                  feelings of delight and astonishment which we could not help expressing at the
                  wealth, the commerce and flourishing appearance of England or of that small but
                  important portion of it which we had merely had time as yet to glance at. He
                  smiled when I inquired whether London presented such an appearance of wealth and
                  prosperity as Liverpool, and whether it exhibited that absence of poverty and
                  suffering which we had remarked with such pleasure in all around us, and he
                  answered:
               
               "Yes, indeed, its commerce is as great as, if not greater, in proportion to its
                  population, than that of Liverpool. Its appearance of wealth and grandeur is
                  increased in a ten-fold proportion because it is the capital of the empire, the
                  seat of the court, and in the season the residence of the nobles; but I am sorry
                  to add that it does not present to the eye of the stranger the absence of poverty
                  and suffering, of wretchedness and human degradation, which you have remarked in
                  this place, though when you have been here a little longer and examined it more
                  closely, you will also find enough to satisfy you that there is no country,
                  however prosperous, free from the common lot of humanity, sin and suffering.
                  Though I might add that whatever of actual suffering and misery and degradation
                  meets the eye here, or even in London, is that which has been brought on by the
                  depraved passions and vicious inclinations of the sufferers rather than by the
                  pressing necessities of the times; that, in short, nearly all the miseries we
                  endure in England are the effects of our very prosperity, of which we boast so
                  much. For there is not a man or family who are able to work but can procure
                  sufficient employment with good wages at least for a greater portion of the year,
                  and if they were prudent and frugal they might then lay up sufficient for the time
                  during which they would be unemployed or other casualties, and if any are unable
                  to work through infirmities or accident, an ample provision is made both for their
                  support and their health by the laws of the country independent of the charity of
                  the rich, which is often very extensive and useful.
               "But luxury introduced into a country soon extends itself like a plague amongst
                  all ranks, and the humblest classes, from their want of education, are likely to
                  be the greatest sufferers by it. In times of great prosperity instead of saving
                  their earnings for the evil day, they spend them in riot and debauchery, leaving
                  the future to take care of itself, illustrating by their example that passage of
                  Scripture which says,' Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof,' and hence it
                  often happens that from enjoying the very luxuries and pleasures of life they are
                  hurled at once into the utmost distress and poverty, when from their previous
                  habits they are the least capable of bearing such privations. The love of dress,
                  which I believe is not entirely peculiar to our females, but which the lower
                  orders have been able to gratify more than any other people, has done much
                  mischief to the morals of this country by corrupting the female heart and
                  rendering it callous to everything but external appearances. In short," he added,
                  "the commercial prosperity which you seem to admire so much has its drawbacks as
                  well as the poverty of your own country, which you so much deplore, for we should
                  remember that virtuous poverty is better than wealth accompanied by vice."
               "True, sir," I replied, "but there is little virtue, I fear, in the poverty we
                  endure, seeing that it is by no means voluntary, but compulsory, and if I were
                  about to choose a wife I think I should prefer one who had gone through the ordeal
                  of temptation unscathed to one whose virtue had never been placed in any jeopardy
                  whatever."
               "A very sensible remark,' he replied; "but strangers do not generally look upon
                  our manners and habits with that discernment which you seem to be endowed with,
                  nor can they very well understand, at first view, either the causes or the
                  consequences of that free and unshackled liberty which we grant to our females
                  before marriage, and hence they are sometimes unjustly severe upon us for
                  appearances which I confess seem to tell against us, but which in the end will be
                  found to accord with the principles of reason and good sense.
               "In most other countries parents keep a constant and suspicious watch over the
                  conduct of their daughters, from their earliest years up to the very day of their
                  marriage, when they consign them to the equally vigilant and perhaps much more
                  jealous care of a husband who has never learned to place that confidence in their
                  love and virtue which a freer intercourse before marriage would have enabled him
                  to test. The wife who feels herself a
                  morally responsible agent does not like to be watched thus, like one who cannot be
                  trusted out of sight; she therefore feels a just resentment at such treatment, and
                  since she cannot alter it, she determines sometimes to avenge herself by
                  justifying the very suspicions which were entertained of her. But this she
                  contrives to do in a cautious, intriguing, underhand way, either under the mask of
                  religion or in some other way which her ingenuity suggests, and for which her
                  previous education has well prepared her. But in England our course is different.
                  We first of all imbue the minds of our daughters with correct principles. We teach
                  them to be open and sincere, to despise secret intrigue and coquetry, and to act
                  in all respects and under all circumstances as rational and responsible beings. We
                  take care to point out to them the inevitable consequences which the slightest
                  deviation from the paths of honor and virtue will entail upon them, both as maids
                  and as matrons, and leave them at liberty to act and to think for themselves. If,
                  under such circumstances, they from giddiness, passion, depravity, or any other
                  cause, forget themselves, and what they owe to honor, to their parents and to
                  virtue, the bond which has hitherto united us is severed forever. They are allowed
                  to pursue their own course and to go to destruction their own way. And is it much
                  to be wondered at that amongst the humbler classes, where a good education and the
                  inculcation of sound principles are out of the question, but yet where the liberty
                  of intercourse between the sexes is greater still than amongst the middle and
                  higher classes, that many females, thus severely tried, should be found wanting,
                  that the thoughtless should be ensnared by the seducer, or that the vicious and
                  depraved should fall victims to their passions, that vice should prevail, and that
                  consequences to be deplored should arise, especially where these natural causes
                  are fostered and encouraged by a very unwise and injudicious law, which holds out
                  a premium to crime and a bribe to female prostitution, instead of stigmatizing it
                  with the brand of disgrace, and punishing it with the severest penalties?*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *It is to be observed that this was spoken long before the present poor law
                     was ever thought of.
               
               "But, on the other hand, as you have very justly remarked, those who go through
                  this fiery ordeal unscathed are indeed, and deserve to be, objects of veneration,
                  respect and love. The lover of such a woman can safely rely on her promise, and
                  the heart of her husband can repose confidence in her virtue. She will be the
                  prudent and happy mother, the cheerful, loving and industrious wife, the tender
                  nurse in sickness, the unflinching sharer of poverty or distress. In short, she
                  will be an angel on earth, to console and smile away the ills that attend on frail
                  humanity.
               "Thus we have two classes or characters of women, more distinctly marked and
                  separated from each other by a better defined and more insuperable barrier than
                  can be found in any other country. I mean the right-minded, pure and virtuous; and
                  the silly, thoughtless and depraved. Nor is it any wonder, when the nature of
                  their education and the temptations to which they are exposed are taken into
                  consideration, that the latter should be more numerous than the former, on account
                  of the superior numbers of the class to which they belong. But the number of the
                  former is so great and influential, their conduct is so excellent and exemplary as
                  to procure respect for the whole sex, and call forth the gratitude and praise of
                  all good and wise men, and happy indeed is that man whose lot it is to be blessed
                  with such a one for a wife."
               While our venerable friend was thus descanting on the virtues of his fair
                  countrywomen I could not help reflecting on the charms and far-famed virtues of
                  our own bright-eyed beauties—the fair daughters of the Emerald Isle, who yield to
                  none on the globe for attractive charms and winning grace, and I began to get
                  weary of listening to the praises of others whom I did not know, and whom I could
                  not consider equal to those with whom I
                  was so well acquainted. I fancied that the old man was exaggerating from
                  partiality to his own country, and I could not entirely assent to his doctrines on
                  that subject. But I have since found everything he uttered to be perfectly true;
                  and, without in the slightest degree depreciating our own incomparable women, I
                  can safely say that the English ladies are as high-minded, as virtuous, as
                  faithful in their love, as true wives, as prudent and excellent mothers, and as
                  beautiful and accomplished as any ladies on the face of the globe, not even
                  excepting our own. Alas! I fear I have found some among them too
                  attractive for my weak philosophy. But of this anon.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXV.
               THE INTRODUCTION.
               AFTER we had examined the chief objects of interest in and around Liverpool, I
                  took occasion to remind Mr. Worthington of his promise to introduce me to his
                  friend Mr. Harcourt, in whom we all felt much interest.
               "I shall have great pleasure in gratifying you on that head," said he. "I am going
                  down to Bootle tomorrow, to see my boys again, and if you wish to accompany me you
                  are welcome. Besides, I should like to invite Harcourt to dine with us here as
                  soon as he is free from his present engagement, which will be in a week, and it
                  would be well if you became acquainted with him, as well as your future charge, in
                  the mean time."
               "Is he going into a similar situation when he leaves his present one?" I
                  inquired.
               "No," replied Mr. Worthington, "he expects an engagement as clerk with a merchant.
                  The truth is, he is so thoroughly disgusted with teaching that he will have
                  nothing more to do with it. Indeed so far back as last Easter I offered him the
                  care of my own boys, which he declined, not only because he felt unwilling to
                  revisit the scene of his first misfortune, but because he dislikes the
                  profession."
               Next day I accompanied Mr. Worthington to Love-child-house, and was there
                  introduced to his friend Harcourt. I was struck at once with his appearance and
                  manner. In his countenance he had the marks of a high order of ability—it might be
                  called genius, and I found his mind
                  stored with every kind of learning. We soon understood each other as well as if we
                  had been acquainted for years, and as there was no reserve on either side we soon
                  became fast friends.
               While Mr. Worthington was engaged with his children Harcourt proposed a walk along
                  the beach, to which I consented, and we enjoyed a delightful conversation for
                  nearly two hours, during which, amongst other things, I asked him about the
                  characters and attainments of my new pupils, to whom I had just been presented by
                  their father.
               "You are very fortunate in having met with such boys to begin with," said
                  Harcourt. "They will give you no trouble; they are already well broken in, and you
                  have only to go on in the track that has been marked out for you. They have all
                  been well grounded in the principles of grammar, and have read a good deal of the
                  classics; and the eldest is just now beginning to manifest a taste for science,
                  which you will feel a pleasure in cultivating. I have done all I could to prevent
                  them being ruined by the pernicious system of my employer; but I fear if they were
                  to remain here six months longer their case would be hopeless, though they have by
                  nature excellent dispositions."
               "As to religion," said I, "how would you advise me to proceed?"
               "Teach them all the great truths of Christianity," said he, "which you will find,
                  however, they understand in a great measure already. Let them read the Bible
                  constantly, and study the lives and follow the examples of the primitive
                  Christians and Patriarchs, and they cannot err; but do not teach them dogmas,
                  which, according to our weak judgments at least, seem to compromise the justice
                  and mercy of God, and to set bounds to his goodness. Impress constantly on their
                  minds the moral duties which Christianity so emphatically inculcates, and endeavor
                  to render them just, honest and pious men, loyal subjects, and useful citizens of
                  a free state."
               By this time we were summoned into the house, as Mr. Worthington wished to return
                  to town. I requested the favor of Harcourt's company to dinner, in which Mr.
                  Worthington joined me, and we at length, after much persuasion, induced him to
                  accept the invitation as soon as he could get away, and then we bade him adieu for
                  the present.
               "Well," said Mr. Worthington, when we were on our way homeward, "what do you think
                  of Harcourt?"
               "Very highly indeed," I replied. "I have been quite charmed with his conversation
                  and manners. I have seldom met with a young man of such penetration combined with
                  such good sense and erudition. It would seem that his whole life has been spent in
                  reading and meditation, and the study of mankind."
               "And yet," said Mr. Worthington, "he is as accomplished as he is learned; but this
                  I have told you already, and besides you will have an opportunity of judging soon
                  for yourself—at least of some of his accomplishments."
               "Which do you mean?" I asked.
               "His skill in music and his deep, melodious voice, and the art with which he
                  manages it. I once heard him, but it was in his days of hope and love, and I shall
                  never forget it."
               "But do you think," said I, "we can induce him to sing? I fear his misfortunes
                  will render him unwilling to indulge in song."
               "Why not? Sorrow may find an adequate expression in song as well as joy. It has a
                  language peculiar to itself, and often gives a touching pathos to the melody which
                  no feeling of delight could impart. If he has not lost the use of his voice we
                  will make him sing; that I promise you."
               When we arrived at our inn we found that my father and Ellen had gone out towards
                  the new cemetery, so we too followed them thither, where we found them meditating
                  on the final lot of all mortals in that sweet valley of the dead. We told them the
                  result of our visit and that we expected to see Harcourt at our inn that day week, which intelligence gave them both
                  evident satisfaction.
               The interval between that day and Harcourt's visit was spent in exploring every
                  place in and about Liverpool, in delightful excursions on the river, sometimes
                  over to Birkenhead, at others to Woodside and New Brighton, and the evenings were
                  spent telling stories or singing the melodies of our country, in which Mr.
                  Worthington took a deep interest. Ellen has a sweet voice and sings her native
                  melodies with deeper feeling now, that she sings them in a strange land,
                  accompanying herself sometimes on the piano, sometimes on the guitar or harp,
                  which last is her favorite instrument, as it is mine also, and I joined in the
                  concert sometimes with my flute, at others with my voice, and thus the time passed
                  very pleasantly. It was now, too, at Mr. Worthington's request, that my father
                  recounted the principal circumstances of his own life, which were to me so much
                  the more interesting as I had never heard them before, and as they happened to one
                  so deservedly dear to me, and I regret that at present I cannot find time to
                  relate them to you; but at another more favorable opportunity I promise you that I
                  will tell you the whole tale, in which I am sure you will be as deeply interested
                  as I and my sister have been. Indeed, Mr. Worthington, who was almost a perfect
                  stranger to us then, was moved even to tears at the recital, which was one of an
                  extraordinary nature and differing in one essential point from most narrations of
                  this kind—it bore the stamp of truth and reality.
               At length the expected day came and our friend Harcourt arrived. He looked very
                  sad and melancholy, but we did all in our power to cheer and comfort him. At last
                  we succeeded so far as to draw him into conversation, and when he once warmed with
                  his subject, he seemed to forget his woes and to launch out into an ocean of ideas
                  through which he steered with remarkable skill and dexterity. The spirit of
                  antiquity was upon him and he was not restrained from pouring forth its impulse by
                  the presence of my sister. In fact, he at once perceived that she was not only
                  interested in the subjects, but intimately acquainted even with all their details,
                  which both surprised and delighted him. He looked upon her as a sort of prodigy
                  and seemed to think it strange that one so young and handsome could have devoted
                  so much time to books and the severer studies. He felt awed in her presence.
               After dinner, Mr. Worthington proposed, as usual, a song, and called upon Ellen to
                  sing his favorite melody, "Cathleen Mavourneen," (the words of which had been
                  recently written by Mrs. Crawford and the melody composed by Mr. Crouch, I think,)
                  which she sang with even more than her usual feeling, accompanying herself on the
                  harp of her country. Poor Harcourt was so deeply affected that the tears flowed
                  down his face and over his fingers, when he attempted to conceal them. His emotion
                  was deep and strong. The recollection of the past seemed to crowd upon his memory
                  and afflict him sorely. It was overpowering, too much so for him to endure. My
                  father perceived it and softly whispered Ellen to cease. She did so; but Harcourt
                  perceiving what had been done and at once understanding the cause, begged that she
                  would proceed. It affected him, he said, with a tender melancholy which was rather
                  pleasing than otherwise, and he hoped we would bear with him if he vented his
                  feelings in tears. They would relieve his mind of a great burden, he said, and he
                  should feel more happy afterwards. She continued, and his tears flowed even to the
                  end. She ceased, and he awoke as if from a dream. A spell had bound him, but it
                  was one of a transitory nature. When the cause which produced it ceased, the
                  effect was no longer outwardly visible, and he soon resumed his wonted serenity
                  and repose.
               After a little time, Mr. Worthington said that we were all highly obliged to Miss
                  Montague for her song and hoped that she would now, as she had won that right,
                  call upon some person able to recompense her in a slight degree for the pleasure
                  she had given.
               
               She then said that she would take the liberty to call upon Mr. Harcourt, as she
                  understood none there was so well qualified as he to give the company that
                  pleasure which Mr. Worthington expected from the exercise of her privilege.
               "A very bad call, I assure you, Miss Montague," said Harcourt with a melancholy
                  smile. "It is now so long since I waked the tuneful lyre or yielded to the
                  inspiration of the sweet muse, that I almost forget whatever little of craft in
                  that way I once was master of. However, as you have so well won your title to
                  command, it would be treason to disobey; but I would take it as a favor if you
                  would allow me to accompany myself on your harp. It will enable me to remember the
                  air."
               So saying, he sat down to the harp, and having waked a most soft and
                  soul-thrilling prelude, he began in a wild and melancholy strain as follows: 
                     
                        "Oh, wouldst thou have me sing, lady,
                        When my heart is like to break?
                        My lyre is mute; each string, lady,
                        Mourns for its master's sake!
                        For I have felt the power of love,
                        And still his pangs I feel!
                        Ah! thou wouldst not his strains appease,
                        Whose grief no time can heal!
                     
                     
                        "Dost thou command? I must obey,
                        I cannot thee refuse.
                        Those smiles which o'er thy features play
                        Must needs recall the muse;
                        For so my love was wont to smile,
                        Thus beauty decked her brow,
                        Thus she would all my cares beguile,
                        Methinks I see her now!
                     
                     
                        "Ah, fleeting shade! The lovely spring,
                        In gaudy robe of flowers,
                        Shall soon again rich fragrance bring,
                        To bless the verdant bowers;
                        But never shall the cold, damp clay
                        Restore my love to me!
                        Vain world, adieu! false joys, away!
                        I come, sweet love, to thee!"
                     
                  
               
               The touching pathos with which he sang, the deep and sweet melody of his voice,
                  and the truth of the sentiments contained in the song with their applicability to
                  the singer, made a powerful impression on all present. Ellen in particular was
                  moved to tears almost as copious as Harcourt had shed at her song. In fact, a
                  casual observer would imagine there was a sympathy between these two which, if
                  they were longer together, might lead to something more—perhaps it might, for who
                  can tell what time and opportunity might effect—but I could easily perceive that
                  there was nothing like love manifested by either. The truth is, Harcourt was then
                  too vividly impressed with the image of her he had lost to admit the bare idea,
                  and Ellen was not of a caste to be overcome by the impulse of the moment. Besides
                  she had, like most young ladies, determined to be satisfied with nothing less than
                  the conquest of an entire unsubdued heart to herself, and not to be content with
                  the spoils of another, however glorious. This I knew to be her feeling and her
                  pride. But what has love to do with resolution? He laughs at stubborn pride, too,
                  and subdues everything to his own purpose, when he wills it.
               When I perceived that our little party was now become so moping and melancholy, I
                  began to sing a light and gay air for the purpose of rallying them, and
                  dissipating the cloud which seemed to envelope the festal board. I succeeded but
                  partially, for notwithstanding all my efforts, I could perceive that a tendency to
                  sigh prevailed, especially with our two sentimentalists. There is a something
                  sacred in music, associated with our graver and more solemn feelings, which
                  forbids the idea of levity, and leaves upon the mind impressions of a solemn and
                  sublime character which are near akin to worship, though the object is vague and
                  undefined. It is the mysterious sympathy of nature which, through that medium,
                  connects soul to soul by a pleasing bond of union, unseen, it is true, but no less
                  felt by all whose souls are attuned to the same divine harmony. This sympathetic cord still
                  continued to be heard, even by myself, notwithstanding the effort I made to arrest
                  it in its vibration. It was too impalpable to be stayed by the touch, and it still
                  sent forth its thrilling harmony which penetrated all hearts with its etherial
                  tones, and all our efforts were ineffectual to recall our own souls from the
                  ecstacy into which they had risen, at least for that evening, and the company at
                  length separated for the night, penetrated with emotions which none could explain
                  or analyze but in which each loved to dwell.
               Several evenings were spent in this manner, during which Harcourt was a constant
                  and a welcome visitor, for he had now left Mr. Lovechild, and was to go to his new
                  situation in a merchant's office in the course of a week, during which time Mr.
                  Worthington had arranged that we should all remain in Liverpool for the sole
                  purpose of enjoying his society as long as that was possible. Harcourt and I,
                  accompanied by Mr. Worthington's sons, my new pupils, who had now left school for
                  good, made several excursions to various places in the vicinity, during which time
                  I had an opportunity of observing the character of my new friend more closely; and
                  the more I knew of him I admired and loved him the more. He spoke to me of my
                  sister without reserve, expressing his admiration of her beauty, talents, and
                  accomplishments, but never showed the slightest symptom of any thing bordering on
                  passion; and when I have spoken to her, I have been surprised to hear the same
                  encomiums unreservedly expressed with regard to him, and with the same absence of
                  passion or emotion. This seemed to me somewhat extraordinary, because Harcourt was
                  a young man in every respect whom I thought it impossible for any one to know and
                  not to love; for I felt certain that had I been a lady I must have loved him. And
                  on the other hand, I always considered my sister most amiable, and such a woman as
                  most men would find it difficult to avoid highly admiring at least; but in
                  Harcourt's case his indifference was easily accounted for. In her's it was not so
                  very easy, because I knew her heart was not pre-occupied by any absorbing passion.
                  What does love depend upon if not on beauty, grace, and accomplishments? And yet I
                  believe it depends upon neither one nor the other, but is the most capricious and
                  unaccountable thing imaginable.
               It seems very strange, but yet it is no less true, that we may meet with many
                  women both beautiful and accomplished, who can leave in our minds no lasting
                  impression, and at most but a transitory emotion; while again we may meet with one
                  perhaps neither beautiful nor accomplished, who at the very first glance will
                  teach us that she is the only one who has a right and a power to command our
                  affections and make the happiness or misery of our being; whose idea we cannot
                  banish from our minds, do what me may. I am almost inclined to think that there is
                  a little invisible god, who goes about shooting his arrows, not blindly, but in
                  spite, at those unfortunate beings whom, for some hidden cause of his own, he
                  wishes to subject to misery and torture, since often the parties are not adapted
                  for each other, while he suffers others, who seem born to make each other happy,
                  to go at large, unscathed, or wounded, separately, and made to pine for objects
                  which they are never deemed to enjoy, or if they do enjoy them, which turn out
                  entirely contrary to their hopes and expectations.
               Of this last class, in my mind, seemed Harcourt and Ellen. They appeared to me
                  born to make each other happy, but the little god had not shot his arrows
                  reciprocally from their eyes, and therefore all their other qualities and fitness
                  were in vain. Would that it were otherwise! for he is just the sort of husband
                  that would be calculated to make Ellen happy, and she him; and he is such a one as
                  I should delight to call brother.
               But if I was disappointed in this respect, I had the satisfaction of gaining
                  Harcourt's entire and most devoted friendship; for even in the short time we
                     had been acquainted, we became so
                  attached to each other that it was not without feelings of pain we looked forward
                  to the moment when we must part. Indeed this feeling was shared, though in a less
                  degree, by both my father and Ellen, and also, I may add, by our common friend,
                  Mr. Worthington, who were all deeply interested in Harcourt's fortunes, and both
                  loved and admired him for his social qualities and accomplishments, and the
                  natural goodness of his heart.
               Although we had been favored with a song by Harcourt, we were all very anxious to
                  hear him recite some larger piece of his own composition, especially that elegy of
                  which we had already heard so much, and accordingly on the last evening of our
                  stay in Liverpool, when we were all dull enough at the prospect of parting with
                  him so soon, I ventured to request that he would favor us with the recital of that
                  piece, if he remembered it. But he declared that he had been so disgusted with the
                  treatment he received concerning it, and the humiliation he had been obliged to
                  endure from the Rev. Mr. Fitzsurleigh, that he had never given himself the trouble
                  to think of it since, and had quite forgotten it, but that he had no objection to
                  recite another piece of still later composition, which was founded on a true
                  circumstance that he met with one night during a violent thunder storm in the
                  outskirts of the town.
               This piece he read to us, and its recital was true to nature, and produced all the
                  effect which it was intended it should, and when it was ended the applause that
                  followed was spontaneous and hearty. Mr. Worthington was warm in his commendation
                  of its spirit as well as of its style and versification; remarking that he
                  wondered much Mr. Harcourt did not devote himself exclusively to the cultivation
                  of the muses, for which, he said, he seemed intended by nature.
               "I thank you for your good opinion," replied the latter, "but the truth is, I have
                  not sufficient confidence in my own powers to induce me to cultivate so barren and
                  thankless a study as poetry. Besides, I am told, and indeed I have had some
                  experience of the fact, that it requires money as well as talents to bring one
                  into notice as an author in England; and above all, a poet who is poor has no
                  hopes of meeting with anything but scorn and contumely, let him sing ever so
                  sweetly. The booksellers cannot afford to purchase anything which is not supported
                  by a name, and if you apply to the public for subscriptions they treat you in the
                  light of a genteel beggar. The history of our literary men proves this. What poet
                  has ever succeeded in the world as an author by his own poetical merits alone, and
                  unaided either by purse or by party, or by powerful friends, which is the same
                  thing. Even Pope was obliged to descend to stratagem, and write himself into
                  notice by way of criticising his own works. But this is not confined to England.
                  Cervantes, when he saw Don Quixote neglected by the public for a considerable time
                  after it was published, was obliged to write a pamphlet to prove to his countrymen
                  that it contained some things worthy of notice.
               "What was the answer of a stage manager, no less a person than Garrick himself, to
                  Smollett, with regard to his tragedy of the Regicide, which he had promised to
                  bring out from time to time, but never kept his word? I will give you, as nearly
                  as I can recollect it, that answer in his own words, prefixed to the Regicide,
                  which was afterwards published:
               "'In short,' says Smollett, 'after sundry promises and evasions, in which he
                  practised upon me the whole art of procrastination, I demanded his final answer
                  with such obstinacy and warmth that he could no longer resist my importunity and
                  refused my tragedy in plain terms. Not that he mentioned any material objections
                  to the piece itself, but seemed to fear my interest was not sufficient to support
                  it in the representation, affirming that no dramatic composition, however
                     perfect, could succeed with an English audience by its own merit, but must
                     entirely depend on a faction raised in its behalf.'
               "But this is so notoriously the case in every department ment of literature, except that which evokes the
                  strong and degrading passions of humanity, that it would be quite superfluous to
                  dwell upon examples. The rule is so general that it would be difficult to find a
                  single exception to it. And as for patronage from governments, no man need expect
                  it, unless he condescends to be their tool and their instrument in every degrading
                  task which they may think proper to impose upon him; and even if he is so base as
                  to yield to these conditions and support his employers through thick and thin, he
                  is but indifferently rewarded, and looked upon with great coolness when he has
                  done his best, and spent his energies in their service. Smollett's treatment by
                  Lord Bute is a sufficient proof of this. But there are too many such
                  instances."
               "But," said my father, "surely the public are become more enlightened since the
                  times you mention, Mr. Harcourt, which are nearly a century ago. A vast change has
                  taken place in the condition of the mass since then. The classes which were then
                  rude and uncultivated have now become refined by the march of education, and are
                  not only readers but critics. Surely the accomplished poet has a better chance of
                  success now than he had at that period, as he can be appreciated by those who
                  formerly waited for the dictum of the critic
                  before they ventured to read, or to whom reading was not accessible at all."
               "I very much question whether such be the case," replied Harcourt; "for though
                  literature is now accessible to a greater number, the general taste is not so well
                  cultivated. Men have directed their attention to things useful rather than to
                  things ornamental. The powers of steam and of machinery have usurped the throne
                  that was once occupied by polite literature, and the energies of the rising
                  generation are directed into an entirely different and novel channel. 'What
                  wonder, then,' as the poet expresses it—
                     
                        "'What wonder, then, that we behold
                        Such prodigies as ne'er of old
                        Could, from th' existing state of things,
                        Have donned their scientific wings,
                        To mount up to the very skies,
                        To which so many now arise?
                        What wonder, too, that such a train
                        Of thought as fills the poet's brain,
                        The idle dreamings of the muse,
                        And all the grace she can infuse,
                        Should now be driven from the stage
                        In this utilitarian age,
                        When naught but vapor can go down?
                        'Tis now the lion of the town,
                        And he who glory hopes to gain
                        Must follow in its puffing train!'"
                     
                  
               
               "But," said my father, "which do you think more valuable and more calculated to
                  promote the happiness of mankind—an exquisite taste for the beautiful and ideal,
                  or an acquaintance with and control over the material world, and in a certain
                  degree over the elements of nature? It seems to me that the power and dignity of
                  the human mind is greatly enhanced and elevated in our estimation when we behold
                  it exercise such mastery over matter as was formerly attributed to the gods alone.
                  Ulysses received the winds in a bag from Æolus, who is represented by Homer as 'a
                  friend to the immortal gods,' and as having been 'constituted the steward of the
                  winds by Jove himself, to arrest their fury or let them loose on the world when he
                  thought fit;' and by Virgil in like manner— 
                     
                        
                           "'Tu das epulis accumbere divum,
                           Nimborumque facis tempestatumque potentem.'
                        
                     
                     ÆNEID I, line 79.
                  
               
               "'Thou,' says Æolus to Juno, 'grantest me the privilege of reclining at the table
                  of the gods, and makest me lord of the storms and tempests.' What Jupiter made
                  Æolus the godlike power of invention has made thousands now; if not the 'stewards
                  of the winds,' at least 'lords of the storms and the tempests.' It appears to me
                  that all learning ought to have some object in view besides mere speculation, and
                  that the man who employs his time and
                  his talents either in original invention or perfecting those made by others
                  deserves as much if not more praise than the mere scholar, who indeed may surpass
                  the others in taste, but must be acknowledged to be his inferior in
                  usefulness."
               "That, again, is a question which might be worthily disputed on both sides,"
                  replied Harcourt; "for who can appreciate the amount of good done by the poet and
                  philosopher to mankind, in a moral point of view? Who can calculate the humanizing
                  effects of Homer's works alone on the civilized world? and who will deny that the
                  Iliad and Odyssy of that immortal bard are as great and as perfect monuments of
                  the human mind as any inventions that have ever sprung from man? To minister to
                  the physical wants of man is praiseworthy; but of what essential advantage would
                  this be unless his moral faculties were cultivated and provided for also? That
                  physical activity is good for us we cannot deny; but, after all that can be said
                  on the subject, let me ask what physical enjoyments can for a moment be compared
                  to those of the mind? Discovery may extend our knowledge and our dominion over
                  nature, but it also multiplies our wants. And who is the more independent man—he
                  who has many artificial wants to be supplied, or he who has acquired dominion over
                  himself, to whom his appetites obey and not command? Who has the most time for
                  contemplation—for true and purely intellectual enjoyment? And who, in fine, more
                  promotes the happiness of his species—he who exhorts them to be sober, wise and
                  contented, or he who points out to them the whole earth and gives them the means
                  of ransacking it for the gratification of their insatiable appetites and desires?
                  Matter alone and what is called economy and mere utility are not the elements of
                  happiness, but rather the contrary, because they teach men to think of nothing but
                  their physical wants, how they may best supply them to the exclusion of the more
                  necessary wants of the mind. I grant that, duly regulated, nothing can more
                  promote the temporal happiness and comfort of our species than the knowledge of
                  living, the means of defending themselves from the inclemencies of the weather,
                  and of passing rapidly from one place to another; but the greatest danger to be
                  dreaded is that men will not content themselves with moderation, but will be
                  incited by ambition and the love of gain to turn those inventions and discoveries
                  to their own use and the gratification of their appetites, and thereby become
                  slaves to the very elements which it has been their boast to control.
               "Besides, if we devote ourselves exclusively to physics we shall in a certain
                  measure stifle, and by degrees annihilate, the better portion of our being. We
                  shall lose instead of advancing in our civilization and refinement, and all those
                  exquisite pleasures which by a cultivated taste we are privileged to enjoy will
                  depart, and barbarism and immorality will usurp their place and lead to another
                  long succession of dark and benighted ages. The universal spread of literature is
                  so superficial that it will soon be absorbed or evaporated altogether by the
                  all-devouring, all-dissipating mass of ignorance and corruption, like the sheet of
                  waters which the overflowing Nile pours on the plains of Egypt, which, when
                  absorbed or evaporated, leaves nothing but filth and slime behind it."
               "I beg your pardon, Mr. Harcourt, for interrupting you," said my sister, "but I
                  hope you will excuse me when you hear my reasons. I must remind you that this is
                  our last evening in Liverpool, and perhaps the last we shall have the pleasure of
                  your company for some time; I hope, therefore, you will not take it amiss if I
                  endeavor to improve that short period as much as possible, nor consider me too
                  selfish in so doing. I am, I need scarcely tell you, an enthusiastic admirer of
                  music and song, and it is therefore natural that, instead of this discussion, I
                  should seek to turn the current of our thoughts into another channel. We shall
                  have time enough to hear arguments hereafter. Any one can argue, but few can sing;
                  may I therefore request that you will
                  favor us with one more song before we separate?"
               "It will give me great pleasure, Miss Montague," replied Harcourt, "if my humble
                  efforts can give you any satisfaction or add to the hilarity of this little
                  company; but I think it would have been more pleasing to us all if you had
                  volunteered a song yourself, Miss Montague, as you are much better qualified to
                  give delight than I can pretend to be."
               "You will have your call," said Mr. Worthington, "and you, I have no doubt, know
                  how to exercise it with prudence. When you have finished your own song you will be
                  entitled, if you thing proper, to call on Miss Montague for one."
               "Very well," replied Harcourt; "that will certainly be an additional inducement
                  for me to sing, if I can prevail upon her to favor us afterwards."
               So saying he began and sang a sweet melody, which left a lasting impression of his
                  power on all who heard it.
               When he had finished his song he called upon Ellen, who complied in the following
                  soothing strain, which seemed to shed a balm into the weary and lovesick heart of
                  the bereaved youth, for which he expressed his thanks in the most warm and
                  grateful manner. Ellen's song was entitled "The Lover's Consolation," and is as
                  follows: 
                     
                        "The evening is calm and the heavens are bright,
                        The nightingale's song rises high;
                        Oh, would I might spring to yon regions of light,
                        And rest from my cares in the sky!
                     
                     
                        "For soon shall the storm overshadow this scene,
                        And the songsters sweet voice must depart
                        To climes more congenial; but where can I screen
                        From its fury the shrine of my heart?
                     
                     
                        "In love? It may fail! In friendship? Alas!
                        Oft friendship is naught but a name!
                        If the spirit would seek true repose it must pass
                        To those regions from which it first came!
                     
                     
                        "To those regions of bliss, where constantly spring
                        Sweetest flowers on the banks of pure streams;
                        Where minstrels immortal their melodies sing,
                        And summer eternally beams.
                     
                     
                        "Where the wretched repose and the weary find rest,
                        And the wicked to trouble shall cease;
                        And what though the spirit a while be opprest,
                        It will dwell there forever in peace!"
                     
                  
               
               This was the termination of our evening's amusement. It was now late, and Harcourt
                  having expressed himself highly gratified with the attention we had paid him, bade
                  us farewell and departed. We were to leave Liverpool at an early hour next
                  morning; so, having made the necessary preparations for our approaching journey,
                  we retired to rest.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               WORTHINGTON LODGE.
               ON the following morning, which was the twenty-fifth of June, we bade adieu to
                  Liverpool by coach, my father, sister and Mr. Worthington inside, while I and my
                  three pupils rode on the top, pleased to have an opportunity of seeing the
                  beauties of the surrounding country as we passed through it. Oh, what rich, green
                  fields on either side of the road, immediately on clearing the town, and what a
                  prospect from the hill. The whole country was like a well cultivated garden. But
                  this, I thought, was in consequence of the vicinity of so large a town, and I
                  expected that the appearance of the interior would deteriorate as we advanced; but
                  such was not the case. It even increased in beauty and richness as we passed
                  through Prescott, St. Helens, Warrington, and crossed the bridge at the last
                  mentioned place into Cheshire; and as we proceeded through that fertile pastoral
                  country, scenes of the most lovely description were presented to our delighted
                  eyes. Undulating hills and rich valleys, watered with clear streams, meadows with
                  fine crops of hay partly mowed and partly mowing, with the sweet scent of the
                  newly mown grass, fields of corn waving in the gentle air and others filled with
                  large, well-fed cattle and snowy-fleeced sheep; then orchards and farm-yards and
                  the contented faces of the laborers in the fields, the clean and comfortable look
                  of the cottages by the wayside, and the absence of all poverty and suffering—
                  these presented to my mind a picture which I had never even dreamed of in my
                  wildest imaginings, and I exclaimed to myself: "How can the Irish absentee
                  landlord look upon such universal happiness and contentment without blushing for
                  the rags and filth, the misery and distress, the beggary and starvation which are
                  staring him in the face at every step he takes in his own ill-fated country?" It
                  is no wonder, my friend, that the English are a peaceful and anti-revolutionary
                  people. They have nothing to gall them or produce discontent. They are as happy as
                  a people need wish to be, and any revolution in the state must bring ruin to the
                  meanest laborer, for even the meanest laborer has a deep interest in the well
                  being of the community, as to that cause he is indebted for the plenty and
                  contentment and the independence of character of which even he is an example,
                  while to every Irishman, except the privileged few, no change could be injurious,
                  because no change could possibly lower his condition in the scale of civilized
                  man, or diminish his physical wants and comforts, which at present are as badly
                  supplied as is consistent with his very existence.
               Since then I have traveled through many parts of England, and I can safely say
                  that I have never yet seen anything at all approaching to poverty or misery, even
                  in the very lowest classes, unless in large towns, where all those evils have been
                  brought on themselves by their own folly and improvidence; but to compare the
                  physical suffering in England with the wretchedness, misery, degradation and
                  disease that are the rule in Ireland, is a farce. Indeed, I should say there can
                  be no comparison at all, for that which in England would be considered suffering
                  or distress, would actually be accounted luxury in Ireland.
               At length late in the evening we arrived at our journey's end, in Warwickshire, on
                  the banks of a beautiful river, the Avon. Worthington Lodge is an old building of
                  the Elizabethan era and is delightfully situated at a short distance from the
                  river. The grounds are tastefully laid out, and there is an air of neatness and elegance, and, if I may use the
                  term, adaptation, about the tout ensemble of the
                  house, garden, grounds and park which displays a correct taste rather than
                  greatness of conception in the planner and architect and landscape gardener,
                  whoever they may have been, who had the management and direction of those works.
                  There is little or no effort after ornament, but all is plain and neat, as becomes
                  a country gentleman of moderate fortune; nothing ornate or meretricious, though
                  everything is well arranged and in its proper place.
               Of the building itself the entrance hall is by far the most beautiful part and the
                  most attractive, as it contains the pictures of the Worthington family for upwards
                  of three centuries, with the various armorial bearings and the trophies of war or
                  of the chase won at different times by its various members. Next to this the
                  library and dining-room are the most elegant and tasteful, the former having its
                  shelves loaded with excellent books on every subject possesses, for me at least,
                  the greatest attractions.
               The park is stored with fine deer which browse up boldly to the very windows of
                  the hall on that side next the river; but the conservatory and pleasure grounds
                  are inclosed from their incursions. There is a boat on the river which at this
                  place, opposite the house, is broad and deep. There is close by an aviary
                  containing beautiful specimens of English and other birds, and the greenhouse and
                  gardens contain many rare and beautiful plants and flowers, which are a great
                  source of amusement and instruction to those who are fond of the delightful study
                  of botany, either as a scientific pursuit or merely as a pastime. At the distance
                  of half a mile across a bridge is a rural village; there, in a very beautiful
                  cottage, with a garden and two fields attached, my father and sister are very
                  comfortably located, and I often walk over to see them, sometimes three or four
                  times in the day. The road to it is through a shady grove, up a steep hill, having
                  ascended which I have a beautiful prospect before me of the village and the
                  surrounding country for several miles, which is indeed delightful.
               Our reception at Worthington Lodge was everything that could be desired and far
                  beyond anything we had anticipated. Mrs. Worthington had been dead for several
                  years, but Mr. Worthington's two daughters having been informed by their father of
                  our coming, were ready to receive us, and their reception was most cordial and
                  gracious. They are both young and beautiful girls and ladylike, and in a short
                  time my sister and they seemed mutually pleased with each other. Indeed, from that
                  time to this, they have been inseparable companions, for my sister spends in their
                  company almost every moment she can be spared from her attention to my father, and
                  he again and Mr. Worthington are excellent friends. In fact we soon became like
                  one family, so kind and benevolent were our patrons, and so easy in their manners
                  that they always contrived to appear the obliged parties, even when conferring the
                  greatest favors.
               I found my pupils docile and tractable, and at the desire of their father I
                  pursued that course which I deemed would be most conducive to their real
                  improvement in knowledge, the knowledge of things as they are and not as they are
                  seen through the glasses of other men, which is properly called learning, and
                  differs from knowledge in this, that it is only one, and often a deceptive phase
                  of knowledge, whereas knowledge itself is all that a man can know of any
                  particular thing or science, from the closest investigation of it by himself in
                  all its bearings. Now, it is evident that a person accustomed to this kind of
                  investigation will be extremely cautious in admitting things on authority, but
                  will be inclined to examine the grounds of the fact itself, and thus be able to
                  satisfy his own mind that such and such things really are so and so. I pursued
                  this course and soon had the satisfaction of seeing its successful results in the
                  rapid improvement of my charge in many departments of useful knowledge.
               
               Thus our time passed most agreeably and profitably for a whole year without any
                  interruption to disturb the calm tranquility of our philosophical and pleasing
                  pursuits. My father's little cottage in the village was now become beautiful in
                  the extreme, for it was surrounded with the sweetest roses I ever beheld, which
                  were peeping in at the windows, as if desirous to be gathered. The shrubs and
                  flowers on the little lawn, tended and watered by the hand of my sister, throve
                  well, and the kitchen garden, which was superintended by my father and
                  occasionally by myself, was very productive in vegetables and fruits; and thus we
                  enjoyed altogether the largest portion of happiness perhaps that falls to the lot
                  of human beings in any sphere of life. My father and sister dined with us at the
                  Lodge very often, always when there was company, and Mr. Worthington introduced us
                  to all the gentry of the neighborhood, with most of whom we were now on terms of
                  intimacy, and we were often invited to their parties, and every attention was paid
                  to us by the kind and considerate families in the neighborhood, as well as by that
                  with which we were more immediately connected.
               But true happiness, alas! is a plant of brief duration. One beautiful morning (it
                  was in June) I rose early, as was my custom, to take my morning walk and commune
                  with the beauties of the opening day. The sun was not yet risen, but Aurora was
                  ushering on his ray with her rosy fingers pointing back towards his chariot of
                  fire. The hills were tinged with the first blush of day, and the valleys yet
                  sleeping in their shadowy repose. The shrill clarion of the cock awoke the
                  slumbering echoes, and the lowing of the cattle, as they were driven to the dewy
                  pasture, resounded from hill to hill, mingled with the cackling of geese and the
                  clamor of the hungry tenants of the roost. The swan, with his taper neck, rode
                  proudly on the broad river, and the swallow skimmed its surface with joyous wing.
                  The blithe mower whetted his scythe in the meadow and swept the fragrant hay, and
                  the milk maid sang as she filled her pail from the distended udder of the cow. The
                  fragrance of the hawthorn blossoms mingled with that of roses and fruit trees in
                  full bloom, and all nature was young and fair, rejoicing in the strength of the
                  new born day. The cheering voice of the lark floated far above me in the clouds
                  and fell on my ear with a melody grateful as the songs of angels. I walked slowly
                  along, drinking into my delighted soul sights and sounds of celestial beauty and
                  harmony, when lo! a sight more beautiful than all the others burst upon my
                  astonished gaze all at once round the winding path I was treading on the borders
                  of the grove. It was more like what we conceive of angels in our dreams than
                  anything bearing the human form. A young and beautiful being, she seemed not more
                  than sixteen, for the blush of the first dawn of womanhood was fresh on her cheek
                  as that on the new born rose. Her hair was of purest golden hue and fell in
                  graceful ringlets over her neck and shoulders, a natural veil, beneath whose folds
                  her snow-white bosom heaved and swelled as if inspired with emotions of delight
                  from the contemplation of the witching scene before her.
               I gazed upon this lovely being until my heart was indeed "charmed away," for I
                  have been able to think of nothing but her image ever since. Her form, her
                  features, her sweet smile, recur to me in my visions by day, and my dreams by
                  night, and peace and happiness have fled from my heart. No longer do I rejoice in
                  the society of my sister or my father, as heretofore, but I wander moodily and sad
                  through lonely places, and pine away in the contemplation of one dear idea. My
                  former energy is gone, and all who knew me hitherto are struck at the great change
                  which a short time has produced. It is in vain that I call up reason to my aid;
                  she refuses to perform her accustomed office, and shrinks back affrighted at the
                  fearful aspect which my passion presents, as if afraid to encounter it. I know not
                  what to do, for I fear I shall be quite unable to hold up against the load that
                  oppresses me. Now it is that I know
                  what love really is, formerly I scoffed at and defied him as an impotent
                  pretender; now I feel that he not only is, but that he is powerful, or that my own
                  heart, which I once deemed strong, is weak. But you will say, "take courage, there
                  is hope for you yet; persevere and you may win the love of her who has so wounded
                  you like a stricken deer." My friend there is no hope either of winning her love
                  or abating my own deep, heartfelt passion! Twelve months have passed away since
                  the fatal moment I first saw her, and my love, instead of diminishing, has
                  increased continually, though I knew too soon the fatal fact that she was
                     "engaged," even then, and that her heart was given to another long
                  before she saw me. I have struggled with my passion, but in vain, and what can I
                  do now? I feel that my services are but a poor recompense now for the kindness of
                  our friend and patron, Mr. Worthington, and to remain any longer a dead weight
                  upon him, and all belonging to me, I cannot endure. My mind has become so
                  entangled in the mazes of a hopeless passion, that I cannot apply to my duties
                  with that earnestness which I could wish, and I cannot reconcile it to my
                  conscience to remain not only inactive, but absolutely torpid in a place where
                  both gratitude and common honesty demand the most active and assiduous attention.
                  I have, therefore, made up my mind to leave this place with my father and sister,
                  and rush once more into the great world, and trust in Divine Providence for the
                  result. He will never forsake us; and perhaps time and a diversity of scene may
                  make some favorable change in my mind and feelings. Forget her I never can, nor do
                  I wish it; but some alleviation of my mental sufferings is necessary for my very
                  existence; and this I can only hope for by fleeing far away from her presence. My
                  dear father is well nigh heart broken, my sister is little better; yet they both
                  agree with me in the propriety of the course I am about to adopt. Of two evils,
                  they say, it is better to choose the least, and they have therefore preferred
                  ferred seeking for a scanty subsistence with me to running the risk of losing me
                  altogether in order to secure a temporary good. Mr. Worthington says nothing; he
                  must have penetrated into my heart long since, and there discovered the cause that
                  deprives me of all my wonted energy and him of my services. He regrets the
                  circumstance, but seems tacitly to acquiesce in the plan adopted for a remedy,
                  whether my father and he may have talked the matter over, I cannot say, but one
                  thing is certain, that both seem to feel the necessity of the step I am about to
                  take. As you are ready on all occasions to give me the benefit of your sound and
                  friendly advice, might I beg the favor of your aid at this trying moment, I shall
                  be impatient to hear from you. Write soon, I beseech you, if you value the
                  happiness of your friend.
               You will ask me why I did not inform you sooner, and also you will wish to know
                  something of the family and condition of the lady who has so innocently been the
                  cause of so much pain to a whole family. As to the first question, I think I have
                  answered it already. It is partly because I wish to give you a regular history
                  from the beginning of every thing that has befallen us, and partly from a desire
                  to divert my mind from my own sufferings, while I described the unmerited
                  sufferings and the magnanimity of another. For he that is unfortunate loves to
                  dwell on the misfortunes of others in order to alleviate his own hard lot by the
                  consolitory reflection that he is not alone in his sufferings, and that there are
                  others who are yet more unhappy than he, or perhaps he finds a pleasure in
                  retarding the narrative of his own misery for a season, and therefore seeks as a
                  means to that end some history that may, in a certain degree, correspond with his
                  own.
               As to the second point, I will most readily explain it. The lady is the daughter
                  of the clergyman of this place, the youngest of three, the two elder being
                  married. During the first year of my residence at Avondale, she had been at school
                  at some distance from home, I believe in the neighborhood of London, and had never been at home, otherwise I
                  must have seen her at church, or at Mr. Worthington's, where she has since that
                  time been a frequent and a very welcome guest. The morning I first saw her I was
                  taken by surprise; I had never heard of any one in the neighborhood at all so
                  beautiful. Indeed I afterwards remembered to have heard a dispute between the two
                  Misses Worthington, when the name of Eliza Waltham happened to be mentioned,
                  whether or not she ought to be considered handsome, one saying that she might, and
                  the other that she was far from it; and I thought there could not be much beauty
                  where there was room for doubt, but when I saw the lovely object of their
                  discussion I was astonished at their want of taste, for I instantly considered her
                  the most beautiful creature I had ever beheld.
               That very day I mentioned to my sister the rencounter of the morning, and she
                  immediately told me that it could be no other than Miss Waltham, who had returned
                  from school the day before, where she had finished her studies, and that she had
                  been introduced to her the previous evening.
               "And why did you not mention it to me before?" I said, with an eagerness which
                  told but too plainly the interest I took in the fair stranger.
               "Indeed," said she, "I never thought of any such thing. What can it affect you to
                  know that yesterday evening I was introduced to such or such a lady? But what do
                  you think of her; do you consider her handsome?"
               "She is the loveliest being I ever saw," I replied, "and I do feel a great
                  interest in every thing that concerns her."
               "Why, Edward, you are in love," said Ellen, with a smile. "Beware, and remember
                  our circumstances."
               "She is not rich," I exclaimed, "heaven be praised, and I can see no great
                  obstacle in the way of our union."
               "What, two poor people marry!" said she, laughing aloud. "How absurd you are
                  getting; dear Edward, I really thought you had more sense."
               "I can work for both," I said, with a serious look, "and as long as I have health
                  she shall never want."
               "But how do you know whether she can love you, or whether she may not be already
                  engaged," said she.
               "Engaged!" I exclaimed; "impossible. So young, so lovely; where could she have met
                  with a man capable of appreciating her worth? Mention not the hateful word; it
                  cannot, it must not be."
               "Her father," said Ellen, "though a clergyman, is a prudent, a worldly man, and he
                  will doubtless look out for a match of some substance for his daughter. The other
                  two, I understand, had many offers, but he would not permit them to accept of any
                  but rich men, though the oldest dearly loved a young man of great worth but little
                  property; but her father prevailed upon her to accept a retired tradesman,
                  advanced in years but abounding in wealth, and she did so, though it is whispered
                  she has never been happy since."
               "And never deserves to be!" I exclaimed. "How could she think of marrying a man
                  whom she could not love, merely for the sake of paltry gold? She deserves the
                  worst that can happen to her, and her old, wretched father deserves to be put in
                  the pillery for forcing her to do it."
               "He had some difficulty," said my sister, "for his daughter had a willful
                  disposition enough, but he overcame her by perseverance, and she consented at
                  last."
               "And how could the man who married her think of receiving her hand when he knew
                  her heart was devoted to another?"
               "He has since found ample time and cause for repentance," said she. "But take you
                  my advice and give up all idea of this girl, for you cannot succeed, and if you
                  should you must marry her against the will of her father; and that, you know,
                  would be a very unfortunate commencement of life."
               "That I would not wish to do," I replied; "but if she could love me I would marry
                  her; for though her father should
                  hesitate to give his consent, he would be reconciled to it at last, when he found
                  that I should do everything in my power to conduce to her happiness and
                  comfort."
               "Nothing but money can satisfy a man who loves nothing but money; so that is
                  hopeless," said she. "Besides, I hope you are too honorable to think of robbing a
                  parent of his child. How would you like such treatment if you were a father?"
               "If I was so unreasonable as to thwart and mar the happiness of my child," I
                  replied, "I should deserve worse. In short, such argument is useless, and I am
                  determined to have that maiden for a wife, or it will break my heart, and I want
                  your aid and assistance in the attempt. You have been introduced to her; you will
                  have frequent access to her—you will be her companion! For my sake gain her
                  friendship and confidence. Speak to her often of me, and enable me to enjoy her
                  company. I shall ever be grateful to you. But remember, whether you aid me or not,
                  my mind is made up. I must have that girl to wife, or I know not what will become
                  of me!" I said in a tone which excited her alarm and pity.
               "Dear brother," said Ellen, "do not talk so seriously. You surely cannot seriously
                  mean what you say"—
               "But I do, most assuredly," I interrupted, "and nothing can turn me from my
                  purpose. Will you be my friend and assist me, or my enemy and do nothing? Say at
                  once, for I cannot endure half measures!"
               "Allow me to speak to our father on the subject," said she, "and then I will tell
                  you what I will do."
               "Not a word, if you value my peace, for if I am thwarted in this suit I am undone,
                  and I know my father will never consent."
               "Well, Edward, I must ever, you know, be your friend; but if you would be guided
                  by me you would not persevere in this matter, for I have a presentiment that"—
               "What do you mean? Do you know anything militating tating against my success more
                  than you have already stated?"
               "No, certainly; but my fears for your peace and happiness, from the known
                  character of the father, suggest many obstacles."
               "Well, then, do you but introduce me to her as soon as possible, and leave the
                  rest to me."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               THE DILEMMA.
               ACCORDINGLY, that very day, while my pupils and I were walking in the fields and
                  culling flowers, we were met by the ladies, as if by accident—the two Misses
                  Worthington, Miss Waltham and my sister. I was so much embarrassed at their
                  approach that I could hardly utter a syllable. I blushed deeply, and instead of
                  bowing to Miss Waltham on my introduction, I stood staring at her, as if she was
                  something frightful. My sister began to rally me on what she called my absence of
                  mind, and the other ladies smiled, as if they all knew my secret already. I could
                  not find words to enter into conversation, and the ladies passed on. When they
                  were gone I felt the awkwardness of my behavior most acutely, and could almost
                  have punished myself for my stupidity. What opinion could Miss Waltham entertain
                  of me? I thought; and the reflection was more than I could endure.
               I knew she would dine at the Lodge that day, and I resolved to conduct myself more
                  gallantly, if possible. At all events I determined not to appear awkward or
                  embarrassed in her presence on any account. It was one of my maxims—I can scarcely
                  tell on what principle—to proceed in my courtship with caution and with a slow
                  siege, but not to attempt a regular assault. I thought it would be best to assume
                  an indifference at first, and lead her on by degrees, as it were imperceptibly
                  ceptibly, into the meshes of love, and then to take her by surprise.
               The dinner hour at length arrived. I took considerable pains to dress that day,
                  that I might appear to the best advantage. With a trembling heart I entered the
                  dining-room, where I found the party already seated at dinner. There was an empty
                  chair—it was next to Miss Waltham! What an opportunity! Nothing could be more
                  fortunate! I sat down beside her. My heart flew to my lips. I felt it palpitate
                  rapidly; any one might have heard it at the other end of the room but for the
                  clatter of knives and forks. For some time there was very little spoken; all
                  seemed intent on doing justice to the viands. The ladies seemed to have got a good
                  appetite from their morning's walk; even the divine Miss Waltham ate more than I
                  thought was seemly for one so lovely and aërial. I was the only person who could
                  not eat. When the edge of the general appetite was somewhat blunted, conversation
                  was called in to enliven the repast, and Mirth and Laughter came tripping in soon
                  after. All were gay and smiling; I alone was dull and moody.
               "I am afraid," said Mr. Worthington to me, at a pause in the conversation—" I am
                  afraid, Mr. Montague, you are not very well to-day. I have observed you have eaten
                  very little, and your accustomed vivacity seems to have departed. Is there
                  anything the matter?"
               "Only a slight headache," I replied. "It will soon be gone. I think it is owing to
                  the heat, we have had such a very warm day." And then turning to the young lady by
                  my side, I whispered (I wished to enter into conversation with her, but could find
                  nothing else to talk about at first)—
               "Don't you think, Miss Waltham, that we have had a very hot day to-day?"
               "Sir?" said Miss Waltham; and she raised her fine, large, blue eyes, whose rays
                  penetrated my heart and put me quite hors de
                     combat.
               
               "Don't you think," I whispered again, but in a still less distinct tone than before, "don't you think we
                  have had a very hot day to-day?"
               It was impossible for the young lady to understand me; but thinking that I had
                  asked her to take wine, she replied after a moment's reflection:
               "With pleasure, sir."
               "This is lucky," thought I; so I filled her glass and pledged her, and then I felt
                  my strength and courage revive in my heart, and words to give expression to some
                  of my ideas. I asked her about the last new novel. She could almost repeat it by
                  heart. The characters of the various personages there described became a fruitful
                  theme of conversation, and all my vivacity began to return. The young lady
                  discussed the merits and demerits of the work with a keen and critical
                  discernment, and I made the delightful discovery (to a lover) that her mind was as
                  cultivated and accomplished as her person was elegant and her features beautiful.
                  Then we entered upon other departments of knowledge: botany, geology, and modern
                  discovery, and I found her equally versed in all, and intelligent in her
                  conclusions and reasoning. We seemed now to understand each other; our spirits
                  could commune on congenial subjects, our eyes met in mutual confidence and esteem,
                  and we were all-sufficient for each other, without even dreaming or caring that
                  any else were present. This is a delightful feeling, and who has not experienced
                  it at some time or other of his life? And who that has once experienced it can
                  ever forget it? It is congeniality of mind, after all, that constitutes the
                  principal charm and most enduring bond of human affection.
               The cloth was removed—dessert came; but still we were both unconscious of all that
                  was passing around us. We did not even notice the nods and winks of the young
                  ladies to each other, with reference to us chiefly, nor that we were observed by
                  them. Time flew too rapidly; and when the ladies rose to withdraw both Miss
                  Waltham and myself seemed to feel that it was too soon.
               That night I slept little and early next morning I arose to enjoy the cool
                  freshness of the morning air. My steps were spontaneously directed to the spot
                  where I had first seen Miss Waltham. Hope suggested to me the idea that I might
                  see her there again, but I was deceived; she did not appear. The morning was as
                  clear and bright as the last, but its beauty was shed in vain to my ungrateful
                  eyes. She was not there, and every object in nature seemed insipid. I walked to
                  and fro in a sort of feverish, impatient excitement. I knew not why. At length I
                  bent my steps towards the church; her father's vicarage was hard-by. Perhaps I
                  might catch a passing glimpse of her form gliding through the trees or at her
                  chamber window. I passed through the gate of the church-yard and along the pathway
                  which wound through the narrow resting places of the dead, and wondered whether
                  any of the silent sleepers underneath had ever loved like me. The sexton and his
                  assistant were the only persons visible, and they were pursuing their vocation in
                  digging a grave, and lightened their labor with a song. I was now drawing near to
                  the vicarage house. There was round the garden a dense hedge of thorn cropped
                  close, and I thought I perceived something like a female figure in the garden, on
                  the other side; perhaps it was she. I stole near to the spot softly, just to feast
                  my eyes with one look and then to retire. I came to a little opening and looked
                  cautiously in the direction of the figure; it was indeed Eliza Waltham, but she
                  appeared deeply distressed. She held an open letter in her hand and the tears
                  rolled down her cheeks. What could this mean? Could it be that she had a lover?
                  And if so, could he have the heart to treat her ill? No, no! the letter must be
                  from some school-fellow whose little misfortunes called forth her sympathy; she is
                  weeping for the woes, real or fancied, of another. And this thought raised her
                  still higher in my estimation. She folded up the letter, walked up and down amidst
                  the flowers that bloomed around her then took it out again, read it over, kissed
                  it and wept, and this she repeated several times. How extraordinary dinary, I thought, that she could act thus with the
                  letter of a friend. What if it should be from a lover? And this thought
                  overpowered me. I withdrew in haste, lest my feelings should betray me, and I went
                  directly and told all I had seen and all I feared to my sister.
               She, poor girl, felt deeply for my state of mind and endeavored to console me all
                  she could.
               "As to the letter," she said, "do not allow that to disturb you, my dear brother.
                  There are a thousand causes to which her distress may be attributed besides that
                  particular one which you dread; but still I would have you prepared for the worst
                  that can happen. Do not suffer yourself to be engrossed by this fatal passion.
                  Consider the ruin it may bring, not only on yourself, but upon all who are
                  affected by it. But I will endeavor to ascertain the true state of the case. I
                  will for your sake do that which in any other case I would scorn. I will gain her
                  confidence and let you know the result, for the sooner this affair is elucidated
                  the better for all parties."
               So saying she left me and I proceeded to my daily task with an anxions heart and
                  impatient for the time when I should know the worst.
               In the meantime Miss Waltham was a constant visitor at the lodge. She took a
                  particular pleasure in conversing with me on subjects pertaining to literature,
                  science and art. Her taste was exquisite and her reading extensive for her age,
                  and her mind was almost universal such as characterizes genius. She never betrayed
                  the least embarrassment in our intercourse, and often, while we walked together in
                  the garden or the fields alone, I have been surprised at her simplicity and
                  trustfulness and the total absence of everything like passion, while I was burning
                  with the most ardent love. She seemed to have no idea that there was any
                  difference in our sexes, or the least cause of restraint in conversation. Her love
                  of nature was, or seemed to be, the one predominant feeling of her heart. You may
                  conceive the happiness I enjoyed in the company of such a woman. The more I knew
                  her the more I esteemed and loved her, both for the qualities of her mind and the
                  graces of her person. How often have I been on the point of telling her I loved
                  her! How often have the words trembled on my tongue! But the fear of offending her
                  and of losing her society, perhaps for ever, deterred me for a long time. I was a
                  frequent guest at her father's table, and the old man loved and confided in me.
                  Paradise itself did not possess more joys for its first happy inmates than I
                  derived from this delightful society. I could have been content to enjoy it for
                  ever if I had not been driven to madness by the force of passion.
               One lovely evening I had dined at the vicarage; my sister was one of the party;
                  and after dinner a walk in the garden was proposed. I offered Eliza my arm, which
                  she accepted; my sister took that of her brother, an amiable young man just
                  returned from a voyage to India, where he had gone in an Indiaman in the capacity
                  of midshipman. There were two newly married couples present also, who accompanied
                  us, and we each diverged into different walks. There was at the farther end of the
                  garden a wicket that led into the cornfields and shady lanes, whither Eliza and
                  myself directed our steps. It was a favorite walk, as it abounded with many
                  specimens of wild flowers which we were in the habit of examining. We walked along
                  the lovely pathway. The sun was setting and tinged the whole western sky with
                  purple and gold. The surrounding country was bathed in a sea of mellow light, and
                  the fragrance from the closing flowers that had drunk of the dew and were drooping
                  their heads to rest, was soothing without being too powerful. We gazed upon the
                  sky and the earth alternately, and could scarcely decide which was the more
                  beautiful. We thought each derived beauty and magnificence from the presence of
                  the other.
               "Thus it is," said I, "that man, when smiled upon by the sweet countenance of
                  woman, derives softness and interest, while she is strenghtened and invigorated by his care and support. God has so
                  arranged the universe, and all things therein has he so blended, that nothing of
                  itself is useful or beautiful; but all things derive mutual support, strength,
                  beauty and usefulness from each other. How happy are those human beings who meet
                  together on earth so as to be a mutual support and comfort to each other during
                  their mortal existence! How happy is the man who can find a partner to sympathize
                  with him in his suffering and rejoice in his joy! Their two souls blend into
                  harmony like yonder distant horizon with the green earth; they are all in all to
                  each other, and all creation pours forth its sweets for their enjoyment and
                  pleasure. In every object of nature they can recognize a blessing sent from Heaven
                  for their good, and they can raise their souls together to the throne of God and
                  bless Him for his bounty. They feel no want nor fear of want, because they can
                  trust in Heaven, and in the daytime they can labor without pain and at night
                  repose sweetly together in the certain confidence that Heaven is their protector,
                  and that at last it will be their resting place and their home forever. How blest,
                  my dear Eliza," I ventured to say, at the same time pressing her hand gently in
                  mine, "how happy should I be to meet with a congenial soul such as I have
                  described! How truly blest if you would deign to smile upon me; if you would
                  condescend to favor my suit, to accept the offer of my heart and my hand, to be my
                  friend, my love, my all!"
               While I spoke her eyes were cast on the ground, her lovely cheek was suffused with
                  a deep blush, and a sigh, which I at first considered a good omen, stole from her
                  gentle breast; but when I came from general principles to particulars, when I
                  applied the remarks which I had made to her and myself individually, the case was
                  materially altered. She started as if from a sweet dream, withdrew her arm as it
                  were involuntarily from mine, and raised her eyes with an expression of the
                  greatest possible surprise to my countenance and encountered my look with a fixed
                  and steady gaze, where displeasure and reproof, with a mixture of sorrow, were but
                  too plainly written. The tale was at once told; the mystery unravelled, and my
                  doom sealed in that one look. Without uttering a syllable she turned back and left
                  me alone to my sorrow and despair. I had not presence of mind to even offer to
                  accompany her, but stood riveted to the spot like a statue.
               From that moment to this, and it is now two months, she has not spoken to me,
                  except when common politeness and civility and appearances demanded it, and I have
                  lost entirely the pleasure of her society.
               As soon as I recovered from my stupor, I hastened after her. I entered the garden
                  nearly about the same time as she did, so that nothing extraordinary was perceived
                  by the company, with whom we now mingled, and returned all together to the house.
                  I soon made some excuse to retire, and taking my sister with me I directed my
                  steps towards our home.
               Ellen was not slow to perceive the state of my mind and she easily divined the
                  cause. I told her the whole circumstance as I have detailed it to you and she
                  sympathized with me even to tears. She then told me that she had that very day
                  heard from one who had a right to know that Miss Waltham was engaged. It was from
                  her own brother, who told her the fact during their walk, and who, it appears, at
                  the same time, was talking some soft nonsense into my sister's ear, and as he is a
                  very nice young fellow I really believe he has made an impression upon Ellen's
                  heart, though she will not confess it; but she is altered in manner ever since,
                  and I sometimes detect her sighing deeply and even shedding tears; but she says it
                  is for my sake and that of my poor father, who, having heard the whole affair from
                  her, was ready to break his heart with sorrow.
               "If it be true," I replied, "that she is engaged, as her brother says, I am indeed
                  undone! I will immediately give notice to Mr. Worthington, and leave this part of
                  the country altogether, for I cannot endure to see her the bride of another. Perhaps a change of
                  scene may alleviate my sufferings, if not, then welcome be the hand of death
                  quickly. But for you, my dearest Ellen, and my dear father, I should even now seek
                  the tyrant in his den and invite him to his prey before the time, but"—
               "Forbear the wicked thought, my dear brother. Heaven is merciful and will send you
                  consolation in due time. You must have the courage of a man, and not yield
                  yourself up a victim to despair. Both my father and myself will willingly concur
                  in any plan that may conduce to your happiness, and if you cannot endure to live
                  here we will accompany you wheresoever you wish."
               "Well, then," I replied, "go and ask him what we had better do. Tell him a11 about
                  it, and say that I cannot live here any longer than is absolutely necessary to
                  enable Mr. Worthington to procure a successor to occupy my place. I think two
                  months from this time will be sufficient. With my father's
                  permission, I will give him notice this day, and we will all proceed together to
                  London, at the end of the time mentioned."
               She went to consult my father, and in about an hour returned with his permission
                  to act as I thought proper, and saying, "that he approved of my plan, as that
                  which was most likely to conduce to my happiness now and hereafter."
               That very evening, therefore, I gave notice to Mr. Worthington to leave him in two
                  months; at the same time expressing my grateful acknowledgments for his kindness
                  and friendship for nearly two years that I had known him, and declaring that as
                  long as I lived it should never be obliterated from my mind. My excuse was that I
                  could no longer discharge my duties towards his children as I could wish, and that
                  I had a desire to try my fortune in London, whither my father and sister would
                  accompany me, where we should endeavor to establish ourselves as well as we
                  could.
               "I shall be happy to assist you in every way I can," said that worthy man; "my
                  interest, my credit, and my purse are at your service; use them freely. London is
                  the best theater for the exercise of your talents, I admit, though of course I am
                  sorry to be deprived so soon of your valuable services, but I am grateful that you
                  have favored me so long with your presence. My sons have profited much by your
                  instructions; more even than I thought it possible for boys of their age to
                  accomplish under any mode of discipline, or though endued with any talents; and I
                  am indeed agreeably surprised at the result. Their religious instruction, too, has
                  not been neglected, and as long as they live they must feel grateful to you for
                  the sound and pure principles of Christianity with which you have so thoroughly
                  imbued them. Even I confess that I have profited much both by your reasoning and
                  example, and I owe you a debt which it would require a whole life to repay."
               From that time to the present I have done all in my power to continue the good
                  work I had begun, but my efforts have been fruitless, my mind is paralyzed, and my
                  whole soul absorbed by a devouring passion which never relaxes its hold for a
                  moment.
               I have seldom seen Miss Waltham since; or if I have, her manner towards me has
                  been so altered as to render the meeting painful to both; by degrees she withdrew
                  altogether from the Lodge and has kept her own house closely, under pretence of
                  illness, and indeed at last she became ill in earnest.
               This is the last week of our stay at Avondale; my next letter will be directed
                  from London. Poor Miss Waltham is getting worse daily; her life is even despaired
                  of. To-day I have had some conversation with her physician, who is very doubtful
                  as to her recovery. This, however, must soon be decided, as she has not strength
                  to bear up against her disease much longer; it must soon take a turn one way or
                  the other. I keep this letter open purposely to let you know the result, for I am
                  determined not to leave till that is known. My sister is still her best friend,
                  and has been most assiduous in her
                  attendance on her. The whole neighborhood is in great excitement on her account.
                  Both rich and poor adored her, and her loss would be deplored by all; her father
                  is distracted with grief. But no one knows the disease under which she is
                  suffering, or if her physician does, he keeps it secret from us all.
               'Tis Friday, and Miss Waltham is pronounced out of danger; to-morrow we bid adieu
                  to Avondale. As soon as we are settled in town I will write again and let you know
                  our address and prospects. I hope you will write to me as soon afterwards as
                  possible; a letter from you now would be particularly acceptable, as it would tend
                  to alleviate the Innumerable sorrows with which we are surrounded; the pain of
                  parting from dear and well tried friends, of leaving a place and objects we love
                  dearer than life itself, and the uncertainty that attends our future home in the
                  bosom of a great metropolis, where not a soul is known to us—these are matters
                  that require the sympathy and consolation of a friend. I am overpowered with my
                  feelings; I can write no more at present, and what I have written is nearly
                  blotted out with my tears! Alas, what sorrows are crowded into one brief space of
                  time. But it is unmanly to complain and noble to endure with patience. Adieu, dear
                  friend; may Heaven preserve you from the cares and woes that have plentifully
                  fallen to the lot of your sincere but unfortunate friend.
               
                  EDWARD MONTAGUE.
               
            
            
               CHAPTEE XXVIII.
               THE SURPRISE.
               
                  LONDON, May, 183—
                  
                     To FRANK DUNWOODY, ESQ.
                  
               
               AFTER the lapse of an eventful month I address you once more. This great Babylon,
                  is indeed a miracle of grandeur and magnificence; of filth, depravity, poverty and
                  distress; of piety and crime; of every thing good and evil, of which the human
                  mind can form a conception. There is a continued stream of people in all the
                  principal streets, so that it is difficult to make way through the mass, and the
                  thoroughfares are absolutely choked up with vehicles, the noise of which is
                  stunning to the ear, and gives one such a feeling of endless confusion and chaotic
                  din as to drown every other sensation. The traffic must be enormous.
               We are located in a small court leading into one of these thoroughfares in the
                  city, and though the rent of the place is high enough, the place itself is very
                  small though comfortable; but it is so confined amongst brick walls and tiles as
                  to give one the idea of suffocation. What a contrast to the open air, and the
                  beauty and verdure of the country. I wonder why any one who can afford to live in
                  the country can think of remaining in this pent up, close, and unhealthy city. And
                  yet I have already seen many, very many, well dressed men and women, who make it
                  their chief residence. It is said that they even prefer it to the country. But I
                  pity their taste, and can have but an indifferent opinion either of their delicacy
                  or their morals. None of us like it; my
                  father says it will kill him if we remain, and my sister cannot live without the
                  sight of green fields and flowers. But necessity must reconcile us all to our lot;
                  as yet we have been able to do nothing but look around us, and lose our way; and I
                  think it will require us some weeks before we can explore even a small portion of
                  the vast metropolis.
               I have not had time even to think on any subject since our arrival. We have heard
                  that Miss Waltham is much better. Her brother Henry, the sailor, called upon us
                  yesterday. I am at a loss to know how he found us out. He is going out again to
                  India in a few days, and found our address, he says, by accident. My sister
                  blushed very deeply when he entered, and there was an embarrassment on both sides
                  which was very interesting to look upon. He has been with us almost constantly
                  since. He says we are the only family he knows intimately in town, and therefore
                  he takes the liberty of calling. But I think there is another cause which time
                  will more fully develop.
               As yet I have been able to look out for no employment, and I wander about the
                  streets, sometimes with my sister, but often alone. One seems lost amidst the
                  masses of human beings that crowd every part, and it is a matter of astonishment
                  how they are all supported, or find employment. But the greatest wonder of all is,
                  why they delight to congregate together and live in such narrow, confined cells
                  and streets when there is plenty of room for them in the open and glorious
                  country. In the principal streets there are fine shops and warehouses, and
                  therefore it is easy to see the means of existence which their inhabitants
                  possess; but there are immense numbers of small streets running out of these and
                  intersecting each other, which are tenanted by countless myriads of human beings,
                  of whom it is impossible to say whence their support is derived. They are all
                  seemingly poor, or at least in that condition, and they have no employment evident
                  to the eye of a stranger. There are, however, a multiplicity plicity of trades and
                  callings, of which I know not even the names, which the concourse of men has
                  rendered necessary for their health or comfort in a large city that could not be
                  required in the country; but a great portion of the persons here described live,
                  as I am told, in the best way they can, by their own ingenuity, by preying upon
                  their fellow men in various ways. But I have something to tell which will surprise
                  you much.
               Only ten days ago I was obliged to go into the country a distance of some fifteen
                  miles on business. It happened to be the day before the races at the place (Epsom)
                  to which my journey was directed, though I knew nothing of it till I arrived
                  there. I took my place on one of the numerous coaches that run to and fro, and was
                  fortunate enough to get a front seat, occupied by three men already, and I made up
                  the number it could hold. The man who sat next me was dressed in a black fustian
                  or serge jacket, with sleeves of a different color, and I took him to be an
                  hostler, or stable boy, attached to some family, and proceeding to join his
                  master; the person next to him was dressed like an upper servant, and the third
                  looked like a dandy lackey who was making the best display he could with his
                  master's cast off clothes. He also sported a number of flash rings on his fingers,
                  and seemed anxious to personify the second-hand gentleman, if indeed he might not
                  pass with some people for the first. To me they all appeared the servants of some
                  nobleman or gentleman who had gone on before in his traveling carriage and left
                  them to follow by the coach. The person next me was very humble in his demeanor,
                  and always seemed to address me with diffidence and with the most profound
                  respect. I was at first plagued with his talking propensity, but when I got a
                  little accustomed to him I found him a practical philosopher, and was rather
                  pleased with some of his observations and reflections which were very
                  ingenious.
               Soon, however, we arrived at the outskirts of the town. My new acquaintance,
                  pointing to a public house on the
                  roadside, whose sign was "The Elephant and Castle," said in a whisper to his two
                  companions, "that is our house; we must stop here." So saying he called to the
                  coachman to stop; and, taking a bundle which was folded in a red handkerchief, he
                  got down, and having bade me a good day, he and his companions entered the public
                  house.
               When I arrived at the place of my destination I found I must remain in the town
                  all night and the greater portion of the following day before I could have the
                  business for which I came settled, owing to the bustle and confusion of the races,
                  which were to commence on the following day. As I had nothing particular to do
                  next morning, and as the race course was close to the town, I determined to go
                  there to while away the time, though I am by no means a frequenter of such places,
                  nor do I approve of them, either for amusement or morality. I sauntered about the
                  course for some time, looking at the various shapes and forms which our plastic
                  nature delights to assume in the motley group of human beings that were
                  congregated together, all with the avowed object of enjoying a holiday, but many
                  for the express purpose of plying those trades of deception and fraud to which
                  they had been educated, in order to gain something to themselves from the
                  simplicity or folly of their fellow creatures.
               I sauntered about for some time, diverted by the scene, which is, I believe,
                  nearly the same in all countries; when feeling at length somewhat fatigued, I
                  entered a booth or tent for refreshment, and sat down to rest my limbs over a cup
                  of coffee. I had not been seated more than ten minutes when repeated shouts of
                  "Murder! murder!" in a wild and piercing shriek were heard from the adjoining
                  tent. I ran out alarmed to ascertain the cause. There was a crowd of people
                  assembled around a man who was lying on the ground, bleeding profusely and over
                  him bent a young and handsome woman, in an agony of sorrow! It was she who had
                  called out "Murder!" and the young man lying in the tent was her husband! Poor
                  thing! she was the very image of woe! Her husband had been stabbed in the side by
                  a wretch with whom he had a slight dispute about gambling, and a surgeon who
                  happened to be on the spot pronounced the wound mortal. Indeed the young man
                  expired in a few minutes. The villain who had perpetrated the deed was held in
                  custody by some countrymen till the police should come to take him to the station
                  house, and he seemed quite unconcerned about the sufferings he had inflicted on
                  two young and innocent victims. I could not help starting with involuntary
                  surprise when I caught a glimpse of his countenance, as he raised it to scowl on
                  the crowd that surrounded him with their execrations. It struck me that I had seen
                  him before, but I could not recall the exact place or time. At length his eye
                  caught my glance. It was instantly lit up with a look of recognition! He smiled
                  with a faint and sickly grin. It could not be misunderstood. It was the very man
                  who had been my companion by the coach the day before, and who had seemed such a
                  meek and mild philosopher! I now scanned his person with a keener and more
                  searching scrutiny. He was advanced in years, low, strongly built, and seemingly
                  once of a powerful and athletic frame. He had a sinister and forbidding look, and
                  a mischievous expression, and seemed just such a person as would not shrink from
                  the perpetration of the worst of crimes. There were a couple of strong-looking,
                  athletic men who seemed to take an interest in his fate, but they kept aloof as if
                  afraid to avow themselves openly his friends. These followed after the crowd, in
                  dogged and sullen silence, as the police dragged the culprit to the black
                  hole.
               I inquired into the particulars of this fatal affair, and found that the prisoner
                  was a well-known desperate character of the black-leg or swell-mob fraternity;
                  that he was a most consummate tactician at thimblerig and all other cheating
                  games; that he had inveigled the deceased to bet largely on the game, and had
                  cheated him most palpably; that the latter, a spirited young countryman, not
                  choosing to be robbed of his money
                  before his eyes, had remonstrated with him, but was surrounded by a number of
                     swells, and in the scuffle that ensued he was stabbed in the side
                  by the prisoner, whose knife was left sticking in the wound; that the deceased had
                  been married only a few days, and that his young bride was inconsolable for her
                  loss.
               "This," thought I, "is melancholy enough;" but you will form some conception of my
                  surprise, astonishment and indignation when you learn that the murderer, the
                  wretch with whom I had conversed on the coach so familiarly, and of whom I had
                  formed so good an opinion, was no other than the infamous and abandoned McArdle,
                  of whom you have already heard so much in the unfortunate Harcourt's history! Yes,
                  my friend, he has confessed to all his crimes, and especially the injury which he
                  did to that young man! As soon as I was made acquainted with these particulars I
                  went to the magistrates, informing them that I knew where Harcourt was to be
                  found, and they immediately requested me to dispatch a letter to him in all haste,
                  which I did, and as soon as it was possible I had the pleasure of meeting him in
                  town. He and I started immediately for the town of Epsom, and presented ourselves
                  before the magistrates. We were requested to accompany them to the jail, to see if
                  Harcourt could recognize McArdle, with a view of being a principal witness on his
                  trial, which was to take place in a few months. He had no difficulty in
                  recognizing one whom he had such good cause to know and never forget, and nothing
                  could exceed the feelings of disgust and antipathy manifested by him as he entered
                  the cell of the murderer.
               The prisoner at first seemed hardly conscious of our presence, so absorbed was he
                  in his own feelings and reflections. At length he started as if from a dream, and
                  springing towards Harcourt, fell on his knees, imploring his forgivenesss in the
                  most piteous language, exclaiming in good English and free from all brogue:
               "I know, Mr. Harcourt, that I must now die, for the proof of my guilt is too
                  evident to admit the slightest hope of escape, and well deserved is the punishment
                  which the justice of Heaven demands. But I could not die before confessing the
                  deep wrong which I have done you, in the vain hope of aggrandizing myself and
                  bettering my humble condition. To effect my purpose I committed crime after crime;
                  but the more I involved myself in guilt, the more did my necessities press upon
                  me, till at last I am reduced to the deplorable condition in which you now behold
                  me.
               "In order to deceive you," he continued, "I told you a tale partly true and partly
                  false, for a purpose which I will now explain.
               "Norah, your nurse, was indeed confined at the time I stated; but it was she who
                  brought forth the stillborn child and not the strange lady, who was in reality
                  your mother, and is, for I believe she is still living. Your father perished by my
                  hand, in the way I have already described to you. The strict injunctions and the
                  oath by which your mother bound us to conceal from you every circumstance
                  concerning your birth till you should be of age, and the impossibility of your
                  having any communication with your mother or family personally, rendered it easy
                  enough for me to form the scheme of self-aggrandizement which I was not slow to
                  conceive, and which might have succeeded but for the too great subtlety with which
                  it was executed.
               "I took an early opportunity of creating a misunderstanding between your mother
                  and your guardian, who never in fact knew the real circumstances of the case, and
                  the whole management of your education, etc., necessarily devolved upon myself. It
                  was agreed between your mother and me that I should, at the end of every year,
                  produce the certificates of your attendance at school, with the reports of your
                  tutors, in order that she might be enabled to judge of your progress, and she then
                  furnished the funds to pay the master, with the other incidental expenses incurred
                  on your account. These funds passed through my hands, and I took good care that
                  they should in their passage contribute something of their superfluity to my own
                     private vate use, which, joined to
                  the liberal salary allowed to Norah and me by your mother, furnished us the means
                  of living not only comfortably but luxuriously. Thus the time rolled on, and no
                  one could be better pleased with the turn affairs were taking in the world than I
                  was. But at length you approached towards manhood, when the guardianship of your
                  mother, according to the settlement made by your father before your birth, should
                  cease, and you should be your own master. I knew you detested me, and I clearly
                  saw that there was much danger to be apprehended from the moment you should arrive
                  at your majority; my calling would then be gone, and my life of ease and luxury
                  would be at an end. I therefore quietly conceived the design of deceiving you
                  before it was yet too late; but, on the other hand, lest I should be too
                  premature, I anxiously waited for the moment of your attaining your twenty-first
                  year, as any act of yours before that time I knew would not stand good in law. I
                  determined to excite your curiosity on the subject of your birth and parentage to
                  the highest possible pitch, and then to execute the scheme I had so long
                  meditated, which was to secure to myself not only a competence but a splendid
                  income for life, independent of the world, by forcing you to sign a bond in my
                  favor. I found much difficulty in inducing Norah, who loved you dearly and who
                  valued your happiness more than her own, to acquiesce in my scheme; but at last,
                  by force of argument, but more by threats, I induced her to comply. But no sooner
                  had she sworn than she began to repent; and the poor creature could get no repose
                  either by day or night, for thinking of you and your sufferings when you should be
                  made acquainted with the fictitious story of your birth. She pined away with
                  sorrow and remorse, and raved about you in her dreams, and at last became so
                  affected by her thoughts and fears as to cause me considerable alarm for the
                  consequences. This was more particularly the case after you left her for a tour on
                  the continent. She then raved incoherently about you night and day, saying that
                  you were betrayed and ruined by those who ought rather to protect you, and by this
                  means she caused me much serious alarm. I tried all I could to convince her by
                  reasoning; but finding this of no avail, rather than be baffled in my plan of
                  avarice, I formed the design of taking her off by poison, and I soon executed it,
                  for in less than a fortnight from that time she was a corpse! But I had taken my
                  measures with such precaution as to avoid the possibility of detection.
               "Things were in this state when you returned. What was my surprise when I heard
                  your voice at my cottage door on that morning; but what was my horror and despair
                  when you directly accused me of the crime of which I was guilty, but which I
                  thought was completely hidden from human observation! Had it not been for a lucky,
                  I should now say a Providential accident, I would have had your murder to add to
                  the dark catalogue of my crimes.
               "But finding from your language and manner that it was only mere conjecture on
                  your part, or the vain phantom of a dream, I succeeded in reasoning you out of it
                  and extricating myself from suspicion which, if excited at that time, must have
                  led to a discovery that would have been fatal to both myself and my prosperity.
                  The feeling, too, that your life was necessary for me, tended to allay the
                  dreadful impulse that I could scarcely resist of taking away your life at the
                  earliest opportunity.
               "When I told you that I alone knew the secret of your birth, it charmed you as if
                  with a spell and neutralized for a time the hatred that rankled in your breast
                  against me. I promised you an explanation, and the time and place were agreed upon
                  for the purpose. You came on a dark and dismal night to a wild and lonely heath.
                  You were entirely in my power. Oh! how I longed to plunge my knife into your
                  heart! but your existence was necessary to me. Your property was so settled that I
                  could get nothing if you were removed. It was only during your own life that I
                  could profit by you, for when you ceased to exist all would go to your next heir. This alone prevented me
                  from gratifying the earnest desire of my soul, which was, above all things, to
                  steep my hands in your blood.
               "I had taken care to prepare documents to convince you of the truth of what I
                  said. They were all forgeries; but the deed which I induced you to sign was drawn
                  out without a flaw; it was all correct. The one-half of your income was mine as
                  long as you lived. But an overruling destiny thwarted all my schemes. You were in
                  love; I knew it, but had not calculeted its effects, and the news I told you
                  instead of humbling you to the dust and bending you to my purposes, drove you to
                  distraction. You disappeared from the world, and all, even I, believed you were
                  dead; but a protecting hand was held over you. You were preserved to reap the
                  reward of your virtues! You are now a rich noble; you inherit the ample domains of
                  your father, and your mother still lives to bless and welcome her long lost son to
                  her arms! Go, and may you be happy! but, oh! before you leave me say that you
                  forgive me! Let that word of mercy fall from your lips and I shall yet die, if not
                  happy, yet at least not so wretched, since I have unburdened my mind of its load
                  of guilt!"
               "Wretched man!" said Harcourt, "I forgive you; but tell me, I pray you, where
                  shall I find my long lost, my unknown and surviving parent, and I will not only
                  forgive you, but bless and pray for you?"
               "In the kingdom of France and the province of Lorraine. She was happily married
                  there, but her husband is dead and she will receive you with open arms and
                  acknowledge you to be her beloved, her first born son!"
               "Her name?" said Harcourt with eagerness.
               "Her name is the Marchioness of Dumont."
               "Oh, Heavens!" exclaimed Harcourt, "it was then she whom I saw at Paris. My heart
                  told me so, for it yearned towards her with a child's instinctive affection. I
                  could have fallen at her feet and kissed the hem of her garment. And her son—she
                  has a son?"
               "Yes, the young Marquis of Dumont."
               "The same," said Harcourt. Oh! nature, thou art ever true to thyself; thou art the
                  great teacher of the human heart and dost unite congenial souls together in bonds
                  which neither time nor space can sever."
               When Harcourt ceased speaking McArdle held out his hand to him, who did not reject
                  it; but taking it in his he bathed it with his tears, and then we all knelt down
                  as if by an irresistible impulse and poured forth our hearts to God in prayer,
                  humbly entreating him to pardon the weaknesses and infirmities of our frail nature
                  and to cover the trespasses and sins of the wretched being before us with the
                  mantle of his salvation. The prisoner wept and sobbed aloud, and the feelings by
                  which he was absorbed seemed those of a sincere and true penitent.
               It appeared, too, from subsequent confessions, that he had been engaged in many
                  robberies and murders since his resources had failed by the disappearance of
                  Harcourt, and amongst the rest that he had planned, though he was not actually
                  engaged in, that one for which Harcourt had been tried and condemned, and that it
                  was one of his gang who was taken and executed for another robbery who confessed
                  that it was he who was guilty of the particular one in question, and that
                  Harcourt, who had then assumed another name, was entirely innocent.
               I have just snatched a few moments to write the above, but Harcourt and I are now
                  so busily engaged in investigating this affair, that I have not time to write any
                  more for the present. At the earliest opportunity I will resume the subject.
               
                  Yours, ever, etc.,
                  EDWARD MONTAGUE.
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               FOR DEAR LIFE.
               
                  LONDON, July, 183—.
               
               TWO months have elapsed since my last, for which delay, if it were necessary, I
                  would apologize, but it will be sufficient for your friendship to know that I have
                  been busily engaged since that time. A wonderful change has taken place in the
                  prospects of our family in that brief space of two months. But I will pursue my
                  usual course and tell you the whole regularly as it occurred. I know you like this
                  method best, and it always gives me pleasure to endeavor to gratify you.
               I did not think, when I first saw Harcourt, after I had heard his story from Mr.
                  Worthington, that I was likely to become so intimately connected with him in so
                  short a time. The more I knew of him, I liked him the better. Such true and
                  genuine nobility of soul it has never been my lot to meet with in any man. I felt
                  a deep interest in his fortunes, I confess, without ever dreaming that his
                  prosperity could affect me otherwise than to confer that pleasure upon me which
                  all properly constituted minds must feel, when true merit and virtue meet with
                  their reward. The zeal which I disinterestedly manifested in his behalf and the
                  friendship which I certainly have always entertained for him, have called forth
                  his warmest gratitude, and he declares that hence forward we shall be as brothers.
                  Already, as you shall presently see, he has done much for me—but I am
                  anticipating.
               When the confession of McArdle was published in the papers, it excited general
                  interest in all who knew Harcourt, and indeed in others who knew nothing whatever
                  of his history. Amongst the first class Mr. Worthington was in no small degree
                  gratified to find that he was at length likely to be re-established in his rights.
                  He came to town for the express purpose of offering his congratulations and
                  assistance, and showed himself ready to make any sacrifice of time, or money, or
                  interest to serve him. His experience and advice were of great importance. He
                  suggested that Harcourt should have another interview with McArdle, for the
                  purpose of regaining the deed which the latter had urged him to sign, and to
                  secure, if possible, the two men who had acted both as witnesses and intimidators
                  on that occasion. I now recollected, from the description of those men, the two
                  athletic, ill-looking fellows whom I had noticed on the race course when McArdle
                  was taken up for the murder, and I had little doubt but those two were the very
                  same who had witnessed the deed in the old shed on the common. I communicated my
                  suspicions to Harcourt and to Mr. Worthington and they agreed with me in the
                  correctness of my surmises. We therefore thought it best that these men should
                  first of all be secured, and we procured a warrant for their apprehension, which
                  it would be easy to effect, as they were seen loitering about the neighborhood of
                  the prison where McArdle was confined, for we began to suspect, from certain
                  reports we had heard, that McArdle's repentance was not sincere and that he had
                  made the confession with a view of saving his own life, through the interest of
                  Harcourt, for he fancied his own testimony would be necessary to establish the
                  identity of Harcourt and to have him reinstated in his rights. And, indeed, it
                  seemed to be so; but he could withhold it if he thought proper, for his mere
                  confession was not sufficient for that purpose; there must be legal proof to
                  amount almost to a demonstration, and this was the grand difficulty that was to be
                  overcome.
               It was, therefore, agreed that the sincerity of the culprit's repentance should be put to the test,
                  and, accordingly, Harcourt, with Mr. Worthington and myself, set out for the town
                  where McArdle was confined in order, if possible, to regain the deed and to secure
                  the witnesses, whom I would be able easily to recognize if I should happen to see
                  them loitering in the neighborhood of the prison.
               When we entered the cell of the murderer he seemed somewhat startled at our sudden
                  and unexpected appearance, but soon recovering from his surprise, he assumed a
                  face of woe and repentance and began to accuse himself for his cruelty in having
                  injured so kind and good a young man as Mr. Harcourt, and to implore his
                  forgiveness anew and the mercy of Heaven.
               Mr. Worthington then began to question him as to whether there were any person now
                  living who could swear to the identity of Mr. Harcourt besides himself (the
                  prisoner).
               "There is no one," replied the latter, "except his own mother and myself who can
                  bring legal proof of his identity, and her testimony alone, according to the law
                  of France, would not be sufficient, so that he is entirely depending on me for
                  those proofs which will not only restore him to a loving, dear parent, but enrich
                  him besides with the accumulated property of his deceased father."
               "But," said Mr. Worthington, "you are doubtless ready to give those proofs as some
                  atonement to the young gentleman for the injuries you have done him, and which you
                  seem to deplore with such remorse?"
               "Life is sweet," said the prisoner, "and I require a longer time for true
                  repentance than the law, if I am convicted, will allow me. I wish to live, for I
                  am afraid to die, and those proofs will be given only on one condition—that every
                  exertion be used to spare my life."
               "You have a deed or bond," said Mr. Worthington, "which you forced this young man
                  to sign under false pretences, will you restore that bond?"
               "What use would that be to anyone if I die?" said the culprit. "But it would be of
                  considerable service to me if my life is spared. I cannot restore it under any
                  circumstance. All I can do is to restore this young gentleman to his property, of
                  which by that bond I am entitled to the one-half during his life, and this I will
                  do only on the condition that my life is spared and I am restored to my
                  liberty."
               "How can you expect so unreasonable a condition from those who have no power to
                  confer it?" said Mr. Worthington. "You know that the law must take its course on
                  all and will not turn aside from its straight-forward path for any man."
               "Well, then," said the prisoner, "let the law take its course and let Mr. Harcourt
                  try to regain his birth-right by the course of law, without my aid, and see who
                  will be the gainer by this means."
               "Do you know two men named Bernard Flanagan and Phelim O'More?" said Mr.
                  Worthington.
               "They were the witnesses to that bond and its depositories," said the culprit in a
                  deliberate tone, "and honest men they are as ever were engaged in such a
                  transaction."
               "Are they?" said Mr. Worthington; "so much the better, then, for they are taken,
                  and have turned king's evidence against you, and promised to produce the
                  bond."
               (A messenger had just come to say that the men whom I had previously marked out to
                  the police were secured, and had turned king's evidence against McArdle and
                  confessed every thing.)
               "Indeed!" said McArdle, with a look of incredulous contempt. "I wish you joy of
                  your acquisition; but you will not be able to frighten me so easily as you
                  suppose."
               "Halloa, there," cried Mr. Worthington to the officers outside, "bring in those
                  two men, directly."
               In another moment the two quondam associates of McArdle were ushered into his
                  cell, and at the first sight of them all his presence of mind forsook him; he changed color, his lips were
                  compressed and livid, his limbs shook with rage and fury, and his countenance
                  betrayed all the diabolical feelings of his heart. He would have torn us all to
                  pieces if he could, but his rage was impotent. He stretched his chain to the full
                  length, like an enraged mastiff, but there he was obliged to stop; his fetters
                  were too strong for him, and we laughed at his vain efforts with derision, which
                  drove him completely mad. He raved, kicked, stamped, and foamed like a fury of
                  hell; and unable to endure the disgusting spectacle any longer, we left him to
                  vent his rage to the cold walls and to gnaw his guilty heart with black
                  despair.
               When the two new prisoners were examined, and the hope of pardon as accessories
                  was held out to them if they would confess, they told us in the presence of two
                  magistrates the whole truth from first to last; the real history of McArdle and
                  Norah, and the course of guilt they themselves had pursued under the direction of
                  the former. The following is a brief outline of McArdle's early history which I
                  abridge from their more ample detail.
               McArdle, (they said) was the son of poor but industrious and pious parents, who
                  labored hard to give him a good education with a design of bringing him up for the
                  church, (meaning the Roman Catholic church.) They spared no pains to execute this
                  design, and labored night and day to accomplish it. It was a foolish enough
                  undertaking, for the boy, instead of learning his books, was, from his earliest
                  years, busily occupied in learning every evil practice to which he seemed formed
                  by nature. His progress, therefore, at school was slow in learning but rapid in
                  mischief, and he grew up an accomplished though hypocritical blackguard. His poor
                  parents were entirely blind to his faults, and persevered in their original
                  design, notwithstanding the earnest advice of all their friends and relations to
                  the contrary. At last he picked up as much Latin as to allow him to pass muster
                  for the college of Maynooth, where he entered, and for some time conducted himself
                  with such address as to gain the good opinion not only of his tutors for good
                  behavior, but also from his fellow students for the versatility of his character
                  and the great power he possessed of amusing. There it was, (continued the men)
                  that we, amongst others, made his acquaintance, and an unhappy circumstance it was
                  for us that we ever met with him.
               In due time his character began to develop itself, for, notwithstanding his
                  cunning, he could not escape observation at all times. Many of the students began
                  to miss money from their desks and pockets, which was a rare circumstance indeed
                  in that establishment, and suspicion fell first on one and then on another, but
                  never, at least for a long time, on the right one. But this circumstance caused
                  much ill will and distrust in the college, and a vigilant watch was kept up by
                  many with a view of detecting and exposing the secret marauder.
               A secret committee was established for this very purpose amongst a few of the
                  senior boys, and it was agreed that the members should keep watch in turn. It
                  happened, (said Flanagan, who was the chief spokesman) that I was one of the
                  persons chosen on that committee, and it fell to my lot to keep watch during the
                  first week. For several days I was unsuccessful, and was beginning to get heartily
                  tired of my appointment, till at last, when my time of watching was almost
                  expired, I had the misfortune to detect the villain in the very act.
               I had secreted myself in a kind of cupboard in which I had bored a few small holes
                  to look through and admit the air, and from whence I had an extensive view of a
                  whole suite of dormitories, so that if any one passed into a room not his own, I
                  could instantly follow and see what he was about.
               It was on a Sunday; every one had gone to mass except McArdle, who had staid at
                  home under pretence of being unwell, and now thinking all secure, he sallied out
                  of his own room in his night-gown and
                  cautiously entered the apartment of one of the richest students in the house. I
                  followed him closely and looked through the key-hole. He went to the youth's desk,
                  drew a skeleton key out of his pocket, opened it and took out several pieces of
                  money, some in gold and some in silver. He eyed the gold for some time with a
                  greedy look, and put it into his pocket, but immediately took it out again and
                  contented himself with taking a few tenpenny pieces in silver. He then went to
                  another desk and was about to go through the same process, when, forgetful of his
                  superior strength, and ignorant of the desperation of his character when roused, I
                  pushed open the door with a shout and seized him by the collar. At first he was
                  amazed and terrified, but suddenly recovering his self-possession, he seized me by
                  the throat, which he squeezed with such violence as not only to stop my voice but
                  my breath, and to deprive me of all sensation. After a brief struggle I fell
                  senseless on the floor.
               Perceiving now that he had proceeded rather too far, he relaxed his hold, threw
                  some cold water on my face, and applied a bottle of hartshorn to my nostrils, when
                  I began to exhibit some symptoms of returning animation. At length I recovered my
                  senses and found that I had been rather too hasty in my zeal, for which I nearly
                  paid the penalty of my life.
               McArdle stood beside me with a diabolical grin on his countenance, for a few
                  moments, without uttering a syllable. At length he condescended to address me.
               "I think," said he, in a calm but firm tone, "if you did not know your man before
                  you have good reason to know me now, and for the future. All I have to say to you
                  is this, that if you ever presume to utter a single syllable about what you have
                  seen I will strangle you, as sure as you were born."
               I trembled at the determination of his look as he uttered these words, and was
                  silent, fearing that he might put his threat into execution that very moment, and
                  I have often wondered since, seeing the desperate deeds he has committed, with the
                  greatest coolness, that he did not do so. He continued:
               "You are silent; if you do not speak, I will throttle you on the spot, this
                  instant."
               "For heavens sake," I said, "spare me, and I will never tell any one."
               "Swear," said he, at the same time presenting me the breviary, "swear this instant
                  that you will not."
               "I swear, solemnly," said I, taking the book and kissing it, "that I will never
                  open my lips on the subject."
               "That is not sufficient," said he, "you must take this key and open that box,
                  (pointing to the one which he was about to open when I interrupted him) and become
                  involved in the same crime by taking there-from a portion of money, not too much,
                  lest we should be suspected, and if you conduct yourself according to my wishes, I
                  will make you a partaker of the benefits to be derived from an acquaintance with
                  one who knows how to live; but the instant you breathe a syllable of what you have
                  seen to a human being, that instant your doom is irrevocably sealed."
               I had no alternative but to do just as I was told, and accordingly I continued for
                  a length of time the unwilling accomplice of a wretch whom I detested, and my
                  companion here, Phelim O'More, was taken in exactly in the same way, with one or
                  two others. We continued our depredations to such an extent as to render us
                  intolerable; and we contracted such habits of dissipation and debauchery, which
                  this ill-gotten booty furnished us with the means of indulging in, that, by
                  degrees, we became so hardened in guilt and depravity as to render any change not
                  only distasteful to us, but almost impossible. We took the utmost precaution to
                  avoid detection, and if any one was cunning enough to outwit us we bullied him
                  into the same league, and soon made him as wicked and as desperate as
                  ourselves.
               At length an unforeseen accident was the cause of the whole plot being discovered
                  at once, and caused our disgraceful
                  exposure and expulsion from the college, with the utter ruin of our prospects and
                  the loss of our character. One of the "gang," as it was termed afterwards, fell
                  sick, and being pricked in his conscience, made a full confession of every thing.
                  The next day we were all formally expelled and driven out upon the world to prey
                  upon society, for which we were already admirably qualified.
               The first thing McArdle did (for he has always been our leader and adviser in
                  mischief) was to lie in wait for the youth who had confessed, and the first time
                  he made his appearance after his recovery McArdle met him in a lonely field, at
                  some distance from the college, and in open daylight, with his own hand, strangled
                  him on the spot.
               This deed of bloody vengeance having been done, the next consideration was how to
                  gain a living. Various means were suggested and tried in their turn, but none of
                  them were sufficient to satisfy our inordinate wants. Money was wanted, and money
                  must be had by some means or other, it little mattered how. Highway robbery and
                  often murder were perpetrated, till at length we became a pest to the
                  neighborhood, and were proclaimed in the hue and cry. We then found it necessary
                  to leave the country altogether and fly to England, where it was resolved to adopt
                  a totally different course of proceeding. McArdle in a moment saw into the
                  confiding simplicity of the English character, and instantly formed the resolution
                  of gulling the over-credulous John Bull.
               There happened at that time to be a great outcry in England against Popery, and
                  particularly against the new college of Maynooth, which had been but recently
                  established, and the system of theology adopted in that seminary as a text book
                  was an ample theme of discussion amongst the fire-brands of intolerance and the
                  Exeter Hall orators of those days. McArdle knew how to take advantage of the times
                  as well as any man, and he saw at once the steps he should take to effect his
                  purpose. He thought he would make an excellent Protestant in England, where his
                  abuse of the Maynooth system, coming from a student who from "conscientious
                  motives" had withdrawn from the Roman Catholic church altogether, could not fail
                  to turn out to his advantage. He therefore proposed to turn saint,
                  and abuse Popery and Maynooth, which were the surest roads to the hearts and the
                  purses of the pious English. We were to do the same.
               Accordingly, on our landing in England he made inquiry for the most zealous
                  fire-brand against Popery amongst the clergy, and to him he went with native
                  confidence and a holy fervor, to offer his services in the good cause, at the same
                  time stating his opportunities of knowing everything connected with the Maynooth
                  doctrine and discipline, and actually carrying a copy of Dens' Theology with him,
                  which he had stolen from the Professor of Divinity, and which it seems was not to
                  be had for love or money by any but the initiated. He was received with open arms
                  by the holy man, to whom O'More and I were introduced in a similar
                  character. We were invited to dinner, and treated with the utmost hospitality, and
                  at night prayers were offered up by the pious clergyman for the success of the
                  crusade against "Anti-christ" and "Jezebel," and a thousand other "harlots," which
                  the three holy and disinterested missionaries of the
                  true faith were about to undertake forthwith! A day was appointed for a meeting,
                  at which McArdle was to lecture; but as the subject was one of great delicacy, all
                  females, and even boys under seventeen, were to be carefully excluded! In the mean
                  time McArdle prepared himself for the occasion; and although he was no great
                  orator, he knew human nature too well not to be assured that the success of an
                  orator depended more on his theme being in itself agreeable to his audience than
                  on any ornaments of language which he could invest it with.
               At length the important day came. There was a large assembly of grave and
                  mysterious-looking men—indeed mystery was the order of the day; and the ladies
                  could hardly be made to comprehend what sort of religious meeting that could be at which their
                  presence could possibly be improper. Their curiosity was so excited that it is
                  said many disguised themselves in men's clothes in order to gratify it!
               What passed cannot be recounted to ears polite. Suffice it to say that the
                  doctrines-taught in Maynooth were read out aloud from Dens, in the original Latin;
                  and though few comprehended the meaning, yet from what they were able to glean
                  from the half-explanations, the hints and inuendoes of the learned
                     theologian who edified them with his profound lecture, they seemed
                  highly gratified. They shook their heads and clapped their hands; but, what was
                  best of all, they made a large collection to defray the expenses of the pious and
                  zealous missionaries who devoted their time and attention to the good cause, and
                  we pocketed a good round sum from that speculation! We all laughed in our sleeves
                  when our backs were turned, and lived merrily till the money was spent, and then
                  we went to work again, each taking a separate route, with a warm letter of
                  recommendation from the zealous clergyman to whom we had first offered our
                  services; and thus, under assumed names, we made the tour of England very
                  agreeably, being feasted and entertained wherever we went, not only by the clergy
                  but by the nobles of the land! and we might have been as happy as princes had it
                  not been for an extraordinary quality appertaining to each of us. We seemed
                  centers of attraction for everything precious and valuable, wherever we went.
                  Silver spoons, gold snuff-boxes, plate, watches and money had a wonderful affinity
                  for our pockets and persons—so much so that at last we attracted the attention of
                  the police. Somehow or other McArdle contrived to escape to Ireland with a nice
                  young girl whom he enticed to follow his fortunes, while we were sent on an
                  apprenticeship of twenty-one years to that agreeable and flourishing colony of
                  Botany Bay, where having faithfully served our time, we returned to this country
                  only a few years ago; and somehow or other (homogeneous bodies will meet!) we met
                  McArdle here after he had served an apprenticeship of the same length of time, but
                  much more agreeably, in cheating and deceiving you, and after so long a fast we
                  all felt a strong appetite for the same sort of food with which our boyhood and
                  youth had been nurtured; or, to speak without metaphor, we felt as ready for all
                  manner of roguery, villainy and mischief as before! In our free intercourse with
                  the accomplished artistes in the colonies we had
                  learned many useful and dexterous practices, which we now longed to apply to
                  useful purposes, and opportunities were not wanting to gratify our desires.
               McArdle's wife, Norah, (for though they were not married she went by that name,)
                  began to be troubled with certain qualms of conscience about Mr. Harcourt, and
                  also because she was not married to the man with whom she had so long lived in
                  illegal intercourse. She was a good, kind-hearted creature, but weak in mind and
                  subject to fears about a future state, and she had not that affection for the good
                  things of this world which McArdle wished; and, altogether, he thought it would be
                  safer to get rid of her, and amongst other things we assisted him in this
                  also.
               When she found herself on her deathbed she requested McArdle, by all that was
                  sacred, to procure for her a priest of that church whose ordinances she had so
                  long neglected, to whom she might confess her sins and receive from his hand the
                  last rites of her church before she expired. She also wished to be united in the
                  holy bonds of matrimony to the man with whom she had lived so long in a state of
                  sin. He having foreseen this, had taken care to provide vestments, etc., for one
                  of us, whom she had never seen, and introduce him to her as a priest, which
                  character, from our early education, it would be easy for us to assume without the
                  least fear of being detected. O'More was the person chosen to attend her, and he
                  was instructed by McArdle that if she intrusted him with any written document he
                  should pretend to take a copy of it, which he was to make her sign, and McArdle gave him a written paper which he was
                  to substitute for that copy. This was the paper which he showed you in the
                  shieling on the common on that night we witnessed the bond which you signed in his
                  favor.
               Then O'More took up the story:
               "After a general confession of her private sins, Norah told me your whole history
                  and the designs of McArdle against your peace and happiness, which she implored me
                  by everything sacred to prevent, which I promised faithfully to do. She then
                  handed me a paper written in her own hand, and signed by herself in my presence,
                  which she requested me to witness by putting my name to it. I did so. It was your
                  history, Mr. Harcourt—an account of your parentage, education and prospects,
                  particularizing certain marks on your person, known also to your mother, by which
                  you could be identified any where amongst a thousand, and she entreated me to
                  search you out and give it into your own hand without telling her husband or any
                  other person of it; for if I did, his cunning would be sure, she said, to defeat
                  my object and hers, which was to do justice. I promised to do this also, at the
                  same time giving it as my opinion that it would be safer to take a copy of it,
                  which I could keep, and which must be signed by her also. To this she acquiesced,
                  and I pretended to write a copy; but instead of doing so, I merely read it over
                  from the paper given me by McArdle, which I substituted for the copy, and she
                  signed it without perceiving the fraud. I folded up the two documents separately,
                  and then at her request I called in McArdle and performed the mock ceremony of
                  marriage, after which poor Norah soon breathed her last, seemingly relieved in
                  mind, but still uttering the name of Harcourt as long as her lips were capable of
                  motion.
               "As soon as the breath left her body I gave McArdle the paper which I had induced
                  her to sign, carefully keeping from him all knowledge of the original document
                  written in Norah's own hand and witnessed by me, prudently thinking that perhaps I
                  might one day or other turn it to good account, either by humbling his pride when
                  he should discover that he was in my power or aggrandizing myself by betraying him
                  to the injured party."
               "And what have you done with that document?" demanded Mr. Worthington.
               "I have it still and can produce it if I can thereby obtain pardon," said
                  O'More.
               "Not only shall you obtain pardon," said Harcourt, "for that is secured to you on
                  the conviction of McArdle by the very terms of king's evidence, but you shall have
                  a handsome annuity for life, which will place you beyond the reach of want and
                  leave you no temptation to crime, if you wish henceforth to live as an honest
                  man."
               "And my comrade here?" demanded O'More.
               "He, too, for your sake and the sake of justice shall have an employment that will
                  secure him a comfortable living for life and his pardon on the same conditions as
                  yourself."
               "Well, then, here is the document," said O'More, at the same time putting his hand
                  into a secret pocket inside his waiscoat and taking out a small paper parcel
                  carefully folded and sealed.
               Harcourt eagerly took it, opened it, and instantly recognized the handwriting of
                  his beloved nurse. It was just such a document as O'More had said, and a
                  sufficient legal recognition of Harcourt's person and rights in any court of law
                  or tribunal of Europe. We were all highly delighted at this lucky turn of fortune
                  and willingly recognized the directing hand of an all-wise and merciful Providence
                  in this as in all the affairs of men. There was no longer any doubt or difficulty
                  in his case and his course was now as plain as noon-day.
               When McArdle was made fully acquainted with these facts, his frenzy and despair
                  knew no bounds. He endeavored to commit suicide, but was too carefully guarded by
                  his vigilant keepers, who removed every means of self-destruction far from his
                  reach.
               Soon after this he was brought to trial, and his guilt being proved by many witnesses, not only for the
                  murder of the young man at the races, but for that of his wife and several other
                  persons, he was found guilty, condemned, and, after the lapse of a short time,
                  executed. He died as he had lived, a hardened and unrepenting sinner—a terrible
                  warning to bad men that justice, though slow, is sure to come at last, and that
                  all the wiles and snares of cunning man cannot avert the inevitable consequences
                  of a guilty and depraved life!
               May the great Ruler of the universe preserve us from the first step of sin and
                  crime, for when a man has once set his foot on the evil path he may find it
                  difficult, nay, impossible, to retrace his steps, and may be hurried on, step by
                  step, till he plunges headlong into that abyss whence there is no return and where
                  pain and woe must be his everlasting portion.
               His legal documents and witnesses to his identity being now irrefragable, Harcourt
                  at length came into the full possession and administration of his inheritance; and
                  a noble one it is, for during the whole of his minority, notwithstanding some ill
                  management and peculation on the part of agents, it had gone on steadily
                  accumulating, and he now found himself master of a very large sum of money in the
                  public funds, as well as an unincumbered hereditary estate.
               As my father has had great experience in financial affairs and the management of
                  property, he was recommended to him by Mr. Worthington as the fittest person to
                  whom he could entrust them, and as a man on whose integrity and honor he might
                  safely rely. As he is still in the vigor of intellect and has been long wishing
                  for some such employment, it is just the very thing that suits him, and the old
                  man seems to have entered into a new state of existence, so delighted is he with
                  the aspect which affairs have assumed. He has recommended Harcourt to purchase a
                  fine estate that is for sale in Ireland, and has received from him a carte blanche, in order that he may effect that
                  object. He is even now negotiating about it, and it is hoped that in a few days
                  the treaty will be concluded; and shortly afterwards he and my sister are to start
                  for Ireland in order to take possession, while Harcourt and I proceed direct to
                  the continent in order to have an interview with his mother and take formal
                  possession of his estates in Lorraine and to arrange all his affairs in that
                  province. After which we purpose returning to England for a time and then visiting
                  Ireland, the beloved land of our birth. This is the plan we have fixed upon for
                  the present. When anything important occurs I will write and inform you. In the
                  meantime letters addressed to me at Paris will be forwarded.
               Hoping soon to hear from you, I remain, my dear friend, ever truly yours,
               
                  EDWARD MONTAGUE.
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXX.
               AN EPISODE.
               
                  LONDON, ——
                  
                     TO FRANK DUNWOODY, ESQ.
                  
               
               WE have arrived here once more after an absence of several months. I received your
                  last kind letter in Paris, but I was so much occupied then and since, that I had
                  no time to answer it till this moment. You make many inquiries about how I like
                  France, how Harcourt was received by his mother, brother, sister, etc., all of
                  which I must answer very briefly at present. I will give you a fuller detail when
                  I see you personally in Ireland, which I hope will be the case very soon. Two
                  months will be sufficient for us to do all our business in London, and then we
                  will set out for our dear native home. Oh, how my soul rejoices at the bare
                  thought! The sight of mountain, bog and heather; the breathing of the pure air of
                  my native hills, even the very rags and poverty of my poor countrymen, will be
                  refreshing to me after the pomp and splendor, the wealth and the vain pageantry,
                  the pride and display with which I have been so long dazzled. And the simplicity
                  and purity of our rustic nymphs, decked out in the best of finery, health and
                  modesty, will, indeed, be delightful after the gaudy, gilded and painted forms
                  which vice assumes in this most licentious of capitals. But of this by and by; I
                  must now answer your questions briefly, as I have said.
               I like France and I like the people. They are gay, it is true, but they are
                  kind-hearted and possess many amiable qualities, amongst which the domestic
                  affections are not the least conspicuous. Love and glory—national glory—are their
                  grand characteristics, and these are never the feelings of a selfish or a
                  grovelling people. I take it that there is a great affinity between their national
                  and individual character and that of the Irish; but I have not been sufficiently
                  long in the country nor had I sufficient time to spare to enable me to form a just
                  judgment of them.
               Nothing could exceed the kindness or enthusiasm of the reception which Harcourt
                  met with from his mother and relatives. It is beyond my powers of description, and
                  I must, therefore, leave you to fill up the chasm by your own imagination, while I
                  content myself with stating that I never witnessed anything half so affecting. He
                  was instituted into the possession of his father's property without any
                  difficulty, and was recognized and hailed by a grateful people as the lawful
                  representative of a noble and honorable race of ancestors.
               Having spent some time in arranging affairs in Lorraine, we proceeded to Paris,
                  accompanied by the Marchioness and young Marquis of Dumont, with his sister and
                  her husband, who was already known to Harcourt, from having encountered him in the
                  Louvre when he visited Paris some years ago, as has been already stated. His name
                  is de Barron, and his lady is indeed a model of grace and beauty. She is
                  Harcourt's half sister, and he may justly be proud of possessing such a sister.
                  They have been married two years and have one fine child, a little girl, who bids
                  fair to be very handsome. We were introduced into the first society in Paris,
                  presented at court, and even invited to the royal table. In fact, every possible
                  attention was paid to Harcourt, and on his account, to me also, and it was with no
                  small regret that we found ourselves obliged, after the lapse of a few short
                  weeks, to withdraw from a society in which we had experienced so many agréments, such polite attentions; but business, inexorable business, called us to London,
                  and here we are once more cooped up amongst brick walls and half suffocated with
                  smoke in this beautiful month of May. But they tell me it is the
                     season, i.e., the time when all the great and fashionable folks of
                  the country leave their beautiful seats, that are just bursting forth in all the
                  luxurious loveliness of paradise, for the dust and smoke, the blacks, filth,
                  noisome stench and unhealthy air of a great, overgrown, mammoth of a capital! Is
                  this credible? Would anyone in his senses think it possible? Yet the fine
                  equipages that are appearing in great numbers in the parks, in Regent street, Bond
                  street, Piccadilly, St. James and the other principal streets of the west end
                  confirm the truth of this otherwise highly improbable story. Coronets and
                  escutcheons, gold laced cocked hats, and long poles, splendid liveries and court
                  dresses, show that the levees and drawing-rooms have commenced and that the
                  campaign of fashion and frivolity has been entered upon. This will continue till
                  the end of summer and then the fashionable world will retire into the country, or
                  to the different watering places, or disperse themselves in search of novelty and
                  amusement over every country in Europe.
               I have had a letter from my father and one from my sister. They are both in high
                  spirits—my father particularly, who seems to be now in his natural element. The
                  estate in Ireland is purchased, and the house is undergoing repair, and as soon as
                  it is ready we intend to start and take up our abode permanently, and there
                  commence our labors of love.
               It may not be uninteresting to you to hear something of a conversation which I had
                  with Harcourt a few days ago. It refers to his own feelings and that part of his
                  history with which you are not acquainted. I mean during the time he resided with
                  the merchant in Liverpool.
               This merchant was not only a man of business, but a keen discerner of character.
                  His brother, who resided in America, was a partner in the firm, and there had an
                  establishment fully as extensive as that in England. They were the largest
                  ship-owners in the country, and their trade was principally with the New World.
                  Their counting-house in Liverpool was an immense room, in which not less than
                  eighty clerks were constantly employed, and where the master himself spent no
                  inconsiderable portion of his time.
               When Harcourt entered this establishment he was struck not only with its immensity
                  but chiefly with the regularity and precision with which business was conducted,
                  and the order and decorum that prevailed in every department. The genius of
                  commerce, as he himself expressed it, seemed to hover around and inspire him. He
                  beheld in the quiet and orderly scene the elements of greatness and national
                  glory, and from that moment he entered into the spirit of his new vocation with
                  zeal and enthusiasm, resolved to explore its secret laws and penetrate its most
                  hidden recesses. But he had no small difficulty to encounter, both from his own
                  ignorance of and inexperience in business, and from the envy of the mass around
                  him, who could neither understand his zeal nor comprehend the motives by which he
                  was actuated. They, for the most part, pursued their dreary and irksome tasks like
                  mere automatons; and when the hour of deliverance from it came, they endeavored to
                  forget everything pertaining to their duties till the returning day summoned them
                  back to their desks; while he, on the other hand, took a delight in his
                  employment, entered into its spirit, and in the hours of relaxation studied its
                  theory and principles so thoroughly that he was in an incredibly short period of
                  time complete master, not only of the routine and the details of his office, but
                  also with the higher and more noble power by which the whole machine was set in
                  motion and regulated.
               Such a congenial spirit as this could not fail soon to attract the attention of
                  his patron, who, as I have already stated, was a man of the world, and well versed
                  in a practical knowledge not only of things but of men. He had early accustomed
                  himself to penetrate the human heart
                  and there read the motives that govern men's actions, and all the nice shades of
                  character within. Where the honorable and the virtuous have to pass through the
                  world by the exercise of their abilities in a dependent station it is truly
                  fortunate for them to meet with such a man as this; but the dishonest and the
                  intriguing will instinctively quail before his searching eye, and, conscious of
                  evil intentions, will slink away to seek a less discriminating master.
               From one of the lowest desks, which it was necessary for him to occupy at first on
                  account of his inexperience, Harcourt soon found himself transferred to the very
                  head of the establishment; and in a short time afterwards he was consulted on
                  every important subject by his patron, who found his advice so excellent and his
                  sagacity so unerring as to be utterly astonished. He already regarded him as a man
                  of genius, as well as prudence and perseverance, and showed him every mark of
                  favor and attention.
               Harcourt declares that when he left Mr. Lovechild's school, though he had labored
                  there six months incessantly both day and night, yet so small was the pittance of
                  wages he received that it was scarcely sufficient to pay for necessary clothes,
                  etc., to fit him out for his new situation! At this time he owed Mrs. Sweetbriar
                  (who, you will recollect, is the woman with whom he lodged when he first came to
                  Liverpool) a few pounds for board and lodging, for his money had disappeared by
                  some mysterious means several weeks before he got employment in the school, but
                  after a labor of six months he was unable to pay her a farthing. In his new
                  situation, however, by the considerate kindness of the merchant he was soon
                  furnished not only with the means of paying off that debt but also of laying by a
                  sum for a future day.
               "As soon as I got my first quarter's pay," said Harcourt, "I went instantly to
                  Mrs. Sweetbriar's, to pay her what I owed and to thank her for her kindness; for
                  though I had a suspicion that I really owed her nothing if justice was done to me,
                  yet as I could not prove it, and as, moreover, both she and her son had been
                  remarkably kind to me when all my money was gone, I really felt very grateful
                  towards them, and hastened to show that gratitude in the only way in my power. But
                  what was my surprise and astonishment when I found that she would not accept of a
                  single farthing!
               "I only give you what I justly owe," said I, "and I beg of you to accept it."
               "You owe me nothing," she answered; "I have been very well paid already."
               "How is that?" I said; "you have only been paid so and so. I owe you for several
                  weeks' board and lodging; besides, I am much indebted, too, for your kindness, and
                  on that account I hope you will accept this trifle."
               "Not one farthing!" she replied; "I am paid all I shall be paid, so ask me no more
                  questions, nor give yourself any more trouble about the matter."
               "I do not understand you," I replied. "Is John at home? I want to see him."
               "Ah, if you want to see poor John you must cross the sea! He left me a fortnight
                  ago."
               "What!" I exclaimed: "again exposed himself to the same kind of dangers from which
                  he so narrowly escaped! I really thought he never would have ventured out
                  again."
               "And I, too," said the poor woman, wiping her eyes with her apron; "but he and I
                  quarreled," said she, sobbing bitterly, "and in my passion I did not spare him, so
                  he has run away and left me alone and"——She was here stopped by her tears, and for
                  a long time could not utter a word.
               "And what provision has he left you during his absence?" said I when she recovered
                  a little.
               "The half of his pay, as usual," said she; "but besides—I will tell it you, though
                  he begged me not; yes, I will tell it you—besides that he has left me another
                  fourth, and kept only one-fourth to himself, on the condition that I shouldn't
                  never ask nothing of you," said the
                  poor woman, "and I promised I wouldn't, and, what's more too, I'll keep my word,
                  that I will, though I should starve for it, and never drink a drop of anything
                  again in my life."
               "Noble boy!" said I; "he has the soul of a prince, and we must drink his health in
                  a bumper!" So saying I went out to a spirit merchant's in the neighborhood and
                  brought in a large bottle of the best Geneva or gin, and filling out a glass for
                  her and a small drop for myself, we drank to John's good health and safe return.
                  She then entered into a long history of his virtues and goodness, saying that
                  there wasn't such a kind-hearted, good-natured, well-disposed lad—no, not in all
                  Liverpool! in which I fully agreed with her, though she led him a most wretched
                  life when he was with her, for she was incessantly scolding and quarreling with
                  him.
               "What ship is he gone out in," said I.
               "The Nancy, of Liverpool, Captain Green," she answered.
               "What," I said, "why that is one of our ships, and I shall be your paymaster as
                  soon as the money is due; but come to me at any time and you shall not want.
                  Besides, I think I can give him a lift with my patrons. However, I will try what I
                  can do for him, and even if I fail do not blame me."
               "God bless you," said Mrs. Sweetbriar, "and prosper you, for you was always ready
                  to do a poor critter a good turn," and upon this she began to weep more and more.
                  I knew this to be her way when she had taken a drop too much; so, wishing to be
                  excused from witnessing her tender feelings, I rose to depart.
               "Stop a moment," said she, "I have something to tell you; your goodness and
                  kindness makes me confess it."
               "What can this be?" thought I.
               "It was me that did it," she said, in a wild kind of hysterical scream, at the
                  same time sobbing and crying most piteously.
               "Did what?" said I, not comprehending her meaning ing or recollecting any thing
                  about her thievish propensities.
               "The money," she said; "when you was here I went into your room at night and took
                  it out of your pocket when you was sleepin, to buy a drop of gin—oh, gin, gin—why
                  did I ever drink gin? But then I hoped to be able to pay you agin some day; I
                  didn't take it with a design to steal; John told me I did, and I said I didn't; so
                  it was that that made us quarrel, and him to leave me—oh! oh! dear me!" said she,
                  bursting out into a long wail.
               I took this opportunity to leave the house, and I felt sorry that I had given her
                  the means of excitement to such a degree; but I knew it was so habitual to her
                  that she would have found means some way or other to get a drop of what she loved,
                  and this consoled me.
               I took the earliest opportunity of speaking in such high terms of approbation to
                  my patron of the honesty and other good qualities of John Sweetbriar as not only
                  to get him a material increase of pay for the present, but a promise of constant
                  employment and promotion for the future if he continued to conduct himself as he
                  had hitherto done.
               Thus nearly a year passed away, during which I had little time to reflect on the
                  past, so much was I absorbed with the duties and the interests of the present, or
                  if I ever dwelt on by-gone scenes, it was only as a confused and unpleasant dream,
                  or as if the occurrences had passed in a different state of existence. I felt,
                  however, that as far as regarded the sex, my heart was completely sealed up
                  against every thing like passion for the future. The speculative studies, too, of
                  the early period of my life in which I then so much indulged, appeared to me now
                  vain, frivolous, and unsatisfactory. I felt that they were not sufficient to make
                  the mind completely satisfied with itself, and that a life of exertion, of real
                  utility to our fellow men, and of perseverance in those pursuits which are
                  calculated to promote human happiness, is alone worthy the powers and the genius
                  of the immortal and responsible soul.
                  Instead of the shadowy dreams of those visionary times, I now grasped the
                  substance, if not actually, at least in prospect. I was preparing myself actively
                  for a harvest of which I hoped soon to reap the fruits. Books, indeed, and study I
                  still loved, but they were such alone as treated of useful subjects, geography,
                  commerce, and modern history, that splendid system of science entitled "The Wealth
                  of Nations," which the unwearied genius of a great economist has left us, and
                  those other systems of political and domestic economy which modern philosophers
                  alone have invented and developed; these, and such like books, formed the chief
                  subjects of my meditations in my leisure hours, and their principles and theories
                  were proved and tried by the actual experience of the following day. Thus, in a
                  short time I acquired a large fund of useful and important knowledge, which I
                  employed with my whole zeal and powers, exclusively to promote the interests of my
                  employer; and thus I felt as happy as circumstances and the memory of past scenes
                  would permit.
               I have said that about a year passed in this agreeable and useful state of
                  healthful excitement, when a circumstance occurred which gave a new turn to my
                  thoughts, or rather, perhaps, I should say, directed them into an old and
                  dangerous channel.
               It happened at this time that my patron, from too much anxiety and over exertion,
                  was taken ill. His malady was of a low, nervous, but by no means a dangerous
                  description. His physician said that he only required repose from his severe
                  labors and mental tranquility to restore him to his health, and that therefore he
                  must remain in the house and not give himself much concern about business for some
                  time. It was essential at least, he affirmed, that he should not engage for the
                  present in the more laborious duties, however anxious he might be to hear how
                  affairs were going on, which alone could be permitted to him with prudence.
               At first there was some difficulty in carrying these peremptory decrees into
                  effect, for my patron would infallibly perish if he were not permitted to hear the
                  results of business, however he might be persuaded to dispense with the detail. It
                  was at length arranged that a confidential clerk must lodge with him in the house,
                  with whom he could confer on all occasions, and who would be ready every evening
                  to entertain him with a full and clear account of the business of the day. This it
                  was thought would gratify without oppressing him, and thus he might gradually be
                  brought round to his original health and spirits. Unluckily for me I was the
                  person chosen to fill this office.
               From the peculiar nature of my position it had ever been a principle with me to
                  avoid all association or acquaintance with those in whom I might be likely to feel
                  too deep an interest. Of a warm and susceptible temperament, I mistrusted my own
                  heart, and therefore took as much care as possible to save myself from the
                  consequences which any imprudent levity would necessarily entail upon me. But
                  especially since the fatal passion which absorbed me, for the adored but lost one
                  who died for my sake, my care and watchfulness over myself were redoubled, though
                  I felt this was almost unnecessary. Still an instinctive monitor warned me to
                  beware, and when the announcement of this new change of position was made to me I
                  absolutely trembled for my safety, though I scarcely knew why I did so. It is true
                  I had heard my patron had an amiable family of two daughters, but what was there
                  in that common circumstance to startle or alarm me? I could not account for it,
                  but such was the fact; and though every soul in the counting house envied my good
                  fortune, and would have esteemed himself most happy to be in my place, yet I would
                  have excused myself from the honor if I could have done so with any show of
                  reason, or without appearing very ungrateful.
               There was not, however, any time left, either for reflection or remonstrance; the
                  change must be made immediately,
                  whether I was prepared for it or not, and accordingly on the very evening I was
                  made acquainted with the decision I was forced to take up my abode in the
                  merchant's house, which I did accordingly, though with rather a bad grace.
               It was, however, a very quiet and retired family into which I was now inducted as
                  a member rather than a dependent. It consisted of Mr. Brown, his wife, two
                  daughters grown up, and a son who was as yet only ten years of age, and so
                  extremely delicate as to prevent him being sent to school. Mrs. Brown was a very
                  nice, pleasing lady, of mild and retiring manners; her two daughters, though not
                  handsome, were interesting in appearance and highly accomplished. They were both
                  little in stature, and about the respective ages of eighteen and twenty. The elder
                  would be considered the handsomer of the two by most people, because her features
                  were more regular. She was also more genteel in appearance, being more slender and
                  delicate than her sister, who was inclined rather to plumpness. They had beautiful
                  hair, which was neatly arranged, and their manners, though not exhibiting the
                     tournure, as they call it, of the great world
                  of fashion, were correct without being awkward or restrained. They all received me
                  with politeness, but yet with a manner which left me to feel my position and their
                  superiority. Whether this arose from my own consciousness of the fact, or from
                  their behavior, I cannot positively say; I think, on reflection, that it was more
                  likely to proceed from the former than the latter cause. I forgot to mention that
                  they were at tea when I entered the room, and there was a gentleman there, a
                  visitor of their acquaintance, and a clergyman, who so engrossed the conversation
                  as to leave very little for me to do in that way. They did not introduce me to
                  this inveterate little talker, and I was glad of it. As soon as tea was over, I
                  arose and went to the little study appropriated to my use. It was adjoining my
                  patron's room, and was furnished with a desk, a stool, some chairs, a carpet, and
                  a good collection of books; in fact it seemed a small library. I was soon
                  afterwards summoned into the merchant's room to give an account of the business of
                  the day, which I did with so much precision and perspicuity as to cause him
                  evident satisfaction.
               Next morning I was up early, as usual, arranged my books, and read till eight
                  o'clock, when a servant came into my study (or office perhaps I should rather call
                  it) to announce to me that breakfast was ready. I descended to the same room where
                  I had taken tea the evening before, and there found the two young ladies ready,
                  seemingly waiting my arrival. I bowed to them very politely, and they returned my
                  salutation with great courtesy and without any of that stiffness which I fancied I
                  remarked in their conversation the evening before. Their mother had not yet come
                  down. The eldest officiated at the head of the table, and was very affable in her
                  manner and conversation. All the time she talked a great deal, and well on every
                  subject; but the younger was more reserved, whether from bashfulness or pride I
                  could not then guess, or from a natural reserve of disposition. When she did speak
                  her remarks were very just and sensible; but her large, languishing, dark eyes
                  spoke volumes whenever she opened them or raised her modest glance from the
                  ground, which was seldom. Indeed there was a sweetness of expression in her
                  countenance which was at once pleasing and fascinating, and she was evidently one
                  who would improve and gain upon one the more he knew her. This I saw at a glance,
                  and instantly determined to be on my guard; for though I knew well the immense
                  distance there was between us, I also knew too well that love unfortunately
                  regards not the distinctions of fortune or rank, but shoots his fatal darts
                  blindly and indiscriminately amongst the sons and daughters of men for his own
                  diversion, regardless who may suffer or perish by his cruel and inconsiderate
                  sport. Another fact I knew also from experience—that young girls, like vain and
                  inconsiderate Cupids, often hurl the fatal darts that lurk in their eyes
                     indiscriminately criminately at
                  whatever game presents, just to whet them and try their efficacy by keeping them
                  in practice, cruelly regardless of the stings they inflict and the fatal wounds
                  which they often make on the unfortunate victims of their thoughtless play. These
                  considerations, with the consciousness of my own weakness, induced me to put on a
                  seemingly impenetrable armor, and to assume a callous indifference which
                  unfortunately I did not possess. As soon, therefore, as I had finished breakfast I
                  rose, bade the ladies good morning, and, seemingly to their disappointment, left
                  the room for my own desk, though it yet wanted half an hour of the time when it
                  was necessary to go to the counting house. I was now summoned into my master's
                  room, to receive directions for the day, and having carefully noted these down I
                  departed.
               I returned in the evening in time for tea—for, owing to my close application to
                  business, Sunday was the only day I could dine at home—and found everything as the
                  day before, with the single exception of the clergyman. I was now obliged to rack
                  my invention to find talk for these ladies; but I soon found that if I made a good
                  listener it was all that was required of me after starting the subject, which,
                  though trifling, was a considerable effort for one who was absorbed in cash book
                  and ledger, and in systems of economy, in shipping, with their customs and
                  freights, and matters of this kind, which I found it difficult to lay aside, even
                  for a brief half-hour. However, I was soon relieved even from this burden, for the
                  ladies found subjects for themselves, so that I became the happiest man in the
                  world, having nothing to do but look and nod my head, while my mind was roaming
                  about—at one time in New York, at another in Quebec, now in my counting-house, and
                  again in my study; at one time philosophizing with Adam Smith, at another
                  sympathizing in the hungry terrors of Mr. Malthus, but entirely regardless, or
                  affecting to be so, of the beautiful languishing eyes, which became the more
                  energetic in their artillery as I seemed the more impenetrable: and, like the
                  Liliputians against Gulliver, they hurled their arrows with the greater vehemence
                  when they found my most vulnerable parts were protected against their pungency.
                  There is an inherent pride in woman's heart which cannot endure that her charms
                  should be viewed without emotion, and that pride will urge her on to take revenge
                  of the hapless wight who presumes to look upon her with coldness and indifference.
                  It will impel her to pursue her game with the cunning of the fox, till she has
                  laid it bleeding and prostrate at her feet; and then, if it has yielded itself an
                  easy prey or shown itself an ignoble and dastardly creature, she spurns it as the
                  lion does the carrion, and leaves it a victim for the wolves and the dogs. But if
                  it evade her cunning or boldly oppose her aggression, she often becomes the victim
                  of her own pride and love of revenge, and, like the jealous Procris, receives in
                  her heart that mortal wound which she intended for her enemy! And who will say she
                  is not justly punished!
               I not only knew this to be the case, but my feelings and my happiness, not to
                  mention my interest, all directed me to regulate my conduct accordingly. I had
                  experienced already too much of experimental love-making without seeing my way
                  clearly before me, and I determined never again to fall a victim to those pangs
                  which accompany it, unless I saw how my happiness was to be realized. I was not in
                  a mood to offer myself as the target for young ladies to practice their arts upon,
                  and as I had not the slightest design upon them I wished to be left to my wonted
                  quiet and repose; for this reason I always retreated from the combat if I was
                  assailed, offering no resistance nor returning a dart, but retiring calmly and
                  unhurt with my shield over me to defend me from those of my enemy.
               This plan I continued for several months, without taking the slightest notice of
                  certain glances and feigned sighs, inuendoes and hints, which were hurled against
                  me, more in sport than in earnest I am confident at first, but which, from their
                  want of success, excited a little pride
                  and chagrin, till at length they looked serious, as I imagined.
               Arabella was the name of the elder of these two young ladies, but she had already
                  tried her strength in more than one instance, and had come off triumphant, having
                  brought the victims suppliant to her feet, and then with cold-hearted levity
                  forsaken and spurned them. The younger, Lucy, emulous of her sister's success, and
                  eager to try her unfledged arrows on the first that offered himself, in order to
                  go through the same process, that she might be thought worthy of honor in the eyes
                  of her sex, singled me out for no other reason, I believe, but because I was the
                  most suitable victim for the experiment; for you must know that the young ladies
                  in this country are thought nothing of amongst their equals unless they can
                  triumph in a number of victims, just as the young American savages are not
                  admitted to the rank and privileges of men till they have a certain number of
                  enemies' scalps to show.
               "And 'my master's fair daughter'(the younger) Miss Lucy,(not 'O'Dogherty') scemed
                  now trying very hard to 'bore a hole in the heart of (not Paudheen
                  O'Rafferty)'—you know the allusion?" he inquired.
               "Yes," I replied, "it is from the well-known old song called 'Paudheen
                  O'Rafferty,' and commences thus: 
                     
                        "'When I was a 'prentice, living in Drogheda,
                        Minding my work, then just as I ought to be,
                        My master's fair daughter, Miss Biddy O'Doherty,
                        Bor'd a hole in the heart of young Paudheen O'Rafferty.'"
                     
                  
               
               "Precisely," said Harcourt, "and my case became at last something like that of the
                  'prentice of Drogheda;' for, though I resisted with all my power, what will not a
                  persevering pair of languishing black eyes perform? The truth is that by degrees I
                  could not help looking into them, just to see what they were like, and my
                  curiosity, I fear, might have proved too much for my philosophy but for a
                  circumstance which I will now narrate to you."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXI.
               THE PARTY.
               IT became apparent to Brown & Co., the firm by which I was employed, that my
                  services were indispensable to them, now especially, as Mr. Brown, the head of the
                  firm was slow in regaining his wonted strength and energy, and they had resolved
                  to offer me a junior partnership in the establishment, which, of course, I
                  accepted with joy and gratitude.
               And to celebrate this event with due éclat and
                  ceremony it was also resolved that a great ball and supper should be given at the
                  house of Mr. Brown, and cards of invitation were sent far and wide, and
                  preparations on a grand scale were assiduously set on foot for the occasion.
               Though by no means friendly to such exhibitions I resolved to endure the
                  infliction of this one as heroically as possible, especially on account of the
                  deep interest manifested in it by the two Misses Brown, and particularly by Miss
                  Lucy, who seemed to make it a point that I should enter into the scheme with my
                  whole heart and acquit myself therein as became one who would be "the observed of
                  all observers," and in the honor of whom it had been undertaken.
               For this reason I exerted myself as much as possible to render it a success in
                  every respect, and I assisted in the preparations with all the zeal and skill of
                  which I was master, for I had understood that strangers from a great distance had
                  understood that strangers from a great distance had been invited and that I might
                  even have a chance of meeting some of
                  my old friends and college acquaintances, and this gave me an additional impulse
                  to give the affair as much éclat as possible,
                  for I had by this time entirely thrown off my reserve and boyish fear of being
                  looked down upon because of my humble birth and connections, having fully realized
                  the great truth that "worth alone makes the man."
               The magnificent mansion of my friend and partner was one of the finest in the city
                  and well adapted for the display of wealth, luxury and taste, and no cost was
                  spared in furnishing every article which should conduce to the end in view, the
                  comfort and happiness of the numerous guests who had been invited to participate
                  in its boundless hospitality.
               About nine o'clock in the evening the guests began to arrive and dancing commenced
                  soon after. I had the honor of dancing with the two Misses Brown in succession and
                  then with several other ladies to whom I had been introduced in the course of the
                  evening, and all seemed joyous and happy and "merry as a marriage bell."
               Somewhere about ten o'clock, to my delight and surprise, the names of Charles
                  Cumming and William Hamilton were announced. Could it be possible? Were these my
                  friends of yore, of the days of youth, of innocence and love? Yes, the same; and
                  the joy of the meeting was mutual and sincere. William Hamilton was the
                  fellow-student who had accompanied me on my continental tour as far as Lyons,
                  where we parted and whom I had not seen since, and Charles Cumming, as you are
                  aware, was the brother of one whose love and memory could never be obliterated
                  from my soul, in which that love now burned more intensely than ever.
               When the first transports of joy were somewhat abated, I introduced my two friends
                  to the Misses Brown, who seemed highly delighted with the young men at first
                  sight, for not only were they handsome, well formed and graceful, but that night
                  they were dressed most brilliantly in their splendid uniforms, Charles in that of
                  a captain of the guards, of which he had become a member since I left Avondale,
                  and Mr. Hamilton in that of the navy, in which he was now a lieutenant.
               I had heard of the effect of a uniform upon the female heart, but had never
                  witnessed it so palpably as on the present occasion; but what the cause of
                  infatuation might be on the otherside, I could not then by any means imagine. The
                  Misses Brown were neither beautiful, nor showy, yet their influence on these two
                  officers was palpable and the impression on both sides seemed mutual as it was
                  instantaneous.
               What could this mean? Are these girls mere heartless flirts, and Lucy especially,
                  has she been playing with my feelings all this time? There is surely some mystery
                  here which I should like to fathom. What can it be?
               In the whirl of excitement with the new-comers it seemed that I had been entirely
                  overlooked or forgotten. The two couples danced again and again without thinking
                  of anyone else, and I stood looking on in perfect bewilderment, when another
                  familiar name was announced and sounded in my ears like a message from the other
                  world.
               "Sir Frederick and Miss Cumming!" Good God! what did all this mean? Was I dreaming
                  or awake, or had the excitement driven me crazy? I mechanically turned my eyes in
                  the direction of the door and there saw—oh! is it credible?—yes, there I saw the
                  same elderly gentleman enter with the same beautiful creature leaning on his arm
                  who, on a former similar occasion, had made such an impression upon my heart.
                  There, unless my senses deceived me, stood Sir Frederick and Charlotte Cumming,
                  looking exactly as they did in the happy days gone by. It must be a dream. I put
                  my hand to my forehead to feel if I was awake. I rubbed my eyes; still the figures
                  remained. Yes, they approached me. Then the dead do revisit the earth! I am
                  deceived by some phantom, remembering the scene in the Palais Royal at that moment
                     and feeling ashamed of my weakness,
                  for there might be others in the world bearing a strong resemblance to Sir
                  Frederick Cumming and his daughter. This reflection alone sustained me and kept me
                  from sinking to the earth as on the former occasion.
               Before I had time for further reflection the figures were close upon me. Sir
                  Frederick stretched forth his hand and said, with a smile:
               "Mr. Harcourt, I am delighted to meet you once more. Permit me to present you to
                  my daughter, Miss Charlotte Cumming. Charlotte, this is Mr. Harcourt."
               "Mr. Harcourt," echoed Charlotte with a low courtesy and a vacant look in which
                  there was no trace of recognition.
               "Pardon me, Sir Frederick," I stammered, "I am utterly bewildered. Can you tell me
                  what all this means? Am I really awake or is this a dream, one of those strange
                  and wild fancies which have so often disturbed my rest?" as I returned the
                  courtesy of Miss Cumming with a low bow.
               "I am aware of it all," replied Sir Frederick. "You have been misled by a
                  newspaper paragraph to the effect that Charlotte was dead. That report had gone
                  forth and was not contradicted; but she had only fallen into a swoon or rather a
                  trance, and slowly recovered, to life, but not to reason. She has remained in the
                  condition you see her ever since, perfectly childish, oblivous of the past and
                  careless about the future. All our efforts to restore her to herself have been
                  useless. We have traveled over Europe, consulted the best physicians, but all to
                  no purpose, and there is only one hope left for us, and that is in the influence
                  which your presence may have over her. Mr. Worthington has told us of all your
                  sufferings and sorrows, your noble and heroic endurance of the same, and the
                  innate grandeur and beauty of your character; and he has talked this matter over
                  with us and with your new partner and our physician, and they all agree that this
                  experiment may be worth trying. This party has been gotten up for the purpose and
                  the whole plan pre-arranged; that you were not consulted may appear strange to
                  you, but this will be explained to your full satisfaction hereafter. At present I
                  will place my daughter in your hands; she is quite passive. Please ask her to
                  dance as at the party when you first met her, and act in all respects as you did
                  on that occasion, and we hope the result will prove satisfactory."
               I immediately bowed to the lady and asked the honor of her hand for the next
                  dance. She placed her hand in mine without uttering a word. We danced and she
                  seemed pleased, but as yet she failed to recognize me. We danced again, and this
                  time she seemed to enjoy it more and appeared to return the pressure of my hand. I
                  took her into the refreshment room, where she partook of cake and a glass of wine,
                  after which we danced again. The music and the exercise seemed to animate her more
                  and more. A party of singers was practicing in an adjoining room; she led me by
                  the hand and we joined it. My voice mingled its tones with the others, and the
                  moment it struck upon Charlotte's ear she started as if from a dream. She seemed
                  for a moment bewildered, and I stopped singing.
               "Go on! Oh, please go on!" she said softly, with a sweet smile, as if unwilling to
                  lose something that delighted her.
               I resumed and she seemed all attention. My voice now gradually swelled into a
                  wild, pathetic strain well known to her, for it was an air which I used to sing to
                  her in the days of happiness and love. Her whole being seemed absorbed by it. A
                  new light beamed from her eyes—a light which I recognized well. She heaved a deep
                  sigh and the tears flowed abundantly down her cheeks.
               "Thank Heaven!" I exclaimed, "she is awaking to life, to reason, to love."
               "Love, love!" she murmured, "yes, dearest Harcourt, I shall never cease to love!
                  But must we part? Oh, I fear it will kill me! Do not, oh do not leave me! stay, stay!" and here she flung her
                  arms around my neck in an agony of sorrow; but becoming conscious of the presence
                  of others, she stared around in amazement. "Where am I!" she exclaimed. "Is this
                  all a dream; oh, dearest Harcourt, what a dream!"
               "Dearest!" I exclaimed, "our long dream of sorrow has ended in a glorious
                  awakening."
               "Has my father then consented?"
               "Yes, my love, and now at length we have met to part no more; but I will explain
                  the whole affair to you hereafter. Now your friends await you. Let us seek them in
                  the adjoining apartment."
               I now led her into a private room where I found her father, brother and the Misses
                  Brown, who had witnessed the whole affair, ready to receive us with delighted
                  feelings. They crowded around us and welcomed the lost one to life and love with
                  showers of kisses and congratulations, to which she responded with transports of
                  joy and gratitude.
               Oh! my friend, would that I could impart to you even a small portion of our
                  sensations on that happy night. As for myself, I felt like a parent who after a
                  long and dreary pilgrimage on earth meets his long lost child in Heaven—one in
                  whom all his affections had been concentrated, whom he had seen torn from him by
                  the relentless hand of death after an agony of suffering. His soul had long
                  yearned to meet that dear one; he had long watched and waited, but the dawn was
                  slow in coming, so slow that he had begun to doubt whether it should ever come,
                  whether, indeed, there was an immortality, a life beyond the grave! But when at
                  length that blessed dawn bursts upon his sight in all its glory, and he sees his
                  loved one arrayed in the brightest robes to receive and welcome him, the clouds
                  that overshadowed his hopes disperse and he awakes to the reality of bliss
                  unspeakable in the presence of his darling, the light of his eye and the joy of
                  his heart.
               And I am assured that the feelings of Charlotte, my beloved one, were, on this
                  awakening, equal in intensity to those of the lost child on its reunion with its
                  father in the skies.
               These were the blissful feelings that possessed our souls on that happy night.
               Was not this a glorious consummation for us all? Did not the concentrated bliss of
                  this one hour compensate for all the sufferings and sorrows of the past? Did we
                  not appreciate these blessings the more because of, and in contrast with, those
                  very sufferings? Ah, let us never repine at the frowns of fortune so long as we
                  can trust to the smiles of Him who holds our destinies in His hand!
               The whole secret now came out. I had been the victim of a plot. The demure Misses
                  Brown had been engaged for some time to the two young gentlemen to whom I supposed
                  I had introduced them for the first time. Lucy had practiced her arts upon me to
                  try my loyalty as well as her own, although it was a hazardous experiment, and she
                  smiled archly at the happy result of her strategy; but as for me I felt relieved
                  of a great weight. I had not loved, I could not have loved her, for my heart was
                  pre-occupied, and I dreaded for her sake lest she should place her affections on
                  one who could not reciprocate, and thus become a bankrupt forever; but she was too
                  prudent for that.
               My ideas of marriage are singular, perhaps erroneous. I have always been strongly
                  impressed with the conviction that true marriages are made in Heaven, and that we
                  have an ideal of the partner allotted to us engraven upon our souls, which ideal
                  will one day be realized, if we have only trust and patience to wait for the
                  opportunity. Hence love at first sight is oftener in accordance with our instinct
                  than with our reason, and the teachings of instinct are by no means to be
                  disregarded. Opportunity may sometimes bring young people together, and there
                  being no antagonism, they may fall in love or imagine they do when it is nothing
                  more then the effect of animal magnetism, under whose delusive impulse they marry,
                  and find, when too late, that they had
                  been premature, and it is not until their heart's ideal at length appears that
                  they feel the full weight of their chains and deplore their folly.
               The prejudices of birth and family in the minds of Sir Frederick Cumming and his
                  son seemed to have been dispersed by the light of reason and experience, and they
                  no longer stood opposed to the happiness of Charlotte, but joyfully gave their
                  consent that her hand should be conferred upon him who had so long been in
                  possession of her heart, and it was arranged that the nuptials should be
                  celebrated at Cumming Hall as soon as circumstances would admit, and in the
                  meantime it was determined by all parties that nothing should be made public, and
                  that the Cumming family should not return to Avondale till within a few weeks of
                  the appointed time, but should remain in Liverpool enjoying the congenial society
                  of their friends there and the benefits of the sea air and sea bathing during the
                  brief season that now remained.
               As I walked to the counting-house next morning after the party, my heart was
                  tumultuous with joyful emotions, not on account of my unlookedfor worldly
                  prosperity, or that I now entered the master where so late as yesterday I had been
                  the humble employee, but because of the blessing which was soon to be conferred
                  upon me in the hand of one who had been the sole object of my early love; and when
                  I reflected on the wonderful chain of circumstances that had connected all these
                  things together, I could not help concluding that the hand of God was visible in
                  the whole affair, and my grateful heart swelled in love and praise to his holy
                  name, and blessed him for all his mercies.
               When I entered the counting-house and noticed the envious feelings displayed in
                  the dark looks of most of my late fellow laborers, merely because of the
                  preference shown me by Mr. Brown, I wondered what they would feel when they
                  learned that I was elevated still higher above them—even to be their master. But
                  again, on deeper thought, I concluded that whatever their feelings might be
                  interiorly, I should never be able to detect them on the fair and smiling outside;
                  such excellent dissemblers are men when it suits their interests.
               My letters were usually directed to me at the counting-room. Amongst many others,
                  I found one from you awaiting me on this eventful morning. It was that in which
                  you informed me of McArdle's confession, my true parentage, and the real nature of
                  my prospects. This was another stroke of fortune whose favors as well as frowns
                  never come alone. What was to be done now—communicate the joyful news to my
                  friends at once, and receive their congratulations? This was my first impulse, but
                  another consideration withheld me; I thought it better to wait till the result was
                  fully known, and no doubt remained of the truth. Making urgent business as my
                  excuse, that very evening I took leave of Charlotte and my wondering friends and
                  started by the mail for London, and you know as well as I how I have been occupied
                  since.
               "Happy man," I exclaimed, when Harcourt had concluded this interesting episode to
                  his history, "you have at length found the haven of repose after the violence of
                  the storm, while I am still tossed on the great ocean of uncertainty, without a
                  pilot or a star to guide my bark through the darkness and the storm."
               "What, in love?" said Harcourt; "why should you wish to conceal this from your
                  friend? Let me hear the story of your woes and my experience in that line shall be
                  at your service, and may be of use."
               "And hereupon I related the whole story of my love, just as I have to you, and at
                  its conclusion he said, smiling:
               "Is that all?'
               "All!" what would you have more? Was there ever so hopeless a case?"
               "Tut, tut; I see you are but a novice in these matters, and have but an
                  indifferent knowledge of the sex if you can suppose that a young girl in the first
                  bloom of womanhood and conscious of her beauty, would spend her time, as Miss
                  Waltham has done with you, merely for
                  the sake of science and literary pursuits. Believe me, there was a stronger
                  attraction and a deeper passion concealed beneath this mask. As sure as you live,
                  that girl loves you, and you alone."
               "You really think so? This gives me new life and revives hope in my heart; and
                  even for this you are entitled to my heartfelt thanks and my blessing. But oh, if
                  your opinion should be verified, how shall I ever be able to express my gratitude,
                  or make it manifest by my actions?"
               "Let me manage the affair for you, and I will prove it beyond a doubt."
               "How so?"
               "No matter; I have thought of a plan for ascertaining the true state of Miss
                  Waltham's affections, and with your consent I will put it into execution."
               "You have my full consent, provided only that it be not distasteful to the lady,
                  nor calculated to give her offense."
               "On the contrary she must, under any circumstances, be gratified. Business will
                  detain us here a few days longer, after which we will pay a visit to Avondale
                  under altered circumstances."
               Here our conversation ended. In a short time I hope to let you know the result of
                  Harcourt's experiment.
               
                  Your sincere friend,
                  EDWARD MONTAGUE.
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXII.
               THE STRATEGY.
               
                  WHITE-FAWN INN, Avondale,
                  
                     FRANK DUNWOODY, ESQ.
                  
               
               HERE I am, only at the distance of one mile and a half from the temple that
                  enshrines the idol of my soul; and yet I must not approach it to offer my
                  devotions, but must worship at a distance in silence and sorrow! I go in my walks
                  to a neighboring hill, where I sit for hours gazing on the spot which holds all
                  that is dear to my heart. I gaze upon the trees, the windows, the garden, the
                  lawn, and everything connected with that dear spot, with feelings of envy because
                  they are blessed with her smile and her presence, while I must remain in the back
                  ground, unnoticed and unthought of—unthought of, did I say? Ah, would that it were
                  otherwise!
               You will naturally ask, "Why is this? Why do you not advance boldly, and convince
                  yourself at once of the truth, if that be possible, and relieve your mind from the
                  agony of doubt and suspense?"
               Ah! my friend, have you ever known what it is to love? Are you aware that to have
                  no longer anything to hope for is indeed to have nothing to live for, and that
                  death is preferable to despair? And yet human nature shrinks from death as from an
                  enemy—as from something hideous and frightful that is about to take away its being
                  and consign it—it knows not where!
               I am indeed at this moment in most awful and appalling suspense. My very existence
                  depends on this critical moment. I
                  weigh the chances, and find them against me; and I have made up my mind already as
                  to the course I shall pursue. There is only one left for me, and I leave you to
                  judge what that will be. But I will explain myself more fully.
               When we arrived at this inn, a week ago, Harcourt made me acquainted with the
                  whole scheme which he had planned for my happiness or misery—to ascertain whether
                  my deep and enduring affection for Eliza Waltham was returned or not.
               We were to put up at a retired and unfrequented inn, at some distance from the
                  village of Avondale, and assume each a disguise which he brought for the purpose,
                  and remain there under assumed names, so that no one might suspect either our real
                  characters or motives; and as Harcourt, during the time he remained in the
                  neighborhood, had had very little intercourse with the people, and none at all
                  with the family at the parsonage, he undertook to go to the village and endeavor
                  to ascertain, first from the gossip of the public house attendants everything he
                  could about the Waltham family generally and about Eliza in particular, and then,
                  if possible, from her own maid, with whom he proposed forming an acquaintance by
                  way of sweetheart, what were the feelings and dispositions of that young lady's
                  heart towards his friend, or whether her affections were really devoted to
                  another.
               The first attempt was successful in proving that, so far as outward appearances
                  went, the young lady gave little encouragement to the numerous admirers who were
                  attracted by her beauty and accomplishments, and that in fact, from what could be
                  judged, she had no favorite lover among them. Some indeed had heard of a childish
                  attachment which she was reported to have formed with a young gentleman who was
                  for a season her father's pupil; but as he had long since gone abroad, and no
                  correspondence was kept up between them, it was supposed it had fallen to the
                  ground, like many other such early follies.
               When Harcourt returned that evening to our inn and related all he had heard in the
                  course of the day, it elevated my spirits a little, which had been so terribly
                  depressed with nervous anxiety that I was ready to faint when I saw him
                  approach.
               Next day was Sunday, and he proposed that we should both go together to Avondale
                  church, where her father preached, and where she was sure to attend.
               "You will thus," said Harcourt, "have an opportunity of seeing her again, and I,
                  perhaps, shall be able to ascertain which is her maid, and perhaps introduce
                  myself to her."
               "But I am afraid," I replied, "that I shall be known, for having long been
                  accustomed to go to that church, there is scarcely one in the village who would
                  not recognize me."
               "Oh, never fear that!" said Harcourt. "I will so disguise you that even I could
                  not recognize you myself if I met you in the street."
               "Well, I shall be very happy to place myself under your hands."
               Accordingly, the next morning was employed in dressing me out in such a disguise
                  as indeed it would be impossible for any one to know me through it. When I looked
                  at myself in the glass I felt the greatest confidence that I might go any where
                  without danger of recognition; and yet when I entered the village and met many
                  whose faces were familiar to me, I could not help shrinking back with fear lest I
                  should be discovered notwithstanding my disguise. Harcourt laughed at my weakness
                  and encouraged me both by word and example to go on boldly and fear nothing. I
                  obeyed; but though I said nothing at the time to cause my friend pain, yet my
                  conscience told me I was doing wrong. At best, and even for the most innocent
                  motives, I do not like—I never liked—disguise; but when I reflected that I had
                  spent all that morning of the holy Sabbath, which ought to be dedicated to
                  meditation and prayer, in disguising my person for the worldly motives which
                  prompted me, I could not inwardly applaud myself for the act. We ought not, I thought, to do even the most
                  disinterested and praiseworthy duty by unworthy means, and this made me uneasy as
                  I pensively walked to church on that sweet Sabbath morning.
               The bells were ringing with a solemn but pleasing harmony, inviting His creatures
                  to the house of God, to offer up their prayers and praises for His bounties to
                  men. It was a lovely harvest morning, and the fields were groaning under their
                  golden treasure, which was in some places reaped and gathered together in abundant
                  shocks; in others as yet waving with full ear, inviting the sickle of the reaper,
                  and filling the farmer's heart with gladness and joy. On all sides the country
                  people, dressed in their gayest attire, and most of them browned with the sun, and
                  bearing on their hands and countenances the marks of their rural toil, were moving
                  in reverential silence towards the house of prayer, as to a common center, to
                  offer up the tribute of their grateful praise to the bountiful Lord of the
                  Harvest. As we entered the retired village we were struck with the reverence for
                  the Sabbath which was there manifested by the stillness and quiet that prevailed
                  in every direction. All the shops and ale-houses were closed, and not a soul was
                  to be seen in the street save those only who were hastening towards the house of
                  God. The churchyard was soon gained; there every thing was familiar to me—the low
                  stile, the graveled walks, and the tombs. Indeed I could see no change, except
                  that it was more thickly peopled by the silent dead than when I last saw it. I
                  could hardly refrain from bowing to my old friends, the sexton and his assistant,
                  who were standing at the belfry door, and to the village schoolmaster as he drove
                  before him his little flock of neatly dressed, clean and well-behaved boys; but I
                  remembered that I was not now myself!
               We walked round the church, examining the new accessions of inhabitants which had
                  taken up their eternal dwelling in the densely peopled churchyard, and communing
                  in spirit with the old, till we arrived opposite the house of the clergyman. The
                  hedge was the same as on that morning when, through a small opening in one of its
                  angles, I had detected the tear on Eliza's cheek as she read a letter. The garden
                  was the same, except that it was a little farther advanced in the season, and
                  everything there appeared exactly as it was wont in former times; but the divinity
                  that sanctified and gave a value to all, in my eyes—where was she? No doubt we
                  should see her approach presently, before the bell should cease and prayers should
                  begin. There I stood, riveted to the spot. The little bell had been ringing for
                  some time, and every moment I hoped to see the parsonage door opened. It wanted
                  only three minutes of the time that prayers should begin. But where was the
                  clergyman? Mr. Waltham had not yet passed! At length the door was thrown open, and
                  a tall, thin man, dressed in a surplice, advanced rapidly towards the church door.
                  He was young and handsome. This, thought I, must be Mr. Waltham's curate. He
                  himself will most likely preach, though I knew he always used to perform the whole
                  duty himself. Can anything be the matter? I fear all is not right here!
               I communicated my suspicions to Harcourt, but before he had time to reflect a
                  carriage drove up to the door in great haste. A gentleman alighted from it and ran
                  rather than walked into the house. I knew him; it was Doctor H. What could this
                  mean? Was any one ill there? and what if it should be Eliza Waltham herself! This
                  thought overpowered me. I detested the disguise which prevented me from rushing
                  into the house and inquiring. Indeed I would have gone had Harcourt permitted me;
                  but he withheld me, saying that I was mad and would ruin all. There was no one
                  near of whom I could make inquiries, and at Harcourt's earnest request I turned
                  with him to go into the church, where service had already commenced.
               As we walked down towards the church door the sound of the organ and the voices of
                  the singers, rising up to Heaven from the midst of perfect stillness ness and falling gratefully on the ear,
                  together with the scene I had just witnessed, and the undefined and vague fears
                  that scene had inspired, produced a deep and solemn impression upon my mind and
                  made me hasten to unite my feeble voice in prayer with the congregation inside. We
                  entered and took a seat on one of the benches appropriated to the parish poor (for
                  we were dressed like them) and listened to the beautiful and impressive liturgy of
                  our church with feelings of the most heartfelt devotion. How sweet, how solemn,
                  how sublime are the words in which we acknowledge our transgressions:
               "I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me."
               And the humility of posture and the earnestness of language in which we implore
                  pardon and forgiveness!
               "Enter not into judgment with thy servant, O Lord, for in thy sight shall no man
                  living be justified!"
               And again: "We have erred and strayed from Thy ways like lost sheep," etc., and in
                  the litany, "O God, the Father of Heaven, have mercy upon us, miserable sinners,"
                  etc., with innumerable other passages, all of the greatest simplicity, but at the
                  same time of the sublimest pathos and most appropriate form of address, from an
                  humble and dependent worm of the earth to the Omnipotent Ruler of the universe.
                  Would that the spirit of this beautiful liturgy were more generally felt!
               The clergyman read with a clear, impressive voice, as if he felt the full force of
                  every word he uttered, and both Harcourt and I were so completely overcome with
                  the intensity of our feelings that we wept. This might have been occasioned partly
                  by the circumstance that we had not attended church for several Sundays previous,
                  being disgusted with the display and hypocrisy of a London congregation, and the
                  rapacity of those who had anything to do with the pews, who made the temple of God
                  a "den of thieves rather than a house of prayer."
               When at length he came to the collect "for all conditions of men," in which it is
                  usual to pray for anyone that is dangerously ill, I almost sank to the ground with
                  emotion. My heart beat audibly while he was reading it and I was only relieved of
                  extreme suffering when he came near the conclusion to these words:
               "Finally, we commend to thy fatherly goodness all those that are afflicted or
                  distressed in mind, body or estate, especially him for whom our
                  prayers are desired."
               Which assured me that whoever the sick person might be it was not, at all events,
                  she for whom I had felt such fears, and this greatly consoled me, though it was
                  evidently one in whose weal or woe she must feel a deep interest—her
                  father. Which, indeed, we afterwards found to be too true, by inquiring after the
                  sermon was over.
               It appeared he had been suddenly taken ill that morning, only an hour before
                  church time, and already his life was despaired of. It was an attack of apoplexy,
                  for he was of a plethoric habit, and his family were thrown into the utmost
                  consternation and alarm, none of whom ventured to leave him for a moment, even to
                  go to church. The clergyman who officiated was one of the neighboring parish, who
                  had been sent for on this pressing emergency.
               After service we returned home with humbled and subdued feelings, impressed deeply
                  with the power of God and our own weakness and insignificance, and the slight
                  tenure by which we enjoy life and happiness. I at least felt no longer inclined
                  for masquerade.
               "This is an awful occurrence," said Harcourt in a low voice as we left the
                  church-yard, "and to happen at this moment, too, is extraordinary."
               "It is a lesson for us," I said, "if we are wise, not to indulge in such levity on
                  the Sabbath. Indeed, I think masking on any day is not proper."
               "Do you really? Well, I am sure I have incurred a sin gratuitously, for it was
                  entirely for your sake I proposed it."
               
               "You are very kind and your intention is excellent, my dear friend, but I confess
                  I have not felt comfortable or happy all day, and I think it would be better to
                  take some other means to attain our end. The best way is to go openly to work at
                  once and make her an offer in my own character."
               "But this will entirely defeat your object. If I understand you properly, you have
                  been always anxious to know whether she loved you for your own sake merely and not
                  for any change in your circumstance and it will be impossible for you to ascertain
                  this if you throw off your disguise, in which I cannot see the least harm. My
                  impression is that her father, this very man who is now on the bed of affliction,
                  perhaps of death, has exercised a powerful influence over her mind, as you say he
                  did over his other daughters, and prevented her giving those indications of
                  preference openly for any whom she knew he would not approve, for evident reasons,
                  however she might indulge the idea of them in her heart of hearts. Why, I have
                  known girls in such circumstances to be so completely cowed and bullied as not
                  even to venture to breathe their thoughts to their most intimate friends, scarcely
                  to their own hearts, so much have they been under the habitual terror of parental
                  control, and from everything I can learn, this has been the case with her. Indeed,
                  I was told yesterday in the village that she must marry anyone her father pointed
                  out to her, however she disliked him. Now, my advise is that we retain our
                  disguise a little longer, at all events, and I will go tomorrow again and make
                  inquiries as to the health of her father, and if he is not actually dead or dying,
                  I will endeavor to ascertain something of the posture of affairs."
               "Very well," I replied, "I am satisfied to follow your advice, and I hope it will
                  turn out well, but to-day's omen looks very bad."
               "Very good, you mean to say. What could favor your object better than for her
                  father to die?"
               "God forbid," I replied, "that I could wish to derive rive advantage from anything
                  which must desolate her so cruelly. I had much rather suffer myself than see one
                  so dear to me in sorrow."
               "You are too sentimental by half, too careless of your own happiness and too
                  attentive to that of others. You must know that such extreme delicacy of feeling
                  is seldom appreciated, even by the object of it, and that a man who makes the
                  happiness of others the object of his life loses his own, and is looked upon
                  either as a hypocrite or a fool by the rest of the world, who do not possess such
                  feelings. A woman will never give you credit for forbearance on the ground of
                  consulting her happiness. She will attribute your delicacy to weakness or
                  indifference, and I am inclined to think not unjustly, for where the passion of
                  love is strong, no consideration either of prudence or fear of inflicting injury
                  will deter it from the attainment of its object. A woman will sooner forgive you
                  for violence or deceit, practiced to gain her person, than she will for that
                  delicacy which is shocked at the idea of hurting her feelings or bringing her into
                  difficulties. True love revels in difficulties, and no woman is worth seeking who
                  would not follow her lover as cheerfully into the obscurity of a cottage as she
                  would into the splendor of a palace. Do not be scared at trifles, all stratagems
                  are admissible in the warfare of love, and that which we are practicing is at
                  least an innocent and harmless one."
               "I alluded only to her father's present illness," I replied.
               "Which may turn out to your and her advantage," said Harcourt.
               Next day he went again to the village. Mr. Waltham was still in a precarious state
                  and little hopes were entertained of his recovery; but he was not in immediate
                  danger. He might even get over the present attack (the second), but the next would
                  be sure to carry him off.
               "When I left the vicinity of the parsonage house," said Harcourt, telling me in
                  the evening of that day's adventures,
                  "and had got into the church-yard, near the lower gate, I met a pretty little girl
                  who seemed to be going direct towards the place whence I came, and supposing her
                  to be one of the servants there, I ventured to ask her how her master
                  was to-day"
               "He is something better, sir, thank you."
               This is well, thought I. She is Mr. Waltham's servant; perhaps his daughter's
                  maid.
               "What is the opinion of Dr. H.?" I continued; "has he any hopes?"
               "I believe not, sir," said she, going on.
               "Stay a moment," I said, "I want to make some other inquiries."
               "I havn't time now," she replied, "for my young mistress sent me in all haste for
                  some leeches to apply to master's temples."
               "Well," said I, "go, by all means, with the leeches, but I would take it as a
                  favor, a very great favor, if you would permit me to see you again soon—very
                  soon—for I have something to say to you which concerns your young mistress, and
                  perhaps you, too, more than you imagine."
               She looked astonished, scarcely knowing what to think of me, or whether I was
                  serious or not. I assured her most solemnly that I was in earnest. She then said
                  that she would be passing that way in half an hour, when she could stay a few
                  moments to speak to me.
               "Well," I replied, "I will be on the look-out for you; do not fail to come."
               I sauntered about the church-yard, reading the rude epitaphs on the tombs, and
                  looking at my watch every moment in hopes to hasten on the time; but the more
                  eager I was to urge it on, the more did it seem inclined to remain stationary,
                  like a rusty donkey or mule which no spur or goad will impel when the fit of
                  obstinacy takes possession of it. At last the half hour came, and although I
                  placed myself in a position to observe every thing that was going on near the
                  parsonage house, no girl nor any one else made an appearance for another half
                  hour, when I began to lose all patience, and to prepare to take my departure for
                  that time; when lo! the front door opens, and a female form comes forth gently, as
                  if in expectation of seeing somebody. She advanced towards the spot where I was
                  standing, which was in a recess at the south end of the church, and when she was
                  near enough, I sallied out from my hiding place to meet her, for I now perceived
                  it was the same I had spoken to before.
               "Is this the way you keep your appointment," I said, "I thought you would never
                  make your appearance."
               "What, you here yet! I had no idea you would have staid so long. Indeed I quite
                  forgot all about it, for we have had sad work at the vicarage!"
               "What! Mr. Waltham worse?"
               "No, but he fainted with the loss of blood, and poor Miss Waltham thought she was
                  going to lose her father, and oh, what she suffered; for a while she seemed worse
                  than he, though God knows he would not be a great loss to her!"
               "But she is recovered, I hope."
               "Oh, yes, and he is much better since the leeches."
               "That is well; but I want to speak to you about your young mistress, on the part
                  of one who loves her dearly; my good, my kind master!"
               "What, has he changed his servant again? ah, you will soon lose your good, kind
                  master, as you call him."
               "Lose him! how, my pretty little black-eyed beauty; is your mistress going to rob
                  me of my treasure? Nay, he will still be mine, my sweet Susan, (I had learned her
                  name in the village) though he may be your mistress's too, and then you and I will
                  be near neighbors, you know," and here I threw my arms round her neck and kissed a
                  very pretty pair of pouting lips.
               "Get along, Mr. Impertinence, and tell your master that we don't covet either him
                  or his man at the vicarage, either now or hereafter; and I think if he had any sense he might know that much
                  by this time. My mistress has made up her mind never to marry, at least till——;
                  but no matter; and even if she does, she will choose a man of a different stamp
                  altogether; that I know—so take that in your hand as you carry no staff."
               "And you, my sweet Susan, I hope you are not so cruel as your mistress. If so, I
                  am sure you will break many an honest valet's heart as your mistress has many of
                  their master's, I would be bound to say."
               "Hold your tongue in your head, or teach it better manners when it speaks of my
                  mistress. She breaks no hearts, but wishes to remain in peace; and above all, she
                  despises the man who depends on his money and attempts to purchase her against her
                  will of a father who is as miserly as an old Jew, and forgets sometimes that his
                  children have feelings which may be hurt. But my young mistress has too much
                  spirit to be trampled upon, and if Mr. Henry was at home, or some one else I could
                  name was in the neighborhood, Sir John, your master would not dare to act as he
                  does."
               "Sir John ——! Sir John ——! Let me remember. Why, do you know, Susan, I have been
                  so short a time in my master's service, that I quite forget his other name. I have
                  a very bad memory, sweet Susan, and I am beginning to think it is muddled by your
                  presence, love. But tell me my master's other name!"
               "You cannot surely have forgotten Sir John Vapering, of Vapering Hall?"
               "Sir John Vapering, Susan! But there you are wrong; I am not Sir John Vapering's
                  servant, Susan. I am the servant of your mistress's other lover, Susan."
               "What, of Bond's, the old stock broker's son, who used to fancy himself in love
                  with my mistress when he was at school here, and indeed spread about a report that
                  they were engaged? Why, I thought that young scamp was out in India! Is he
                  returned, then? He might as well have staid there for aught my mistress cares
                  about him."
               "There you are out again, Miss Susan; Stocks isn't my master, neither! Can't you
                  guess, now, who is? Your mistress had a favored lover once, I think, Susan, if you
                  remember; and one who loved her dearly, too, and though absent for some time,
                  still loves her with the fondest devotion."
               "I don't think my mistress ever gave any man reason to believe she loved him;
                  though to tell the truth, there was a gentleman, (but he is too poor to keep so
                  respectable looking a servant as you seem) to whom she was partial, but I am sure
                  she never told him so."
               "Looks speak often when words are silent, Susan, as the poet says— 
                     
                        'Expressive silence oft will speak
                        In language where mere words were weak;'
                     
                   and it often happens that two feel they love each other when neither will
                  venture to confess it, perhaps not even to their own hearts. There are certain
                  causes, Susan, which make people afraid to indulge a passion which they know might
                  not be approved by those whom they wish to please, and this, more than any thing
                  else, makes them endeavor to stifle the voice of nature within them, which,
                  however long smothered, will burst out at last, and rage with more than primitive
                  violence."
               "Then you know my master!"
               "No, Susan, but I know something of human nature."
               "What, you can tell fortunes! I wish you would let me know mine."
               "That I will, Susan," said I, looking at her hand. You are beloved by an honest
                  man, who would fain make you his wife, if he could."
               "Is he a young man or a widower? now I will try your skill."
               "Let me look again at the lines of your hand; you have just asked me an important
                  question, and one, as you remark, that is well calculated to put my skill to a
                  severe trial; so you see it is necessary for me to examine closely into this affair. One, two,
                  parallel for a space—one falls off, and another crosses!—much younger, dark hair,
                  little, handsome!—the first dark, too! all right! Now I am ready to answer your
                  question. Ask me again, Susan."
               "Is he a young man or a widower that loves me?"
               "That you love, or loves you, which?
               "Both!"
               "Well, then, Susan, I should say, taking the above facts into consideration, that
                  you are loved both by a young man and a widower, Susan."
               "Well, I know that, but which is to be my husband; which do I love?"
               "Why, Susan, you are a prudent girl, I know from these marks. You wouldn't like to
                  marry a man that has got no place of settlement for you, and from the kindness of
                  your disposition you are fond of children."
               "I have always been thought so."
               "And would make an excellent nurse, where kindness and attention are
                  necessary."
               "'Tis for that very reason he wishes to have me."
               "You will marry the widower, Susan!"
               "As I live," said Susan, in astonishment, "he is a conjurer! Well, after that! How
                  could you know?"
               "Ah, that's another thing! But you see, at any rate, that I know something of
                  human nature, which proves to you pretty distinctly and unequivocally, Susan, that
                  I know all about your mistress's love for my master, and my master's love for your
                  mistress, their walks in that field, the proposal he made to her—and all about it!
                  But tell me, Susan, what could have induced her to fly off in a rage that evening
                  he proposed to her, when at the same time she loved him dearly, and was sorry even
                  while she was running away and looked angry—eh? You see I know her very
                  feelings!"
               "Aye, that's the very thing that vexes her, and for which she has blamed herself
                  ever since. The truth is, she hardly knew what she was doing at the time. It was
                  sudden and unexpected, and she didn't know what else to do. She was very young,
                  only a child, but many a salt tear has she shed since. 'It was entirely my own
                  fault,' she would say, 'for driving him away with my rudeness and cruelty, in
                  return for his kindness and love; yet I think if he had loved me sincerely he
                  would have returned—at least I should have heard from him; but he is silent! I do
                  not even know where he is, and I feel desolate and unhappy.' Then she would talk
                  of the happy evenings they used to spend together in the fields and lanes,
                  gathering flowers and fossils, and reading poetry; and she has often and often led
                  me over these places and fancied she was walking again with him! then she would
                  turn round suddenly, and covering her face with her handkerchief, would burst into
                  tears. Poor girl! I have pitied her from my heart, and tried to comfort her by
                  saying he would perhaps come again, but she could not believe it. 'No, no!' she
                  would say, 'he forgets me! I shall never see him again! but I deserve it all, for
                  I have brought it on myself by my own folly! I am sure he loved me once, and I
                  thought he was not likely to change; but there is no confidence to be put in
                  men—they are all deceitful! I shall never look at one again to love him. My life
                  is a blank, and I can only look to the grave for happiness and repose!'"
               "But perhaps," said Susan, starting suddenly, as if in doubt—"perhaps this is not
                  your master neither. What is his name?"
               "Mr. Edward Montague," I replied.
               "'Tis the same," said she. "And where is he now? Does he still love my
                  mistress?"
               "He has never ceased to love her most tenderly—most devotedly; but he was induced
                  to believe, from the representation of her own brother and from another
                  circumstance which I will tell you presently, that she was engaged, and that of
                  course was a sufficient reason to prevent him intruding on her notice."
               "Such was the report, as I have told you; and though she always contradicted it
                  most flatly, yet her brother, in common
                  with several others, believed it true. But what was the other circumstance you
                  mention, that induced him to think her engaged?"
               "He, by mere accident, saw her reading a letter one morning in the garden, and as
                  she read she wept bitterly. But that was not all: she read it again and again,
                  kissed it, and wept anew! which, joined to the report that he heard soon
                  afterwards, confirmed him in the belief, which nothing would shake till I by my
                  magic art convinced him that she loved him and no other man."
               "You were right. What an extraordinary man you must be! But I fear it is not
                  proper to talk with you, as you must have connection with things not to be
                  mentioned."
               "No danger in that, Susan. But I hope your mistress will now be convinced of my
                  master's enduring and long-tried affection, and consent to make him what he
                  deserves to be—happy in the possession of her hand."
               "I fear it is now too late. She has given up all hopes—all ideas of the kind, and
                  withdrawn her dependence on man and placed it on Him in whom there is no
                  variableness nor shadow of turning. Besides, at this awful moment, when she is in
                  constant dread of her father's death, I fear I cannot even mention it to her."
               "Why not? There is a sanctity in love which gives even a dignity to sorrow. I
                  would have this thing brought to an end as quickly as possible. I know how it
                  will—nay, how it must end. So we must all work together to accomplish the decree
                  of fate. These two are to be united in the bands of holy matrimony."
               "But my mistress has no fortune, and your master is poor."
               "No matter; let loving hearts be united, and trust in God for a blessing."
               "What would you have me to do?"
               "Advise your mistress to give my master an interview as soon as her father is
                  sufficiently recovered to admit of it. I shall be in this place to-morrow, about
                  the same time, for your answer. Be sure to meet me. Adieu."
               And here Harcourt waved his hand like one having authority, who must be obeyed,
                  and departed without waiting to receive her answer.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXIII.
               THE FLUNKEYS.
               JUST as he was leaving the churchyard and entering the principal street of the
                  village, a splendid carriage, with footmen in magnificent livery, and a gentleman
                  inside, dashed past him at a furious rate. It turned the corner and drove up to
                  the vicarage door before he had time to collect his thoughts. He instantly turned
                  back, to ascertain, if possible, who it might be, but though he ran across the
                  churchyard as fast as he could he was not able to get up in time to have a full
                  view of the gentleman, who was just entering the door as he arrived. All he could
                  gather from the slight glimpse that he caught of his back was that he was a
                  gay-looking and highly fashionable young man above the middle size, and seemingly
                  in the bloom of youth; but he now determined to ascertain more of his character
                  from the servants outside, who remained with the carriage, waiting till their
                  master should think proper to leave the vicarage; and as Harcourt was on that day
                  dressed in one of his own servant's liveries, he found it no difficult matter to
                  enter into conversation with his brethren of the cloth, though he observed that at
                  first they rather looked down upon him, fearing lest he might not, like
                  themselves, appertain to the aristocracy, and that they might therefore demean
                  themselves by holding any communication with him. However, approaching the
                  carriage with a knowing look and a familiar nod, as if to give them a hint that he
                  was not much their inferior, he ventured to break the ice, assuming a pompous and
                  important tone:
               "Good morning, my friends; foine day."
               "Very foine day," answered the footman, with an air of great condescension.
               "You are Sir John Vapering's people, I presume," said Harcourt.
               "We ave the onor to happertain to is hestablishment," answered the footman.
               "I thought as much! Such a splendid turn-out as this could hardly belong to a mere
                  country squire. There is a smack of the fashionable world about the whole concern
                  that one might look for in vain amongst the rude fox-hunters of the country. The
                  horses, the livery, the build of the carriage—everything reminds me of dear, dear
                  London! but most of all, the genteel, high-bred appearance of the gentlemen in
                  livery shows at once to an experienced eye that they belong to the
                  aristocracy!"
               This touched the right string; in fact it acted like magic, for the haughty
                  muscles of the menials instantly relaxed, a smile irradiated their
                     intellectual countenances, they exchanged glances at each other, a
                  whisper and a nod, and the next moment they were each shaking Harcourt by the hand
                  in a most cordial and friendly manner. By a few idle words he had gained the
                  affections of two great men of a great man.
               "Ow delighted we are," they both said in a breath; "ow delighted we are to meet
                  with a Christian man in this ere wilderness of eathens. Is it long since you left
                  town?"
               "Only a few days ago. When did you come down?"
               "Honly last Saturday, and we are heartily tired of this dull place already. There
                  is no society, no amusement, nothin but a set of dull, clod oppers has knows
                  nothin whatsomever of polite life. But I ope," said the coachman, "you are going
                  to make some stay in the neighborhood. You will be quiet an acquisition, and we
                  should be extremely appy to hadmit you into our select society."
               "I am extremely obliged to you, gentlemen, but my master is such a wild blade and
                  knows so little of his own mind that it
                  is quite uncertain how long he may remain. He is the very devil for the girls and
                  he has scented a very pretty one in this neighborhood, and his movements will
                  pretty much depend on his success there. The truth is, he is sure to succeed, for
                  few women have yet been able to resist him. But I believe your master is a
                  stranger also in these ere parts?"
               "He has been ere about two years, living on an estate which he purchased in the
                  neighborhood. It is next neighbor to Sir Frederick Cumming's, if you appen to know
                  anything of that ere gentleman. There was formerly only a cottage there, but he
                  has built a very foine ouse in the new fashion and called it after his own name,
                  Vapering Hall. It was reported that the former owner hanged himself, and that his
                  ghost—ha, ha, ha!—that his ghost appears at times in the ouse, but this is hall
                  ould women's tales to frighten the country clods. We of the west end knows better.
                  The modern himprovements in philosophy as taught us long since that there is no
                  ghosts—ha, ha, ha!"
               "And your master visits at the vicarage?"
               "Visits! do you think he would condescend to visit parson folks and the like? Not
                  he, he is too much of hawt tun for that! no, no!
                  The fact is he is only fishing for gudgeon—ha, ha!"—and here Jehu winked most
                  knowingly at Harcourt and then at his companion.
               "I understand you," said Harcourt. "He is pretty much in the same predicament as
                  my own master, I guess. Has the parson got a daughter?"
               "Aye that he as, and as pretty a piece of furniture as ever a man clapt his eyes
                  upon, and they say as good as she is andsome; poor thing, I pity her!"
               "I see; and your master has clapt his eye upon her and is paying his court to the
                  father in hopes to gain the daughter. How does he succeed?"
               "Hush, hush!" said they both in a whisper, and with a great variety of winks, nods
                  and gestures, "it is all a secret, nobody knows nothin about it, that is very few
                  knows, you hunderstand!"
               "Perfectly! but you needn't be afraid of me, I am all right, you know, besides I
                  am quite a stranger in the place and can feel no hinterest one way or the tother.
                  I am well used to this ere sort of thing. God bless you, I ave assisted at half a
                  dozen of helopements already and at as many clandestine marriages."
               "The devil you ave! Then you would just be the very thing for Sir John, for blow
                  me if I don't feel raether awkward on the occasion," said the footman, "having
                  never had much practice in that ere way."
               "Then Sir John intends to force the lady to elope with him?"
               "For goodness sake don't speak so plain," said the coachman, and then turning to
                  his fellow-servant, he said in a whisper: "I thinks, William, as how we may as
                  well tell this gentleman all about it."
               "Oh, if you mistrust me in the least I beg you will not say another word on the
                  subject; indeed, I would rather not hear it, having no interest whatsomever in the
                  matter, and if anything should be spoken hereafter, you might blame me for it,"
                  said Harcourt with a look of great indifference and turning as if about to leave
                  them.
               "Stay, stay! we do not mistrust you, and beg your pardon for heven hinted sich a
                  thing, but then you see it would be as much as our places is worth if it was found
                  out, and that will be some excuse for us."
               "Certainly," said Harcourt, "you cannot be too particular and ought to know your
                  man well before you trust him in so himportant an affair."
               "Well, then," said the coachman, "the truth is that Sir John as deceived and
                  ruined many a fine lady before and undoubtedly intends to do the same to Miss
                  Waltham now. He is no saint, though he as contrived to happear so to her father
                  and to the simple people in the neighborhood, by attending regularly at church
                  when he is ere, and making great professions of piety and religion; but the lady
                  doesn't like him, it is hevident she even detests him."
               "May I ask you," said Harcourt, "how you come to know all these secrets? Does your master let his
                  servants into his mysteries?"
               "No; but there is a little bird that lets me into other people's mysteries, and
                  hearts, too; and there is a way of coming at his secrets too, ha, ha! isn't there,
                  William?"
               "I should think so," said that functionary in a long, drawling key peculiar to
                  himself.
               "I hunderstand you," said Harcourt; "alf a hint is enough for me, for you must
                  know I am a bit of a conjurer and understand uman natur. Show me your and, Mr.
                  Coachman, and I will give you a proof of my skill."
               "I'll bet you a pot of Hoare and Delafield's best porter," said the coachman,
                  "that you don't tell my fortune true."
               "Done," said Harcourt; "but I forget myself, you are too great a philosopher to
                  believe in occult powers."
               "Nay, nay! a bargain's a bargain and a bet's a bet, and thou I don't believe
                  exactly in ghosts, that's no reason why I mayn't believe in gipsies and
                  conjurers."
               "Well, give us your and, old fellow. Ha, what do I see! one, two,
                  cross—gone—another—dark, little, handsome, black eyes and sweet countenance! Appy
                  man, you are not yet forty and already you ave been blest with a wife and family.
                  Stay, don't stare so! I aven't done yet. You will soon be ground over again in the
                  mill of matrimony and come out a new and younger man by ten years, and sich a
                  sweet little wife, too! I envy thee, thou appy, appy man!
               "William," exclaimed Coachy, "did you ever! Well, I'm blowed if that don't take
                  the shine out of everything I"—
               "Stay," said Harcourt, "I avn't done yet. I can even tell you her Christian name;
                  she is called Susan, eh, isn't it so! Aye, you see I knows what's what, and more
                  than that, too; she doesn't live quiote a hundred miles from the spot you stand
                  upon this moment."
               "Before God," said William, the footman, "he must have dealings with—, but I
                  daren't mention who."
               "Here's my and!" said Coachy, "I'm blowed if you ant the nicest chap I hever met
                  with either in Lunnen or out of Lunnen! and if we don't drink the pot of porter
                  together, and another and another into the bargain, I'm blowed!"
               "Well, now," said Harcourt, "you see it is easy to account for your knowledge of
                  other people's secrets; but how have you been able to come at your master's, that
                  I confess puzzles me."
               "As you are such a good conjurer," said William, "in other things, I should think
                  you moight know this ere too."
               "Why, do you suppose a conjurer knows everything? No, no! he must see the person's
                  hand and read his fortune there, or else his countenance, and there read his
                  disposition; but I thinks I can easily tell even this if you answer me one
                  question as to Sir John's disposition. Is he troubled with absence of mind and a
                  bad memory?"
               "You have hit at once, by Gosh!"
               "Well, then, it is easy for me who has gone through every branch of the sarvice
                  and among the rest has been own gentleman to many a worthy gentleman, it is easy,
                  I say, for a person possessing such experience to riddle this problem without the
                  aid of conjuring, which I will put aside for the present."
               "How can I find out the secret? Is it not evident that every gentleman has got
                  friends or acquaintances?"
               "Certainly! at least there is few that havn't of some kind or other, and God knows
                  they would be better without any at all sometimes, our own hopeful master for
                  example, William; what a wretch is that ere what writes, William, eh!" said
                  Coachy.
               "Well, don't you see, there it is at wanst," said Harcourt. "When a man has
                  friends or acquaintances ances, and
                  they is at a distance, he writes to them and they writes to him again in
                  answer."
               "Ha, ha, ha!" roared the two liverymen at once.
               "Again, you see, if he is absent in mind, its very lackly when he has read the
                  letters he may throw em where his gentleman can get a peep at em."
               "Ha, ha!" cried the coachman, "did you ever?"
               "No, never!" responded the footman. "Ha, ha, ha! isn't it very odd, ha, ha,
                  ha!"
               "And then the gentleman has wun partickler, dear friend, who he lets into his
                  master's secrets, but hunder a most solemn promise to tell nobody; and that friend
                  most likely as another friend to whom he tells the secret hunder the same
                  hobligation, and thus it extends to a few, only a few, confidential members of the
                  gentleman's household, from wich of course it rarely escapes, unless, indeed, some
                  one of those friends as a dear friend in the ousehold of some other gentleman or
                     lady in the neighborhood; and then, you know, at last the secret
                  is confined to the faithful keeping of a few faithful friends in a couple of very
                  respectable establishments, within only a few miles of each other, and is just as
                  safe as if it was still confined to the bosoms of its original proprietors."
               "Ha, ha, ha, William! I declare I'll burst right out with laughing! What a funny
                  devil this ere is, and how fortunate we was in meeting with im; wy, if he stays
                  any time in the neighborhood he will keep us all alive during the dull hours we
                  are hobliged to rusticate!"
               "Well, now, gents, ant I pretty near the mark, by mere guessing, without troubling
                  my familiar on every trifling occasion? I think I have hit upon the way in which
                  you came by your information; and now that we have made all things plain, what if
                  you would proceed and tell all you know. I can now give full credit to what I
                  hear."
               "What, do you mean to accuse us of—?"
               "I beg your pardon; no, no! nothing of the kind! I merely meant to say that now we
                  would understand each other better."
               "Oh, well, if you meant it in that are way, all right. I thought you were too
                  perlite to doubt our word."
               "Decidedly so; how could I ever think of such a thing?"
               "Well, then," continued the coachman, nodding his head, and winking with an air of
                  great mystery, "I have it from very good authority on both sides, that the young
                  lady doesn't like Sir John half so well as her father does, who is very desirous
                  that she should become Lady Vapering and our mistress. He 'as preached and
                  preached to her till he was tired about it, as I well know, from very good
                  authority, but she always steadily refused to listen to his advice, or Sir John's
                  addresses, hunder various pretences, putting 'im off from time to time, till Sir
                  John became quite impatient, and determined to carry her off by force, if ever he
                  could get a hopportunity, and for this purpose kept up a correspondence with a
                  decayed gentleman not very far from here who would not stick at murdering a man,
                  (some says he 'as murdered more than one) if he was well paid for it! Sir John, of
                  coose, has never 'ad the slightest idea of marrying her, though he 'as persuaded
                  that greedy old wretch, her father, to believe he would, and nothing will persuade
                  him that Sir John is what he is."
               "What," said Harcourt, "has any one ever attempted to persuade him?"
               "Many and many a synonomous letter 'as been written to him about it, (for none of
                  us dares mention it openly, we should lose our places, and perhaps be murdered
                  into the bargain,) but he laughs and scoffs at them all, and throws them into the
                  fire, as calumniousness; and Sir John still persuades him of his upright and
                  honorable hintentions; but we knows better, don't we, William?"
               "I should think we do," said William, in his usual droning style.
               "Well, would you believe it? yesterday old Waltham ham had a fit; (I wish the devil had taken him away
                  in it.) And no sooner did he get a little better than he sent a note to Sir John!
                  I think, William, you have got a copy of it."
               "I should think I had," responded William.
               "Hand it out here, then, and let this gentleman see it."
               "I thought you wished me to slip it into Susan's 'and for her mistress? you know
                  it was for her sake we copied the letter."
               "Yes, but this gentleman won't keep it a minute."
               The copy was produced; it is as follows:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "MY DEAR SIR JOHN:—
                           
                           "It has seemed good to Divine Providence to afflict me again with the
                              same dangerous stroke as before. I feel that I have not long to live;
                              but before I go hence, it is the wish of my heart to see my dear child
                              settled in life—to see her become the wife of so good and worthy a man
                              as Sir John Vapering. She has hitherto proved too much for us; she has
                              resisted both my advice and command; nay, even my threats. There is
                              some strange mystery in this, for in all other respects she has ever
                              been a most dutiful and obedient child. Her heart is tender, and I
                              feel convinced that what she would not grant to either authority or
                              advice, she will now yield to the dying request and entreaty of a
                              father whom she still loves. Come over in all haste, that we may
                              converse on the subject.
                           
                              "Your sincere friend,
                              "HENRY H. WALTHAM.
                              
                                 "To Sir John Vapering, Bart."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "Well," said Harcourt, "that is most abominable! An old wretch of a father wants
                  to take advantage of the solemnity of death to make his daughter miserable for
                  life!"
               "But you havn't heard all we know, yet," continued the coachman.
               "Before my master received Mr. Waltham's letter, he had 'eerd of 'is illness, and
                  immediately wrote to his diabolical companion all about it, rejoicing in it, as it
                  would put Miss Waltham entirely in his power, for, as he remarked, she had no
                  friends to protect her, and moreover was poor, and he 'ad made up his mind to
                  carry her away by force, if she did not consent to go by fair means, at the same
                  time requesting his friend to come with all 'aste to assist 'im, saying that he
                  would have his carriage ready to receive the lady, and 'orses stationed all along
                  the road to bring them to town with all speed. So you see we are to be hengaged in
                  this good work, which we do not much like."
               "Then you are not your master's friends in this particular project," said
                  Harcourt. "You are perfectly right, for it is a cruel deed."
               "We shouldn't think so much of it if the lady liked him, or if she wasn't so good
                  and so kind, or perhaps if she 'adn't a good friend in one who is dear to some of
                  us," said Coachy, with a knowing wink, "but she detests him, and it is said loves
                  another."
               "Aye! who is that?"
               "An honorable gentleman, though poor, a Mr. Montague; but he 'as been long absent,
                  and knows little of the dangers she is exposed to, or if he did, and loved her, he
                  would hasten to rescue her from the fangs of such a wretch as my master."
               "Then you really feel an interest in this young lady?"
               "Who can doubt it? We would do any thing we could to serve her."
               "Well, now, you are honest fellows, and I admire your honorable and upright
                  characters, and for that ere reason I will not conceal from you that my master is
                  that same Mr. Montague you mention, that he is near at hand, and still loves Miss
                  Waltham as fervently as ever; that he is determined to rob that ere fox, your
                  master, of his prey, and save the young lady from destruction, and it is on that
                  errand that I am here to-day."
               
               "Indeed! you astonish us!" they both exclaimed, together; "but we hope you will
                  not betray us."
               "Do you think I could be such a villain? on the contrary I honor you, and you may
                  be assured that my master will reward you well if you give us your valuable
                  assistance in this affair; and not only that, but your own consciences will reward
                  you in having done what is just and proper."
               "But your master, poor man, has little to give away; thou that is of small
                  consequence to hus; but we fear that he will be ill able to resist the great
                  wealth and wickedness of Sir John Vapering, even on fair grounds. But do you not
                  see plain, that even while we are talking here, he may at this moment be gaining
                  an advantage hover 'im which no power could hafterwards resist? For if Miss
                  Waltham is once weedled to promise at the request of her dying father, Sir John
                  will be able to lay a claim wich no one can resist till it is too late."
               "We will resist force by force, and surely when the world are made acquainted with
                  Sir John's real motives they will applaud us for it. Has Miss Waltham been made
                  acquainted with Sir John's secret designs?"
               "We have taken good care to let her know every thing through Susan, except this
                  last, wich we 'ave not 'ad an opportunity of doing."
               "Well, then, no threats or entreaties will prevail upon her to promise, even
                  should her old father die with rage on the spot."
               "William," said the coachman, "there is Susan; go to her directly, and tell her
                  all. Give her the copy of that ere letter, and beg her to let her mistress know
                  every thing. I must keep the box, as I fear my master will come out, every
                  moment."
               "Poor Susan came stealing out with her apron up to her eyes, crying and sobbing
                  bitterly, as if her heart would break. William beckoned to her to approach under
                  the hedge, where he was standing, when he drew out the letter and began to tell
                  her the whole circumstance, entreating her to go directly to her mistress with the
                  news, but she stood still and sobbed, and wept the more, and was utterly incapable
                  of speaking in answer to their urgent and earnest entreaties, to tell what was the
                  matter. At last, having recovered a little from her emotion, she said, with a
                  mournful voice, interrupted by sobs:
               "No, it is all of no avail now; it is all over! My mistress is undone. She has
                  consented to marry Sir John, and she will break her heart."
               "What! said Harcourt, who by this time had come to where she was, is it possible
                  she could do such a thing, after knowing Sir John's intentions towards her?"
               "She stated that openly to her father, and accused Sir John of such intentions to
                  his face, in the presence of her father, but they both ridiculed the idea as
                  absurd, and the vile calumny of some secret enemy, until they almost convinced her
                  it was entirely false, and her father begged and entreated as a last dying
                  request, that she would consent to marry Sir John. 'My dear father,' she said, 'I
                  entreat you do not urge me to this act. I cannot love Sir John; I never can love
                  him; he knows it, and knowing it, why does he persist in this suit? It would be
                  base prostitution to marry a man I could not love, for any consideration of a
                  pecuniary nature, and would only tend to make both wretched for life.'"
               "'Foolish girl!' cried her father, 'you talk like a child! Love him! That will
                  come with marriage, as it does in most cases. But you are obstinate. You will
                  neither obey my commands nor listen to my entreaties—not even my dying request!
                  But beware! a terrible vengeance awaits the disobedient child! I will give you
                  just five minutes to make up your mind—either to marry Sir John or to bear the
                  dying curse of an outraged and injured father! Choose for yourself, and there is
                  the watch before you.'
               "During these dreadful minutes," continued Susan, "the poor girl was almost in
                  despair. She attempted to throw her
                  arms round her father's neck, exclaiming, 'Father, you will not—you cannot curse
                  your child!' but he repulsed her with anger and remained silent. At last the awful
                  five minutes were drawing near to a close. A terrible suspense followed! and when
                  the minute hand of the watch passed the last fatal point, the old man, with his
                  gray locks flowing over his shoulders in wild confusion, fell down on his knees,
                  exclaiming, 'You have made your choice!' then raised his withered hands to heaven,
                  about to call down the curse of God on the head of his innocent child, when she,
                  poor thing! driven almost to distraction with terror and amazement, exclaimed in a
                  wild agony of despair, 'Father! father! hold! Do not—oh, do not curse me! I will
                  marry Sir John—I will do anything! but oh! do not curse me, I beseech you, my dear
                  father?' and then she sank down senseless on the floor. From that time to the
                  present she has been out of one fainting fit into another, and has completely lost
                  her reason! Oh, it will kill her!' said the poor girl, weeping bitterly, 'I'm sure
                  it will! She will never get over this shock!'"
               "Did you tell your mistress, Susan, that Montague was come?" said Harcourt.
               "No," said she, "I hadn't time; for just as I was going to tell her, that wretch,
                  Sir John Vapering, came in and ruined all! But here he comes! Oh, the villain! how
                  I detest him!"
               So saying she stole away into the house by another door, while Sir John came out
                  in seeming high spirits and with a malicious grin on his countenance, by which he
                  seemed to exult in the idea that if he had not been able to enjoy his victim, he
                  at least had succeeded in breaking her heart.
               This monster of iniquity entered his gilded chariot, and ordered his servants to
                  drive home with an air of as much composure is if he had just performed some deed
                  of humble charity, and with as much indifference as if there was no God in heaven
                  to punish the sins of the wicked and depraved; and Harcourt was left standing
                  there alone in utter astonishment at all he had heard, and scarcely knowing how to
                  act for the future. He loitered about the place, however, till he had learned that
                  Miss Waltham was somewhat better, and then he came back to the inn and told me all
                  that had happened.
               My grief and indignation knew no bounds while I listened to the last scene in
                  particular, and it was with the utmost difficulty he could prevail upon me to
                  desist from going that moment to chastise Sir John Vapering for his abominable
                  cruelty and villainy. My impulse was to go to his house and cane him on the spot,
                  and then to leave my card, that he might take his own measures. But Harcourt
                  pointed out the folly of this measure, saying that it must fail, and give Sir John
                  an additional triumph. "For you may be sure," said he, "that you would find it a
                  difficult matter to cane him in his own house, where no doubt he always entertains
                  a set of bullies to do his work for him; and besides, you must reflect that such
                  rash conduct on your part might deprive Miss Waltham of all protection in the time
                  of need. No, no; nothing but stratagem will do now. You must still remain quiet
                  here in your disguise, and I will go again to-morrow and make inquiries. I promise
                  you, too, that, if possible, I will make Miss Waltham acquainted with your
                  presence, and ascertain what is her wish as to your future plans. I will try to
                  convince her fully of Sir John's perfidy and the folly of sacrificing herself to
                  such a monster—merely to gratify a sordid and doating father! In fact I will leave
                  nothing undone to promote your interests, and if we cannot succeed at last we must
                  blame fate, and not ourselves for want of exertion, and this is one
                  consolation."
               "May Heaven reward you, my dear friend!" I exclaimed, "for your unparalleled
                  exertions in my favor. Surely there never was such true, disinterested friendship
                  known between man and man! But for your wisdom and prudence I should have been
                  much more wretched even than I am. As yet there is some ray of hope while she is not completely in that
                  monster's power; but had you not withheld me, I, too, should have been in his
                  power before long, and that would have been an additional triumph to his
                  malignity. But Heaven will direct us, and all may yet be well."
               Next morning early—that is, to-day—Harcourt again sallied forth on behalf of his
                  friend, and left me here alone, an idle spectator of this extraordinary warfare,
                  in which I take such an interest, and in which my blood boils to be more actively
                  engaged. But "the prudent general succeeds better than the fiery soldier," it is
                  said. Perhaps both should be engaged here; for, when great deeds are to be done,
                  boldness and decision, in my opinion, often gain the victory.
               I remain, my dear friend, in the most wretched state of impatience and suspense,
                  ever sincerely yours,
               
                  EDWARD MONTAGUE.
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIV.
               THE STRUGGLE.
               
                  AVONDALE, ——
               
               
                  MY DEAR FRIEND:
                  I HAVE now to give you the sequel of this extraordinary history. No doubt you
                     have been surprised at my long silence, nearly three months having elapsed
                     since my last letter; but I will now endeavor to explain the whole affair as it
                     occurred.
                  I think I mentioned in my last that the next day after his first conference
                     with Susan, and all that occurred in the house while he was talking to the
                     servants of Sir John Vapering outside, Harcourt set out again towards the
                     village, for the purpose, if possible, of seeing Susan again, and ascertaining
                     how both Miss Waltham and her father had passed the night, and whether she had
                     made the young lady acquainted with all that had occurred. He went to the same
                     spot where he had seen Susan the day before; but though he remained there till
                     long past the appointed time, Susan did not make her appearance, and he was
                     obliged at length to come away, totally disappointed for that time. All he
                     could ascertain from the reports in the village was that both Miss Waltham and
                     her father were in a very precarious state. He then directed his steps towards
                     Vapering Hall, in hopes of being able to meet with either the coachman or
                     footman, whom he had found so communicative the day before; but here again he
                     was doomed to be disappointed, having been told that both had gone out early
                     with the carriage and their master,
                     and that it was quite uncertain when they would return. In this posture of
                     affairs he was obliged to return somewhat chagrined but not entirely
                     disheartened, and I was doomed to remain still in the same wretched state of
                     suspense as before.
                  "What is to be done?" I said, almost in despair, when he had informed me of his
                     ill success. "Had we not better put off our disguise, and go at once and
                     consult Mr. Worthington on the subject? I know he will be happy to assist us in
                     every way he can."
                  "I would much rather it could be done without his aid. He is a neighbor, you
                     know, to both parties, and most likely would not like having his name mixed up
                     with such an affair; besides, he is a father and has daughters of his own, and
                     it would not be seemly to involve him in the matter at all. No, no; we must
                     depend on ourselves alone, and stand or fall by our own exertions."
                  "Well, at all events," I said, "I wish to take a more active part in the
                     business, and not remain here, laid up like a vessel which is no longer of any
                     use. I cannot endure this painful suspense, and I must be acting, even though I
                     should do harm."
                  "You can come with me into the village to-morrow, if you like. My only fear is,
                     that if we were both to be seen loitering about there often suspicion might be
                     excited and our cause injured; whereas one disguised in a livery like this may
                     long go backwards and forwards before he is noticed. Our main point now is to
                     ascertain whether Miss Waltham has been made acquainted by her maid with what
                     has occurred. I should suspect she has been too ill to admit of Susan imparting
                     to her anything so calculated to excite her mind as the intelligence of your
                     arrival or the diabolical machinations of that monster, Sir John Vapering."
                  "I fear it is now too late, for she has promised to marry Sir John; and I know
                     that she will keep her word, even though she should suffer death in
                     consequence."
                  "What! though made aware of his villainy?"
                  "Why it appears that she is half convinced of his innocence already, and she
                     may therefore unguardedly place herself in the power of the wretch."
                  "You must recollect that she knew nothing of your presence then. She even
                     fancied you had forgotten her, and under these circumstances what could a poor,
                     lonely girl do in the hands of such a pair of villains?"
                  "If it were possible by any means to convince her father of Sir John's real
                     motives perhaps we"—
                  "That would be impossible. There is nothing in nature more stubborn or
                     obstinate in its own opinion than an old man, except perhaps an old woman. He
                     has had too much experience of the world and has lived too long in it to
                     suppose it possible that anyone living can set him right, and he gives himself
                     credit for too much sagacity to leave any doubt on his own mind as to his
                     foresight and his powers of discerning men's characters. If all Sir John's
                     domestics, with you and me in our real characters, and Mr. Worthington, with
                     half a dozen other gentlemen of the neighborhood, were to swear solemnly, in
                     his presence, that Sir John was a bad man, nay, if we were to place Sir John's
                     own letters before him as a demonstration, he would not believe it. He would
                     say it was a conspiracy of envious wretches to blast and ruin Sir John's
                     character, merely because he (Mr. Waltham) was partial to him. There is not the
                     slighest hope in such a character. The mischief must actually be done and the
                     ruin accomplished before he will believe it."
                  "Why, you seem to know him better than I do."
                  "As I said to Susan and her sweetheart, I know human nature. The only chance of
                     opening his eyes in time would be to induce Miss Waltham to urge on the wedding
                     with Sir John, and then if he declined (which he would be sure to do) her
                     father might thus be able to get a glimpse of his real character."
                  "But what if he should take her at her word!"
                  "He never intended any such thing; but supposing he should, then it would be
                     our time to act boldly and come in
                     to the rescue. But that will not be necessary."
                  "I am beginning to think that would be an excellent plan. There is only one
                     drawback."
                  "What is that?"
                  "Sir John might find excuses sufficient to satisfy the father for deferring the
                     marriage."
                  "True! I didn't think of that, for as long as the father lives, Sir John may be
                     certain that the ceremony would be performed in his presence, or at least
                     openly in his own church; but as soon as Mr. Waltham died, Sir John would have
                     a pretext for removing her and then get one of his bullies to perform it in a
                     private way, as he has done many others already."
                  "But why might not Sir John contrive to possess himself of Miss Waltham even
                     while her father lives, since he is such a villain?"
                  "There is not the least danger of that, for though he is a villain, he wishes
                     to appear reputable in the eyes of the world, and any outrage of this kind
                     would drive him completely beyond the pale of society, at least for one whole
                     season. But he is too cunning to expose himself thus. He will go to work after
                     another fashion. I have not the least doubt but that he has induced her father
                     to appoint him sole executor and guardian to the young lady after his death,
                     and thus he will have a double claim upon her."
                  "Why, if that's the case, there is not the least shadow of hope for us. We are
                     utterly undone!"
                  "Stay, stay! the father still lives, and if we can prevail upon her to
                     disregard his threats openly, or else to consent to a private marriage with
                     you, all will be well. Then, you know, her husband will be her natural
                     guardian. This is your only hope, that I can see. But there is no time to be
                     lost, for her father is in imminent danger and may be called off to his long
                     account at any moment."
                  "Alas! I fear it will be no easy matter to induce her to adopt either of the
                     courses you have suggested."
                  "Well, it will be time enough to despair when all means are tried."
                  Thus our conversation ended for that night. We determined both to set out for
                     the village next day, and then went to bed; but as you may well suppose, my
                     anxiety suffered me to sleep little, and in the morning I arose unrefreshed and
                     feverish, and having dressed I went to Harcourt's room and roused him up also,
                     and when he had dressed and we had breakfasted, we both sallied out together
                     towards the village.
                  The morning was unusually clear and bright, but scarcely had the sun appeared
                     above the horizon when a thick fog began to arise from the valleys, and it soon
                     became so dense around us as to render objects invisible at the distance of a
                     stone's throw before us. We pursued our way till we entered the village without
                     meeting a soul, and even there no one was stirring as yet. We passed on till we
                     arrived at the churchyard, but so dense was the fog now become that we could
                     scarcely see two yards before us, and it was even a difficult matter to find
                     our way to the vicarage. When at last we got to the gate, we could not see the
                     house, though it was only a very short distance from us. The gate, however, was
                     not locked and we entered the garden without being perceived. But what was our
                     surprise to find that the inmates were stirring and that there was an unusual
                     noise, as if of female voices weeping.
                  We advanced still closer to the windows and heard distinctly the stifled sobs
                     of a female in deep distress and the voice of another trying to comfort and
                     console her.
                  "Why did your not tell me this before?" said Miss Waltham (for it was no other)
                     to her maid. "If you had, nothing under Heaven would have induced me to give a
                     promise of marriage to that monster of iniquity, even if my father had cursed
                     me with his dying breath. What could avail a curse so unmerited and even so
                     criminal? Surely it would rather fall on the heads of those who caused it to be
                     invoked than on the innocent head of
                     her who was the object of it, or even the poor dupe himself of Sir John's
                     artifice, who, not knowing what he did, pronounced it! Alas, alas! how wretched
                     and unfortunate I am! Just at the moment assistance was at hand I have been
                     doubly betrayed by a sordid father and a vile seducer, for he has now put me
                     completely into his power by naming him his executor and my guardian!"
                  "Did I not tell you how it would be," said Harcourt in a low whisper.
                  "Hush! listen!"
                  "Do not weep, my dear mistress," said Susan, herself sobbing and weeping all
                     the time, "kind Heaven may yet send you some means of deliverance!"
                  "Alas! I almost despair of all aid. The physician says that my father cannot
                     live many hours, and then I shall be obliged to leave this roof and go wherever
                     my guardian and future husband pleases to send me. Husband! did I say? vile
                     betrayer and seducer, who would seek to destroy the daughter of a man who,
                     however weak in other respects, had one quality which he ought to respect—a
                     blind confidence in him. I wish, Susan, I wish you had kept your appointment
                     with Montague's servant yesterday."
                  "It was quite impossible; I hadn't a moment to spare; but no doubt he will be
                     here again to-day, and perhaps his master with him. May I say that you will
                     grant him the interview he desires?"
                  "May God direct me! I scarcely know what to do; I am encompassed by
                     enemies."
                  "All Sir John's servants are your friends."
                  "Yes; but did you see that fierce-looking monster he brought with him yesterday
                     morning? I shuddered as I gazed upon him!"
                  "He is more like a ruffian than a gentleman."
                  "Yet they say he was once a great man, but that he is fallen off. Oh! he looks
                     as if he didn't much mind what he did. Susan, dear Susan, I cannot tell how I
                     shall feel on seeing Montague again; but it consoles me in all my sorrows to
                     know that he is faithful, that he has never ceased to love me. Ah, it was all
                     my own fault, all! but if he knew how I have suffered for it since, I am sure
                     he would forgive me, poor dear Montague! If I could have known all this before,
                     how it would have relieved me of a fearful weight of sorrow! Would that he was
                     here this moment!"
                  "Your wish is granted, my beloved Eliza," I said gently, "he whom you seek is
                     here before you! Be not terrified, love, it is no illusion. Your own, your long
                     lost Montague is here and has heard all! Forgive me, love, it was purely
                     accidental, for having reason to fear the machinations of bad men, I and my
                     friend here have come to keep guard over you, and if we have overheard your
                     precious avowal do not blame us, we could not help it. Besides, it does honor
                     to you and to your whole sex."
                  On hearing a man's voice under her window she started in surprise and fear; but
                     when she learned who it was and how we came there she regained her
                     self-possession and replied:
                  "It is, it is indeed Montague! Well, since you have overheard my sentiments
                     concerning you, let me tell you I am rejoiced at it. There has been too much of
                     misunderstanding between us already, which has caused equal pain on both sides,
                     and the present is not a time to stand on ceremony. You know, then, how I am
                     situated?"
                  "Perfectly, and am come to offer you the only means of escape that can be
                     devised," and here I recapitulated all the previous reasonings of Harcourt and
                     myself on the subject, and urging her to avail herself of the offered means of
                     escape from the clutches of her cruel and heartless betrayer.
                  "But my father! How could I leave him for a moment? No, no, impossible!"
                  "Are you aware of Sir John's intention as soon as your father is no more?"
                  "Susan has told me all, but I cannot believe he would dare to act in so
                     outrageous a manner."
                  "You little know him, if you suppose so. Had you heard all I know of his character, you would
                     think differently. It is time now that you should consult your own happiness;
                     you have been too long at the mercy of others already."
                  "Well, I am willing to do anything consistent with my duty to my father, whose
                     dying couch I never will forsake!"
                  "She cannot," said Harcourt, "besides you have neither license nor clergyman,
                     even if she could consent to your wishes on the instant."
                  "Then what's to be done?"
                  "You must wait till you see how matters may turn out, and if her father should
                     recover a little, you may have time to procure the necessary document and the
                     clergyman, and then you will be safe."
                  "Will you agree to that arrangement, my dearest Eliza?"
                  "But I have told you that my father is not expected to outlive the day,
                     therefore there will be no time. All you can do is to be at hand, and if Sir
                     John should dare to offer any rudeness, or to urge me away from home against my
                     will, you can then interfere. I shall know where to send for you. But retire to
                     a short distance now. I expect Sir John will be here soon, and as the mist is
                     beginning to clear away, I fear you will be discovered if you remain much
                     longer. Adieu! may Heaven protect you! Do not go far away from me, Montague, I
                     entreat you, I may soon stand in need of your protection."
                  "We shall be in the porch of the church; Susan knows the spot," said Harcourt,
                     and then we retired as quietly as possible to wait the course of events.
                  We were not more than ten minutes in our new position when Sir John's carriage
                     drove up at a furious rate to the vicarage, as he had been in the habit of
                     calling every morning since Mr. Waltham's attack, to ascertain how he was; but
                     this time he was accompanied by a stranger, a man not so tall as himself, but a
                     great deal broader and stouter-built, no doubt the same as accompanied him the
                     day before, at whose appearance Eliza said she had shuddered. This was no other
                     than the decayed gentleman who corresponded with Sir John, and of whom the
                     coachman had said that he would do anything, even commit murder for money. We
                     could not see his face, however, at this time, as they both quickly entered the
                     house.
                  They remained upwards of an hour within, during which time Harcourt ventured
                     out to talk to his old friends, the servants, who, however, were either more
                     reserved this time or else they had nothing to tell more than they had already
                     communicated, for they said that the stranger had been closely closeted with
                     Sir John for several hours daily, and that no written communication had been
                     seen, which was very likely, and, therefore, that they had been unable to
                     penetrate any farther into Sir John's secrets.
                  "But it seems strange," said Harcourt, "that neither Mr. Worthington nor his
                     daughters, nor any of the gentlemen in the neighborhood, call at the vicarage
                     to see Mr. Waltham in his illness. He used to have many friends; they seem all
                     to have neglected him! Can you account for it?"
                  "There is a coolness between my master and the gentlemen in the neighborhood,
                     and since 'e has become such a favorite at the vicarage they 'ave dropped off.
                     The truth is they don't much like 'is goings-on there," said the coachman.
                  "I see!" said Harcourt; "they begin to smell something!"
                  "The Misses Worthington used to be always with Miss Waltham, and she with them;
                     but my master contrived to separate them. Do you know wat 'e reported?"
                  "How should I?"
                  "That one of the Misses Worthington was jealous because he visited at the
                     vicarage, and hactually persuaded that ould dotard of a parson that it was
                     true."
                  "Indeed!"
                  "Yes, and since that time there 'as been a coolness between the two
                     families."
                  
                  "Have you any reason to suspect that Sir John will use violence towards Miss
                     Waltham if her father should die?"
                  "I 'aven't the least doubt of it," said the coachman, "both from his letters
                     and his former hexploits. It is quite sartain he will."
                  "Then we shall take care to prevent it."
                  "Mind 'ow you act, for it is reported that 'e is made hexecutor to her father's
                     will, and guardian to the young lady, and for that reason 'e will 'ave the law
                     on his side; so mind what you are about. I wish you success, but I fear you and
                     your master will be defeated. Money and power will be too strong for poverty
                     and right. Besides, he will be well armed and well attended, of that you may be
                     sartain, and it will be no easy matter to resist 'im."
                  "I hope neither you nor your fellow servant will be on his side, but rather
                     against him?"
                  "The only thing we can do in the case is to give him no real assistance, but to
                     be easily knocked down! You understand me! but indeed we don't know yet wether
                     we shall be employed in the matter at all; we rather think as how none but
                     perfect strangers and desperate characters will be engaged in it."
                  "When do you think the attempt would be likely to be made?"
                  "The very night after her father's death! 'e will wait no longer, I can assure
                     you, for then 'e will have a pretence for removing her from a lonely 'ouse, and
                     wen he has accomplished his designs the poor young lady will be too anxious to
                     'ide her shame, and too fond of 'oping that he will marry her, to make a noise
                     in the world about it. He will find means to clear himself in the eyes of the
                     public, you may depend upon it. He is no novice in these 'ere matters!"
                  The coachman had scarcely uttered the last words when Susan made her appearance
                     at the front door. She came running out as fast as she could to seek us; but
                     when she saw Harcourt at the carriage she stopped.
                  The moment I saw her I ran up, regardless of consequences sequences, and
                     breathlessly asked her with a hurried voice:
                  "What news?"
                  "My master's dead!" said she, rather gaily for such a solemn occasion.
                  "And how is your young mistress?"
                  "As well as could be expected; but Sir John says that she must instantly leave
                     the house of sorrow, and go with him to his aunt's, in whose care he says he
                     will place her till after the funeral and the reading of her father's will, and
                     she is preparing to go."
                  "What! is she willing to accompany Sir John?"
                  "You know she cannot refuse her guardian! but it will be your business to
                     insist upon her remaining."
                  "I understand you. It shall be done. Go and tell your mistress not to fear, but
                     to prepare to accompany Sir John, her guardian."
                  And Susan returned to the house when she had whispered something into the ear
                     of her sweetheart.
                  "She wants me to assist you against my master, but I don't exactly see 'ow I
                     can do that prudently," said coachy, "unless the footman, William here, would
                     join me; and then, you know, we should both be sent off together, perhaps to
                     prison! Besides, that thick, stout gen'lman with my master is the very devil
                     for strength and hagility, and it would require 'alf a dozen of us to face him
                     alone! It's an ugly job! I'd rather have nothing to do with it at all."
                  "I should think so," said William, "and so would I, too."
                  "Well," said Harcourt, "do you at all events remain neutral, and we will try to
                     manage these two men ourselves."
                  "What the deuce do you mean, Harcourt?" I exclaimed, my Irish blood boiling in
                     every vein. "Would you advise these knaves to forsake their hopeful master!
                     They're d——d rascals if they do! No, no! let the courageous gentlemen in livery
                     here join their fellows out of livery, and if we two, single handed, don't
                     thrash the whole batch of them in a good cause, then, I say, we neither of us deserve the hand
                     of the fair or virtuous, and, moreover, may we never obtain it!"
                  "Bravo! bravo!" said Harcourt. "Here's my hand and heart! I hardly gave you
                     credit for so much spirit; but I wronged you, grievously wronged you. But we
                     have no weapons."
                  "Never mind weapons! Furor arma minstrat!
                     Rage furnishes arms! We shall supply ourselves from the spoils of the
                     enemy."
                  "But whether shall we await them here or go into the house?"
                  "Meet them more than half way. But come, it is time we advanced; they will be
                     coming out directly."
                  As we proceeded through the gate, up the gravel walk that leads through the
                     flower garden to the house,Harcourtsaid:
                  "Did you observe how those men changed color while you spoke? I never should
                     have thought that such great, fat, sleek fellows as those could be such
                     cowards!"
                  "How could you possibly think of asking the assistance of such dastards? Why,
                     one good man would beat a couple of dozen of them."
                  "I gave them credit for more pluck than they possess. But here, let us lie
                     behind these shrubs and wait the approach of our antagonists."
                  We had hardly well placed ourselves when the front door opened and they made
                     their appearance, Eliza weeping and supported by a gentleman on each side. As
                     they approached we had a full view of our antagonists—both large, stout,
                     determined-looking men; but the stranger certainly presented the most repulsive
                     features I ever beheld. Poor Eliza looked timidly around her in all directions,
                     in expectation of seeing us approach. But we suffered them to pass, and when
                     they had gone on a few paces we rose from our concealment and followed
                     them.
                  They had got almost to the gate when, hearing heavy footsteps behind them on
                     the gravel walk, they turned round to see what it was. We both took off our
                     hats at the same time, and bowed very politely, saying that we wished to know
                     where Miss Waltham was going.
                  "With her guardian, my worthy fellows," said Sir John, with a condescending
                     nod. "Have you any commands from your masters for her?"
                  "You are Sir John Vapering, I presume," said I.
                  "That is my name."
                  "Well, Sir John, you will excuse my freedom; but I am an old follower and
                     friend of the family, and I feel a deep interest in Miss Waltham's happiness.
                     May I be allowed to suggest to you, Sir John, that I do not think it quite
                     proper that this young lady should accompany you at present. Her father's
                     breath has scarcely left his body, he is yet warm, and you hurry this young
                     lady away, without allowing her time even to weep for him or superintend the
                     last rites of the funeral. You might wait, at all events, till he is buried and
                     his will is read, that your authority as guardian may be known and
                     recognized."
                  "Oh, this is your advice, is it? Thank you! I am very much
                        obleeged to you!" said Sir John, with a contemptuous curl of
                     the upper lip; and then he began to walk on towards the carriage.
                  While I was thus addressing Sir John, the other ruffian took out his glass,
                     adjusted it to his eye with great deliberation, and examined me with a vacant
                     stare, half curiosity, half indifference; at one time drawing his head and
                     shoulders back to a great distance, at another sticking his glass almost into
                     my face; sometimes pushing his head to the right, at others to the left, that
                     he might examine me fully. At last, when he had completed his survey, and Sir
                     John began to move on, he turned away from me to his companion, exclaiming,
                     with a considerable effort to overcome the vis
                        inertiæ of his contempt, "Sir John, how demned curious!"
                  "Stop, villains!" I exclaimed, with indignation amounting to fury, "if you
                     don't listen to reasonable advice, you will listen to this!" at the same moment
                     I drew my fist and gave Sir John such a box on the ear as left him sprawling at my feet! At that
                     instant Harcourt attacked his companion, but not being either so expert or so
                     powerful of frame as I, and having a more accomplished customer to deal with,
                     instead of knocking down, he was knocked down at the first blow, and his
                     antagonist instantly came to attack me with fury, and flushed with success; but
                     I parried off his blows with the greatest ease till he completely exhausted
                     himself with fruitless rage.
                  "Oh," said I, calmly, "we shall have time enough to decide this contest. You
                     are out of breath; rest yourself a little and get cool, or you will have no
                     chance. I do not wish to take any advantage of you."
                  This made him ten times more furious than before, and he assailed me with
                     redoubled vigor, but with the same success.
                  "Well," I said, "you know, if you will not take advice, you must take the
                     consequences," at the same time I fetched him a blow that leveled him to the
                     dust, where he remained some time without offering me the slightest
                     annoyance.
                  In the meantime Sir John regained his feet, but he reeled from the effects of
                     the blow. He called as loud as he could, "murder! murder!" and commanded his
                     men to come to his assistance instantly and take me prisoner, but before they
                     came up Sir John was sprawling senseless again from the effects of another
                     blow. Harcourt now came to his senses, but he was bleeding profusely at both
                     mouth and nose, so I ordered him to take Miss Waltham into the house, and as
                     soon as he could get the blood staunched he might come out again if he
                     chose.
                  William, the footman, was the first of the men who made his appearance. He
                     looked round, and when he saw his masters lying on the ground and bleeding, he
                     was going to run away again, when I called him.
                  "Come here, William, your master will never forgive you unless you get a wound
                     in his service and defense. For your own sake, therefore, I must draw a little
                     claret." So I struck him on the mouth with the back of my open hand and the
                     blood flowed in a copious stream. He roared out with pain, and the tears
                     trickled down his cheeks. When he at last found words, he turned up his great
                     gooseberry eyes towards me with an supplicating expression and said:
                  "I should think you moghtn't have struck quite so hard."
                  It was now Jehu's turn, but he seemed not to like the idea of it at all. He
                     shrunk back like an urchin at school who was going to be caned.
                  "Come on, Coachy," I said, "I'll be easy with you for Susan's sake," and I
                     merely gave him a slap on the cheek, so as to leave the marks of my
                     fingers.
                  "Now," said I, "take these valiant gentlemen and place them gently in the
                     carriage, and recommend them to take a nap when they get home, and if they have
                     a stomach for more of the dose in the morning, or within a month, give them
                     this, it is my card, and will let them know where to get satisfaction in any
                     way they like it."
                  By this time they began to show some signs of life and motion, but they did not
                     manifest a desire for more of the same sort at that time; so, having seen them
                     placed in the carriage, and fairly off, I turned on my heel and went into the
                     vicarage.
                  Never was a victorious general received with more joy and enthusiasm after a
                     pitched battle than I was after this little skirmish. Harcourt was in
                     amazement. Eliza almost overwhelmed me with compliments, and Susan was in
                     ecstaties, only she hoped I hadn't quite killed her coachman.
                  "Oh, no," I replied, "he has come easiest off of all the precious lot for your
                     sake, Susan; but to say the truth, he is hardly worthy of you. But now what are
                     we to do? Harcourt, will you advise us, for you have the more cunning head,
                     though, perhaps I may claim the palm in boxing and the like, but that is of
                     small value compared with wisdom and deliberation."
                  "I hardly know that," said Eliza, "what would we have done but for your
                     strength and courage just now?
                     Wisdom and cunning are not always sufficient to protect their possessors from
                     the violence and power of the wicked and profligate. It is requisite sometimes
                     to have force to oppose force."
                  "I must confess," said Harcourt, "that I have only half known your character. I
                     have hitherto considered you rather speculative than practical; more
                     philosophical and ideal than useful or active. I always gave you credit for a
                     sort of passive courage, but I had no idea that you were endued with that
                     mighty energy, that resolution of purpose, and that rapidity of execution which
                     characterize true heroism so clearly exhibited in your conduct this day. Why,
                     the very glance of your eye, and the posture of your body, were sufficient of
                     themselves to terrify ordinary men. I can now, for the first time of my life,
                     form some conception of the achievements of heroes, so much out of the common
                     way, which I looked upon before as fabulous and absurd. I can well account for
                     the feelings of that band of Roman soldiers who were afraid to attack their
                     general, whom they had undertaken to kill, till they had lured him into a place
                     favorable to their designs. Why, he would not have left a man of them living
                     had they not hurled down rocks on his head from behind. He was a hero, and they
                     were only common men! What was it but the lightning glance of heroism that
                     unnerved the barbarian's arm, who had entered the prison of Caius Martus to cut
                     off his head? or the voice of that hero exclaiming— 
                        'Dost thou, O man, dare to kill Caius Martus?'
                      which seared the Gaul's heart and struck the sword from his hand? But what
                     is most inexplicable in this matter is, that I could not detect this latent
                     quality in the breast of my friend."
                  "Pooh! pooh!" said I, "you quite overrate both my prowess and perhaps my
                     courage. Why, it cost me only a couple or three blows altogether, and the most
                     ordinary mortal would have done that, and more too, for such a prize," at the
                     same time glancing at Eliza, who stood by my side.
                  "What you esteem so little is the very thing I admire most," said Harcourt. You
                     have completely beaten and humbled to the dust two strong, powerful and proud
                     men, with apparently little effort to yourself; and though an ordinary man
                     would doubtless have attempted as much for such a prize, yet he would have
                     failed in it as certainly as he attempted it."
                  "Well, well, let that subject drop for the present, and let us deliberate how
                     we are to act for the future."
                  "I have only one more observation to make on this subject, which is this; I
                     believe few persons know their own powers, either mental or physical, till they
                     are tried and those powers are called into action."
                  "Do you really think so? Well, now, I differ with you, not entirely, but in
                     part."
                  "In what respect?"
                  "I believe that though a person may not know the exact measure of his own
                     powers till those powers are put to the test, yet I also believe that whenever
                     great powers, either mental or bodily, exist, there also is a
                     consciousness of possessing such powers, which consciousness gives confidence
                     or courage to the individual and causes him rather to seek than shun the means
                     of putting those powers to the test, and of calling them into action. Some men
                     have asserted that all men naturally are cowards; some women assert that all
                     the sex are frail, but this is only the assertion of a few individuals of both
                     sexes who make themselves the models of the whole race. It is not a proposition
                     assented to by all. Hence the danger of taking universal propositions of this
                     kind for granted without duly reflecting on the nature of the propositions and
                     the persons asserting them. Now there is no doubt that if these two
                     propositions had been thus qualified they would have been strictly true. I mean
                     if the persons who originally promulgated them had written thus:
                  
                  "All men, constituted like me, are naturally cowards."
                  And again—
                  "All women, constituted like me, are naturally frail."
                  "But the error consisted in predicating of all men and of all women qualities
                     or defects which were confined to a class, and that particular and, let me
                     hope, very limited class, to which they themselves belonged; for as there is
                     consciousness of strength, so there is of weakness, and as the one imparts
                     confidence or courage, so does the other mistrust and cowardice."
                  "But how is it possible that a noble quality of this kind could have veiled
                     itself so long from one who thought he knew human nature?"
                  "I thought you were to confine yourself to one observation; but since you put
                     the question I will endeavor to answer you. How is it possible that a man of
                     penetration, and one who has studied human nature, could avoid perceiving, in
                     the course of his experience, that it is the poor and needy who, to hide their
                     defects and poverty, assume the appearance of possessions and importance to
                     which they have no just claim? Have you not observed, too, that it is the
                     upstart, the would-be gentleman, who is always loudest in his claims to
                     gentility, and most particular and punctilious in exacting deference and
                     respect even from those who he is conscious in his heart are his superiors? Did
                     you ever know a real gentleman sound the trumpet of his gentility before him,
                     and tell the crowd to make way for a gentleman? The real is always
                     distinguished from the counterfeit by its intrinsic simplicity and the total
                     absence of all pretension, while the latter is always dazzling the eyes with
                     its brilliancy; but when you look a little below the surface, just through the
                     plating, you can distinguish the base metal within; when you take it in your
                     hand it is greasy, and if you attempt to make it sound, the leaden echo falling
                     heavily on your ears assures you that it is an imposition! In the pure metal
                     you do not see one quality thrown out prominently into relief, the other being
                     cast into the shade, but all blending harmoniously and unobtrusively together
                     in the same body. In the counterfeit you see the best put outside, to deceive,
                     or rather you see a false covering only, while all within is of a different
                     stamp, and anything rather than what it would have you believe. I think this is
                     a sufficient answer for a man of observation."
                  "I confess," said Harcourt, "that I have yet much, very much to learn, and that
                     I have been rather premature in assuming to myself credit for penetration and a
                     knowledge of human nature; but you have given me a well-deserved rebuke, and
                     henceforth, I promise you, I shall be more moderate in my pretensions."
                  "Nay, my friend, I assure you I did not mean any of my illustrations to apply
                     to you; but it appears you think otherwise, and that is a very good reason to
                     believe that they were wanted. Remember the proverb, 'If the cap fit,' etc. And
                     indeed to be candid with you, my friend, the only fault I have ever been able
                     to perceive in your character is that very one to which you allude, namely,
                     assuming to yourself a thorough acquaintance with human nature, and taking
                     credit to yourself for a power—a peculiar power, I may add—of penetrating into
                     its recesses. Now, the study of human nature requires a whole life—even the
                     long life of a Nestor or Tiresias; or, to go to more authentic records, of the
                     antedeluvian heroes, would not be sufficient to learn it thoroughly. The longer
                     we live, therefore, we shall know it the better, that is if we continue to
                     study it; but in all our knowledge, which at best is but limited, we cannot
                     form too modest an estimate of ourselves, our abilities or acquisitions; and,
                     believe me, we shall be thought more of for having the courage—stoicism,
                     perhaps, is the word—to conceal our powers or talents from the world till a
                     proper opportunity offers to exhibit them to advantage, than if we parade them
                     every hour in triumph before the faces of men, when neither their display nor
                     their exercise was called for."
                  I had scarcely ended speaking when Harcourt seized my hand, and, like one possessed, threw his arms
                     around me and embraced me tenderly, exclaiming:
                  "Never was man so blessed in a friend! In every respect you astonish me! Your
                     moral courage is not inferior to your animal, and your wisdom and philosophy
                     are superior, if possible, to both! The relation in which we stand to each
                     other, the"—
                  "Indeed, Montague," interrupted Eliza, "he deserves all your kindness and
                     attention! Even this familiarity between you delights me; for never was there a
                     more faithful, a more honest, or a more devoted servant!"
                  "What! Eliza!" I exclaimed; "is it possible you are still ignorant of his
                     station and quality? Yes, yes; I quite forgot to tell you. What a strange
                     oversight! But have you never heard the name of Harcourt? Surely you must
                     remember, my sweet love—you must remember hearing of a near neighbor of yours
                     once by that name?"
                  "What! he that lived where Sir John Vapering lives now, who suddenly left the
                     country and went no one knows whither, and for whom poor Charlotte Cumming
                     almost broke her heart!"
                  "The same person now stands before you!"
                  "Oh, Lord!" cried Susan, in a kind of scream; "they say his ghost walks even
                     now in"——
                  "It must be when I am asleep then, Susan," said Harcourt, laughing, "for I can
                     tell you that I cannot spare it at any other time."
                  "But explain this mystery, dear Montague," said Eliza. "I am quite bewildered
                     and"——
                  "I will explain it all in due time, my love. It is a long story, and at present
                     we have more important work on hand."
                  "I think," said Harcourt, "it would be best to place Miss Waltham under the
                     protection of Mr. Worthington, till after the funeral at all events, lest some
                     attempt might be made by Sir John to recover possession of her person in the
                     meantime, or at least till her sister arrives."
                  "Does she know what has happened?" I inquired of Eliza.
                  "All she knows is," replied Eliza, "that my father has been very ill; but she
                     has never been once to visit him, nor has she even written to make inquiry
                     after him. I cannot help thinking that Sir John has been at work here too, and
                     either intercepted the letter or else changed her mind by some diabolical
                     contrivance, for no one could be more affectionate or devoted than she was
                     previous to our acquaintance with him."
                  "The best way would be," said I, "to send a servant with a letter directly, to
                     acquaint your sister with all that has happened, and I have little doubt that
                     she will hasten to the house of mourning as soon as she hears it."
                  "And I," said Eliza, "cannot think of leaving it till the remains of my father
                     are conveyed to the tomb."
                  "Well," said I, "we will remain with you and protect you, for I cannot think of
                     again exposing you to a danger similar to that from which you have but just
                     escaped. We will remain, and if Sir John should make any further attempt I
                     trust we shall know how to repel it, and disappoint him as we have done
                     before."
                  "Thank you," said Eliza; "that is what I particularly wish—that you should
                     remain. But I should also wish that the Worthingtons were again my friends and
                     disabused of the unworthy opinions which they have been induced to entertain of
                     me through the same base agency. You would therefore do me a favor if you would
                     go to Mr. Worthington and explain to him everything that has happened, and I am
                     sure that both he and the young ladies are too generous not to be at once
                     reconciled to her who has never ceased to be their friend."
                  "I will undertake that office with the greatest pleasure," said Harcourt, "and
                     I think I may venture to promise you that my mission will not be unattended
                     with success." So saying he immediately set out for Mr. Worthington's, leaving
                     me alone with my beloved Eliza, to console and protect her.
                  
                  When he was gone we remained together, talking of the past and scarcely
                     conscious of the lapse of time till the shortening day came abruptly to a close
                     without bringing back Harcourt or a soul to the vicarage, except a few old
                     women of the neighborhood, who had offered their services to arrange the
                     affairs of the funeral; but we did not think much of company, as we were now
                     all and all to each other. Miss Waltham's only servant man had been sent some
                     hours ago with a letter for her sister, and there was not any likelihood that
                     he would return till late at night, as he had a considerable distance to go;
                     but even if he and half a dozen other men besides had been in the house they
                     could not have prevented what followed.
                  I was so completely absorbed in the delightful feelings of the present moment
                     and in the prospect of consummate happiness for the future, that I had
                     neglected all precaution to secure the prize for which I had risked much and
                     suffered more already, and to protect which I would freely sacrifice my own
                     life. It never once struck me that Sir John would be so utterly desperate and
                     regardless of consequences as to make any new attempt, and I therefore remained
                     in a state of perfect security, although on the very brink of a precipice, as
                     you shall see presently.
                  It was perfectly dark, though we had not yet called for candles, being
                     satisfied with the light which a good fire, blazing cheerfully, afforded. We
                     were sitting together, my arm thrown round her slender waist and her head
                     reclining on my bosom in all the confidence of youthful love and hope, when the
                     parlor door was thrown open suddenly and in burst more than a dozen of strong,
                     powerful men, well armed, and masked in such a manner that it was impossible to
                     catch a glimpse of their features. Eliza screamed wildly, and then falling back
                     on a sofa fainted away. I instantly sprang to my feet, seized the poker, which
                     was the only weapon within reach, and stood upon the defensive, and demanded in
                     a fierce tone what they wanted, or how such disguised ruffians could dare to
                     intrude thus rudely into the house of mourning! They shrunk back at the sound
                     of my voice, but I received no answer. Two of the most determined now advanced
                     towards Eliza, over whom I stood in a posture which showed I was determined to
                     defend her to the last drop of my blood. I told them in a voice furious with
                     passion that if they advanced a single step further it was at their peril. The
                     hands of the whole party were on their weapons and the two first continued to
                     advance. Without saying another word I sprang forward and with two quick blows
                     levelled the two foremost ruffians to the floor. I raised my arm again to
                     repeat the blow on those who followed, but the moment the stroke was about to
                     fall a pistol was fired, the shot passed through my right shoulder and I fell
                     senseless to the ground, and when I awoke to consciousness I found myself in a
                     new and strange scene.
                  My wound was a bad one, bringing on a long and dangerous fever, from the
                     effects of which it was for a considerable time doubtful whether I should ever
                     recover. When at length, however, I was pronounced out of danger, the following
                     particulars of what occurred after falling that evening were related to me by
                     my friend Harcourt, who never for a moment quitted my couch:
                  "When I went to Worthington Lodge," said he, "I found that the family had gone
                     out in the morning, but were expected home every minute. I was induced to wait
                     in hopes that they would soon arrive, till at last night came on without
                     bringing them back, and then I resolved to join you and go back on the
                     following day; but just when I had got as far as the gate, I met their carriage
                     returning, and both Mr. Worthington and the young ladies insisted on my going
                     back to the house with them, which I did. Here I entered into a full
                     explanation of everything that had happened and of the cause of the
                     estrangement between their family and the Walthams, and the diabolical agency
                     of Sir John Vapering in that matter, till I convinced both father and daughters
                     that Miss Waltham was more to be
                     pitied than blamed in that whole affair, and so completely reconciled them that
                     they proposed instantly to accompany me to the vicarage, in order to condole
                     with and offer their services and sympathy to the poor, bereaved and persecuted
                     girl in whose happiness they once took so deep an interest.
                  "We had got as far as the vicarage gate when we heard the noise of several
                     joyous voices behind us, who seemed to be hastening in a carriage to the same
                     place whither we ourselves were proceeding. We all felt this levity of conduct
                     was untimed on such a melancholy occasion, but we had scarcely time to reflect
                     on the matter when the carriage drove up and its occupants alighted. They were
                     seven or eight in number, all young men gaily dressed in naval uniform or such
                     as belongs to midshipmen and lieutenants of the East India Company, and amongst
                     the number the Misses Worthington instantly recognized the features and voice
                     of Henry Waltham. The mystery was soon explained. He was entirely ignorant of
                     his father's death or even his illness; had that day come from town to make
                     merry at his father's house and in the company of his beloved sister, because
                     he had been left a large fortune by a rich uncle in India, in which she also
                     was to be a sharer, and he had invited down a number of his young naval friends
                     to enliven the happy occasion; but what was his astonishment and sorrow to hear
                     that his father was no more and that he must now put on the garb and the
                     countenance of mourning and woe instead of that of joy. The change that was
                     wrought on the whole party was as sudden as it was extraordinary, and it
                     affected us much to behold it. Mirth and laughter, with the high exultation of
                     good fortune and splendid prospects, gave way to tears and the utmost distress
                     prevailed where all was lately so joyous and so gay!
                  "But scarcely had this explanation been made when we were all suddenly alarmed
                     by the sound of a pistol in the vicarage, followed by wild screams and the
                     utmost confusion and uproar. What could this mean? It instantly struck me that
                     Sir John was again at work, and I as briefly as possible explained the matter
                     to my friends. Dirks and pistols were instantly glittering in the dim light of
                     the stars, and, having placed the ladies under the protection of their father,
                     we advanced without a moment's delay. Our object was to surround the house and
                     permit no one to escape, to take them alive if possible, if not to shoot them
                     on the spot.
                  "But when we got to the house our prudence forsook us; no one could think of
                     remaining outside. But finding the front door open we rushed in pêle-mêle, hurried on by our unbridled impetuosity!
                     How can I describe the scene? We burst at once into the room in a body. There
                     we beheld you lying bathed in blood on the floor. A ruffian, muffled and with
                     blackened face, had seized Miss Waltham, who had fainted away, and was dragging
                     her, with her hair dis-hevelled and her dress in confusion, towards the door.
                     We did not give them much time to prepare for their defense, but being afraid
                     to use fire-arms lest we should kill the lady or you, we plied our weapons, I a
                     huge club, which I had picked up in the kitchen, and the young sailors their
                     deadly dirks. Several of the men were laid prostrate at once, others leaped out
                     of the window, and were either killed or maimed for life, and others attempted
                     to force their way down stairs, but in this they were foiled, for they were
                     either wounded or taken prisoners, so that not a man of the gang escaped.
                  "Our first care now was to attend to the lady and to you. Miss Waltham, after a
                     good deal of difficulty, recovered from her fright, but we found you in a
                     dangerous state. You had bled a great deal and seemed so weak as to leave us
                     little hopes of your ultimate recovery. We however stanched the blood and sent
                     for a surgeon, who dressed your wound, after which we had you removed to Mr.
                     Worthington's, where you have remained ever since till very lately in a
                        precarious state, and had it not
                     been for the devoted attention of Miss Waltham and others, it was scarcely
                     possible that you could have recovered.
                  "Our next duty was to examine into the state of the wounded and the prisoners.
                     They were all disguised, but we unmasked them. We found Sir John Vapering's
                     principal bully mortally wounded. Sir John himself had leaped out of the window
                     at the first alarm, but was so frightfully mangled as to present a most hideous
                     and disgusting appearance. He lived long enough to hear that Eliza Waltham,
                     whom he had sought to ruin, had now become a rich heiress, and being driven to
                     madness by this news, the exposure of his conduct, and the approaching ignominy
                     of a public trial, he died by his own hand in prison only a few days ago, an
                     object of horror and contempt to all and a beacon to those who wish to avail
                     themselves of such examples to avoid the shoals on which he was so awfully
                     shipwrecked."
                  "But where is my dear Eliza?" I exclaimed. "One look from her would be more
                     efficacious in restoring me to health than all the remedies which the faculty
                     could prescribe. I long to see her and to thank her for her tenderness and
                     devotion!"
                  "Why," replied Harcourt, "she was so unremitting in her attentions to you, whom
                     no remonstrance for her own safety could induce her to quit for a moment, that
                     she at length, owing to her delicate frame, became so exhausted, that she could
                     bear up no longer. She was obliged to yield at last and is at this moment
                     suffering on a sick bed for her praiseworthy devotion. But she is recovering
                     fast, and I trust will soon be able to bear an interview with you."
                  "Oh! why, my dear friend, did you permit her to endanger her precious health
                     and life for my sake?"
                  "I tried all I could to dissuade her, but it was of no avail, and I found that
                     there was less danger from permitting her attendance upon you, however
                     injurious to her delicate constitution, than there would be in depriving
                     priving her of the pleasure and mental relief which such a duty seemed to
                     confer upon her."
                  I now recovered rapidly, and soon Eliza also had recovered sufficient strength
                     to deprive an interview of all danger. We met, and as there was now no obstacle
                     in the way, I entreated her to name a day for our union as soon as the time of
                     mourning should be past. She did so. Marriage settlements have been drawn up
                     and all things are waiting for the time when I shall be made the happiest of
                     men! In the mean time she is to remain under the protection of Mr. Worthington,
                     while Harcourt and I proceed to Liverpool and thence to Ireland, to arrange
                     some affairs that require our immediate presence.
                  I should have written to you long since had I been able, but my wound and the
                     state into which I was thrown afterwards, prevented even my dictating a letter
                     to another for you, or even of thinking on the subject at all. We start in a
                     few days for Liverpool and soon after for "Old Ireland." I will write the first
                     opportunity. In the mean time believe me to remain, etc., etc.,
                  
                     EDWARD MONTAGUE.
                  
               
               
                  P. S.—Harcourt has just received a letter calling him to London on important
                     business. I must accompany him. This will detain us for a short time, after
                     which we shall proceed on our journey to Ireland. I may write you in the
                     interval.
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXV.
               NECTAR AND AMBROSIA.
               
                  LONDON, ——
               
               
                  TO FRANK DUNWOODY, ESQ.
                  YOU perceive we are returned to this large wilderness of bricks and smoke,
                     though sorely against our will, for both Harcourt and I are most anxious to get
                     away, as you may well suppose; but business which brought us here will not
                     permit us to leave for another week at least. In the meantime I cannot be idle,
                     I must employ myself some way or other; I therefore fly to my pen to divert my
                     mind from itself, and thus you have only a species of selfishness to thank for
                     the trouble and expense my correspondence puts you to—trouble in reading and
                     answering my letters, and expense in paying the postage.
                  I have received a letter from my father complaining of my sister's conduct.
                     This is novel. He says that she is of late become quite obstinate and
                     headstrong! "Would you believe it," he adds, "she has actually refused a most
                     excellent offer of marriage from a gentleman of property, who is young, amiable
                     and handsome, without assigning the slightest reason for so doing. Was ever
                     anything so preposterous? She says she does not wish to marry at all! This is a
                     pretty piece of business."
                  I could not help smiling when I read this paragraph in my venerable father's
                     letter. Poor girl! "She does not wish to marry at all!" We shall see! I fancy I
                     can unravel this seeming mystery, but I shall for bear for the present, and
                     confine myself to requesting the old gentleman not to torment her any more on
                     the subject by urging her to wedlock against her will.
                  Have you ever seen an author? I mean a real flesh and blood author, a poet, a
                     novelist, a historian, or any other kind of great and famous writer? I was
                     introduced to a whole posse of them the other evening. I'll tell you how it
                     was.
                  My friend Harcourt received an invitation to dine with a gentleman celebrated
                     for his patronage of literature and the arts, and himself no mean amateur in
                     both. He refused the invitation, alleging that he went no where without his
                     friend. The consequence was that a servant was sent express to me with a very
                     polite note requesting the favor of my company to dinner at Mr. Hartly's, to
                     meet a small party of literary gentlemen the next day. I readily accepted the
                     invitation, because I was not only anxious to see something of that famous
                     class of men, whom I had not yet met in general company, but I thought it would
                     tend to divert my thoughts to subjects in which I could take an interest and
                     make some compensation for the frivolity and worthlessness of what is called
                     society, (I suppose by the rule of contrary, like lucus
                        a non lucendo.)
                  Accordingly the next evening Harcourt and I found ourselves seated at the
                     splendid table of our host, and surrounded on all sides by the great luminaries
                     of the age, men indeed who belonged as much to posterity as to the present
                     generation. It was evidently a great favor to be admitted into such select
                     society, for we were almost the only persons who had not acquired fame in those
                     noble pursuits which confer an immortality on their illustrious votaries. For
                     myself I sat in silent awe, as if I was in the presence of demigods, and
                     employed myself in stealing occasionally a glance at the features and external
                     characteristics of men whose minds were known to be of so profound and etherial
                     a nature. It was easy enough to see the innate divinity in the physiognomy of most, but
                     it was extraordinary also to observe how its powers were modified and
                     influenced by the material mould in which it was imprisoned, and to witness in
                     the traces of thought, the struggles of mind with the passions of matter. Most
                     of these men were already known to me by their writings, but for the most part
                     their presence gave me quite a different idea of the men from that which I had
                     already formed of them from those sources, and in some cases I was much
                     disappointed to find that the real man did not come up to the ideal which I had
                     conceived of him. But on the other hand, many surpassed that ideal, and seemed
                     capable of much more than they had ever given to the world. In these there
                     seemed to be an immense storehouse of genius running to waste, which they knew
                     not how to squander, however prodigal they might be. But whether this proceeded
                     from inactivity or diffidence in their own strength it was not easy to say.
                     These impressions were formed of the company at a glance before we had yet
                     commenced discussing the good things that were placed in such profusion before
                     us.
                  During dinner there was but little conversation. Most of the persons present
                     seemed to know each other intimately, and there was nothing like ostentation of
                     language or flashes of wit attempted, and an ordinary observer could hardly
                     distinguish between these great men and those of his own class the "fruges consumere nati" of general society.
                  There were three great poets present, the worthy representatives of the three
                     kingdoms of the United Empire, amongst which our own dear fatherland honorably
                     maintained its rank and its ancient glory. There were several dramatists of
                     great merit, and not a few distinguished novelists, amongst whom the youngest
                     was not the least conspicuous for his faithful and yet novel delineations of
                     character and nature. There were two famous painters, two historians, and an
                     actor of great eminence, with a few youthful aspirants whose names have not yet
                     become familiar to the public ear. These, with ourselves and our host, composed
                     our little select society. There were no ladies.
                  When the cloth was removed, a general and animated conversation ensued, which
                     must have been a rich treat even to the wise and great themselves, who are
                     accustomed to this kind of fare. I leave you, therefore, to judge of the
                     delight which we, who were mere novices and strangers, derived from it. I could
                     compare it to nothing but a clear fountain, springing from a rock on the top of
                     a high hill, and as it flowed at first slowly along the valley, was joined by
                     other streams equally pure, from other rocks equally elevated, until at last it
                     swelled into a majestic river, which sometimes rolled along its unruffled
                     course through the plain, at others rushed an impetuous torrent, foaming and
                     hissing over rocks and precipices, but still retaining its waters clear and
                     unsullied, and adorning its banks with verdure and surpassing beauty.
                  It would be in vain for me to attempt to give you even a specimen of the
                     conversation; for though I might give you some faint idea of the words spoken,
                     and the sentiments uttered, yet you must feel with me that the spirit of the
                     discourse, the fire of the eye, the energy of soul beaming on the countenance,
                     the gesture which is often so eloquent, are utterly incapable of being
                     translated or communicated. These are the subtle spirits which evaporate in the
                     process of transfusion. They are too light and etherial for our dense
                     atmosphere of ink and paper, and to be at all conceived and known must be
                     caught as they rise from their native retort. Yet I may let you taste some of
                     the residuum, the earthy particles, which alone my memory retains of that
                     brilliant essence; and if it, like casks long imbued with the flavor of wine,
                     still retains the precious odor of what it once contained, you have a right to
                     be very thankful, but even of this I am doubtful.
                  Amongst other subjects discussed that evening, one struck me as particularly interesting, both on
                     account of its own inherent interest, as of the various and opposite opinions
                     it elicited from the eminent person-ages who took part in it. It was on the
                     "Tastes of the Age," a question which, like all others touched upon, was
                     introduced casually. Some one happening to say that the tastes of the age were
                     influenced and directed by the great writers of the age, others maintaining, on
                     the contrary, that the great writers of this and every other age were
                     influenced by its tastes, and this led to a discussion which branched out into
                     many ramifications, and embraced a great variety of subjects. I will only give
                     you a summary of it, distinguishing the poets, novelists, historians, etc., by
                     numbers, one, two, etc., merely for the purpose of convenience, and not from
                     any classification according to the respective merits of each individual of a
                     class:
                  
                     First Poet.—"It appears to me self-evident that master writers
                     fashion the minds, as master tailors do the habits of their customers,
                     according to their own pattern, and mould, and that the world must receive
                     both, just as their caprice dictates, or else be content to be
                     adorned with fig leaves in a primitive manner, and to feed upon the mast and
                     husks of literature instead of its rich and native fruits."
                  
                     First Historian.—"I really do not see the application. It seems
                     to me that we might be very well content with that form of habit which
                     satisfied our fathers and grandfathers, and that the ample stores of the
                     ancient sages in every department of literature ought to enable us to dispense
                     with many new-fangled inventions and conceits without much inconvenience. We
                     see even at the present day whole nations who have not changed the costume of
                     their ancestors, and who hand it down from generation to generation as an
                     heirloom to save posterity from innovation and the corruption of depraved
                     taste, and perhaps it would have been well for the interests of society and
                     morality had they retained their pure and simple literature also."
                  
                     First Novelist.—"If that had been an established principle
                     amongst mankind from the beginning we should have had no improvements whatever
                     in anything, but remained stationary both in physical and mental necessaries
                     and luxuries. We should have had no variety of character or costume, no
                     diversity in society, but a sameness and monotony which would have offered no
                     materials to exercise the ingenuity of man, and many professions which have
                     long since become honorable would have been lost to mankind for ever. In fact
                     the human race would have remained stationary, and instead of enjoying these
                     blessings of civilization and refinement, this learned and elegant
                     conversation, we should at this moment be munching our acorns under the shade
                     of some huge oak, or playing hide and go seek, like apes, amongst its luxuriant
                     branches."
                  
                     First Painter.—"I dare say the rude figures and uncouth
                     hieroglyphics on the Egyptian monuments were, at the time of their execution,
                     considered master-pieces of art; but who that had once seen the godlike figures
                     that breathed on the canvass of an Apelles, or the living marble that burst
                     from the chisel of a Phidias or a Praxiteles, could endure to return to those
                     rude efforts of a barbarous age?"
                  
                     Second Poet.—"Who that had once read the divine numbers of the
                     Mæonian bard, or looked upon the soul-stirring scenes of Æschylus, Sophocles or
                     Euripides, would be satisfied with the utter barrenness of preceding bards or
                     the rustic Bacchanalian songs which even the imperfect improvements of the
                     wandering Thespis no little elevated?"
                  
                     First Historian.—"I am not an advocate for the total suppression
                     of innovation or improvement, gentlemen; all I contend for is that it ought to
                     be kept under certain restrictions, and not be permitted to run riot. The
                     arguments which you have brought forward from the ancient painters and poets
                     before the Homeric age, and in rude times, ought in justice to be applied to
                     the ages succeeding that of those great masters; for perhaps it might be found that Homer, Apelles
                     and Phidias as far surpass in excellence those who came after them as they are
                     acknowledged to have excelled those who went before, and that, judged by these
                     standards, the poets and painters who have succeeded would be found just as
                     deficient as those who preceded them. There seems to be a point of perfection
                     which the human mind cannot pass, and hence it is necessary to ascertain that
                     point as clearly as possible, and make it the guide of our exertions and the
                     standard of our taste in all things of the same kind. The clearest proof of
                     this is, that the best poems of every language are those which have taken Homer
                     and Virgil for their models; and hence it is that the greatest writers in every
                     age have been able to influence the taste of their own and succeeding ages only
                     so far as they have conformed to that universal standard of taste which has
                     been raised by those great masters, for all ages and for all countries."
                  
                     First Poet.—"That is not exactly the argument. I take it that we
                     are here speaking of the power of genius to create a standard of taste, and not
                     speaking of a standard that already exists; and I think, if we examine our own
                     literary history, we shall find ample proofs of such power existing. Where did
                     Shakspeare, for example, find a model for his immortal dramas? Where but in the
                     resources of his genius, which enabled him to draw directly from the stores of
                     nature? Was he influenced by his age—that is, the writers who went before him,
                     and the opinions and feelings which they made current, so much as he influenced
                     his age—that is, those who were made acquainted with his writings, whether they
                     were his contemporaries or his immediate successors? for I believe it will be
                     conceded that the age of an author is that in which his writings become known
                     to the public, where alone his opinions, if they have any power at all, can
                     come into operation. The age in which Milton lived, for example, was not his
                     own age as an author, but those which followed he made his own; and this was
                     the case with Homer. Granting this, then, I think it cannot be denied that
                     Shakspeare's creative genius influenced his age and that it will influence
                     every age till a greater' than Shakspeare arise to put him out of countenance.
                     If that had happened in the following age his setting glories would have been
                     thrown into tie shade and dimmed by a more brilliant luminary; and it is only
                     because such intellects are few and far between that we exalt them into
                     standards of taste for the world, and circumscribe the beauty and teeming
                     fruitfulness of nature. According to the canons of the Stage-rite, such a
                     person as Shakspeare never could exist and according to those critics who judge
                     by his rule and plummet such men, if they did exist, ought to 'give us no
                     pleasure, because they choose to do it in their own way This is the very cause,
                     too, which throws daring and elevated genius into another age from that which
                     ought to possess it. Frigid and injudicious critics, judging by the maxims of
                     their age the current opinions and rules handed down to them, either by an
                     Aristotle, or a Johnson, or a Pope, dare not admire or commend anything
                     eccentric or irregular, however brilliant, and thus the glory of just
                     appreciation is often lost to their age and reserved for a more worthy
                     posterity. The age, too, is frequently incapable of judging of an author who is
                     far in advance of it. This happened particularly to Milton, though perhaps
                     politics had more influence in clouding his luster than any other cause.
                  "Again: Dryden had influence enough in his day to introduce insipid rhyming
                     tragedies on the stage, according to the principles of the French school, to
                     the exclusion of Shakspeare and the legitimate drama; and Pope, in his turn,
                     gave an impulse quite his own to toe literature of his time, asserting the
                     great principle, hardly to be controverted, that genius, however it may choose
                     to show itself, may scorn the bonds and letters that bind ordinary men, and
                     carve out a new and untrodden course for itself where it can command the inferior minds of its own age,
                     and according to its powers make inroads into the domains of the future."
                  
                     Third Poet.—"You have forgotten or omitted the strongest proof of
                     your argument to be met with either in ancient or modern times. I mean that
                     consummate genius whom we have all seen, and whose untimely end we have all
                     deeply and sincerely lamented. He was more fortunate in meeting with the just
                     appreciation of his age than most men of genius have been, which, however, may
                     be attributed to accident, for it is very probable that his great and original
                     powers might long have lain dormant and hidden even from himself, had they not
                     been called into action by the stimulus of the Edinburgh reviewers. We all know
                     what influence he has had on his age. He rose upon the poetical horizon with
                     the rapidity and luster of a comet, whose light throws all lesser stars into a
                     total eclipse. "While he continued there his brilliancy increased, and men
                     gazed with astonishment and admiration! Even their reason began to vacillate,
                     and they fell down in worship before this literary divinity! They would
                     acknowledge no other god of their devotion, and looked upon all who worshiped
                     any other as idolators! In their frantic enthusiasm it was not sufficient for
                     them to elevate and adore their own idol, but they, like other votaries and
                     bigots, would dethrone and break all others to pieces. Pope, the divinity of a
                     former age, was assailed by them; his godship was disputed, and they were
                     actually compelled to consult their own oracle as to the truth or error of
                     their judgments, and were only satisfied when he assured them that Pope, too,
                     must be 'numbered amongst the prophets?' Do, I blame them for this? Far from
                     it, for I was as great and enthusiastic an admirer of the noble bard as the
                     most devoted of them. I only bring forward these facts as an additional
                     illustration of my friend's argument to prove the overwhelming power of genius,
                     which, like Midas of old, turns everything it touches into the richest,
                     treasure; but, like the same hapless miser, it is alas! often consumed by its
                     own-excess of wealth! How we would spurn with contempt the wretched critic who,
                     while we were carried away in ecstacy by the impetuosity of the ambrosial
                     stream of song, would frigidly offer us his rule and line to measure the depth
                     and quality of the current, in order to ascertain whether we ought to be
                     pleased! Our feelings towards him would be the same as towards the groveling
                     pretender to taste who, while we gazed upon a most magnificent scene of wild
                     wood, and stream, and 'cloud-capped hill," with rocks thrown in wildest
                     confusion; on rocks, till their peaks seemed to pierce the distant heavens,
                     would tell us that we ought not to be pleased, because the scene before us was
                     not in strict accordance with the principles of landscape gardening! When an
                     author carries us away without leaving us any power of resistance we maybe sure
                     that he possesses great strength and genius, and at least give him credit for
                     their exercise, as far as our own feelings are concerned. The only true
                     standard and guide in all matters of this kind is Nature. Her stores are
                     inexhaustible, and he who knows how to draw upon them skillfully, and touch the
                     strings which she has implanted in the human breast, need not fear of success
                     though his mode of operating may be peculiar to himself."
                  
                     Second Novelist."The great enchanter of our age, whose recent
                     loss also we have to deplore, is another proof of the truth of this theory. He
                     has shown himself a consummate master of nature and of the human soul, and
                     intimately acquainted with the hidden springs that regulate the actions of men,
                     and with the means of working upon their feelings and sympathies."
                  
                     Second Historian.—"It appears to me that there are many glaring
                     defects in Scott's writings. His histories, especially, are little better than
                     romances; but leaving these out of the question, and following him into that
                     province which is considered so peculiarly his own? We can detect there many
                     great and important errors even for romances or novels. It will be admitted,
                     that every work of fiction ought to have some fixed design and inculcate some
                     great moral lesson son, rather by
                     inference from the characters described than by dry moral precept, just as we
                     may learn wisdom and prudence from the pages of history, where nothing but the
                     bare facts are stated. Now, I think this has been too much neglected by Scott,
                     whose whole powers seem to have been employed merely to enchant the imagination
                     with magnificent pictures, or to awe the soul by wild and unexpected
                     situations, so that when you have gone through his novels, which you could not
                     resist, you generally feel that your time has been, in a great measure,
                     misspent, and that you have learned very little for your pains. From which of
                     them do you rise with those chastened and elevated feelings, that improvement
                     of heart, that love of virtue and detestation of vice which occupy your mind
                     after the perusal of such works as the Vicar of Wakefield? Not one, that I
                     remember. Yet this it is, after all, which stamps a permanent value on the
                     labors of the philosopher and philanthropist, whether he be a poet, historian,
                     painter, or novelist, and will render him the friend of man in every age and
                     hand his name down with gratitude to a distant posterity!"
                  
                     Second Novelist.—"Though I cannot deny your inference, yet I
                     would dispute one of your premises, for I think it is quite sufficient if a
                     novel interests the reader without tending to corrupt the moral feelings. I
                     grant that it would be better if it could always be made to improve the mind;
                     but, if, from the very nature of the subject, that is not always practicable, a
                     novel ought not to be condemned because it has not the effect of a sermon. To
                     soothe and cheer the depressed or over-anxious mind, to allay feelings
                     irritated by too close a contact with the world, and to enable us to pass an
                     hour in a species of enchantment, an ideal world, a state of temporary oblivion
                     to the cares of the real world and the evils of life, is no small boon bestowed
                     upon us by the novelist. And all this Scott has done. Nay, more. He has painted
                     many characters worthy of imitation for their fidelity and good qualities, and
                     has very often, indeed in most instances, done practical justice to all. For
                     many of his defects there is one great excuse, namely, the haste with which the
                     story was conceived and written, which precluded the possibility of great
                     precision in language or a labored style; but I think, taking everything into
                     consideration, his countrymen, Europe, the world and posterity ought to feel
                     themselves deeply indebted to him. But what is best of all, his life, his whole
                     being, was one great, one glorious moral, and that he has left, too, as an
                     example to the world and a noble heirloom to posterity!"
                  
                     Third Novelist.—"I cannot conceive how it is that novelists are
                     attacked, even by the judicious, for not making all their characters either
                     altogether immaculate or so bad as riot to possess one redeeming quality. One
                     would think it sufficient if they took men as they found them, compounds of
                     good and evil, and actuated by human passions like common mortals, sometimes
                     conquering, sometimes conquered by them. There are certain weaknesses, too,
                     which they must not possess in common with their kind, and if it be one of
                     those weaknesses, vanity, for instance, which impels them to travel about the
                     country in search of nothing, people call them fools and say they are
                     introduced without any apparent object, though it is well known that it they
                     are good for nothing else, they, at all events, make people laugh, which, it
                     seems, is considered nothing in these utilitarian times. And if the novelist
                     introduce a good, honest character, though of eccentric habits and deportment,
                     in a subordinate station, as a faithful servant or humble friend, and show his
                     consistency and uprightness throughout the piece to the edification and
                     amelioration of all persons, he only receives subordinate praise, as if it was
                     not just as difficult to paint a character in that line of life as any other,
                     and because he neglected to make the great man everything which it is conceived
                     a great man ought to be. This one-sidedness of view is not fair, to say the
                     least of it."
                  Here the company showed a disposition to smile at the ingenuity of the last speaker, who, in
                     generalizing, was very artfully drawing out his own defense for having written
                     a work (his first, and a facetious one it is,) which had been the subject of
                     the very criticisms which he condemned.
                  
                     Third Dramatist.—"In this question it is very likely that the
                     truth may lie somewhere between the two extremes, for the author of the age may
                     be influenced by its tastes in his desire to minister to them, and those tastes
                     may, in turn, be influenced by him when he gains the attention of men and takes
                     a more original ground. This was evidently the case with Molière, who pleased
                     at first by following preceding writers, and then led his age along with him by
                     pursuing nature after his own fashion. But, however this may be, I think it
                     will be acknowledged that the critics of this age, at all events, have not
                     shown themselves the best judges of its current literature, and often make
                     themselves ridiculous by the absurdity and dogmatism of their decrees. It is a
                     pity that men of such moderate capacity do not content themselves with a more
                     becoming and decorous demeanor. If they had a little more modesty they would be
                     sure to obtain their object with much less trouble."
                  
                     Young Poet (who had sat an attentive listener till now).—"They
                     are the most impudent set of men on the face of the earth! I am astonished at
                     the effrontery of the whole class and. wonder that the fate of the Edinburgh
                     Reviewers, in the case of Lord Byron, does not deter them from their audacious
                     attacks on young and aspiring geniuses whom it is impossible for them to
                     comprehend. We do not require critics, because the public generally are much
                     more competent to judge of literary merit, and much more honest to give a just
                     decision than these hired charlatans, these assassins, who stab in the dark and
                     seek their own safety under the impenetrable darkness by which they are
                     enveloped. I have no patience with them."
                  
                     Third Painter.—"The greatest objection to public criticism seems
                     to be this, that one professed critic writes down his opinions indiscriminately
                     on almost every branch of literature and art, though naturally he may have an
                     exquisite perception of beauty or excellence in one single department only, and
                     perhaps not even in one. True taste, or that inherent perception of the
                     beautiful which we designate by that name, requires to be well cultivated in
                     order to enable it to judge of what is excellent in anything that comes within
                     the range of observation, and human life is too short to permit the most gifted
                     taste to be thus disciplined in so many different departments. Though all may
                     admire a beautiful painting, yet who but a painter can judge correctly of its
                     beauties or its defects, or unfold the principles by which the one was produced
                     and in violation, of which the other resulted? Who but a musician can
                     understand the noble harmonies of the great masters, or dive into the
                     mysteries, a thorough acquaintance with which has enabled those masters, by
                     collecting and combining natural sounds to touch the chords of the human soul
                     and make it respond to their empire, whether they choose to raise it into the
                     wildest emotion or lull it into repose? Authors and artists ought to be judged
                     by authors and artists only, and not by the arrogant hoi-polloi of criticism.
                     Let all men be tried by their peers."
                  
                     Actor.—"If that was the case I fear I, for one, should soon be
                     reduced to a deplorable condition, for my brethren, to a man, think themselves
                     much better actors than me, and wonder what the public can see, or applaud in
                     me."
                  
                     First Poet.—"And so it would be, perhaps, with all professions,
                     for after all, though the assertion may seem paradoxical, authors and artists
                     are not the best critics even in their own departments, and supposing them to
                     be perfectly candid and disinterested, I think they are more inclined to value
                     their own performances and think less of others than either deserve. We have
                     all, perhaps, had just cause to complain of critics in our time, but
                     notwithstanding all their faults they must be acknowledged to be a very useful
                     class of men. It ought to be
                     remembered that poets do not write for poets only, nor musicians for musicians,
                     nor do painters work for painters, nor actors for actors, but all for that
                     great nondescript compound, the public; and the public does not wish or care to
                     be told by critics why this or that work will please them, but
                     simply whether it will do so or not, and it is very
                     strange if such respectably educated men as most critics are do not know that
                     much of a poem, a work of art, or an actor. Hence it is that the criticisms of
                     the present age are more frequently just and reasonable than angry authors will
                     allow, and that the public at large is greatly benefited by them, and not only
                     the public but young authors themselves, whose first productions, for the most
                     part, are defective enough without having the puny bantlings spoilt by
                     injudicious and cruel indulgence. 'He that loveth the child spareth not the
                     rod,' is a proverb as applicable to those (I was going to say unnatural
                     offspring of the brain) as to the natural children of the body. This is
                     sufficiently illustrated by that celebrated and just criticism in the Edinburgh
                     Review so much talked of, for it not only corrected a willful and spoilt child
                     of nature, but it gave a sublime and immortal poet to the world. My Mend here
                     has talked of the learning and study that are necessary to educate even
                     natural, inherent taste, to Enable it to judge correctly of the labors of the
                     painter, the musician, the poet, etc., but he seems to forget that all men are
                     constantly studying their master and model, i. e., nature, from their very
                     infancy. Why can I not judge of a beautiful painting as well as I can of a
                     beautiful landscape or a lovely countenance? and cannot I feel emotion from the
                     happy combination of natural sounds in music because I do not know the exact
                     process of that combination? Then, according to this theory, no one ought to
                     have been delighted with the beauty and variety of flowers, the harmony of
                     light and shade, the brilliancy of color and the other properties of light
                     before Newton analyzed that body and dissected its beam into seven primitive
                     colors. We are all critics by nature, more or less, for we judge of everything
                     that comes within the range of our observation and conceive of it a certain
                     impression or idea, whether it be agreeable or disagreeable, and I think the
                     world ought to be grateful to those patient and laborious characters who take
                     the trouble to make themselves better acquainted with most things than their
                     neighbors, merely for the pleasure of warning those neighbors what to avoid and
                     pointing out to them what they ought to choose."
                  All seemed to acquiesce in the feelings and reasonings of the last speaker, and
                     no one offered any further argument on this subject and so it dropped. Others
                     were taken up and discussed with animation and freedom, and with the greatest
                     good humor and politeness; but though I have treasured up many valuable
                     observations in my mind, I cannot at present find time to communicate them. I
                     have given you the above merely as a specimen of the intellectual feast, though
                     it is but the crumbs gathered by the beggar Lazarus from underneath the rich
                     man's table.
                  When the party broke up late at night, or rather early in the morning, both
                     Harcourt and I felt that we had a been admitted to the table of the gods and
                     partaken freely of their nectar and ambrosia. The remembrance, as that of a
                     pleasing dream, still floats on my imagination.
                  
                     Yours,
                     EDWARD MONTAGUE.
                  
               
               
                  P. S. I hope my next will be dated from Ireland.
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXVI.
               OLLA PODRIDA.
               
                  CASTLE HARCOURT, Ireland, ——.
               
               
                  TO FRANK DUNWOODY, ESQ.:
                  WHEN Henry Waltham understood that Harcourt and I resolved to visit Ireland, he
                     expressed his determination to accompany us, and we offered no opposition to
                     his desire. In a few days after the date of my last letter, therefore, having
                     bade a temporary adieu to friends we dearly loved, we all three started
                     together from Avondade. Harcourt and Henry Waltman were happy at the prospect
                     of meeting those whom a long absence had rendered doubly dear, while I alone
                     was sad and dejected in parting from all I loved, but my sorrow was alleviated
                     by the hope that in a few months we should meet again to part no more.
                  Harcourt expressed a desire, not merely from idle curiosity as will be seen, to
                     trace, as far as that were possible, his former route from Avondale on that
                     eventful night when he had bidden an everlasting farewell, as he supposed, to
                     one whom he loved most tenderly, and as it would make little difference to us,
                     we willingly acquiesced in his wish.
                  Accordingly we started early in the morning, on foot, and passed through the
                     thicket where he had torn his clothes, his hands, and his face, which must have
                     been more from carelessness or indifference than the density of the brambles
                     and boughs, for this time we passed through without any such effects. We could
                     not, however, by any efforts, find the house or cottage where he had sought
                     refreshments after his fatigue, nor the other where he had encountered the
                     house-breakers, and for his attempt to save which he had so nearly sacrificed
                     his life. But we at length came to the town where he had been imprisoned, and
                     put up at the very inn where he had lodged the night succeeding his reprieve.
                     The landlord of course did not know him, but he spoke of him with the most
                     kindly feelings, and said that the townspeople had often since talked about
                     him, and showed that they would be pleased to hear of his being alive and
                     happy.
                  "You may tell them," said Harcourt, "that he is not only alive, but well and
                     happy, and what is still more extraordinary, very rich! and that he will never
                     forget their generous kindness towards him while he lives. But," said he, "do
                     you not know me? I am that person who called forth the pity, the humanity, and
                     the exercise of active benevolence from the good people of this truly
                     enlightened and charitable town, and as a mark of my esteem and regard, and the
                     most effectual means of expressing my gratitude in a manner that I know will be
                     most agreeable to their feelings and character, I will fund a sum of money for
                     the express purpose of relieving those unfortunate wretches who may hereafter
                     be situated as I was then, who, though innocent, may be robbed of all means of
                     support by that very law which ought to reward and protect them, and I will
                     give it to your town for this purpose forever. I would thank the people in
                     person if I could find words to express my gratitude, but I will rather leave
                     them to judge of my sincerity by my acts than by words."
                  Whilst Harcourt spoke the good landlord seemed utterly amazed. He begged and
                     entreated him to remain a little while in his house till he could acquaint his
                     fellow townsmen with his arrival, to which Harcourt would not then consent, but
                     he promised that at a future specified time he would do himself the honor of
                     calling upon him, and when Harcourt had made him a handsome present we set out again in the
                     direction of the farm house, where out friend had experienced such kindness and
                     belevolence when he most stood in need of it.
                  You may conceive the surprise and pleasure of the farmer and his family on
                     seeing Harcourt and learning the fortune at which he had arrived, but it
                     beggars all description. Poor Janet was almost frantic with joy, and John
                     Downshire, the shepherd, and the other farm servants were in ecstacies. The
                     farmer's youngest daughter alone was sad. She was still unmarried and evidently
                     retained her affection for her early love; but Harcourt made amends to her as
                     far as that was possible for his inability to bestow his heart. He gave her a
                     rich dowry, which, in a short time, as we have since learned, procured for her
                     a very eligible match in her own neighborhood. The farmer was presented with a
                     beautiful hunter, and Janet and John Downshire got handsome and valuable
                     presents. In short every one of the servants was made to rejoice, and our
                     arrival among them occasioned a species of jubilee which it was delightful to
                     look upon.
                  It was with difficulty that Harcourt could tear himself away from this place,
                     and not until he had promised to visit them again, and when we departed we were
                     all loaded with blessings for his sake.
                  We now hastened on to our journey's end, and soon arrived in Liverpool, where
                     Harcourt was received with open arms, and we for his sake. He found his
                     destined bride perfectly recovered and anxiously expecting his return, and
                     their meeting was indeed one of pure unmixed love. He could not bear to leave
                     her any more, and as he must of necessity go on to Ireland he resolved to take
                     her with him as his wife. Accordingly the ceremony took place in a day or two
                     and every thing was prepared for our departure. Previous to starting, however,
                     Harcourt took us with him to see his old friend, Jack Sweetbriar and his
                     mother. Jack, we found, had returned from America, and by the interest of
                     Harcourt was now promoted to a lucrative post, and Harcourt provided the means
                     of educating him so as to fit him for it. He then settled a small annuity on
                     his mother to enable her to procure a little of her favorite beverage daily
                     without subjecting her to the temptation of stealing; but he so regulated his
                     bounty as to render it impossible for her to go beyond the bounds of
                     moderation.
                  We heard that Mr. Lovechild and his system had completely failed, and that the
                     Rev. Mr. Fitzsurleigh of St. James' Cemetery, was as surly and sordid as ever,
                     but he was driven from his holy office and again practicing law, illustrating
                     the proverb that "the mills of the gods grind slowly, but they grind exceeding
                     small."
                  The morning previous to our sailing for Ireland, I received a letter from my
                     father containing the satisfactory intelligence that not only had fortune
                     favored him in his new speculations, but that he had recovered all the property
                     which he had lost, and that now he was a richer man than he had ever been in
                     his life before. This gave me no small pleasure, as it placed me, in a certain
                     degree at least, on an equality with Miss Waltham, and would render my sister
                     no contemptible match for her brother Henry, for it was now evident that he
                     visited Ireland for no other purpose than to make her an offer of his hand; his
                     heart he had given to her long ago. Indeed he no longer made a secret of it.
                     Why should he? and I knew she was tolerably well disposed to lend a favorable
                     ear to his vows, even when he was still poor. How much more would she be so now
                     that he had become unexpectedly so rich. People say that true love is very
                     disinterested and quite regardless of circumstances. Perhaps it is, but it can
                     afford to be much more disinterested still when it knows that it has little to
                     risk by the profession of such a sentimental creed; but if it ventures on
                     marriage without the necessary means and appliances, and without all due and
                     proper precaution, the more fool is it, say I.
                  We arrived in the "Green Isle" without any accident dent, and Ellen was "very glad to see Mr.
                     Waltham," and Mr. Waltham was "very glad to see Miss Montague." Indeed they
                     seemed to be quite at home with each other, and to require or care for little
                     other company! We left them by themselves as much as possible, and the result
                     was that in a day or two there was terrible sighing and most distressing looks
                     on both sides, as if their owners wished to come to an explanation on the
                     subject of their contemplations—not with each other, they had done that
                     already! but with my father. Here was the difficulty—for he had given his
                     suffrage to another! But they had good friends in Harcourt and me. By our means
                     their utmost wishes were soon gratified, for we never ceased entreating,
                     importuning and tormenting till the old gentleman had given his
                        consent, when all was happiness and smiles.
                  Harcourt found his affairs arranged entirely to his satisfaction; and his lady,
                     who is a most amiable and delightful creature, was highly pleased with the
                     preparations which had been made for their reception.
                  You know the gallantry and enthusiastic nature of our countrymen, from the peer
                     to the peasant, and what a lively impression of gratitude even the imputed
                     kindness of a landlord and the lenity or benevolence of an agent leave upon
                     their hearts. Both the conduct of my father as agent and his representations of
                     Harcourt's character as a good landlord amongst the tenantry called forth the
                     most lively demonstrations of joy and gratitude, not merely from his own
                     tenants but from thousands of others in the neighborhood of his estate, who had
                     heard of his virtues. The moment, therefore, that it was known that their
                     landlord with his lady should visit them they commenced their preparations for
                     their reception, and they were most anxious in their inquiries to ascertain the
                     precise time of their arrival, that they might be ready to show them every
                     respect. Of course my father encouraged this feeling, though he kept it secret
                     from us all.
                  What was the surprise of Harcourt and his lady, therefore, on approaching their
                     new mansion, to find themselves greeted with the enthusiastic cheers of
                     thousands of grateful people! Their horses were taken from their carriage, and
                     they were drawn to the door of their splendid mansion in triumph, where
                     servants dressed in magnificent liveries, with a venerable steward at their
                     head, were drawn out ready to receive their lord with every demonstration of
                     profound respect and the most devoted love—a love which already burned in their
                     bosoms as strongly from anticipation and hope as it does in those of more
                     phlegmatic and less sensitive people from years of experience.
                  From motives of modesty and humility Harcourt wished to suppress this
                     demonstration, thinking himself unworthy as yet of such love from a people whom
                     he had had no means of serving hitherto, but in whose happiness, nevertheless,
                     he had long taken a deep interest, and he whispered his feelings to my father,
                     asking his advice.
                  "By no means," said he, "attempt to suppress this feeling, so natural to the
                     Irish people. They have little but their affections to give away, though by
                     nature bountiful, and it would be a pity to deprive them of a pleasure of so
                     innocent and praiseworthy a character. Perhaps you may think this exhibition
                     mere hypocrisy or blarney, because they have not yet had the means
                     of judging of your character; but if so you are mistaken. I can assure you that
                     they are a people who would scorn to act in this manner if they were not fully
                     persuaded that you are worthy of it. Your character is known to them; I have
                     made them acquainted with it, and it is from their confidence in your kindness
                     and integrity that they thus act. A truly good and benevolent landlord is so
                     rare in Ireland that when one at length appears, or is even likely to appear,
                     the tenants are intoxicated with joy and know not how to express their
                     gratitude, the extravagance of which is often exhibited so as to produce even a
                     ludicrous effect. Had you come here unknown, or with a bad character before
                     you, your reception would have been quite different, I assure you. This people
                     can be sullen and sulky when they
                     are ill treated, and they often resent the cruelty and insults of wicked
                     landlords and brutal agents in a fearful manner!"
                  In the evening there was a bonfire, and the whole country round was illuminated
                     with torches. Thousands of men, each carrying a lighted torch made of bog fir,
                     were to be seen hastening to Castle Harcourt from all sides, preceded by bands
                     of music, and accompanied by women and girls dressed neatly, and in a short
                     time they all assembled on the green in front of the house. It was a beautiful
                     and highly picturesque sight, and presented an admirable moral lesson. At a
                     given signal they all advanced to the window where Harcourt and his lady were
                     standing, and raised three such cheers as I suppose neither of them had ever
                     listened to before! Harcourt addressed them from the window in a speech full of
                     humanity, sense and kindness, and ordered some barrels of beer to be
                     distributed among them, to drink his health and that of his bride. Three other
                     cheers, louder than the last, responded the thanks of the assembled multitude,
                     and then they retired, blessing their benevolent landlord and his "amiable and
                     beautiful angel lady," and extolling them to the skies.
                  This scene impressed Harcourt and his lady with higher ideas of the moral
                     excellence of the Irish people than they had hitherto conceived of them, for
                     they justly remarked that a people who were so susceptible of the noble feeling
                     of gratitude must, notwithstanding their many defects, be good at heart and
                     capable of higher things and loftier sentiments than is generally supposed, and
                     from that moment both determined to devote themselves and their energies to
                     promote their happiness.
                  But they were terribly shocked when they saw a little more of the poverty and
                     wretchedness of the country. It was a source of continual uneasiness and sorrow
                     to them, and it was a long time before they could familiarize themselves with
                     the contemplation of the fearful suffering humanity exhibited in that most
                     degraded and most cruelly injured and oppressed portion of the habitable globe.
                     Their horror was unbounded at the bare thought that such a state of
                     wretchedness could exist anywhere within the precincts of the British Empire,
                     so much extolled for its greatness, its power and its humanity, and their
                     bosoms burned with indignation to think that man could so cruelly tyrannize
                     over his fellow man, in a Christian and civilized country!
                  No sooner, therefore, were they comfortably settled themselves in their new
                     mansion, than they commenced their labor of love and true Christian charity,
                     not the mockery practiced by the clergyman of the parish—a fair specimen of his
                     class in this unhappy land. This reverend gentleman was of course very pious.
                     He derived a good living from the miseries of a people who spurned his
                     spiritual instructions, and while he freely distributed Bibles and religious
                     tracts amongst them from his zeal for religion, he most rigidly exacted his
                     tithes to the utmost farthing or sheaf, and frequently sent his myrmidons to
                     strip the last stack of the poor sick peasant, and when he had taken his tenths
                     out of the heart of it and left the remainder good for nothing and exposed to
                     the storms of heaven, he has sent a religious tract—what could be better than
                     one written to illustrate the patience of Job?—to console the poor man and his
                     family for the loss of their daily bread!
                  Such was not the piety and Christianity of Harcourt and his lady. On the
                     contrary, though the word religion was seldom heard from their lips in pity for
                     wretches who had suffered so cruelly in its name, its essence and true spirit
                     were exhibited in their lives and daily conduct. The most active, yet judicious
                     charity towards the poor and the wretched were practiced constantly without any
                     ostentation. In the first place they let out their lands to their tenantry at a
                     reasonable rent, which encouraged them to cultivate the soil, that they might
                     enjoy at least some of the fruits of their labor, and not be compelled, as
                        heretofore fore, to give up
                        all to rapacious landlords, and still more grasping and
                     rapacious parsons. The result of this action was soon visible in the improved
                     condition of the lands and its cultivators, who were no longer afraid, as
                     formerly, to exhibit their prosperity, for you know as well as I that if a poor
                     farmer had been more than ordinarily industrious, and by that means had saved a
                     small sum of money, he was obliged to conceal it and appear poor, both in his
                     dress and living, lest his landlord, hearing of his prosperity, should raise
                     his rent, which he would be certain to do to the utmost farthing if he thought
                     the tenant able to pay, and even beyond the starving point if he was made aware
                     of such a phenomenon! This is one cause why the Irish seem poorer than they
                     really are, and is a sufficient explanation of that peculiarity in their
                     character, which subjects them to the charge of dissemblers and hypocrites. But
                     who are to be blamed for this, the enlightened teachers or the apt, though
                     destitute scholars? The question answers itself.
                  Then the crowds of wretched, half-starved laborers for miles around were kept
                     in constant employment at fair, though not high wages, for great caution was
                     necessary in regulating this department, as high wages might lead to temptation
                     and excess; the principal object was to keep them employed and to teach them
                     how they might lay out their earnings to the best advantage; to suppress, if
                     possible, the love for ardent spirits, and to introduce some of those domestic
                     improvements and comforts which are so essential to the English laborer's
                     happiness, and to provide for which he must be comparatively sober, thoughtful
                     and considerate.
                  It was made a general rule not to relieve any able-bodied, idle, vagabonds or
                     beggars, to encourage their idleness and profligacy; but to set them to work
                     and pay them regular wages, if they showed themselves worthy of it. But if, as
                     many of them did, they preferred a wandering, vagabond life to honest industry,
                     then they were at liberty to go where they pleased. Thus beggars were gradually
                     got rid of altogether, for they are a class of people having such extensive
                     inter-course amongst themselves and so communicative to each other, that they
                     all know pretty well the houses where they are likely to ply a prosperous trade
                     and the contrary. The old, the sick and the maimed were provided for in a house
                     which Harcourt had built expressly for the purpose, with an hospital attached;
                     but even here there were no idlers amongst the inmates, except those who were
                     incapacited from all labor. Work suitable to the age, sex and the strength of
                     each person was provided for them, on the same general principle that regulated
                     all our other proceedings at Castle Harcourt, viz.: that "idleness is the root
                     of all evils, and that it is perhaps the only state or mode of existence in
                     which man may be said to be truly miserable and shut out from all
                     enjoyment."
                  The private history of individuals, however interesting, dwindles away to
                     nothing compared with the common weal of a nation, and hence it is that writers
                     who have inculcated principles by which any considerable number of our race has
                     been materially and permanently benefited, have deserved well of mankind and
                     are justly extolled to the skies. Those who endeavor to act upon these
                     principles, as far as their own limited sphere and example enable them to do,
                     are not altogether unworthy of some regard.
                  Both Harcourt, my father and myself had seen too much of the operation of the
                     poor laws in England, to have the remotest wish to see them introduced into our
                     own country (for I need scarcely tell you that nothing was done by Harcourt
                     without consulting my father and me previously, and he, for the most part,
                     acted upon our advice.) Yet we saw clearly that some system for the relief of
                     the poor, or rather by which their labor and energies could be properly
                     employed and directed for their own benefit, was absolutely necessary for the
                     very existence of the people, and we have, therefore, entered upon a set of
                     experiments as detailed above. The great object and desideratum is to relieve the very poor and
                     indigent chiefly through their own exertions, according to an organized system,
                     without overburdening the great mass of small farmers, who are only one degree
                     or shade removed from absolute pauperism. Now, if in England the enormous
                     burden of the poor rates is bringing hundreds down from the state of
                     rate-payers to that of paupers, how much more fatal would even a small
                     additional burden be to the rate-payers in Ireland, who are mosty bent to the
                     earth by the burdens which they have to endure already? Besides this, the
                     greatest evil which we would have to dread from the introduction of the English
                     system, would be that it saps the very root of morality and virtue, for it
                     holds out a premium to licentiousness by too liberally supporting the offspring
                     of sin and of shame, and encouraging a multitude of low women in the practice
                     of evil, when they are not made to feel the consequences of their abandonment
                     of duty and of virtue. When such as these are brought up in the faith that they
                     have the funds of a whole parish to call upon, let them act how they may, and,
                     indeed, as a last resort, they very soon reconcile themselves to the shame of
                     adding their burden to the general load, till at last instead of becoming a
                     disgrace, it is considered a kind of merit because it is so common with their
                     neighbors and their whole class. And this dissoluteness and indifference on the
                     part of the female soon extends to the men also, who, indeed, are the greatest
                     sufferers in the end, for the parish makes them accountable for an evil which
                     ought more properly be charged to the account of the women, for men are by
                     nature prone to ask for favors, and it is supposed to be the duty of women to
                     refuse them; but if they are found so open and accessible, it requires much
                     restraint and philosophy in our forward sex not to fall into temptation.
                  And yet you will be as much surprised as I was when I tell you that I found the
                     men of the lower order in England much more cautious and virtuous,
                     as it is called, than the women of the same class. To me, who had been
                     accustomed to find our own country girls not over prudish or formal in outward
                     show, it is true, but strictly virtuous and honorable in all essentials, this
                     seemed at first extraordinary and unaccountable, and I must confess that it led
                     me into some serious errors, which I should not have fallen into had I known
                     the ground better. But a little experience and reflection were sufficient to
                     explain to me the cause, which every one of common sense or discernment must
                     attribute to the truly erroneous principle and practice of the present system
                     of poor laws, as I have already hinted, and not to any inherent immorality in
                     the people more than is common to the whole race.*
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     *This has been in a great measure remedied by the provisions and
                        principles of the new poor law, recently adopted and now in general
                        practice; but I, for one, fear it has come too late. The disease has gone
                        on too long, and is too deeply seated in the system—the heart and vitals
                        of society, to be eradicated by mere words and forms of expression. It
                        ought to have been guarded against years ago by precaution and
                        legislative foresight. As it is, however, all has been done that could be
                        effected under the circumstances, and the country ought to be grateful
                        even for so much.
                  
                  All poor laws, and other laws, ought to be framed on this one broad, general
                     principle, that man is an accountable being, not only to God but to his fellow
                     man and his country, and that if he expects society to do any thing for him he
                     also must do something for society; that to entitle a man or woman to be
                     relieved by their fellow men they ought to be virtuous, as far as that is
                     possible, and that after they are relieved they should manifest their gratitude
                     in lessening the burden by their exertions, instead of considering that they
                     have a legal claim to be supported in idleness for the future. I mean to say,
                     that if people do seek public relief, instead of exerting themselves previously
                     to avoid the necessity of it, access should only be had to it under
                     circumstances both painful and humiliating, except only to those who are old
                     and incapacitated by sickness or other infirmity from exerting themselves in
                        their own behalf, and these ought
                     to be supported with all care, tenderness and bounty.
                  Harcourt soon perceived that the people had a most unconquerable hatred of two
                     things, namely, tithes and Protestantism, for the one was so closely associated
                     with the other in their minds that he found the two ideas were completely
                     inseparable; and what wonder when the parishioners never heard of or saw their
                     rector except when he sent his bloodhounds to rob them of the fruits of their
                     labor; not that the rever-end gentleman did not preach in the parish church—he
                     was very attentive to the forms and ordinances of religion, but then his
                     parishioners were of a different faith, and left him to pour his zealous
                     loathings of Popery and Papists to the empty walls and a few of his immediate
                     dependents whom he had schooled into all that demureness of look and sanctity
                     of exterior and expression which are so truly characteristic of our meek and
                     humble modern saints. As the living was in the gift of Harcourt, and had been
                     purchased with the estate, he endeavored to mollify the reverend gentleman a
                     little in his exactions and cruelty with regard to his tithes, but in vain! He
                     still continued in his pious course, distributing tracts and exacting tithes,
                     till death arrested him while yet in his bloom, and made way for a more mild
                     and merciful successor! for Harcourt made it an express condition on his
                     conferring the living on the succeeding rector that he should accept a
                     compensation instead of tithes, which he himself would take of the people in
                     the form of rent, and pay him a certain fixed sum annually. Another
                     indispensable condition was, that he should distribute no tracts among the
                     people, nor annoy them in any way whatever by urging them to adopt the tenets
                     of a church which was their greatest enemy, and robbed them of bread and almost
                     every blessing which bountiful Heaven bestows on man; for though Harcourt is
                     himself a true Protestant in every sense of the word, and a real Christian, yet
                     he does not think that circumstance a just cause for forcing his religious
                     opinions down the throats of other men, nolens
                        volens. He thinks it better that the religion of men should rather
                     be inferred from their practice than from their creeds and professions, and
                     that if there ever be a chance of the Irish people becoming Protestant at all,
                     it must be by kindness and benevolence exercised towards them, not by preaching
                     to them a speculative creed while the very doctors and preachers of that creed
                     are the great enemies of their temporal happiness, and actually rob them of the
                     very means of existence.
                  I had now remained some months in Ireland, assisting Harcourt to arrange his
                     affairs and just make a beginning of that course which we were all determined
                     to follow up with such zeal, when, having at length found time for relaxation,
                     I began to long for the presence and smile of one who I knew would be rejoiced
                     to engage with us heart and hand in the circle of duties which we had marked
                     out for ourselves. I had prepared a beautiful cottage for her reception, only a
                     short distance from that in which Henry Waltham and Ellen were to reside with
                     my father as soon as they should be united, for it had been arranged by Ellen
                     that she and I should be married on the same day.
                  "We have been good friends," said she, "in adversity, and I hope we shall not
                     forget our love and our sympathies in the day of our prosperity."
                  She showed this sufficiently when she even permitted her lover to quit her for
                     a time and accompany me to England, which contained my heart's treasure, that I
                     might remove it to its appropriate shrine, where it could receive the entire
                     homage and devotion of my heart.
                  Accompanied, therefore, by Henry Waltham I soon arrived at Worthington Lodge
                     without accident or any occurrence worthy of notice, where I found my beloved
                     Eliza waiting anxiously for my arrival. It would be vain to attempt to describe
                     our meeting. She seemed now, if possible, more lovely in my eyes than when I
                     first saw her, and I could not be satisfied in gazing upon her ripe, luxurious
                     charms. Mr. Worthington was not only
                     delighted at our arrival but expressed a desire to accompany us to Ireland, and
                     be present with his two daughters, who were very much attached both to my
                     beloved Eliza and to my sister Ellen, at the double bridal. An additional
                     reason was—to view the magnificent scenery in our neighborhood, which they had
                     never seen, and to make his daughters acquainted with the natural beauty and
                     richness of our far-famed isle. This determination on his part was to us a
                     species of pleasure and delight which we had little anticipated, and added much
                     indeed to the happiness and joy of the approaching event.
                  The ladies were not long in making their preparations. Mr. Worthington made
                     arrangements for the proper conduct of his affairs during his absence, and in
                     three days after our arrival we were all ready to start again.
                  We were requested by Harcourt and his wife to call at Liverpool and invite
                     Arabella and her sister, with their husbands, to Castle Harcourt, which we did,
                     and they, too, accompanied us across the channel, so that we were a large and
                     jovial party. We arrived here only two days ago, and the nuptials are to be
                     celebrated this day week. Will you, my friend, favor us with your company on
                     that occasion? Nothing in the world would give us all greater pleasure;
                     besides, it is so long—so very long—since I have seen you that a sight of you
                     now, and especially on so joyous an occasion, would do my eyes greater pleasure
                     than any other, however brilliant, that could be presented to them. Do come, my
                     friend, I entreat you. I will take no excuse whatever. But for fear you should
                     not be induced purely for my sake, I will mention inducements. Consider, I pray
                     you, the English beauties that will be of the party. The two Misses Worthington
                     are lovely, now that they have unfolded their charms into full and perfect
                     womanhood; and there will be one or two other English ladies, whose names I
                     will not mention, but whose beauty and accomplishments are most attractive, I
                     can assure you; and you may remember that you hinted in one of your letters,
                     when I had mentioned Miss Julia Worthington's spirit and dash, that you would
                     like to have the "taming of that shrew," and that you had no doubt you would be
                     as "successful in that respect as Petruchio was of old with her great prototype
                     in the play." Remember also that you have now an opportunity of proving your
                     powers, if you think proper.
                  I will say no more at present. By the by, I almost forgot to tell you that Lord
                     Hare and Colonel Bond, of your regiment, who were also our schoolfellows, will
                     be of the party, with a few more gentlemen and ladies of this neighborhood,
                     whom you do not know, and that we intend to have a "a rale ould Irish weddin',"
                     or rather two in one! so do not fail to come.
                  Adieu! au revoir, my dear, dear friend, with
                     ten thousand best wishes.
                  
                     Ever yours,
                     EDWARD MONTAGUE.
                  
               
               
                  P. S.—I am almost frantic with joy and the anticipation of happiness.
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXVII.
               CONCLUSION.
               
                  ROSE COTTAGE, ——.
               
               
                  TO FRANK DUNWOODY, ESQ.
                  MANY a true word has been spoken in jest. I little thought when I invited you
                     to my wedding twelve months ago, that before the year was ended you should be
                     the husband of the redoubtable Julia Worthington. I wish you joy, my friend,
                     and am only sorry that I can not avail myself of your kind invitation to come
                     and see you and witness your exquisite happiness. The truth is, my dear Eliza
                     has just presented me with a fine boy, and is doing well; but of course it
                     would be impossible for me to leave her at present. When she is quite recovered
                     we will come and spend a few months with you at Swan Park. So you have sold
                     out. I am very glad to hear it, and only wish that you could fix your residence
                     somewhat nearer to us and make one of our truly happy society. Oh, my friend,
                     if you could see the change that has been wrought in the physical and moral
                     condition of the people here in so short a space of time your benevolent heart
                     would rejoice within you. But when you see it you must form your own
                     conclusions. I might seem to exaggerate if I attempted to describe it.
                  You must have heard that Harcourt has had an heir born to him some weeks ago,
                     and my sister Ellen Waltham has a fine girl.
                  Have you heard what has happened to the younger Miss Worthington, and all since
                     my wedding? What a lucky wedding that was. She lost her heart that day to the
                     noble Lord Hare, and is going to be married very shortly. I have it from her
                     father, from whom I received a letter a few days ago. What do you think of
                     that?
                  I must now tell you an anecdote. You may perhaps remember a circumstance which
                     gave me a good deal of uneasiness at the time, and which I have already told
                     you in one of my former letters. I allude to the morning that I looked through
                     the garden hedge at the vicarage and saw the then Miss Waltham reading a letter
                     over and over, and weeping bitterly as she read, and I attributed her emotion
                     to love. I have discovered the cause lately; she told me herself one day when I
                     mentioned it by mere chance in conversation with her, and what do you think it
                     was, my friend? I will tell you, and I think the circumstance must give you a
                     high opinion both of the heart and feelings of my beloved and invaluable wife.
                     It was a tale of distress that affected her tender and benevolent young heart.
                     A nurse whom she tenderly loved had unfortunately married a brutal drunken
                     wretch of a husband, who both abused and starved her, and Eliza had often
                     before rescued her almost from the jaws of death. At this particular time,
                     however, when she was appealed to with the utmost urgency, she had not the
                     means of affording that prompt relief which was required. This was too much for
                     her; she reflected what could be done, but in vain. She then took out the
                     letter and read it again with tears in her eyes; again she racked her invention
                     in order to devise some means of relief for the poor woman, but in vain, and
                     thus she continued reading, weeping and reflecting alternately for a
                     considerable time. At length she resolved to appeal to her father; she did so,
                     but to no purpose. All she could say was not able to extract a farthing from
                     the miser. At last the happy idea struck her of applying to Mr. Worthington in
                     this emergency. No sooner had she made her tale of distress known to that
                     excellent man than he instantly
                     sympathized with her and the sufferer, and offered the necessary relief without
                     a moment's hesitation. And thus the poor girl was enabled to gratify the most
                     pure and holy of feelings, that of relieving a poor and humble friend in
                     distress.
                  I think I have told you nearly all the news in this neighborhood, at least all
                     that I have been able to collect, which is not much now. Our mode of life is
                     uniform, seldom deviating from the same direct course, and our happiness as
                     pure and sacred as can well fall to the lot of humanity. When I look back on
                     the last few years of our existence, I am struck with wonder and amazement at
                     the scenes we have witnessed and the change that has come upon us. From being
                     poor, homeless wanderers and adventurers on the wide world, we have, through
                     the bounty of Heaven, been raised to a pitch of prosperity and happiness
                     scarcely paralleled in the history of private life, and have been made the
                     instruments of good to thousands of our fellow men by the same Divine and
                     Omnipotent agency. May our hearts ever swell with gratitude to Heaven for its
                     bounties, and may we never forget that its gifts have been lent to us, not for
                     ourselves, but that, like good stewards and servants, we should put our talents
                     to usury and employ our gifts for the benefit of our fellow man, and the glory
                     and praise of our Creator and our God. Hoping soon to hear from you, I remain,
                     my dear friend, etc., etc.
                  
                     EDWARD MONTAGUE.
                  
               
               
                  P. S. I had almost forgotten to answer your question concerning the
                     game-keepers—"whether they continue steady and reformed men, as they promised?"
                     You mean, I suppose, the two new ones, Flanagan and O'More, the quondam
                     associates and friends of the incorrigible McArdle? I am happy to inform you
                     that their conduct has been excellent and praiseworthy ever since. They are
                     most indefatigable and efficacious in their detecting and securing, not
                     poachers, but thieves, and have shown themselves trustworthy on many occasions,
                     particularly of late, when Mr. Harcourt employed them on a very important
                     trust, and they discharged it so much to his satisfaction as to call forth not
                     only his warmest praise and thanks, but still more substantial
                     acknowledgements, and it is confidently hoped by all that they will continue to
                     walk in that path which they have recently entered, and which, perhaps, they
                     would never have forsaken had it not been for the violence and example of a
                     desperate youth and a vile and incorrigible man. Adieu.
               
            
            FINIS.
