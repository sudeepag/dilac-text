               CHAPTER I.
               NIGHT was settling over the city of New York. It was in the fall of 1866. Wall
                  Street had been through one of its fiercest campaigns of that year; but now, as
                  the darkened sky looked down on this field of many battles, it gazed upon a field
                  of silence. The bulls had retired triumphant, the bears discomfited. In other
                  words, one set of speculators had gone home to count up their increased fortunes;
                  the other to contemplate their ruin.
               About eight o'clock a man issued from a broker's office near the Treasury
                  Building, and looking upwards, around, and then downwards, as if he were uncertain
                  whether he trod on solid earth or not, he turned and wended his way with an
                  unsteady step to his store; for this man was not a professional speculator, but a
                  dry-goods merchant, who had caught the fever of speculation.
               As he passed through the store to his counting-room, the few clerks who remained
                  for special duty looked after him, and exchanged significant glances.
               Closing the door of the counting-room, he fell into a chair and buried his face in
                  his hands.
               As the gas-light strikes down upon him while he thus sits, a picture of despair,
                  his thin, yellowish hair matted with perspiration, and his long, bony fingers
                  clutched and quivering in the midst of
                  these scanty locks, one cannot withhold from him a profound sympathy.
               At length he uncovers his face, and rising, he paces up and down the office.
                  Presently he stops, and resting one hand on the desk, he fixes his eye on a
                  photograph which hangs on the partition that separates the counting-room from the
                  store, and mutters to himself.
               The name of this merchant who suffers so much is Jonas Cringar.
               As he stands before us, he appears to be a little over fifty years of age. He is
                  tall, and his shoulders are somewhat bent. His thin hair, and rather bristly
                  beard, which he wears full and of moderate length, are mixed sandy and yellow. His
                  eyes are blue, and have a cast in them; and while they indicate a kindness of
                  disposition, they also convey an impression of obliquity in his character. His
                  nose is nearly straight.
               His mouth has a peculiar expression. It is somewhat long and well compressed, as
                  it appears under the trimmed mustache; but mingled with this compression, which to
                  the casual eye would convey an idea of great firmness, is an expression of
                  weakness, not unlike that which is seen in the mouths of certain inebriates.
               The whole face, in moments of excitement, is drawn down and elongated.
               As he gazed on the photograph, which was the likeness of a man dressed in the
                  uniform of a captain of infantry, his muttering gave place to a silent look of
                  intense mental anguish, his face being drawn down to an extraordinary degree.
               Suddenly he started, looked at his watch, and with an effort at self-control,
                  stepped to the door, and told the remaining clerks they could leave and he would
                  lock up.
               Cringar stood looking at the clerks as they retired. One seemed to delay.
               "Will you leave?" cried the merchant in an abrupt, harsh voice.
               The clerk turned at the sound of this voice; but if he was intending to speak, he
                  was silenced by the haggard expression of his employer's face, and quietly turning
                  to the door, he was about to open it, when a man entered from the street.
               "Garvin!" muttered the clerk as he passed him; "he's doing Cringar no good. Any
                  one can see that with half an eye."
               As this man entered, Jonas Cringar trembled, and drew back into the
                  counting-room.
               The new-comer walked through the store, while his boots seemed to vindictively
                  grind the dust of the floor at every step; and as he crossed the threshold of the
                  counting-room, he extended his hand to the merchant, and exclaimed in a harsh,
                  metallic voice:—
               "How are you?"
               Cringar instinctively drew back. But as his eye met the glance of his visitor, he
                  stepped forward and took the proffered hand, allowing his to remain till the other
                  saw fit to drop it; which doing, the latter seated himself, not removing his eyes
                  from the merchant.
               It is plain that he is a man of power. As he removes his hat, which is still done
                  without taking his eyes from Cringar, the light brings his head and features out
                  in bold relief, affording a striking contrast to the appearance of the
                  merchant.
               His head and face are broad, the complexion dark. That which first strikes the
                  beholder is the eye and mouth. The iris is of a greenish-gray hue, which usually
                  is rather dark, and not remarkably
                  brilliant. But when the mind and will seem actively at work, as at the present
                  time, there appears a light ring, which expands and contracts, sometimes almost
                  filling the space around the pupil, and again forming simply a narrow band, giving
                  the iris an appearance of varied colors, and an expression as cruel as in the eye
                  of the beast of prey.
               There is, however, with their fixedness of look, a certain restlessness in these
                  eyes, scarcely to be called a motion, as if they were ever on the watch at a post
                  of danger. The mouth unites in this restlessness.
               The upper lip, though firm and biting, has a continual tendency to show the white
                  upper teeth, as if it were in constant expectation of these fangs leaping out to
                  fasten themselves on a victim.
               The upper lip and chin are shaven, the whiskers starting from the corners of the
                  mouth, and extending in a downward angle back of the jaw.
               His forehead is capacious, and rounds into thin, dark hair, which is sprinkled (as
                  are the whiskers) with gray, and fast giving way to baldness, with also a peculiar
                  dryness, as if the heat of an incessantly plotting brain were gradually withering
                  it away.
               Such was the man who now sat with his eye fixed on the haggard merchant. His name
                  was Daniel Garvin; his business a Wall Street broker.
               "You don't look well to-night, Cringar," he said, after a quick glance to the
                  photograph and back again.
               "No, I'm not feeling well to-night."
               "The battle's been too much for you, eh?" And Garvin laid his hat on a chair near
                  him, and slowly rubbed the palms of his hands.
               The only answer Cringar gave was an inward groan.
               "You went with the bears, eh?"
               "I understood from you—"
               "Pshaw, man!—well, what? you understood what?"
               "I understood that we should be sure to win." And Jonas Cringar again groaned.
               "This is your reward."
               "My reward?"
               "For not putting faith in me."
               "You always bear the market."
               "Not always. For instance, to-day a man with eyes half open couldn't have failed
                  to see how the thing was going to turn. There are times when a man must doff his
                  claws and don his horns."
               Garvin gave vent to a rapid guttural laugh as he uttered this witticism, but
                  Cringar looked as if this mirth would be as appropriate over a new-made grave.
                  Rising from his chair, he walked to the door, turning his back to his
                  tormentor.
               The broker contemplated him a moment, while the rings in his eyes seemed to gleam
                  with a phosphorescent light. Suddenly he spoke with his abrupt, harsh voice:—
               "Cringar!"
               The merchant turned as if he had received a shock from a galvanic battery. As he
                  met the deadly eyes of the broker, he blanched, for he saw there was a struggle
                  coming, and to enter into a struggle with this man was to engage with a relentless
                  foe.
               "Cringar, you're not playing true with me."
               The merchant was stung.
               "Playing true with you, sir!" he exclaimed, in a voice which indicated a courage
                  of which he was capable at times. "Do you have the face to fling that at me?"
               The broker's eye gleamed with a grim smile, and his upper lip begun to play,
                  revealing his fangs.
               
               "What am I to-night, sir?" continued Cringar, "and who has brought me to it?"
               "Well, what are you?" rejoined Garvin, in a sarcastic voice, exquisitely
                  cutting.
               "A ruined man!"
               "Not so fast, not so fast, Mr. Cringar. You're not ruined yet."
               "Ay, a ruined man!"
               The merchant's countenance assumed an aspect of profound desperation.
               "Pshaw, man!" said Garvin, who now changed his voice to a tone in which
                  consolation and contempt vied for the mastery; "so long as a man is a
                  man he shouldn't despair. Now I think I can get you out of the bog, and set you on
                  your pins all right."
               Jonas Cringar turned on the broker fiercely.
               "Despair! Set me on my pins all right! Be done with these lies!"
               Daniel Garvin sprang to his feet. But this time his eyes met the eyes of a man
                  who, not lacking in a certain degree of strength, was now roused to desperation.
                  The merchant waved his hand for the broker to be seated, and his rounded shoulders
                  straightened into something like majesty.
               "I say, be done, Daniel Garvin, and hear me! You have deceived me from beginning
                  to end! Professing to take me into your confidence, that you might get mine, you
                  have made me your dupe, and the victim of your machinations! You it is who have
                  tempted me from my legitimate business into speculation, and the crimes which this
                  damnable curse gives birth to! I am a defaulter, and, with no power left to help
                  myself, I am ruined. To-day's business has finished me! I am gone!"
               With these last words the merchant sank into his chair, and covered his face with
                  his hand.
               Garvin's eye seemed for a moment to be disturbed by a sentiment of pity. But if
                  so, it was only for a moment; for it instantly settled into a cruel, triumphant
                  look, as he contemplated his victim.
               "You speak like a madman, Cringar," he at length said.
               The merchant's only response was a tighter clasping of his forehead in his bony
                  fingers.
               "You speak like a boy who, thinking he can swim, follows another who goes into
                  deep water, and because he finds he can't swim, he splutters out that the other
                  has drowned him."
               The merchant did not move.
               "You are pleased to say that you are a defaulter through my machinations, as you
                  call it. This is nonsense. Because you take money of a company in which you have a
                  strong interest, and, as treasurer, deem it wise to invest it for a short time for
                  the benefit of the company, is that a crime? If you didn't succeed, it was your
                  misfortune, but no crime."
               Cringar raised his head, and viewed this utterer of plausible sophistries with
                  gloomy eyes.
               "Your sentiments, sir," he said, "are destroying scores of men who have stood as I
                  once stood. It's of no use. I'm a defaulter, and the world has got to know
                  it."
               "Why has it? You're not a dead beat."
               "I am a dead beat. I have lost forty thousand dollars of the
                  company's money, and curse the day I ever touched it; and to-day I have given
                  notes that cover all my available property, including every cent I have in this
                  store."
               He now rose, and, turning, gazed in gloomy despair through the counting-room
                  window into the store.
               
               The broker also rose. Unobserved by the merchant he stood before the photograph,
                  and bent upon it a dark, malevolent gaze. Then he placed his hand on Cringar's
                  shoulder.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               "NOW, Cringar," said Garvin in a voice which he knew well how to use, "I can get
                  you out of all this difficulty. Perhaps my method of doing business isn't the
                  method for you to adopt. Now that you have come out so unfortunately, I'm inclined
                  to think it is so. If I made a mistake in judgment in this respect, it is unfair
                  to make me guilty of much that is worse. I have meant you well, as I call my
                  conscience to witness. I don't mean to say that my methods of doing business are
                  perfect, when viewed by the standard of the old style. Speculation may be a
                  dangerous thing, and may lead to acts as risky as war does, and to strategic
                  deception, as war does; but war is necessary at times, and so is speculation."
               His auditor did not move, so he continued.
               "Now that you are dead beat, and say it's of no use for you to try to keep your
                  head up any longer,—in short ruined, as you put it,—what harm can
                  there be in giving me a fair chance of bringing you out? I can do it."
               These last words were spoken with strong emphasis, and caused the merchant to
                  turn.
               Garvin smiled in his face.
               "Cringar," he said, showing his white teeth, while his ring-gleaming eyes
                  restlessly passed and repassed from one eye of the merchant to the
                  other,—"Cringar, if you really consider yourself dead, what harm in letting me try
                  a little surgery, with the guaranty that I will make you live?"
               Jonas Cringar's mouth began to work, and his face to elongate in a manner which
                  the broker understood.
               He knew he had conquered.
               He took the merchant's unresisting hand.
               "Now, Cringar," he said, "let us be friends; at least," he added with a smile,
                  "until we have you out of this terrible fix."
               Cringar was not convinced of Garvin's sincerity. But it was life or death with
                  him, and he now listened with the resignation of despair to anything he might
                  propose.
               When he told Garvin that he had made him a victim of his machinations, he told the
                  truth.
               But he was not the chief object of these machinations.
               He was simply the tool.
               The original of the photograph which we have seen the merchant contemplate with
                  such emotion, and the broker with such malignity, is the man on whom the latter's
                  evil eye is ultimately fixed.
               The name of this man is Allen Paige, half-brother to Garvin, and partner to
                  Cringar.
               A merchant in uniform is but one of the many sublime anomalies of the
                  Rebellion.
               From the opening of this mighty struggle for the destruction of freedom on the one
                  hand, and the maintenance of it on the other, Allen Paige yearned to join the
                  conflict.
               For over three years it was impossible.
               In the fall of 1864 he would endure it no longer. He determined it should no
                  longer be impossible. Leaving the business in charge of his partner, he went to
                  the front with the rank of Captain.
               
               He fought in the Army of the Potomac, and rapidly mounted to the rank of
                  Lieutenant-Colonel.
               At the battle of Petersburg he was wounded for the first time. A ball from a Rebel
                  sharpshooter struck him in the right breast as he was bending forward, and
                  penetrated to the lower part of the spine. It was a frightful wound; but no vital
                  was hit, and he was not killed. He commenced to die from that time, however, and
                  had been slowly but surely wasting away.
               Though younger than Cringar, he was the senior partner, the style of the firm
                  being PAIGE & CRINGAR, for his superior tact and energy had been mainly
                  instrumental in building up the business.
               But though shrewd and energetic in his business, he was free and open-hearted, to
                  a fault. Quick to trust those whom he called his friends, and slow to suspect
                  them.
               Up to the time of his return, wounded and disabled, from the war, and for several
                  months afterwards, nothing was done by Jonas Cringar in violation of good faith
                  with his partner.
               But within the past two or three months a change had taken place. A serpent had
                  commenced to wind about Jonas Cringar. This serpent was Daniel Garvin.
               The half-brothers took their characters, each from his father. Daniel's father,
                  the mother's first husband, was a dark, scheming, tyrannical man, who made his
                  wife miserable. Allen's father, the second husband, was a noble, open, generous
                  man, who made his wife the happiest of women.
               After his mother's second marriage, and the birth of Allen, Daniel felt himself
                  outlawed. He heard much of his dark father and his resemblance to him.
               He hated his half-brother, but his natural craftiness warned him to hate in
                  secret. He concealed it by a general moodiness, under cover of which he would, in
                  boyhood, dart out and make his unsuspecting brother feel the weight of his pent-up
                  vengeance.
               It thus occurred that while he, with more or less frequency, gave open expression
                  to his hatred, it was not attributed to hatred, but to the ungovernable display of
                  a bad and moody temper.
               The mother and second husband were now dead; and Daniel's secret hatred was not
                  diminished by the manner in which the property had been bequeathed. The bulk of it
                  went to the detested half-brother.
               Avarice is not the least of the dark passions that govern a nature like Daniel's.
                  When he found himself 
                     comparitively
                     comparatively
                   disinherited, his hatred was resolved into implacable vengeance, and his
                  avarice devoured him with an unquenchable thirst for his brother's riches.
               But the stronger his internal passions, the more solicitously he concealed
                  them.
               When Allen Paige returned with his terrible wound, Daniel Garvin made pretence of
                  sympathy. He called at the house, and his countenance assumed an expression of the
                  profoundest pity as the wound was unbound and exposed to sight. He declared, with
                  well-simulated impulsive candor, that he had up to the moment he first beheld this
                  fearful wound entertained toward Allen a feeling of bitterness; but to look upon
                  him now would turn a heart of stone. He clasped him by the hand, and helped dress
                  his wound: and who so tender as one of these men when his schemes demand it?
               But the only sincere emotion that found a place in his bosom, as he now often
                  stood by the side of his suffering
                  half-brother, was the secret but intense satisfaction with which he saw that he
                  was gradually and surely dying!
               We will return to Jonas Cringar.
               Through this man of complicated strength and weakness, Garvin commenced active
                  operations.
               A short time before Paige's enlistment an agreement had been signed between the
                  partners, that neither should engage in any outside speculations.
               This was a barrier. If once broken, it would place him between these two partners,
                  enabling him to take the enemy in detail.
               With his varied arts he labored to entangle Cringar in the interdicted outside
                  speculations. He was successful. Fire brought in contact with wood is not more
                  certain of kindling a flame than was the flaming temptation of speculation—rampant
                  in those days, and spreading like some vast conflagration—of starting into a blaze
                  the lust for wealth of Jonas Cringar, when once the broker's arts had been brought
                  to bear upon him.
               Once entangled, and the victim could only struggle. The history of scores who have
                  been held up to notoriety in these past few years is his history.
               The demon of speculation first devoured all his own immediately available means;
                  then into its maw went forty thousand dollars, held by him as treasurer of a
                  Nevada silver mining company; and now, on the day which opens this tale, he has
                  given notes, with collateral security, which cover all property he had
                  remaining.
               Through it all his evil genius was leading him on with false hopes and pictures of
                  chimerical fortunes. For once, as we have seen, he had in his desperation been
                  able to tear himself from Daniel Garvin, and trust his fortunes in another
                  broker's hands.
               In his downward course, beside his criminal use of the funds intrusted to him as
                  treasurer, he had committed acts which, as he thought of them, made him
                  tremble.
               
               At length Garvin had his struggling victim in his power. He now prepared to push
                  forward his ultimate design.
               A few days previous to their introduction to the reader, he had dropped into
                  Cringar's ear a dark and diabolical hint.
               This hint revealed, as in a twilight, an atrocious plot.
               This plot was the robbery of the widow and orphan children of the patriot
                  half-brother.
               By means of his subtle arts, he had been appointed, with Cringar, executor of his
                  step-brother's will. As executors, they would accomplish the work.
               Jonas Cringar had entertained a sincere affection for his partner, and had been
                  received into his home as one of the family. But he possessed not the character
                  for a long fight against the powers of darkness, for the sake either of affection
                  or principle.
               On this day that had decided his fate in Wall Street, he had, as has been before
                  stated, ventured to make an effort for freedom, by engaging the services of
                  another broker. He had got wind of a certain great combination of the bears, and
                  having possession of what he believed to be valuable points, he put up a margin on
                  a large amount of the beared stock; and as the tide, to the dismay of all bears,
                  unexpectedly set in against them, "more margin" was called for, and again "more
                  margin," each time with a yet more frantic voice, and at each call the merchant
                  covering with yet increasing desperation, till the crash came, and blasted his
                  last hope.
               We have seen him stagger to his store, and have witnessed nessed his anguish, alone, and his desperation in
                  the presence of Daniel Garvin.
               We left him passively awaiting a proposition from the broker.
               "I will tell you what I will do," said Garvin. "I will give you the advantage of
                  knowledge which I possess of the operations of a certain ring, that I am not
                  permitted to speak of now to any one outside of it. Suffice it that you have seen
                  me win, and I tell you I shall win again."
               "My margin," uttered the merchant in a gloomy voice.
               "That is what I am coming to. There is no difficulty about it at all. I will give
                  you acknowledgment of margin without cash down. I recognize that you haven't
                  always been fortunate in your ventures with me, but now I am master of secrets
                  that will insure success, taurine or ursine. You can
                  repay me afterwards."
               A gleam of hope lit up the gloom of the merchant.
               "Mr. Garvin," he said, "give me a start that will enable me to pay that money back
                  in the treasury of the Bald-Eagle Silver Mining Company, and I'll bless you with
                  prayers."
               "It shall be done!" exclaimed the broker decisively, bringing his hand with a
                  familiar slap on Cringar's knee.
               Then fixing his malevolent eye on the wavering orb of the merchant, he said in a
                  low, ominous voice,—
               "But, Cringar, the night is going by, and I have important business to propose,
                  which cannot be longer delayed."
               Cringar's eyes suddenly became fixed in a frightened stare, but he remained
                  silent.
               "First take that away," said the broker in a voice in which command and guilt
                  mingled; and he pointed to the photograph of his half-brother.
               Cringar hesitated, but starting spasmodically from his chair, he took down the
                  photograph and set it on the floor outside the counting-room, face to against the
                  wall.
               When he had again seated himself, the broker proceeded to disclose his plot
                  against the original of this unendurable photograph.
               As Daniel Garvin commenced to unfold his diabolical scheme, the perspiration which
                  had disappeared from the merchant's forehead began again to make its appearance;
                  and it increased as the broker proceeded, until, no longer able to endure the
                  terrible eye that was fixed upon him, he dropped his head into his hands, and soon
                  he formed a repetition of the picture which he presented just after entering the
                  counting-room from the street. His hair again became matted, and his long bony
                  fingers again quiveringly clutched his head under the scanty locks.
               The broker marked the effect he was producing with Satanic triumph. Each separate
                  matted lock, and each long, quivering finger, seemed to cry out to him,—
               "Master, behold your slave!"
               At length he finished, and then sat contemplating the suffering merchant, who
                  seemed too stunned to move.
               Jonas Cringar finally raised his head, and as his face met the light it seemed to
                  have grown, in the last five minutes, twenty years older. It was drawn to an
                  unwonted length, and his chest heaved as if some heavy weight were pressing upon
                  it.
               He rose from his seat, and with an unsteady, and sort of tottering stride, he
                  passed and repassed between the door and chair, clutching the back of the latter
                  each time he approached it, as if for support.
               
               At last he stopped with his hand clasping the back of the chair, and turned to
                  Garvin.
               At this instant the store door was thrown open and a man hastened to the
                  counting-room and exclaimed,—
               "Mr. Paige is dying!"
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               THE chamber in which Allen Paige had been confined an invalid for so long a time
                  was located in the L of the house, which was situated on West Twenty-seventh
                  Street. It received the sun throughout the greater part of the day, and this fact,
                  together with its seclusion from the noise of passing vehicles, had rendered it
                  peculiarly favorable as a room for an invalid unusually sensitive to chill and
                  noise. Here, with his wife and daughter to attend him, he spent month after month
                  of uncomplaining illness, rather inspiring those around him with buoyant spirits,
                  than seeming to need such inspiration himself.
               As we have said, his nature was free and generous, and his desire to cause no
                  trouble on his account, combined with a natural elasticity of spirits, had filled
                  this sick-chamber with an almost perpetual sunshine, even when the clouds hid the
                  sun in the sky. I say almost perpetual, for times there were when even his elastic
                  courage was unable to conquer the pain which would occasionally come on in an
                  unexpected moment, and seizing him in its grip, compel a groan of agony.
               Such moments served, however, to reveal in stronger light the fortitude of this
                  patient sufferer; and not unfrequently the affectionate mother or daughter,
                  touched too deeply by this display of suffering, and by the thought of much more
                  suffering which was endured in silence, being unable to control their emotions
                  would hastily quit the room and weep.
               But he was not often deceived. The reddened eye would tell the tale, and then he
                  would put on so playful and sportive an air that she who but a short time before
                  was weeping would now find herself smiling and laughing as if all were
                  enjoyment.
               It was rare that these devoted nurses permitted any one to take their place; and
                  often as the wounded soldier lay and gazed upon them in the midst of their tender
                  labors, he would silently call down upon them the benedictions of Heaven.
               Isabel, the wife of Allen Paige, was one of those women of whom many are found to
                  redeem the sex from the obloquy, which is often unjustly attached to it through
                  that class whose houses are the dry-good stores, and whose firesides are the
                  opera.
               Her appearance prepossesses the beholder at once. Of medium height, her
                  countenance especially impresses one with its goodness. She possesses beauty to a
                  high degree; but her air is so marked of one who devotes herself to the duties of
                  life, to the entire exclusion of all vanity, that the beholder instinctively
                  shrinks from gazing upon her countenance with any thought of this beauty only as
                  it expresses her virtues. Her form is noble, and a grace pervades it, which
                  advancing years cannot remove.
               Emma, the eldest daughter, is nineteen years of age, and rarely does the eye find
                  such pleasure as in the contemplation of this charming girl.
               She is not so tall as her mother, but equally well proportioned, her form
                  impressing one with an exquisite
                  combination of lightness, grace, and maidenly dignity. Her eye is of a dark hazel;
                  her nose just enough relieved from the straight to give life and character; her
                  mouth full and finely formed, with a certain action, as the lips meet in the
                  middle, which I have observed to be accompanied with purity; her face is a full
                  oval, with an expression, as the cheek descends in a rich curve from the ear to
                  the chin, which implies great force of character with a remarkably affectionate
                  disposition; her hair is of a rich brown, and is slightly brushed away in a waving
                  roll from a classic forehead, which, with its purely feminine air of thought,
                  affords a fit crown for all the other beauties of the face.
               Besides Emma, there are three other children of this family: Alice, a charming and
                  faithful young girl of thirteen years, who proves herself of great aid in the
                  attendance on her father; Albert, a thoughtful boy, two years younger, who, even
                  at this early age, is at the head of the first class of the public school; and
                  Little Dorrit, as they call her, her name being Dora, who is seven years old, and
                  the pet of the whole family.
               On the day previous to the one which has opened our story, Allen Paige had begun
                  to sink rapidly, and as this succeeding day dragged its painful hours, it was
                  evident that the moment of dissolution was near at hand.
               He seemed insensible most of the day, but as evening approached he indicated
                  returning consciousness.
               It was about six o'clock. He had in his wanderings been giving orders to his men,
                  whom he fancied marching with him into battle.
               "By the right flank!—Steady, men!—Halt!—Ready—aim—fire!—Steady!—Fire at
                  will!—First Company deploy as skirmishers!" were incoherently uttered at
                  intervals, as he might imagine himself a line or field officer.
               There was something inexpressibly touching in the manner of the mother and eldest
                  daughter, as they listened to this raving re-enactment of these terrible scenes of
                  battle.
               While grief took possession of their countenances, there was yet mingled with it
                  an expression of tender pride, as they seemed to witness in his unconscious
                  pictures those acts of bravery which had won him distinction in the field. They
                  saw their husband and father marching to his duty as a patriot who loved his
                  country and was ready to die for it; and, in their sorrow, their souls seemed
                  pervaded by the lofty sentiment that, though spared to them for so many months,
                  now were they ready to yield him a sacrifice on the altar of his country.
               A soldier's family,—his widow, his orphan children; they who gave their protector
                  and support to their country, strengthening him with their love, encouragement,
                  and blessing, and thanking God that they could give one to fight for Liberty;—what
                  objects more worthy the protection of a preserved nation?
               Such thoughts cannot fail to inspire the breast of him who beholds the scene
                  around the dying bed of this patriot soldier.
               As the dying man was in the midst of an order to storm the breastworks of the
                  enemy, he awoke to consciousness.
               At this instant the rays of the setting sun were cast in golden light across his
                  face.
               The wife made a movement to close the curtain, but by a look he detained her.
               "Let it rest upon me," he faintly uttered. "I would fain let this messenger from
                  the skies baptize me before I go hence. Ah! how near heaven seems to me now!"
               By a beautiful coincidence, as he uttered these words, a soft strain of music
                  floated through the air, and seemed to mingle its harmonies with these baptizing
                  rays of the golden sun.
               
               This music, so enchanting and so opportune, was produced by a quartette of male
                  and female voices, who were rehearsing that beautiful chant, "THY WILL BE DONE,"
                  in tones of exquisite harmony and sentiment.
               As the closing words of each verse, "THY WILL BE DONE," floated into the chamber,
                  and reached the ears of the dying patriot, his countenance kindled with adoration,
                  and his dimming eyes turned to heaven, while his lips moved as if he were joining
                  in the chant with invisible angels.
               It was not sorrow; it was not grief; but tears rolled down the cheeks of the
                  mother and daughter, and they knelt by the bedside, and with clasped hands
                  silently united in this inspired prayer to Heaven, while Alice and her brother
                  Albert stood in reverent awe, their youthful souls penetrated by the touching
                  sacredness of this scene.
               As the third verse was bearing these adoring souls upward to God, the door was
                  silently opened by the servant, and a young man crossed the threshold.
               The scene before him caused him to pause, and he stood immovable as he
                  contemplated this profoundly impressive picture.
               The sun's rays had passed the face of the soldier, and now with even a yet more
                  glorious light, appeared to encircle his head with the sacred nimbus, while the
                  music, filling the room from an unseen source, seemed in combination with this
                  light to come from the unseen world.
               This young man was of a nature rendering him unusually impressible to such a
                  scene; and as he stood by the threshold without moving, a trembling seized him,
                  and his eyes were suffused with tears. His effeminate face, slightly touched with
                  a downy beard, his full blue eyes, and fine, light, wavy hair, at once indicate
                  this sensitive nature, combined as they are with a slight and delicate form.
               His soul is evidently kindred with the soul of the family before him, for his
                  emotions seem not merely quickened by the outward picture, but from a deep
                  sympathy of spirit.
               The last tones of the chant now hover through the room, and as they die away, the
                  golden light, lingering a moment afterwards, like some sweet refrain, passes away
                  with them, leaving silence and the shades of evening in their place.
               Allen Paige now turned his head, and the wife and daughter rose. Looking toward
                  the door he smiled, and Mrs. Paige, turning, discovered the visitor.
               He was now greeted as if he were one of the family, and he came forward and spoke
                  to his uncle; for, strange as was the anomaly, this light, delicate, and ethereal
                  young man was the son of Daniel Garvin.
               And yet not so strange, for he was a complete transcript of his mother, whose
                  delicate organization, with her uncontrollable sensitiveness, had yielded to the
                  harsh contact of the father's unfeeling and aggressive nature, and found that
                  peace in death which she never found after her marriage in life.
               William, for this was his name, now offered to act as nurse for a while; and with
                  the promise that he would call them at the first indication of a change, the
                  family, yielding to the desires of the now somewhat reviving patient, left the
                  room for a brief respite from the cares of the sick-chamber, and to attend to
                  necessary household duties.
               Soon after they had retired, the soldier fell into a quiet sleep.
               He slept thus for about two hours. When he awoke it was evident the end was
                  approaching. There was a marked change, which the doctor, who came in a few
                  moments afterwards, pronounced the change of death.
               The family were now called to the bedside, and the dying man, having expressed a desire that his
                  brother and partner should be present before he passed away, William Garvin
                  volunteered to seek them.
               It was he who entered the store so suddenly, and gave the announcement as recorded
                  at the close of the second chapter.
               On the utterance of this announcement, the broker took his hat, and, with a
                  meaning glance at the merchant, went out of the counting-room in silence.
               Jonas Cringar followed, also in silence.
               Both were startled; but while Daniel Garvin recovered himself immediately, the
                  merchant shivered perceptibly as he followed the former out of the store, and his
                  long hands clenched and unclenched themselves incessantly, indicating a terrible
                  conflict.
               As they entered the chamber, Allen Paige greeted them with a look which long
                  afterwards haunted Jonas Cringar, and then turned his eyes with an imploring
                  glance on his family.
               They approached the bed, but, as the dying soldier attempted to speak, his tongue
                  refused its office, and with another of those looks, which were destined to
                  disturb the future sleep of the merchant, he relapsed into unconsciousness.
               Had the invisible beings, whom the dying so often contemplate, warned this devoted
                  husband and father of the diabolical plot of which his loved ones were the
                  intended victims?
               None here can tell; but such a thought penetrated to the guilty conscience of
                  Jonas Cringar, and he trembled as the devils tremble who believe that there is one
                  God.
               The soldier now commenced re-enacting the martial scenes of his military life.
               At length he began talking in tones of the profoundest affection of a comrade,
                  whom he spoke of only as Prescott.
               "Who is this Prescott?" asked Daniel Garvin, who seemed slightly ill at ease.
               "He was a dear friend of Mr. Paige. He was a lieutenant of cavalry. His name is
                  Prescott Marland," replied Mrs. Paige.
               "Father seems to have loved him as a son, and has often wished that we were
                  acquainted with him," added Emma.
               As Emma said this, William Garvin turned suddenly toward her, and his delicate
                  features were disturbed by an expression which caused a slight blush to suffuse
                  her face. In another instant he seemed to realize where he was, and the solemnity
                  of the event in which he was then to a degree an actor, and with a frown of
                  self-reproach he turned his gaze to the dying.
               The patriot's utterances now grew fainter and more and more incoherent.
               At length he lay still and silent, and it seemed as if the spirit had finally
                  departed.
               But suddenly he started from his pillow with that apparently supermundane strength
                  which the dying so often reveal, and, waving his arm, he shouted: "Forward, men!
                  To-day you conquer! Remember your country!"
               Then sinking back, he gave signs of the last moments. His eye began to glaze, and
                  his breath to labor.
               At this instant the door opened, and a tall man of majestic, military bearing
                  silently entered the room, and, reverentially approaching the bed, gazed on the
                  expiring patriot with an expression of profound solemnity.
               With one exception he was unobserved by those around the bed, who watched with all-absorbing attention
                  the last signs of life in the form before them.
               The broker was the only one who observed this newcomer, and as he fixed his
                  sinister eye upon him he felt a nameless foreboding.
               The eye of the stranger, as if drawn by the power of magnetism, turned for a
                  moment from the dying soldier, and met the eye that was fixed upon him.
                  Unconsciously, probably, to himself, his own assumed a look of iron sternness, and
                  it seemed to the inwardly quailing broker as if it penetrated his most secret
                  thoughts. Turning his gaze again on the patriot, his countenance reassumed its
                  expression of tender solemnity.
               Presently the face of Allen Paige was lit up by a divine smile. His eye seemed for
                  an instant to break through the glaze that was rapidly covering it, and look into
                  heaven, and his lips moved as if he were speaking to the awaiting angels; and then
                  the spirit of the brave soldier passed to its home, to be greeted by the patriots
                  of all the past ages, while the mortal face lay white and still, with that last
                  divine smile to relieve the coldness of death.
               As the family now gathered with weeping eyes around the motionless form of him who
                  had loved them so much, the stranger silently withdrew, followed by the now
                  furtive glance of Daniel Garvin.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               AFTER a few words of formal consolation, Daniel Garvin and Jonas Cringar took
                  their departure, glad to escape that chamber, where their consciences seemed to
                  hear the solemn denunciations of the dead.
               When they had arrived in the street, Cringar turned towards the broker, and opened
                  his lips to speak; but there was a look about the latter which, for the present,
                  at least, compelled him to remain silent.
               The arch-schemer had not been so absorbed by the impressive scene through which
                  they had just passed as to fail to take exact note of every change of expression
                  which in turn agitated the countenance of the merchant. As we have seen, it was a
                  face calculated to reveal in a strong manner the character of the soul's emotions,
                  and the broker easily read the fierce but suppressed struggle that was going on
                  within him.
               The reader can readily imagine the nature of this internal conflict. The effect of
                  the look which Allen Paige cast upon him when he entered the room, together with
                  subsequent influences of that death-bed scene of one whom he had learned to love,
                  and who had never failed to trust him, brought into action the strongest elements
                  of virtue he possessed. As he contemplated the family of this dying friend, and
                  thought of the diabolical nature of the plot which the broker had opened to him
                  just as he received the announcement that called him to this scene, his heart had
                  nearly rent his bosom; and his haggard face was contorted in such a manner, that,
                  while the casual observer would mistake
                  it for the struggle of grief, Garvin well knew that a crisis was approaching in
                  the soul of this wretched man.
               The broker understood the situation, and prepared himself to meet the decisions of
                  a perturbed conscience with the force of an unyielding will. Accordingly, when the
                  merchant turned to speak to him in the street, he silenced him with his look, well
                  apprehending the nature of the intended speech.
               But Cringar had been too profoundly affected by the mental conflict through which
                  he had passed to be silenced for any length of time.
               After passing into Fifth Avenue, and by some half-dozen blocks, he suddenly
                  stopped, and turning fiercely upon his tempter, he poured forth a storm of
                  invective; and in the midst of it declared his determination to be done with both
                  him and his diabolical schemes, let come what might.
               During this harangue the face of Daniel Garvin became more agitated than we have
                  yet seen it. His eyes burned with lurid fires, and his upper lip seemed to both
                  turn and shrink back, to reveal in all their glistening array the white fangs
                  beneath it, while the entire expression seemed formed of a devilish grin.
               "You are grateful," he said, in a voice harsh and hissing, but low, after the
                  merchant had come to a stop from exhaustion. "In the first place, you talk too
                  loud, and in the next place you talk like an idiot!"
               "None of your damnable thrusts and cuts! I'll have none of them!" exclaimed
                  Cringar with desperate courage.
               "Cuts! so you have decided to cut me, have you?"
               "Cut you, yes! and may the devils incarnate quarter you too! If you dare push this
                  thing, may the dead curse you!"
               The broker quietly approached a lamp-post that was near by, and taking out a large
                  wallet, opened it and drew forth a piece of paper. He then motioned for the
                  merchant to approach.
               Cringar obeyed, and Garvin held the paper under his eyes, so that the light of the
                  street lamp should fall directly upon it.
               At sight of this paper the merchant paled, and, staggering back, uttered a
                  groan.
               A patrolman who had heard Jonas Cringar's harangue, and drawn near, now
                  apprehended some foul play, and advanced to the spot.
               "It is nothing," said Garvin; "my friend hasn't been rightly used above here, and
                  his excitement has made him unwell."
               "Yes, it is nothing," said the merchant in a faint, broken voice,—"nothing, I
                  assure you."
               The watchman withdrew.
               "Well, what do you say now?" said the broker, as he carefully folded the paper,
                  and replaced it in his pocketbook.
               Cringar remained stunned and silent.
               Garvin said no more, but, taking the unresisting arm of the other, he led him away
                  as one would draw a rudderless craft along the shore.
               That night was a terrific one for Jonas Cringar.
               After parting with Garvin, he went to his store, for he could not go home, and
                  there throughout the long, gloomy hours he could have been seen, now pacing the
                  floor with staggering steps, and now fallen in a chair, the picture of hopeless
                  despair.
               "A forger," he muttered to himself. "Branded as a forger!—no, no!—ah, my God!"
               
               This paper, which we have seen to produce so powerful an effect on the astounded
                  merchant was a note made to the order of one Samuel Townsend, whose name was
                  written across the back as indorser.
               This name was a forgery.
               The forger was Jonas Cringar.
               Speculation the cause.
               And this same speculation has led many another of its votaries to the commission
                  of crime equally heinous.
               But they have not been detected.
               It is the nature of speculation to pervert the channels of business, and corrupt
                  financial character. Men who would repel with abhorrence the temptation to certain
                  acts, before plunging into the Stygian stream of speculation, would, after this
                  plunge, take to them as kindly as the lamb to salt.
               So with Jonas Cringar, who, it will be borne in mind, was continually led on by
                  the Satanic influence of Daniel Garvin. "Kiting," "shoving," and the like, with
                  all their attendant slips, lies, and mortifications, became the order of the day;
                  until, in an evil hour, the merchant, when pressed to desperation through the
                  secret machinations of Garvin, made out a note, and with only a few moments left
                  to save himself at the bank, forged the name of an opulent friend, which name was
                  gold in the market, and "shoved it through," intending to take care of it the next
                  day, "no one being the wiser," said he to himself, "and much good done, and no
                  harm."
               As vain as the sophistry with which one instalment after another of the funds of
                  the Bald Eagle Silver Mining Company had been cast into the abyss!
               An eye was on this desperate merchant.
               Early the following day, Daniel Garvin despatched a trusty messenger to take up
                  this note. It was in the hands of a private banker; and Cringar had requested him
                  to hold it, and keep the transaction strictly private on account of peculiar
                  circumstances which he could not make known; he to take it up within six days,
                  paying two per cent a day.
               The messenger professed to come from Jonas Cringar, and laying down good money for
                  it, the banker delivered it, nothing showing that it was not all right.
               Four days' time had elapsed, and during these four days the merchant had this note
                  constantly in mind; for now that he had done the act,—done it, it is true, without
                  intending crime,—he began to realize the consequences if he should be brought face
                  to face with it before the public eye; and it was the thought of this forged
                  paper, which he supposed still in the hands of the banker, whom in his distracted
                  efforts to save himself he had not seen since negotiating the note, that seized
                  his soul in a yet more relentless grip when he contemplated his utter ruin, as
                  previously described.
               "A forger! Branded as a forger!" exclaimed this victim of another's wiles and his
                  own cupidity; and he wrung his hands in despair.
               The Devil triumphed. Before the streaks of dawn began to appear in the eastern
                  horizon, he was the slave of Daniel Garvin.
               The broker did not hurry down to see Jonas Cringar. He felt too sure of his prey
                  to do this, but instead he occupied his time in laying out the diabolical work,
                  which had for its object the robbery of everything from the widow and orphan
                  children of his patriot brother.
               Among other things he did not fail to call to see the corpse, and offer some words
                  of consolation to the living, and of
                  admiration of the dead. That he was able to do so without exciting suspicion was
                  proof of his mastery of hypocritical arts; for while he uttered these words, his
                  heart beat with an exultation which few could conceal, and his mind was busy with
                  malevolent purposes.
               In due course of time the will was read and entered for probate.
               Through Garvin's influence, Allen Paige, with his accustomed generosity and lack
                  of suspicion, had declared his executors exempt from giving bonds, thus providing
                  one important step for the ruin of his own family.
               Where legal or strict business transactions are concerned, let it be remembered
                  that generosity may so act as to turn the edge of the sword from those who deserve
                  it to those who are innocent, and whom it would be the last to intentionally
                  injure.
               The operations of the schemer now commenced.
               First there came whisperings of complications, and of the revelations of
                  transactions which threatened to change the entire aspect of the affairs of the
                  estate. Isabel Paige would not believe these things; but in times when the
                  reputation for judgment of no merchant seemed to be proof against his dabbling in
                  speculation, when it was no uncommon thing for a man to die reputed to be rich,
                  while really his estate would be found inadequate to meet the liabilities, it was
                  by no means a difficult task for the executors of her late husband's will to
                  impress the public mind with the truth of whatever they might be pleased to
                  assert.
               Although Mrs. Paige paid but little heed to these whisperings, feeling sure, from
                  a knowledge of much of her husband's business (for like a wise man he secured a
                  good wife, and then confided in her), that they had no good foundation dation, yet
                  erelong she began to practically feel the effects of these pretended
                  revelations.
               As executors of Allen Paige's will, it was the duty of Daniel Garvin and his
                  abject slave, Jonas Cringar, to retain all property, real or personal, belonging
                  to the estate, including moneys, until its liabilities should have been fully
                  ascertained. Under these conditions, it is not difficult to conceive of the
                  position into which Mrs. Paige found herself thrown. For a while she was enabled
                  to get along without serious inconvenience, by means of available funds left her
                  by her husband, but erelong she began to feel the band as it was being drawn
                  around her.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               A FEW weeks after the death of Allen Paige, Mrs. Paige and Emma were seated in the
                  library, the one sewing and the other embroidering. At first, after the loved form
                  had been consigned to the grave, no place seemed so utterly lonesome to them as
                  did this library. Here Allen Paige had spent much of his home life, among the
                  books which lined the walls; and the room seemed peculiarly a part of him, the
                  everlasting absence of whom caused the very footfalls to echo through the
                  house.
               But, as day succeeded day, the feeling began to change, and in this room of all
                  others, except, perhaps, the chamber in which he had been so long confined, they
                  came to feel as if he were near unto them. Here, therefore, they would now often
                  come and sit.
               Each seemed busy with her own thoughts.
               
               "Mother," said Emma at length, "I can't help thinking of the Deering family."
               Mrs. Paige looked up with an air of anxious interest.
               "Do you think they are in trouble?" she asked.
               "I cannot keep them off my mind."
               "You know Mrs. Deering sent word by Alice that Joseph had a place, and they
                  shouldn't need any more assistance."
               Emma said "yes," but did not seem satisfied. She continued awhile embroidering and
                  thinking. At length she again spoke:—
               "Mother, I feel anxious about them, and I cannot help it."
               "But, my child, they would send word."
               Emma slowly shook her head.
               "You know, mother, Mr. Stanfield recently died, and it is said he left his
                  business in a bad state."
               "I have heard so."
               As Mrs. Paige uttered this, her countenance assumed an expression of anxiety, as
                  if she were thinking of the reports about her late husband's estate, which Daniel
                  Garvin was so insidiously circulating.
               "And," continued Emma, "supposing they had to discharge employees from the store,
                  and Joseph were one of these, how would they be situated?"
               "Would not Mrs. Deering let us know?"
               "I fear not. You must consider, mother, her pride. She is a soldier's widow; and
                  though she has been compelled, through the forgetfulness of the people her husband
                  fought for, to depend much on charity as if she were a beggar—"
               "Too true!"
               "—it has been hard for her spirit, as we well know. And I believe she would have
                  starved rather than be treated as a beggar, if we had not found her out, and made
                  her feel that she could accept bounty from us, because we were also a soldier's
                  family."
               Emma's cheeks glowed as she spoke.
               "And do you think she will now hesitate to call?" asked Mrs. Paige.
               "I fear it. She sent so decided a message that they could get along comfortably
                  for a good while to come. And you know even with us she has felt much
                  humiliation."
               "She has shown a good spirit, however."
               "Yes, and I know she has felt sincerely grateful. But she has also felt under too
                  great obligations. O, how I do wish there would be a society formed to look after
                  soldiers' families, like the Masons and Odd Fellows, and societies of that
                  kind!"
               "By whom would you have it formed?"
               "By SOLDIERS and SAILORS! those noble men who fought on land and sea for their
                  country!" exclaimed Emma, her eyes beaming with a light as if inspired by her
                  father's presence.
               At this instant William Garvin entered.
               At sight of his beautiful cousin, with her countenance flushed, and her eye
                  beaming with the noble sentiments that moved her, he trembled.
               "Ah!" cried Emma, "here's Cousin William, and he shall be my escort!"
               "Where are you going?" asked Mrs. Paige.
               "To look after the Deerings," answered Emma; "and William must go with me."
               "With the greatest pleasure," responded William, his face flushing with
                  happiness.
               As the reader has probably inferred, this delicate young man, with a temperament
                  of the most exquisite sensibility, loved his beautiful cousin.
               Though they had been together as cousins from early childhood, William Garvin had
                  scarcely entered his teens before he
                  began to look up to Emma as an object of adoration. He secretly worshipped her,
                  and at any time he would have laid down his life for her, as an enthusiast will
                  for his religion. But this love he had never made known. Nothing he dreaded more.
                  It was not associated with ideas of possession; she seemed too far above him for
                  that. But he contemplated her with a sort of rapture, as a being whom he could not
                  conceive of as the wife of any mortal man. When she would speak of her shoemaker
                  or dentist, he wondered how these men could dare profane her by their commonplace
                  touch. He looked upon the brush that brushed her hair, and the combs, and all
                  other articles of her toilet, as favored far beyond such articles used by other
                  women. He was, in truth, jealous of them.
               He had become an artist by profession, and the influence of this profession tended
                  to enhance the sentiments of adoration which held such an all-powerful sway in his
                  soul.
               Emma's desire, therefore, that he should accompany her to look up the Deerings
                  made him the happiest of men.
               "You mustn't be gone long," said Mrs. Paige, "for it is now late. And if you are
                  out after dark in that part of the city, I shall feel anxious, for you know
                  several acts of violence have been recently committed there, almost in broad
                  daylight."
               "Do not fear," answered Emma, "I have William for a protector."
               On uttering this last remark she smiled on her cousin, and went out, he following
                  with a throbbing heart.
               The Deering family had lived in a tenement situated in a court running from Third
                  Avenue, and thither Emma, accompanied by her cousin, directed her steps.
               She found them gone.
               She inquired of women and children about the place where they had moved to; but
                  they did not seem to know.
               At length an old woman of haggish appearance came to the door next to the one in
                  which the Deerings had lived.
               "Git out! away wid ye!" she cried, brushing the dirty children right and left; and
                  then, adjusting her crimped cotton cap, which flared up broadly in front, she
                  called out to the cousins,—
               "Is't the sowldhier's family ye 're looking for?"
               "Yes, their name is Deering," answered Emma, eagerly, at the same time approaching
                  the hag.
               "Yis, by the name of Deering. You're come to help thim, I suppose?"
               "Yes, we fear they are in want; and if you can direct us where to find them, we
                  shall be much obliged to you."
               "Yis, yis, I know ye would, sure. Well, by me sowl! I pithy that poor sowldhier's
                  family, and Margarit Roone is the woman that'll dirict ye to thim without any
                  thanks at all, sure. Holy Mither, protect us! but meself is the woman that would
                  be sthruck dead with pithy for sich as thim, and espishally the little
                  cripple,—Jasus protect her!"
               "If you will tell us," interrupted Emma, getting a little impatient with the old
                  woman's volubility.
               "Ah, throth! an' it's meself that'll do that same. Ye 'll be goin' down to the
                  Avenoo below this, and—"
               "Second Avenue?"
               "Sicond Avenoo is it? Yis, the Sicond Avenoo, so it is. Well, ye 'll be going down
                  to the Sicond Avenoo, an' thin ye 'll be afther kaping your way along up till yez
                  pass Fortieth Strate and along beyond that till yez get up to Forty-sivinth
                  Strate; an' it's down that same strate; it's Margarit Roone that's sure indade.
                  Thin it's meself that must think—" Here
                  the hag commenced rubbing her mottled forehead. "Well, thin, ye 'll find an open
                  space, that ye 'll be after knowing on account of the large excarvations, an'
                  there ye 'll find a small bit of a house, which is afther being not the one ye 'd
                  be wanting; but the next house is a high, slim buildin', wid archways for the
                  winders—ye 'll sure an' know it."
               "And is that the house?" asked Emma, now beginning to fear that the sun would go
                  down before the old woman's tongue would stop its wagging.
               "The same, bless your swate pretty coontenance, me lady! I've talked much, but
                  it's Margarit Roone that would talk much more for the sake of the sowldhier's
                  family."
               William Garvin, who had remained silent up to this time, was vastly pleased with
                  the old woman's compliment of his cousin's face, and from an impulsive desire to
                  increase this admiration he exclaimed,—
               "And this lady is a soldier's daughter?"
               "Holy Mary bless her!" returned the hag, with a grimace, "and thin Margarit Roone
                  is sivenfold rajoiced to send yez on your way."
               On the utterance of this benediction, the cousins departed, and the hag withdrew
                  her frilled cap into the door, at the same time muttering through her broken
                  teeth,—
               "Bad luck to thim! if they hunt till they find the house meself has given thim,
                  it's the widow of Patrick Roone—pace to his blessed sowl!—that hopes much good it
                  may do thim! May purgatory take the sowls of the whole brood of thim!"
               This hag was the widow of one of the rioters of July, 1863, who was killed by the
                  military. The very name of soldier made her gnash her teeth with rage; but she was
                  cunning and did not always show it. In the present instance she gnashed her teeth
                  in secret, and sent her inquirers on a fruitless errand.
               The cousins rode up to Forty-seventh Street as the hag had directed, and then
                  proceeded to search for the house she had described. There being no such house,
                  their search was of course in vain. They went up and down, and up and down, from
                  one street to another, for Emma was of pertinacious temper when aroused, and
                  William was only too happy to have the time extended to the last moment that thus
                  enabled him to act as her protector.
               Relying on the old woman's direction, Emma had not stopped to make inquiries at
                  the court about the condition of the Deering family, or why they had left their
                  former lodgings; but now as she was seeking them in vain, the words of the hag in
                  reference to them, and her own fears, served to impel her on to find them if it
                  were a possible thing, her excited fancy picturing them turned out of the old
                  quarters, and now dying of starvation.
               So, though night was coming on, she still persevered, while her cousin, absorbed
                  in the delight of acting as her protector, forgot the dangers which were likely to
                  attend this delay, in a part of the city where violence was of almost daily
                  occurrence.
               In the mean time let us return to the old hag.
               After retiring into her den, she continued to mutter and gnash her broken teeth,
                  cursing soldiers and Abraham Lincoln,—"the nagur," as she called
                  him,—and wishing that his soul might be in purgatory.
               At length, in the height of her solitary fury, she suddenly gnashed her fangs with
                  such vehemence that one of them broke, and she spit it out with a sound between a
                  hiss and a growl; and bounding from her chair, with her back rounded over, as if projected by a spring, she
                  brandished her bony fist, and with a horrible grin that completely overspread her
                  repulsive visage, she exclaimed,—
               "The fine sowldhier's daughter! its Mammy Roone that 'll furnish yez with the
                  night's lodgings where your marvillous beauty will be appraciated! and where they
                  love the mimory of the sowldhier!"
               Then taking down an old hood and shawl from a nail driven in the wooden partition,
                  she put them on; and with her dried and shrunken lips drawn back from her broken
                  teeth, and her bloodshot eyes glittering with diabolical passion, she opened the
                  door and passed out.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               A HALF-HOUR had elapsed after the departure of the old woman, when a stranger
                  entered the court and looked intently about. The women held their gossip, and the
                  children ceased their noisy play, and, drawing back, gazed up at him with open
                  mouths and wondering eyes, overcome with childish awe.
               The appearance of this man is remarkable.
               His stature is lofty and martial in its bearing. It rises considerably above six
                  feet, and is so finely proportioned that only by comparison is his full height
                  realized.
               His head is large. His face is wide, and at the same time projects forward with
                  aggressive energy. The nose aquiline; the cheek-bone high; the jaw long and
                  massive, extending the chin downwards without detracting from its executive
                  strength; the lips somewhat thick, but closely compressed.
               The eyes are gray; and, combined with a sternness that indicates long habit of
                  command, is a contemplative fixedness, giving an effect of profundity to the
                  expression of an iron will.
               This is enhanced by a remarkable scar, that deeply and widely indents his left
                  cheek-bone.
               His hair is dark and thick, and appears in clustering locks under his small felt
                  hat, which, though of civilian form, has the military bend to it. His beard has
                  the cavalry cut, the mustache and imperial only being worn.
               Imperiousness, severity, high temper, quick passions, magnanimity, and humor can
                  be traced through his physiognomy to his nature; which in earlier years have
                  evidently held independent sway, but have been by a tremendous experience
                  compelled to harmonious action.
               In his massive head, which rounds out from his small hat, with its wide and
                  capacious front, is seen an intellect corresponding with his physical power.
               The forehead is a forehead of plans and strategy, and it is evident that he cannot
                  be easily circumvented. His age is difficult to judge, but he appears to be about
                  fifty.
               All were so busy staring at this man that no one thought of speaking to him,
                  though he had asked twice if the Deerings lived there.
               At length a washwoman, who was evidently American born, came forward, and, looking
                  about on the gaping people, cried out,—
               "Are you all deaf? Do you keep the gentleman standing there with no answer for
                  him? And what is it, sir?" she added, addressing the stranger.
               "I have been told that a family by the name of Deering lives here."
               "The soldier's family."
               
               "The same."
               "They've gone."
               The stranger looked disappointed.
               "Can you tell me where they have moved to?" he asked.
               The woman shook her head.
               A little girl now ventured to come forward.
               "Please, sir, I think I can tell you."
               The stranger bent upon her a look which encouraged her.
               "I heard Mammy Roone tell a gentleman and lady this afternoon that they had moved
                  to a tall, slim house, next to a short one, next to an open place, on
                  Forty-seventh Street."
               "Thank you, my child," said the stranger, taking out a coin and giving her. "And
                  who were the gentleman and lady that came here?"
               "I don't know their names, sir. But the gentleman was small and slim,"—here the
                  child's eyes wandered up and down the gigantic form before her,—"and the lady was
                  very handsome, and I heard the gentleman say the lady was a soldier's
                  daughter."
               The grave countenance of the stranger lit up with interest.
               "A soldier's daughter?"
               "Yes, sir. I heard him say so to Mammy Roone."
               The stranger now turned to go. But just as he had left the court he felt a hand
                  placed on his arm, and a voice said,—
               "I would spake wid ye, sir."
               On looking around he beheld a little Irishwoman, who had a face which, though
                  pitted with the small-pox, was kind.
               There was so much solicitude in her countenance that he bent his head at once.
               "Mammy Roone doesn't mane well by thim that was here this same afthernoon."
               This was uttered in a sort of hoarse whisper.
               The stranger's brow darkened.
               "What mean you?"
               "This sure, sir, an' it's not Mary Connelly that would tell ye an unthruth. It's
                  riskisome, sir, to be tellin' ye what I have on me tongue, but I couldn't slape in
                  peace if I did not tell ye."
               "Well, my good woman, what is it?"
               "Well, thin, I'm nixt neighbor to Mammy Roone, an' afther she had sent the
                  beautiful young soldhier's daughter an' the fine young gintleman away wid a
                  diriction that I don't believe is thrue at all, she carried on in her room like
                  the wicked Satan himself; an' I heard her spittin' fire, an' cry out with a
                  horrible laugh, that she'd secure lodgings for the young lady, where them that
                  knows could appraciate her beauty."
               The expression that took possession of the stranger's features so startled the
                  little woman that her tongue seemed suddenly frozen in her mouth.
               "Well!" he exclaimed, under his breath, "what more?"
               The poor woman now began to tremble before the aspect of this man; but a
                  reassuring look which appeared in the midst of his frown gave her courage
                  again.
               "And thin, you honor, she went away with a slam, an' she's no friend of the
                  soldhier nor the soldhier's family, sir, for it was her old man, Patrick Roone,
                  that was killed in the murdhering riot. An' sure she made the family you'd be
                  afther feel her wicked spite, and a betther family lives not in this blessed
                  city."
               The stranger's military mind grasped the whole plot.
               Placing his hand on the little woman's shoulder, "If it is as we fear," he said, "you shall neither come to
                  harm for informing me, nor go unrewarded!" and then hastened away for that part of
                  the city to which the hag had directed the cousins.
               The little woman gazed after him, at the same time talking to herself.
               "He's a wondherful man," she uttered. "It's meself can tell by his eye. An' he's a
                  soldhier too, if Mary Connelly knows ought of mankind. It was an awful cut he got
                  on his powerful face, sure!"
               She now watched him awhile in silence, her face lit up with a gleam of profound
                  satisfaction.
               Presently she again spoke to herself:—
               "Now, look well to yourselves, ye mane-spirited hirelings of Mammy Roone! If ye
                  dare do harm to her who is the soldhier's daughter, I pithy ye! I pithy ye!"
               And with this she went back into the court.
               It was now dusk.
               
               The sun had disappeared behind the house-tops of the great city, when Emma found
                  herself weary and discouraged, after her long and unavailing search.
               "William," she said at length, "I fear we must give up our search, and leave this
                  poor family, Heaven only knows in what a state of destitution!"
               William was about to answer, when Emma uttered an exclamation, and pointed down
                  the street.
               "It is the old woman," cried William.
               William was not mistaken. Rapidly approaching them with a halting gait was the old
                  hag, who had suddenly appeared in view from an intersecting street.
               When near enough to be heard, she cried out between gasping breaths,—
               "The blissed Virgin be praised! Mammy Roone has found ye at last! It's been a hard
                  thramp for me aged bones; but it's your dear silves that's found, any way! Me sowl
                  was throubled for all of yez; for afther ye had gone from me sight, it's meself
                  that feared I had been wrong in the diriction, an' Margarit Roone wasn't the woman
                  to set back in her aizy-chair, an' think of yez not finding the sowldhier's
                  family,—the family it's Mam Roone that can swear on the blissed Book she 'd cut
                  off this poor bit of a shrivelled hand for! An' ye 're a sowldhier's daughther
                  yourself, me swate young lady—"
               "We have not been able to find the house you directed us to," interrupted Emma,
                  impatiently.
               "Ah, but the blissed Virgin only knows how Mammy Roone,—you see they call me Mammy
                  ginerally,"—here the old woman showed some of her broken teeth,—"an' it's afther
                  sounding a sort of social like—but let me see—as I was about to tell yez, the
                  blissed Virgin only knows how Mammy Roone can rattle with her tongue,—but her
                  heart is right, as the hiven of hivens knows, so hilp me God!—an' I'll prove it to
                  yez same, for hav'n't I hobbled up the long distance to make it certain that ye 'd
                  find the poor unfortunates, Hivin bless thim! for—"
               The hag here wiped her eyes with her dirty shawl, and then exclaimed,—
               "But the good Lord protict us, me sweet lady! it's gettin' dark, an' it's no place
                  for sich as you to be out afther this hour. Come with me, an' it's meself that 'll
                  prisintly show ye the house; for I need not the name of the strate to find
                  it."
               Having spent so much time hunting in vain, Emma could not think of returning home
                  without finally seeing the family, whose sufferings were continually pictured in her excited mind, and whom she now
                  felt certain of meeting in a short time, under the guidance of this old woman,
                  whose worst trait she thought was her volubility.
               As for William Garvin, he was but too happy in yielding to the will of his
                  cousin.
               The hag now led them from street to street, shaking her head as she went, and
                  saying,—
               "It's not near. Ye've wandered far. But it's meself that'll lead ye straight to
                  the house."
               But it now began to grow dark, and the old woman assumed a plaintive voice.
               "Me poor eyes! me poor eyes!—the darkness throubles thim; but niver mind."
               So from street to street she led her victims, every now and then turning away her
                  head, that they might not see the drawing back of her shrivelled lips.
               Objects were rapidly growing indistinct.
               The hag had now led the cousins to a district which, even in that part of the
                  city, was marked as God-forsaken and solitary.
               Emma's heart began to be troubled with an oppressive dread.
               Her cousin's face indicated that he also was not free from oppressive fears.
               They now came to a spot where the very houses seemed more like dens of robbers
                  than abodes of honest people.
               As they entered this precinct, the form of a young man of bold free step appeared
                  from a cross-street several rods behind them.
               He paused in surprise as he beheld the group in the dusk before him, and intently
                  observed them.
               Presently he turned, and looking down the street from which he had just emerged,
                  he whistled softly, and then beckoned with his hand.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               ABOUT the time the stranger was parting from the little woman with the pitted
                  face, two young men left Central Park by one of the eastern gates, and wended
                  their way to East River.
               One of them instantly strikes the attention by his fine athletic form and noble
                  countenance. His full and handsome oval face, with its dark eye, open forehead,
                  freely chiselled nose and mouth, and dimpled chin, captivates even the masculine
                  beholder. There is an air of freedom and boldness about him, which indicates that
                  he has, even at his early age, seen much of the world.
               This bold and handsome young man's name is Prescott Marland. He it was who
                  occupied the wandering thoughts of Allen Paige in his last moments, and the
                  speaking of whom by Emma caused the glance from her enamored cousin.
               He has just come from the West, and is sauntering over the city of New York, with
                  which he has made himself pretty thoroughly acquainted in former years. His
                  present companion is a clerk, who has been for some time in the employ of Jonas
                  Cringar, and who has got off early this afternoon to take a stroll with him
                  through the Park.
               The sun had just set when they arrived at the river; and as the last rays
                  disappeared, the moon, as if by some aerial signal, rose full and clear above the
                  eastern horizon.
               Soon its white rays passed over Long Island, and descended with glistening beauty
                  on the river; the long slim form of
                  Blackwell's Island lying in the midst like some sleeping denizen of the deep.
               Prescott Marland contemplated the beautiful scene before him for a while in
                  silence.
               Presently he exclaimed, as if to himself,—
               "OLD THORBOLT!"
               His companion looked at him in surprise.
               Marland laughed.
               "This moon brings Thorbolt before me," he said.
               "Thorbolt?"
               "Yes, Thorbolt, or Old Thorbolt, as we used to sometimes call him."
               "Who's he?" asked the puzzled clerk.
               "As strong and brave a man as ever wielded sabre."
               "A soldier, then."
               "Yes, a soldier and a VETERAN!" exclaimed Marland, with admiring energy.
               "Come, now, there's a story. Tell it."
               "With all my heart. You see Thorbolt's name was really General Hammond,—General
                  Julius Hammond. He's had a tremendous experience in his day. He went into the war
                  with Mexico when he was sixteen, and gunpowder and steel have been his food ever
                  since. But I tell you what it is, he's no adventurer by any means. He has a mind
                  equal to his body; if he hadn't have had he never would have lived to see this
                  day, in spite of his gigantic strength and heroic courage. He's great for
                  strategy."
               "Well, how did he get his name of Thorbolt?"
               "That's what I'm coming to. In the first place, you must understand that few men
                  could match him either for size or strength. If you were to be cut in two, and
                  your upper half put on top of me, your head would be about on a level with
                  his."
               "A pleasing picture."
               "To be sure," rejoined Marland, laughing. "A sort of half-and-half picture. Well,
                  that gives you an idea of his height. But there's his breadth."
               "Which could be suggested, I suppose, by putting me under a trip-hammer."
               "Exactly."
               "And then roll me up to get an idea of his thickness."
               "Capital. The long roll. That long roll never was able to get more than half
                  through before Old Thorbolt would come striding out of his tent, armed and
                  equipped for the fight."
               "OLD THORBOLT. Now will you please tell me about that, without any more
                  joking?"
               "Certainly. As I was saying, Colonel Hammond—he was colonel then—was a man of
                  gigantic stature, and with a strength which would inevitably break some of our
                  bones, if he should hit us with his clenched fist. The long roll came one night,
                  and pretty soon we had it. The moon was up in the east as full and bright as it is
                  there across the river. Hammond was the first into it. Our column was ordered to
                  his support. It was a grand sight, that fight! The Rebs had advanced up a sort of
                  valley, and when we came in view, there was the Colonel at the head of his column,
                  slashing into them as if they were so many corn-stalks. The moon was shining right
                  down the valley, so we could see everything almost as plain as by daylight. It
                  seemed to make Hammond stand out like some avenging god. A Norwegian—a Major, who
                  had just joined our regiment—was riding by my side; and after watching the Colonel
                  a moment, he asked,—
               "'Who is he?'
               "'Colonel Hammond,' said I.
               
               "He misunderstood.
               "'Hammer!' he exclaimed, 'Hammer! He is Thor's Hammer!'
               "Then, as the Colonel's sabre threw off the gleams of the moonlight, a Rebel
                  seeming to go down at every sweep, he cried out again,—
               "'Thor's Hammer! No, 't is the BOLT of Thor!'
               "'Yes, Thorbolt!' cried another officer. 'That's the name for him!
                  Thunder and lightning! the old Scandinavian God himself couldn't do better!'
               "That's the way he got the name. Sometimes we used to put the 'Old'
                  on, because he was one of that kind. He looks and acts fifty, but he isn't more
                  than forty to-day. I tell you what it is, those kind of men have iron wills,—the
                  kind that get 'Old' stuck on to them early."
               "So that's the way he got his soubriquet?" said the clerk.
               "Yes, and I never see a moonlight like this, that it doesn't remind me of it."
               They now turned, and sauntered down the river.
               "This is as good as a romance," said the clerk, as they walked along. "Tell me
                  more about him."
               "Ah! you ought to see him! It's a tremendous scar he's got on his cheek!"
               "How did that come?"
               "In a fight with a Rebel infantry-man."
               "What, swords?"
               "No. In a charge on Rebel infantry his horse was shot under him. A Rebel private
                  rushed forward to transfix him. But Old Thorbolt was ready for the fellow. He
                  leaped to his feet, and at it they went, sabre and bayonet. Those that saw the
                  duel said it was fine. You see the Rebel was a herculean fellow, and they made the
                  sparks fly like a blacksmith's hammer on red-hot iron. Presently they both fell at
                  the same instant, the Rebel with Thorbolt's sabre through his body, and the
                  Colonel with the Rebel's bayonet driven through his cheek-bone into his
                  mouth."
               "Ugh!" ejaculated the clerk, with a grimace.
               "It was a terrible wound, that's a fact," said Marland, smiling at his companion's
                  contorted face. "But he was more fortunate at another time."
               "I should hope so."
               "He was dismounted, and lay wounded on the ground, when two or three Rebels
                  attacked him at once with the bayonet. But he warded off every one of their
                  dastardly thrusts, until they were finally put to flight by reinforcements."
               "I should think he would keep that sword."
               "He does. It is hanging in his library, with other mementos and trophies, with
                  gaps that you can almost put your finger in, made by his powerful blows against
                  the edges of the bayonets."
               "You speak of his library. Is he a book-man as well as a warrior?"
               "Yes. You know I told you his mind was equal to his body. He has an extensive
                  library, which he uses to as much purpose as he did his halting-grounds."
               "His halting-grounds? What do you mean by that?"
               "Simply this. Whenever the column in which he held command came to a halt, it was
                  his custom, instead of laying back with his eyes shut, to scrutinize the
                  surrounding country, and then start a discussion with other officers as to where a
                  surprise might be attempted by the enemy, and what should be done in case of one.
                  In this way he made himself master of the situation."
               "Good! He must have been as able an officer as he was terrible as a fighter."
               
               "He's one of the first cavalry leaders of the age."
               They now struck an avenue, through which they continued their way.
               Both walked on awhile, thinking.
               "I am greatly interested in this Veteran of yours," at length said the clerk. "It
                  seems to me he must feel a good deal safer in this part of the city at midnight
                  than I should."
               As he said this he began to look about him with suspicious glances.
               Perhaps the sight of the Penitentiary on Blackwell's Island, from which he had
                  just turned, did not inspire him with the calmest of thoughts.
               "Yes," responded Prescott, laughing, and looking around with a mind evidently
                  untouched by solicitude, or such fancies as the nervous are apt to indulge in
                  lonely places, "a man who has been through with what he has is n't much disturbed
                  by such places as these. His California experience, when he was a mere boy, was
                  enough to inure him to New York dangers."
               "Did he see much of life there?"
               "A good deal of it. He was scarcely twenty when he was made sheriff, and any one
                  who lived in California sixteen or eighteen years ago knows what that means."
               "It means a good deal of danger, I suppose," said the clerk, looking about him
                  again.
               "It means pistol-muzzles lining the walls of his hut, like the cells of a hornet's
                  nest, in the daytime, and knives hanging by hairs from the roof, like the
                  stalactites in the Mammoth Cave, in the night-time."
               The clerk laughed aloud, and then, glancing around, lowered his tone, and
                  said,—
               "It must be an enjoyable life."
               "It really was to one of his make. I'll give you one little incident before we
                  part," he added, as they now approached the street where they were to separate.
                  "You will bear in mind that this was in his youth. Yet with all his wildness then,
                  one can see the same traits, only in a crude state, in the reckless sheriff of
                  California which afterwards appeared in such grand form in the Rebellion. In both
                  cases he was always studying his ground, and his mind was restlessly engaged in
                  mastering probable strategic points. But we are nearing the corner, and so for the
                  incident, which is only one of many. You see, while he was sheriff there was a
                  desperado at the mines who had defied all other sheriffs, having killed one of
                  them and wounded another. Julius promised to arrest him. He found him in front of
                  a liquor-shanty. 'I have come to arrest you,' said he. 'All right,' returned the
                  desperado; 'but let's come in and take a drink.' 'Very well.' They went in. The
                  liquor was poured out, and each raised his glass. Julius stood leaning against the
                  counter, with his glass in his left hand and his right hand thrust in his side
                  coat-pocket. Now, you see, this pocket was lined with leather, and so formed as to
                  receive a pistol like a leathern case, directing the muzzle to the front of the
                  coat. There was a pistol all loaded and cocked in this pocket, and Julius held it
                  grasped in his hand so that it covered the desperado's body. The desperado, who
                  also held his glass in his left hand, lowered it for an instant, looked at it, and
                  then raised it again. At the same time he made a movement of his right hand.
                  Julius kept on sipping. The desperado took another look at his glass, and
                  commenced scratching his face close to the ear. But Julius kept on sipping.
                  Suddenly the desperado left off scratching, and, as quick as you can wink, drew a
                  bowie-knife from behind his neck. But
                  while the knife was in the air the pistol in Julius's pocket exploded, and the
                  desperado fell to the ground a dead man."
               The clerk shuddered as Marland finished this short but graphic tale; and as he
                  parted from him the dusk of evening seemed loaded with dismal gloom, while the
                  moonlight that touched the house-tops had something ghastly about it.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               THE nervous and hastening step of the clerk was rapidly bearing him away from a
                  spot which exerted so dismal an influence upon him, when his progress was arrested
                  by the sound of a low whistle. He turned, and saw Marland beckoning to him.
               The reader has already seen this action of Prescott Marland, for he was the young
                  man with the bold free step who appeared as Emma Paige and William Garvin,
                  accompanied by the old hag, entered the forbidding precinct which seemed so fitted
                  for the dens of crime.
               Prescott's manner did not serve to allay the apprehensions which had disturbed the
                  breast of the clerk; but his pride would not permit him to do otherwise than
                  respond to his companion's signal. As he approached Marland, the latter placed his
                  hand to his mouth to enjoin silence, and pointed to the group which had so fixed
                  his attention.
               "Who are they?" asked the clerk.
               "It's more than I can tell you," said Marland. "But if something is n't in the
                  wind, then I'm no judge, that's all."
               At this moment the objects of their scrutiny stopped, and then they heard the
                  voice of the hag, which was raised on a louder key than heretofore, expostulating
                  with her victims, and assuring them that they were near the house they sought.
               "Let's come around on their flank," whispered Prescott, "and find out what all
                  this means."
               "Pshaw!" exclaimed the clerk, in a whisper. "What's the use? We'll only get
                  ourselves into a scrape."
               "Use or no use, I'm bound to see what it all means."
               "Leave that to the police."
               "Come now, Billings (Marland thus addressed the clerk), there's a young lady, who
                  I'll swear, even in this light, is beautiful; and a young fellow with her that Old
                  Thorbolt might use for a cane, if his backbone were stiff enough; and if ever a
                  hag meant mischief, I believe that one does. I'm in for it."
               On the utterance of these last words Marland started off to come around on the
                  group by a side street. The clerk, seeing there was no help for it, followed.
               Let us return to the cousins and Mammy Roone.
               The dread, which the former began to experience before reaching the spot in which
                  Prescott Marland discovered them, now increased to such a degree that they halted,
                  as we have seen; and Emma, casting on the old woman a look of strong suspicion,
                  refused to go any farther in the direction she was leading them.
               As we have also observed, the hag now pitched her voice to a high key.
               "Oche! and is it meself you suspict, me darling? Nay! nay! ye would n't be for
                  thinking so evil of poor Mammy Roone!"
               "I certainly do not like the way you are leading us about," returned Emma, with
                  some severity.
               
               "It does n't look right to me, I must confess," joined in William Garvin.
               "O me honies!" cried the hag in a plaintive voice, "to think that meself, with the
                  good name that I've earned, and labored hard to kape, should come undher such a
                  look as ye jist now cast upon me! Meself, that's hobbled away down to the place
                  we're treading this blessed moment, to be of assistance to ye! Arrah, me swate
                  lady, and me fine young gentleman! ye 'll never suspicion Mammy Roone more when
                  once ye 've turned into yonder strate; for now, bless the name of Jasus! it's
                  meself that recognizes the spot at last that we're seeking."
               As she was uttering the last portion of this characteristic speech, the old woman
                  had suddenly taken a step, and extended her body forward, while her face lit up
                  with an expression of joyful intelligence.
               "Come! come!" she exclaimed, seizing Emma by the sleeve. "Ye 'll be glad to see
                  the sowldhier's family at last!"
               The cousins now moved reluctantly forward.
               On their right was a dark, lonesome-looking alley. As they passed this alley
                  William Garvin held his breath; for he observed the dim forms of three men, and he
                  was sure these men were watching them.
               Catching his cousin by the opposite sleeve to that which the old woman had
                  grasped, he whispered,—
               "Let us go back, in Heaven's name! This old woman is leading us—"
               He was interrupted by a movement of Emma, who, on turning as he began whispering
                  to her, started back, and uttered a slight cry.
               William followed the direction of her frightened glance, and also started back;
                  for he now beheld the three dim forms issuing from the alley, and approaching them
                  with a sinister air of mischief.
               The old woman did not appear at first to observe them. When Emma started back and
                  uttered the cry, she broke forth with,—
               "Arrah, me darlint! but your nerves are not sthrong. Indade it is that as old as
                  is Mammy Roone, she's not to be frightened by the dark looks of the strate—"
               Her eyes now fell on the three figures that were approaching. Stretching her head
                  forward, she placed her hand above her eyes, and peered through the dusk upon
                  them.
               "Me sight is dim," she uttered in a hoarse whisper, "but I like not the looks of
                  thim that's coming this way."
               Then, suddenly retreating, she gave vent to a suppressed shriek, and with the cry,
                  "The Holy One be wid us!" she hobbled off, moaning and ejaculating in the most
                  dismal tones of fear and alarm.
               As for Emma, she stood trembling, not knowing which way to move; while William
                  Garvin, who might have hastened away under other circumstances, now placed himself
                  between his cousin and the three sinister-looking men, whose intentions could not
                  be mistaken.
               As the slight form of this devoted lover stands erect and defiant, the spirit
                  inspired with a courage which knows nothing but that the beloved object is in
                  danger, one instinctively longs to see it expand into the proportions of a giant
                  that shall be commensurate to this courage.
               As it is, however, a laugh issues from one of the three ruffians, and he
                  exclaims,—
               "Stand where you are a minnit, my fine chick, an' I'll pen a description of ye for
                  the newspapers."
               The other ruffians responded to this speech with a hoarse laugh.
               
               William Garvin's face changed from pale to red, and then grew pale again. He was
                  in a desperate situation. The scoundrels whom he confronted were evidently
                  accustomed to rough business. The one who addressed him was a burly, powerful
                  fellow, who seemed strong enough to break his delicate form across his knee; while
                  his companions, though not his equals in strength, had an aspect quite as
                  ferocious; and either seemed strong enough to fling this delicate, yet devoted
                  protector with a single hand from one side of the street to the other.
               When within a pace or two of the cousins these three ruffians stopped for a
                  moment, and contemplated them with a leer.
               "Now, my Hercules, what's the use of making a disturbance in this 'ere peaceable
                  neighborhood?"
               "Ha! ha! ha!" hoarsely again responded the other two.
               "We're peaceable citizens, we are; and seein' this 'ere female being carried off
                  by such a ruffian as you be, an' no mistake (another hoarse laugh), we're bound to
                  do our duty, an' rescue the same."
               With these words he advanced.
               Emma had now recovered herself, and her native spirit came to her aid.
               Stepping forward, she confronted this leading ruffian with a look such as
                  compelled him to halt in his tracks.
               "Villain!" she exclaimed, "leave us and go your way!"
               There was silence for a moment.
               Then one of the rear scoundrels cried out,—
               "O blinkers! ain't she a pictur, though!"
               "Ha, ha, ha! Dick 's afeared of her!" responded the other. "I say, On to the
                  rescue! save her from the young reprobate!"
               With this the last speaker pushed forward, and grasped Emma by the arm.
               William, who up to this moment could not entirely realize that any living man,
                  however degraded, would dare profane the object of his adoration with the hand of
                  violence, was by this act wrought to the pitch of frenzy. With a loud cry he
                  sprang upon the wretch who had grasped his cousin.
               The attack was so sudden and unexpected that the object of it fell back in
                  momentary confusion. But the leader, whom they called Dick, catching the frenzied
                  assailant in his powerful arms, threw him violently upon the ground, where he lay
                  stunned and immovable; then crying out, "No more tomfoolery! let us be off!" he
                  seized Emma around the waist.
               Emma uttered a shriek that penetrated far into the approaching night.
               Prescott Marland and the clerk were just entering the street below when they heard
                  this shriek.
               They hastened forward and beheld Emma struggling in the arms of the leading
                  ruffian, while the others were making an effort to gag her.
               "By Heavens!" exclaimed Prescott, "we are just in time for that crowd!" and he
                  bounded up the street.
               The clerk was for a moment staggered; but though his former fancies had been
                  generated by the gloom through a nervous organization, and in an imaginative mind,
                  yet now that the reality was before him, his naturally courageous nature quickly
                  prepared itself to meet the conflict. Closing his lips, and clenching his hands,
                  he followed his companion with nerves drawn taut like so many springs.
               As he sped on his way he caught a glimpse of an old woman, whom he judged to be
                  the one he had seen with the cousins,
                  peering around the opposite corner upon the struggling group.
               "By Jove!" exclaimed the clerk to himself, as the athletic form of Prescott
                  Marland went bounding on before him; "if he don't give 'em a taste of his
                  gymnastics then I'll give in!"
               In the mean time Marland rapidly approached the scene of outrage with long leaps;
                  and it seemed as if several yards yet intervened, when with one tremendous bound
                  he planted a blow on the side of the head of the ruffian Dick that caused him to
                  drop his intended victim, and stagger half stunned against a doorway, near which
                  the struggle was taking place. Then, drawing Emma back, he extended his clenched
                  hand which had just struck so powerful a blow, and cried out,—
               "Scoundrels! take yourselves off, or I 'll teach you a lesson that'll make you
                  behave yourselves in future!"
               With a curse the stricken ruffian, who had now recovered himself, sprang forward,
                  and, foaming with rage, yelled in a hoarse voice,—
               "Who dares strike Dick Smasher? D—n him! I'll see to his life insurance!"
               With this he aimed a fearful blow at the head of the young athlete.
               But though encumbered as he was by Emma, whom he supported on his left arm,
                  Prescott skilfully caught the blow, and at the same time, by a dexterous stroke of
                  his foot, sent his burly but too impetuous assailant sprawling on the ground.
               The other two ruffians, who had shrunk back from Prescott's first onset, now, from
                  both shame and rage, made a rush towards him.
               But the clerk had now arrived. As we have said, his nerves, as he followed his
                  companion, were toughened like so many springs. When, therefore, he reached the
                  scene of conflict, just as these two scoundrels were about attacking Prescott, his
                  body was launched upon one of them as if shot from an engine, and in the next
                  instant the fellow was staggering to and fro with the clerk's hand tightly clasped
                  about his windpipe.
               The third ruffian succeeded in planting a blow on Marland's cheek, and, having a
                  ring on his finger, he brought blood. Then, standing back, he drew a knife.
               Stung by this blow, and perceiving that the moment had come for the use of all his
                  resources, Prescott relaxed his hold of Emma, and, throwing all his power into his
                  left arm, he delivered such a blow under the ear of his new assailant that he was
                  knocked clean from his feet, and fell far backward across the body of William
                  Garvin, as insensible as he on whom he had fallen, while his knife, which he had
                  had no time to use, rattled upon the opposite sidewalk.
               As he now turned on the again-recovered Dick Smasher,—as this herculean
                  shoulder-hitter grimly called himself,—the staggering ruffian, whose windpipe was
                  compressed under the tightening fingers of the brave and nervous clerk, fell
                  gasping beneath his assailant, who still continued to tighten his grasp.
               On seeing his two accomplices down, the leader backed a few paces, and looked
                  anxiously around.
               "Curse it!" he muttered. "This fellow's seen the elephant, and no mistake. Hang me
                  if I would n't like the Doctor's lancet!"
               On the utterance of this sanguinary wish, he glanced at the insensible form of the
                  man whom Prescott's left arm had just laid out, and whose soubriquet
                  was evidently "The Doctor."
               
               But in the next moment he seemed ashamed of his cowardly wish; for, with a sound
                  half-way between a pshaw and a hiss, he advanced to meet Marland's
                  attack.
               The latter delivered a tremendous blow; but the object of it had been taught by
                  his former experience that, if he had any pugilistic skill, he must use it. Making
                  his best effort, therefore, he succeeded in partially parrying the blow, and at
                  the same time attempted a counter. This fell with some effect on his opponent;
                  but, in return, he received a stroke that sent him once more staggering back in
                  confusion.
               At the same moment, the ruffian, under the unrelaxing clutch of the clerk, sank
                  into insensibility.
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               EMMA had witnessed the scene—which had been enacted quicker than I have been able
                  to write it—in a sort of stupor. The appearance of the ruffians, the cruel
                  treatment of her devoted cousin, the seizure of herself, the arrival of Prescott
                  Marland and the clerk, and the subsequent struggle,—all had rushed into these few
                  moments in such a manner as to stupefy her without causing her to faint. But now,
                  as she beheld the huge form of Dick Smasher again fall back before the power of
                  Prescott's arm, and then saw the clerk rise from the immovable ruffian whom he had
                  throttled, she experienced a reaction, and clasped her hands with an emotion of
                  hopeful gratitude; and as Prescott advanced to follow up his last blow, she
                  instinctively started forward also, as if she would lend to her preserver the
                  assistance of her own brave spirit.
               At this instant she heard a yell, and on looking down the street she beheld two
                  more burly figures rapidly approaching the spot. She started back, and for the
                  first time gave utterance to a moan.
               "Oh, will not help come?" she murmured.
               At the same moment a hooded old head was quickly thrust beyond the corner whence
                  these men had issued, followed by a shrivelled clenched hand, from which fell back
                  the tattered fringe of an old plaid shawl. They remained only for an instant, and
                  then were as quickly withdrawn.
               When Prescott discovered the approach of these lawless reinforcements, his
                  attention was diverted. Dick Smasher took advantage of this diversion, and,
                  rushing in, he seized him in his powerful arms, at the same time crying to one of
                  the fresh confederates,—
               "Take the girl, and cheese it!"
               The other ruffian in the mean time had drawn a pistol, and, levelling it on the
                  clerk, pulled the trigger.
               It missed fire, and with a curse he hurled it at the clerk's head, who was just in
                  time to dodge it, and then prepared to close on him.
               But the clerk was not prepared to meet him by force, for his encounter with his
                  throttled victim had left his nerves somewhat unstrung by the reaction; so,
                  stepping back and thrusting his hand into his bosom, he exclaimed,—
               "Beware!"
               The ruffian, who was a coward, feared a deadly weapon and held back.
               While this was going on, a fierce struggle was taking place between Dick Smasher
                  and Prescott Marland.
               The villain, whom the leader had ordered to seize Emma, had hastened to obey, and clasped this beautiful
                  girl in his brutal arms.
               She now gave vent to loud shrieks, and struggled desperately. But the ruffian held
                  her in a strong grasp, and bore her rapidly down the street, using his best
                  efforts to smother her cries.
               As Emma's first shriek pierced the air, William Garvin stirred, as if this shriek
                  from his cousin penetrated ears insensible to all other sounds. Then, as cry
                  succeeded cry, his eyes opened, and he raised his head and the upper portion of
                  his body, and, sustaining himself feebly by his elbow, he looked around.
               The first thing that met his gaze was the prostrate form of the ruffian, who had
                  been knocked insensible by Marland, lying across his own body. Then he saw the
                  forms of Prescott and Dick Smasher still engaged in a fierce struggle. But his
                  eyes passed quickly to the receding figure of the ruffian, who bore his cousin in
                  his foul grasp.
               As he beheld the one whom he so much adored thus being dragged away to a terrible
                  fate, his orbs threatened to tear themselves from their sockets, his countenance
                  assumed an aspect of ghastly horror, and he gave vent to a loud groan.
               "O God! O God!" was all that burst from his lips. His soul was overwhelmed.
               But even that short, ejaculatory prayer from a soul so crushed seemed to have been
                  heard; for scarcely had it passed his lips when he saw a tall, gigantic form,
                  which seemed to his distorted vision to loom nearly to the housetops, enter the
                  street just below the spot where, for a moment, the ruffian was compelled to halt
                  by the struggles of his beautiful victim.
               He beheld in the dim light this form advance upon the ruffian with fearful
                  strides, and, seizing him by the arms, unclasp his hold of his cousin, and,
                  lifting him in the air, hurl him sheer beyond the corner whence appeared the head
                  and hand of the hooded hag.
               This was followed by a hoarse shriek of alarm, which seemed to issue from an aged
                  female voice, and then all was silent.
               William now, with unutterable emotions of joy, saw his beloved cousin taken under
                  the protection of her titanic deliverer.
               This man of such terrible strength, who had arrived at a moment so opportune, is
                  recognized by the reader as the stranger who had been sent this way by the little
                  woman with the pitted face.
               Having taken Emma under his protection, he advanced toward the scene of a still
                  fierce struggle between Prescott and Smasher.
               "I beg you to leave me," William now heard his cousin exclaim, "and hasten to aid
                  that brave young man, who needs you so much!"
               Even in the midst of this fearful scene, poor William experienced the pangs of an
                  indefinable jealousy.
               The stranger, seeing that Emma was for the present safe, advanced with a long,
                  quick stride, and, laying hold of Dick Smasher with his right hand, he tore him
                  from Marland as a man would tear a weed from the ground, and, shaking him
                  violently, exclaimed,—
               "Scoundrel! What means this outrage?"
               He was interrupted by the entrance upon the scene of a policeman, who had been
                  attracted to the spot by Emma's shrieks.
               The ruffian, whom the clerk had so cunningly kept at bay, now cleared the spot at
                  a bound, and sped away at a rapid pace.
               
               His leader, with a curse, took advantage of a moment's relaxation in the hold of
                  the stranger, who turned toward Emma as the confederate fled past her, and with a
                  desperate effort tore himself free, and followed this confederate, evidently the
                  worse for the severe handling he had received from the athletic Marland.
               With the departure of his cowardly assailant, the clerk now had time to look at
                  the colossal stranger, who had so opportunely come to the rescue.
               "By Jove!" he exclaimed to himself, as his first glance ran up and down the
                  majestic figure before him; "there's power enough for a score of these
                  fellows!"
               His eye now fell on the scar, and his voice became audible as he again
                  exclaimed,—
               "Old Thorbolt—or the—!"
               He was interrupted by Prescott. In his excitement this spirited champion had not
                  entirely withdrawn his eye from his late antagonist; but as his ears were greeted
                  by the audible voice of the clerk, he turned his gaze on the stranger. Starting
                  forward, he caught his hand, and cried,—
               "By heavens! General Hammond!"
               "What! Marland!" responded the stranger.
               "Yes, Prescott Marland, and no one else, General.—Well, this is a
                  meeting!" exclaimed Prescott, in a tone of delighted astonishment.
               They were here interrupted by the patrolman.
               "What's the trouble?" he asked.
               "This young lady, with that young gentleman, was led here by a miserable hag, and
                  then attacked by these scoundrels," answered Prescott.
               The patrolman gave a signal for aid, and then turned his attention to the two
                  ruffians who had been lying insensible sensible. William Garvin had revived
                  sufficiently to work himself clear of the one that lay across him, who by his
                  movements had been stirred into signs of returning life.
               Emma and William were preparing to express their gratitude for the timely succor
                  which had preserved the former from the terrible snare that the old hag had laid
                  for her, when the recognition took place between General Hammond, or "Thorbolt"
                  (we will also call him the Veteran), and Prescott Marland, as we have
                  described.
               Their attention had been chiefly drawn to the stranger, whose majestic presence,
                  combined with the marvellous display of power which had appeared in his treatment
                  of strong and desperate ruffians, served to inspire in their breasts a sentiment
                  in which awe mingled with gratitude. But when the name of Prescott Marland was
                  uttered, the eyes of both were turned upon him.
               The emotions of these two cousins at this moment it would be difficult to
                  analyze.
               Emma's instincts at once told her that the object of her father's friendship and
                  praise and this handsome young man of heroic strength and courage could be none
                  other than one and the same person. The ideal which had gradually and almost
                  unconsciously formed itself in her bosom and the real that now stood before her
                  were one also. A secret delight took possession of her heart, and a crimson blush
                  suffused her rounded cheek.
               Her cousin's emotions were more conflicting.
               Though insensible during Prescott's heroic display, he apprehended the truth; and
                  that gratitude he was on the point of expressing was at once disturbed by a pang
                  which only such a soul, for so many years absorbed in the adoration of the object
                  of its love, could experience.
               
               He, poor fellow, when he would have protected her, had been thrown to the earth
                  like a child. But this young man had saved her. Humiliation, therefore, mingled
                  with this pang.
               Emma was the first to recover herself, and, without waiting for formalities, she
                  advanced and expressed her thanks in such a manner as to thrill the heart of her
                  young preserver with pleasure.
               William, whose fate it seemed to be to experience jealous emotions on the
                  utterance of Prescott Marland's name, on occasions when, to his sensitive and
                  morbid conscience, such emotions were not less than criminal, now, internally
                  accusing himself, approached the group, and joined his expressions with those of
                  his cousin. After warm words of gratitude, he said, turning to Prescott,—
               "Did I not understand you to say your name was Prescott Marland."
               "You did."
               Emma again blushed. Her heart beat quickly, for she perceived that her cousin was
                  doing what she herself would like to have done, but could not.
               "Were you acquainted with an officer in the army named Allen Paige?"
               Prescott's fine countenance lit up with pleasing memory.
               "I knew him well. We were in the same hospital, and we came to own everything that
                  was sent us in common. Yes, I knew him well, and learned to love him, too," he
                  added with feeling.
               Emma's countenance flushed with pleasure; then the blood receded somewhat from her
                  cheeks, and her eyes became suffused with tears.
               Prescott observed her emotion. With an impulse he took her hand, and
                  exclaimed,—
               "Can it be possible that this is his daughter, of whom he so loved to speak?"
               "It is his daughter Emma," interposed William.
               As Prescott looked into her beautiful yet tearful eyes, with an ardor borrowed
                  from his remembrance of one whom he had held in such deep regard, he suddenly
                  experienced a thrill which caused him to drop the hand he had taken, while he felt
                  the blood mantling either cheek.
               William, whose whole soul was poured into his eyes, received the impression of
                  this scene, even in that dim light, as the sensitive plate of the photographer
                  receives the impressions of nature.
               As Emma was the first to recover herself when both she and William were thrown
                  into confusion by the utterance of Prescott Marland's name, so now she first
                  regained sufficient self-control to break the spell which had been so subtly and
                  unexpectedly cast upon them.
               She turned to the Veteran.
               Prescott understood her. He inwardly rebuked himself—for what he scarcely knew. At
                  the instant he seized her hand her tears had told him that the fearful wound
                  Colonel Paige had received in the same series of battles in which he had received
                  his own last wound (for he had been wounded more than once) had proved fatal; and
                  yet, in the place of the consolation it was on his lips to utter, he realized that
                  he had been overcome by an emotion which his conscience pronounced selfish.
               He did not then know that the tender emotions and sympathies of grief oftentimes
                  act as the swiftest conductors for the subtle magnetism of love.
               "General," he said, while he still felt the blood tingling his cheeks, "this is,
                  as you have just now heard, the daughter of my friend, Colonel Paige."
               
               The Veteran took her hand, and gazed down upon her with a grave and benignant
                  air.
               "Miss Paige," he said, "aside from the satisfaction it gives me to see you
                  relieved from these lawless men, it is tenfold gratifying to know that we have
                  rendered a service to the child of a patriot and a comrade,—especially the child
                  of one whose patriotic devotion has left her an orphan."
               The reader has undoubtedly recognized in the Veteran the stranger who so silently
                  entered and departed from the chamber of the heaven-crowned patriot.
               The manner of this man, who had so recently displayed such marvellous power,
                  together with his words which he uttered with profound feeling, brought the tears
                  again to Emma's eyes.
               A second patrolman appeared now in response to the signal of the first; and the
                  Veteran, offering his arm to Emma, led the way from the street, followed by
                  Prescott, William, and the clerk.
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               AS they left the recent scene of lawless violence, the rescuers and rescued became
                  more thoroughly introduced to each other.
               "Billings," said Marland, with a half-laugh, "I did n't expect that you would so
                  soon have visual evidence of the truth of what I was telling you a little while
                  ago."
               The clerk looked at the Veteran.
               "No," he said; and then he muttered to himself,—
               "Thorbolt,—Thorbolt,—a very appropriate name, I'm sure. He made them bolt,
                  anyhow."
               This, however, was not muttered so low as to escape the quick ear and apprehension
                  of the Veteran, who glanced upon Prescott with a smile.
               "Still at it, I see," he said.
               "Well, who knows," returned Prescott, "if I had not chanced to have been romancing
                  to my companion here, I might not have seen Miss Paige and her cousin as I
                  did."
               He then related how he had seen them in company with the old woman, of his
                  immediate suspicions and consequent action in conjunction with the clerk.
               "Who was this old woman?" asked the Veteran. "It must have been her scream I heard
                  when I threw the fellow whom I first took hold of."
               "She called herself Margaret Roone," answered Emma.
               "And Mammy Roone," interposed William Garvin, "which I think much more
                  appropriate."
               The young lover was gratified by the glance of approval from the Veteran, on whose
                  arm he beheld his cousin rest with sentiments of pride.
               Emma now proceeded to give an account of their adventures up to the moment that
                  Dick Smasher and his confederates attempted to carry out Mammy Roone's diabolical
                  plot.
               "Oh!" she exclaimed, as she finished, "what will become of the poor family whom I
                  have sought so long in vain?" and this noble girl seemed at once to forget all the
                  perils and violence through which she had just passed, as the picture of the
                  destitute family of whom she had been speaking came before her mind.
               "General," said Prescott Marland, gravely, "of all places New York is the one for
                  an organization which has been recently formed in the West."
               
               The Veteran gave Prescott a significant look. Then, excusing himself a moment, he
                  relinquished Emma's arm, and taking his friend aside, he conversed with him in a
                  low voice.
               Then, returning, he again took Emma's arm, and said:—
               "It gratifies me to know that not only is Mr. Marland a comrade, as one of the
                  army who fought for freedom, but he is also a comrade in an association, to which,
                  of all the million soldiers who have returned from the battle-ground of the
                  Rebellion, there is not one of good standing who should not unite himself."
               "Ay! his duty to his country and to his brother soldier is not entirely fulfilled
                  until he does!" responded Prescott.
               "What is the name of this association?" asked the clerk.
               "THE GRAND ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC."
               "What!" exclaimed Emma, moved by the impressive tone with which the Veteran
                  uttered this name, "is it possible that a political organization can excite such
                  sentiments?"
               "The Veteran and Prescott exchanged glances.
               "A political organization?" repeated the former.
               "Yes," continued Emma, "I heard a gentleman but a few days since, speaking of an
                  organization, called The Grand Army of the Republic, as a political
                  organization."
               Daniel Garvin was this gentleman.
               The countenance of the Veteran grew stern, and his eye for an instant seemed to
                  range over the vast Union. Emma beheld this expression, and wondered.
               "Did the gentleman fight for the Union?" he at length inquired.
               "He did not."
               "Did he aid the Union cause in any way?"
               "I regret to say he did not."
               "Did he not aid the foes of his country?" again asked the Veteran, looking down at
                  Emma with an expression that caused her to shrink.
               Emma did not answer for her cousin's sake; she did not wish to give utterance to
                  her suspicions, and what she had heard others say, in his presence.
               "I read your answer, Miss Paige. It is not necessary for you to speak. Even as
                  during the war the enemies of our country South and North blasphemed the name of
                  Heaven, and calumniated the name of him whom we now call the Martyred President,
                  so do they now distil their poison, by which they would hope to destroy an
                  organization upon which the sainted Lincoln, if he could now speak to us, would
                  pour the blessings of his great and loving heart! Yes, I will prophesy that, as
                  the Grand Army of the Republic sweeps over the land, those who will scoff at it,
                  who will denounce it as a political organization, who will use all manner of means
                  to oppose it,—these men shall be found to have been openly or secretly engaged in
                  the inexpiable crime of this atrocious Rebellion!"
               The Veteran spoke with such vehemence, and in a manner so impressive, that his
                  auditors did not venture to break the silence, when he for a moment ceased.
               He continued:—
               "My dear young lady, I know well I speak to one who, when this organization shall
                  have become established in your city, will be among the foremost women to aid it
                  with your work and influence. Women—may the God in heaven bless them!—stood by the
                  soldiers through the war, and they will stand by them in their noble work, now
                  that we are in the midst of peace. If you find this Grand Army of the Republic to
                  be devoted to the welfare of the widows
                  and orphans of the patriot dead, and of disabled soldiers and sailors yet living,
                  will you not give it your countenance?"
               "Nothing would make me happier," responded Emma, with tears in her eyes.
               "I knew it," uttered the Veteran, while he contemplated this noble girl with grave
                  and tender interest. "No other answer could have come from the daughter of one who
                  in his last moments inspired me with a yet deeper veneration for those heroes who,
                  as civilians, left all and encountered the horrors of war for the sake of the
                  Union."
               Emma looked up with questioning wonderment, and William Garvin was equally
                  amazed.
               Said the Veteran, gently:—
               "I entered the chamber of your sainted father at the moment he was about ascending
                  to the arms of his comrades who had gone before him. I simply came and went. You
                  did not see me."
               As he uttered these last words he remembered the forbidding face of Daniel Garvin,
                  that alone had been turned upon him in that chamber, and a look of severity
                  crossed his features. In the next instant this face was associated in his mind
                  with the person who had declared to Emma that the Grand Army of the Republic was a
                  political organization.
               Emma, on her part, when she thus heard, for the first time, of the presence of
                  this remarkable man at the deathbed of her father, experienced a profound emotion,
                  in which awe was indefinably mingled, as if, in that solemn hour, Heaven had woven
                  in his future with the future of her own family.
               The Veteran returned to the subject of the Grand Army.
               "Your answer, I repeat, is worthy of that father. And now know that it is the
                  spirit of this organization to seek out the widow and orphans of the soldier, as
                  you have sought them to-day. This is a sublime duty to which it binds itself, and
                  to which it will never be found recreant."
               "Ah!" exclaimed Emma, with joy. "Then was my wish granted before I had uttered
                  it."
               "Did you wish for such an association?"
               "It was this very afternoon I uttered the wish."
               "Then is it granted."
               "And then am I happy!" responded Emma. "And so it has nothing to do with politics,
                  after all?"
               "Nothing. To dabble in politics would be simply suicidal. There are men who
                  believe we are thus foolish, because they are deceived in regard to our object;
                  but, in the main, this report is the invention of those who, having expressed a
                  hope that every soldier who fought for the Union might find a grave in the
                  Southern swamps, now display the same malignant spirit in their efforts to injure
                  the efficiency of organized effort to relieve the families whose husbands and
                  fathers found that grave."
               The clerk, who did not lack in penetration of human character, had listened to the
                  Veteran with profound respect.
               "General," he said, "I have myself been prejudiced against this organization by
                  statements to the effect that it was controlled by political demagogues and the
                  like; but you have removed those prejudices. To hear you is to believe."
               "I thank you," returned the Veteran, with a grave smile. "But allow me to add," he
                  said, his smile giving way to an expression of deep determination, "that there are
                  serious abuses in the treatment of the men who fought to put down the Rebellion, which demand and will receive
                  our attention."
               "General," said the clerk, while a look of apprehension crossed his features, "I
                  would like to ask you one question, if you will permit me."
               "Certainly."
               "Do you think because a man is a Democrat that he is necessarily wanting in
                  devotion to the soldier, and all that appertains to the objects for which the
                  Grand Army of the Republic was formed?"
               "By no means, sir. Some of the most zealous members of our organization West are
                  Democrats. Some of the strongest friends of the soldier that I have known are also
                  Democrats. I recall to mind a Democrat living in my native city, Boston, who is a
                  great favorite of the soldiers. They have no better friend. His purse is open to
                  them at all times. He makes no display of his charity, but widows and orphans of
                  our fallen comrades bless him."
               "Pray who is this generous Democrat?" asked Emma.
               The Veteran gave utterance to a pleased laugh.
               "He might even now hear me, and blush, if I should speak his whole name aloud, so
                  I'll beg you to rest satisfied with the familiar appellation, used by his friends,
                  UNCLE NAT."
               "I am gratified by your answer to my question, General," said the clerk. "To tell
                  you the truth, my own father, whom I deeply respect, is a Democrat, and he also
                  is, and always has been, a strong friend of the soldier. I asked you the question,
                  because you know many think that if a man is a Democrat he must necessarily be
                  opposed to the soldier."
               "Far from it. In the workings of our organization we allow no invidious
                  distinctions. Any man who is a true friend of the Constitution and the Union is
                  sure to be a friend of the soldier, and is so recognized, it matters not by what
                  political creed he is known."
               "And how is it with the nationalities?" again asked the clerk.
               "The same. No distinctions are for a moment entertained. All worthy soldiers who
                  fought for the Union are welcomed to our ranks as comrades and brothers."
               "What do they think of the Irish?"
               The clerk uttered this with significant emphasis.
               "The Irish?" returned the Veteran, with rather a stern glance on the clerk. "I
                  have studied that nation with attention, and will answer you in my own way. This
                  war saw no braver men. Some of the very best of my own command were Irish. The
                  true Irishman is a natural patriot. The Irishman who abetted the Rebellion was
                  false to his nationality. In the two women with whom we have had to do this
                  afternoon we have examples of the two classes. The old woman who led Miss Emma
                  into such danger because she was a soldier's daughter represents a falsehood; the
                  little woman who warned me of the other's infamous plot represents the truth. The
                  possibilities of a race are seen in its representative men. Ireland has furnished
                  such men in numbers sufficient for a dozen nationalities. The Wild
                  Irishman is a negative evidence of the possibilities of his race. The greater the
                  capacity for wildness the greater the capacity for civilization. And it would seem
                  as if the Almighty had reserved the Celtic race as grafting-stock, with its
                  extraordinary capacity, for the complete civilization of the world. The Irish
                  stand among the greatest men in the history of England, and to-day Irish blood
                  runs in the veins of some of the most enlightened and progressive men of America.
                  And it is in view of these things that
                  those who are to influence the future of the Irish of this country should realize
                  their solemn responsibility, and see to it that the peasantry, who compose the
                  great mass of this foreign element, be educated to a proper conception of the
                  genius of our institutions. It is the true Celtic character that the Grand Army of
                  the Republic respect, and would see developed from one end of the Union to the
                  other.
               "General!" exclaimed Prescott Marland, with earnestness, "as a member of the Grand
                  Army, I thank you for those words. It is the wish of every man who truly loves his
                  country to see fully developed the innate national character of this vast element
                  of our population."
               "Very good!" responded the clerk. "But," he added, with a facetious laugh, "how do
                  you account for the Irish bulls?"
               "'T is their mother wit in confusion," said Prescott.
               "Their swift imagination, which underlies their wit, trips their unschooled
                  tongue," rejoined the Veteran.
               The conversation was here interrupted by an approaching car, which the cousins
                  entered, accompanied by the Veteran and Prescott Marland, the clerk here parting
                  company to return home in another direction.
               The Veteran and Prescott parted with the cousins at East 27th Street; the former
                  responding to a warm invitation to visit the home of their departed comrade, Allen
                  Paige, by promising to do so at the earliest opportunity, at the same time also
                  promising Emma that she should hear more of the Grand Army and its beneficent
                  purposes.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               ON the third floor of an old building in the rear of the Bowery, and but little
                  more than a stone's-throw from Cooper Institute, Emma might have found the objects
                  of her anxious search, had she been properly directed. They had been driven hither
                  by the raising of the rent of their former lodgings, which, through the
                  machinations of Mammy Roone, was put exorbitantly high for a place so
                  wretched.
               The walls of the apartment into which the reader is introduced are cracked and
                  stained, and the rough worn floor bears signs of equal hard usage and neglect; but
                  it is evident that neatness and order are doing their utmost to relieve the room
                  of its unsightly aspect.
               Yet this neatness and order only serve to increase the pity of the beholder; for
                  he realizes that the occupants have seen better times, and that this destitution
                  is in gloomy contrast to former comfort.
               Joseph Deering had gone out in the —nth New York, and had never returned. He fell
                  in the terrible Peninsular campaign. Though able to comfortably support his family
                  by his daily labor, yet when his faithful hands could no more aid them, they
                  immediately began to experience the pressure of want.
               The condition of Mrs. Deering's health, who had been more or less ill for several
                  years, enhanced the misfortune of her husband's death.
               Her family consisted of a boy, Joseph, one girl eight years old, named Mary, and a
                  little crippled one, a girl also, whose
                  name was Etta, six years old. This unfortunate little girl was injured by a horse
                  and chaise, which ran over her the year before.
               Joseph, who was fourteen years of age, had managed to do something for the support
                  of the family; but in these times of high prices it seemed but a single drop.
               It is on the same afternoon the incidents narrated in the preceding chapters
                  occurred that we look in upon this family of the soldier, doomed to an incessant
                  struggle with privation.
               The mother is seated in an old straight-backed rocking-chair, an heirloom of her
                  family, which she can never part with, and contemplates her two little girls with
                  a sorrow she can scarcely control.
               The picture which thus awakens her grief is the sight of Mary endeavoring to
                  soothe the little cripple, who is suffering from hunger.
               "Joseph will bring you something, my poor little sister," said Mary, with a simple
                  faith that sent a new pang to her mother's heart.
               At this moment the door opened and Joseph came in.
               Mrs. Deering looked at him, but did not speak.
               The boy went up to her, and, kissing her on the forehead, said,—
               "I haven't done as well as I expected to, mother, but we won't despair."
               "No, no, my son, we'll not despair."
               "It would be ungrateful to God, you know, dear mother."
               "Yes, ungrateful to God."
               "So, dear mother, we'll take courage."
               As Joseph said this he put his arm around his mother's neck and again kissed
                  her.
               She could no longer contain herself, but gave vent to her emotions in tears.
               The boy remained silent, while the look of a matured man overspread his
                  features.
               At length she grew calmer, and Joseph said,—
               "Mother, we ought to go to Mrs. Paige."
               Mrs. Deering was silent.
               "Because," continued Joseph, "if we trust truly in God, we will be reasonable, and
                  not be proud."
               "Yes, Joseph."
               As the mother thus responded she experienced contending emotions. Pride, and the
                  thought of rumors that had come to her ears of the lamentable state in which Mr.
                  Paige had left his affairs, impelled her to the one side, and the hunger of her
                  little ones impelled her to the other.
               The latter influence at length triumphed, and she said,—
               "It is well, my son."
               As she uttered these few words she seemed for a moment to forget her sorrows in
                  the contemplation of her devoted son.
               And well may she thus contemplate this noble boy. He is worthy to be called the
                  son of the soldier who had leaped to the defence of the old flag when it was first
                  trampled underfoot by Rebels. He is never in despair, but in the darkest hours his
                  spirit seems to rise in a never-failing trust in Heaven.
               We have seen him just now sustaining his mother, and uttering sentiments that
                  would seem natural to one twice his years. Thus it always was with him, and the
                  other children had come to look upon him as a protector.
               This family is but a type of families throughout the land,—families of soldiers
                  who died for their country; and they have
                  been left to struggle with want, enduring their sufferings in silence rather than
                  seem to come before the world as beggars.
               These families, who had given to the Union their husbands and fathers, were being
                  rapidly buried in the oblivion of public selfishness. The promise made to these
                  patriots when they left for the war, that their wives and children should find
                  protectors in a preserved and grateful people, if they should fall, was passing
                  into the dusty archives of history.
               Then appeared a protecting arm,—the arm of the GRAND ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC.
               This arm was formed by COMRADES.
               The civilian, though individually generous in heart, is apt to forget: the
                  soldier, never.
               The soldier reminds: the civilian responds.
               The Deerings had found in the Paiges benevolent friends. Mrs. Deering, like many
                  another fallen soldier's widow, had found it hard to meet the position into which
                  the death of her husband had thrown her,—the position which demanded that she make
                  known her need and destitution, and be compelled to come before the world as an
                  object of charity.
               For they who could justly command the gratitude of the preserved republic were
                  fast coming to be treated as if, unfortunate victims of misalliances, they had
                  been left to the mercies of a cold world by the death or desertion of criminal
                  husbands.
               Thus it happened that soldiers' families starved all over the land for which those
                  soldiers had sacrificed their lives,—starved rather than yield to the demands
                  which they felt to be a violation of the memory of their husbands and fathers.
               But Allen Paige's family was a soldier's family, and they knew well how to soften
                  the edge of charitable giving by throwing over it the sentiment of duty which one
                  comrade owed another.
               Yet still this kindness Mrs. Deering had felt should not be imposed upon;
                  therefore had she often lived in want, rather than seem to presume; until Allen
                  Paige would, perhaps, in the midst of his own pain, turn to his wife or Emma and
                  say,—
               "I fear Mrs. Deering may be suffering. Won't you send down and see?"
               Alice, who loved to go on these errands, usually went; and on her reporting the
                  state of the case, the suffering family would instantly be relieved.
               For some little time, up to within a few days of the opening of this chapter,
                  Joseph had been in the position of errand-boy in the store of Mr. Stanfield, a
                  kind merchant. He, however, had recently died, and left his business in so
                  confused and dubious a condition, that several employees had to be discharged, and
                  among these was Joseph. While he held this situation they managed to get on quite
                  comfortably; and when, some two weeks before Mr. Paige's death, Alice made her
                  last benevolent call, she was assured by Mrs. Deering that they should probably
                  need no further assistance.
               Since the death of Mr. Paige Mrs. Deering's reluctance to trouble them with her
                  wants had, from the combined causes known to the reader, increased to such an
                  extent, that it is doubtful whether she would have appealed to their charity for
                  herself before she had experienced yet far greater destitution; but the sight of
                  her children suffering from hunger caused her to yield to the pleading of her
                  boy.
               
               Having, as we have seen, prevailed with his mother, Joseph received her kiss and
                  blessing, and, putting on his cap, went out.
               As soon as he had departed Mary came up to her mother, and laid her head in her
                  lap, while the little one looked up and cried,—
               "I'm glad Joseph is going to get something to eat. I'm hungry, dear mamma!"
               Joseph hastened on his errand, each step seeming to bring food to the mouths of
                  his mother and little sisters.
               Mrs. Paige received him with great kindness. It was more than kindness, for her
                  eyes filled with tears as she contemplated this noble boy, whom her husband
                  thought much of on account of his devotion to his mother.
               She questioned him closely about their situation, at the same time telling him of
                  the departure of Emma and William to seek them.
               Through all Joseph's efforts to brighten the gloom of their poverty she saw the
                  truth; and it was then that she gave way to an inward dread, as she thought of her
                  executors and her late husband's estate.
               Her own inconveniences, the result of Daniel Garvin's schemes, had not sufficed to
                  excite that dread; but the contemplation of this poor family's destitution, who
                  had depended so much on their benevolence, for the first time aroused her mind to
                  a vague conception of her possible future.
               She left Joseph alone in the drawing-room while she repaired to the pantry.
               As he sat in this room he gazed around on the walls, and thought of the wealth
                  which could buy all these fine paintings and engravings; and then he looked at the
                  bronze and marble groups which adorned the room, then on the carved furniture, and
                  a sigh unconsciously escaped him.
               "They are all very happy," he thought. "To be sure, Mr. Paige is dead; but it is
                  n't like father's being dead."
               Then he thought of his poor mother and little sisters, and sighed again.
               It was very still, with the exception of the rumbling of teams outside; and his
                  imagination, which was naturally active, began to picture the enjoyments of this
                  wealthy family, in whose drawing-room he was now sitting.
               "They can buy whatever they want," he ruminated. "They are not cold, for they can
                  buy warm clothes and have fires."
               Here he fixed his eyes on the ornamented register, which was already sending out
                  the heat to warm the chilly air of late autumn. "Ah, yes, they can be very happy
                  here"; and Joseph fell to musing on the blessing of riches.
               He was interrupted by the entrance of Mrs. Paige, with a basket filled with bread,
                  meat, crackers, and the like, in one hand, and a basket of fruit in the other.
               Just then a visitor was announced, and Daniel Garvin was ushered in.
               At sight of this man Joseph shrank back. He remembered his face to be the cruel,
                  forbidding face which was in the carriage that ran over his little sister
                  Mary.
               Joseph remembered aright. It was the face of the broker that he then saw.
               Garvin's horse was high-spirited and given to rearing. This little child was
                  playing in the street, and the horse coming upon her, Garvin shouted to her to get
                  out of the way. She was so intently engaged with her play that she neither saw nor
                  heard. The horse reared, and then shied
                  to one side, but not far enough to save the child from the wheels, which passed
                  over her, and made her a cripple for life.
               What Joseph remembered was the harsh and unfeeling expression of Garvin's face,
                  and the way in which he drove on, without stopping to see what harm he had
                  done.
               He had never again seen him until this instant; and now as he looked at him he
                  shrank back.
               But he also experienced the same feeling of stern indignation with which he looked
                  after him on that day.
               The broker beheld the shrinking, yet stern and indignant boy with displeasure, and
                  a frown gathered on his sinister brow.
               Mrs. Paige saw this frown, but did not divine its meaning, though she observed the
                  boy's manner.
               Neither did Joseph, who had good reason to see it.
               The boy thought it was because he, being so ill-dressed, was found in this rich
                  and beautiful drawing-room; for he did not know how he had looked at the
                  broker.
               But Daniel Garvin scowled because he had come in to see how his schemes worked,
                  and he had been unexpectedly met by Joseph's stern, indignant gaze, which seemed
                  to pierce his soul.
               "Who is this boy?" he said harshly.
               Mrs. Paige turned toward the broker with a look of surprise. Her face slightly
                  flushed, and her form was instinctively erected.
               Her voice, however, was calm.
               "He is the son of a soldier who was killed in the war."
               "Ah!"
               Now this "ah!" was short, but uttered as it was, and accompanied by a supercilious
                  glance, first at Joseph, then at Mrs. Paige, and then on the baskets, it possessed
                  a deep significance. Mrs. Paige now assumed an air which had its effect; for no
                  man could behave like a boor in Margaret Paige's presence, and not be made to feel
                  her rebuke.
               "Yes," he added in a manner considerably modulated, and yet so artfully graduated
                  that it would seem to be the result of his own thoughts,—"yes, yes, the son of a
                  fallen soldier. Well, yes; you're a good boy, I hope?"
               Joseph made no answer to this patronizing question; but beginning to feel very
                  awkward in that fine room, with the broker's sinister eyes running up and down his
                  patched clothing, he looked to the floor and blushed painfully.
               Mrs. Paige came to his rescue.
               "Yes, I can speak for him, Mr. Garvin, as being one of the best of boys."
               Saying which she took him kindly by the hand to lead him out.
               "By no means," exclaimed the broker, on seeing her movement. "I have only dropped
                  in for an instant, and my time is up."
               He looked at his watch, and with the ejaculation, "So late!" he bowed himself out,
                  evidently not desirous of lengthening his visit for that time.
               Both Mrs. Paige and the boy breathed more freely when this man had freed them of
                  his ill-boding presence.
               Joseph began to stammer out apologies for having intruded himself.
               "Do not let your mind be troubled, my dear boy," said his benefactress. "But why
                  did you look at him so when he came in?"
               Joseph glanced down on his old clothes at this question.
               Mrs. Paige read his thoughts.
               "You looked at him as if you had seen him before," she added.
               
               "Never but once," replied Joseph, as his face began to gather the same expression
                  which it assumed when the broker came in.
               Mrs. Paige saw there was something to be explained, and she drew from Joseph his
                  story.
               Having finished his story, so full of significance to her who had already herself
                  begun to feel the malevolence of this man, she gave him the baskets, and an order
                  on the wood and coal dealer, and sent him home to cheer those who were anxiously
                  awaiting him.
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               SEVERAL weeks have passed. Mrs. Paige has been made to feel more and more the
                  cordon that is being drawn around her. For a while after his visit, when he met
                  Joseph in the drawing-room, Daniel Garvin had deemed it advisable to reassume his
                  plausible and hypocritical manner; but as he watched the final development of his
                  plans his fangs again began to show themselves.
               At length the time arrived when she felt that her mind must fully prepare itself
                  for whatever might happen.
               As a first step she determined to ascertain, if possible, the intentions of her
                  executors. She therefore wrote to Jonas Cringar.
               This was the note:—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 JONAS CRINGAR, ESQ.
                              
                           
                           DEAR SIR,—Will you be so kind as to call and see me this evening. I
                              confess to feeling much anxiety regarding the settlement of Mr.
                              Paige's estate. Besides your own expressed fears, I have heard many
                              rumors of a nature calculated to have long ago alarmed me, if I had
                              not been sustained by a very strong confidence in the business
                              character of my dear husband. But even this confidence will not
                              suffice to sustain me without some more definite statement of affairs,
                              as things now appear.
                           I write you because I have learned to esteem you as Allen's
                              long-trusted partner and friend, and can consult with you with greater
                              freedom than I can with Mr. Garvin.
                           Trusting you will grant my request, I remain
                           
                              Yours, very truly,
                              ISABEL PAIGE.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               When Jonas Cringar received this note his face was agitated by conflicting
                  emotions. He read it over two or three times, as if first his eyes read it, then
                  his mind, then his conscience.
               Finally he crumpled it in his nervous fingers, resting his hand on his knee, and
                  gazed before him in a sort of stupor.
               Presently he heaved a sigh and exclaimed,—
               "My God!"
               Without saying more, he took his hat and went out, the clerks gazing after him
                  with looks which said,—
               "His conscience troubles him."
               That evening Mrs. Paige sat in the drawing-room, anxiously awaiting the
                  merchant.
               As she sat there she contemplated the paintings, statuary, and carved furniture,
                  which had thrown Joseph into such a deep revery, and sighed.
               In the midst of this revery the door-bell rang, and Jonas Cringar was ushered
                  in.
               As he entered the door he glanced around the room where he had spent so many hours
                  with his late partner, and his conscience smote him with such violence that for a
                  moment he did not move, and he visibly trembled.
               Mrs. Paige observed his emotion; but though she partly interpreted it, she did not dream of the hidden
                  anguish of this unhappy man, nor of the fearful struggle which was incessantly
                  going on within him.
               She advanced to meet him.
               "I thank you for coming," she said. "I am now anxious to hear all that you know or
                  think about the condition of the estate."
               The merchant continued to hold her hand in his embarrassment, but could not at
                  once find words to answer her. But at length his tongue was loosened a little, and
                  with a halting speech he said,—
               "Mrs. Paige, I really thank you for reposing confidence in me. I—really shall be
                  happy to tell you all I know or think."
               Poor slave! It was the last thing he intended to do.
               He being seated, Mrs. Paige at once entered into the business for which she had
                  sent for him.
               "Mr. Cringar, there have been many reports that have come to my ears, as you well
                  know, some of them very injurious to my departed husband's reputation; but these I
                  cannot afford to notice, only as they affect the hearts and feelings of those who
                  hold his memory dear, and who are jealous of his good name. It is to you that I
                  must look for the information that is to govern our future actions."
               Cringar, during this speech, had been exerting himself, with all the mental
                  strength he possessed, to acquire the firmness necessary to carry him through the
                  coming ordeal; and Mrs. Paige had not been unobservant of the varying expression
                  of his countenance.
               "My dear Mrs. Paige," he said, "you must prepare your mind for the worst."
               "I have."
               "I am rejoiced to hear it."
               "You have the worst to tell me?"
               "Yes."
               Cringar now hesitated, and looked from the ceiling, where he had cast his eyes
                  when he had begun to speak, down to the floor; for he was not yet able to look the
                  intended victim of his wickedness in the face.
               "You will oblige me by at once telling me the whole," uttered Mrs. Paige, with
                  anxious severity.
               This compelled the merchant to turn his eyes upon her, but they instantly turned
                  off again.
               "You must give up the idea of indulging in acts of benevolence, my dear madam,
                  even toward soldiers' families."
               "Mr. Cringar, I have not requested you to come to give me such advice as this.
                  Tell me the truth as regards my husband's business, and I will judge what I can
                  give to others."
               Jonas Cringar, now driven to a corner, broke out with desperation,—
               "Well, then—all is lost!"
               Mrs. Paige turned pale, but retained her composure.
               "All?"
               "Yes!—all!—everything!"
               "It is impossible!"
               "Ah, madam! I knew you would say so!" exclaimed the merchant, in a voice in which
                  sympathetic distress and remorse were strangely mingled.
               "And have I not reason to say so?" asked this wronged woman, who, though inwardly
                  agitated, fixed a penetrating gaze upon the guilty merchant.
               He quailed before this gaze.
               But now he felt that all his resources must be brought to bear, or he should have
                  to answer for bad work to Daniel Garvin.
               
               That natural obliquity of character, which has been intimated as belonging to him
                  now came into play and gave him what might be called (if we may be allowed a
                  rather uncouth figure) a second mental wind.
               Having thus gathered strength, he for the first time was able to look his
                  interlocutor fairly in the face.
               "You certainly have reason to think so, dear madam; but Mr. Garvin
                  and myself can submit statements to you which will convince you that all I say is
                  true."
               "May I ask what those statements are?"
               "Certainly; and I will say that they seem to be supported by the most conclusive
                  evidence."
               "Well."
               "Some of them are claims of a most unexpected nature; while others have to do with
                  transactions which, while I very deeply lamented them at the time, yet I have kept
                  silent about them, hoping something would turn up to mitigate their evils."
               "Well."
               "Well, then, Mr. Paige, like too many victims of the fever which has prevailed in
                  business circles for the past few years, has, it seems, risked everything in
                  speculation, and in every instance very unfortunately."
               Jonas Cringar stopped a moment, but the intended victim of his abominable
                  falsehoods remained silent.
               Gathering strength by working either knee in those nervous, bony hands, he
                  continued:—
               "You see, my dear Mrs. Paige, this speculative fever seized many a man as honest
                  and upright as my late partner. Character did not come into the question at all.
                  It had no more to do with a man's reputation than typhoid fever, or typhus fever,
                  or any other fever."
               The merchant now extended one of his hands, as if about to deliver a lecture on
                  the morality and immorality of speculation.
               Mrs. Paige interrupted him.
               "Mr. Cringar," she said, "I do not need that you should defend Mr. Paige's
                  character to me. I will thank you—"
               "Well, then,—well, then,—you see there have been very bad complications in our own
                  business on account of it. Drawing from one's legitimate business so incessantly
                  to allay this terrible fever, it brings things to a fearful pass, madam. You see
                  there it was,—his losing so many thousands in his cotton speculation, it was a bad
                  beginning."
               "Mr. Cringar," uttered Margaret Paige, in a subdued but steady voice, "you speak
                  to me in riddles."
               "I suppose so; it must seem so, my dear madam," returned Cringar, whom the reader
                  will readily perceive to be devoid of all necessary qualifications for such an
                  interview as this which he had undertaken. "It's a riddle to all of us,—the way in
                  which what seemed an ample fortune has vanished. It seems like a dream, madam, and
                  if I'm a little incoherent, ascribe it to the difficulty I experience in trying to
                  make known to you facts which I know must astound you and make you miserable."
               "This cotton, Mr. Cringar," said the soldier's widow, in whom now a feeling of
                  contempt was mingling with her apprehensions, "I am aware that Mr. Paige once had
                  a transaction in cotton; but he informed me that he had made much money by it, and
                  he was not accustomed to utter an untruth."
               "Ah, madam, it isn't for me, who loved him like a brother, to cast any aspersions
                  upon the character of my late partner, or throw doubts on his integrity. But the
                  fact of it is, madam, he undoubtedly supposed when he told you that he had cleared
                  a profit on that cotton, that he had
                  really done so. The market was rising very rapidly, and he was n't the only man
                  who counted on profits before his time. But he was so unfortunate as to hold on
                  too long, though I kept advising him to let it go; and the result was a heavy
                  loss."
               "He never told me of this, Mr. Cringar."
               "It is one of the unfortunate features of speculation, my dear madam," spoke this
                  abject tool, who was beginning to find his tongue,—"one of the unfortunate
                  features of speculation, that even the noblest and most open-hearted men will be
                  so shamed by their losses, they dare not say anything about them to others, often
                  feeling the most reluctant to make them known to those who really have the
                  greatest claims on their confidence. In fact, now that you speak of it, Mrs.
                  Paige, I recall to mind," continued the merchant, lifting his right hand half-way
                  to his lips, with the long forefinger extended, and at the same time bent like a
                  claw,—"yes, I recall to mind very distinctly his saying to me once, when I was
                  urging him to sell out, even at a small loss rather than suffer a greater one,
                  'Jonas,'—for he always spoke to me familiarly,—'Jonas, I have told my wife that I
                  am good for a large profit on this cotton, and I intend to stick,'—excuse me,
                  madam; that's a phrase sometimes used in speculation, and I wish to quote his
                  exact language,—'I intend to stick till the market takes another jump.'"
               At this moment Emma came in from the street, accompanied by Alice, and opened the
                  door of the drawing-room, when, perceiving her mother and Jonas Cringar alone, and
                  comprehending at a glance somewhat the nature of the business between them, she
                  made a move to retire. But Mrs. Paige requested her to enter.
               This action on the part of the mother was the result of a sudden inspiration.
               She had not been deceived by the apparent candor of the merchant, clothed though
                  it was by such verbosity 
                     as as
                     as
                   he had displayed. She had by no means a superficial knowledge of human
                  nature; she had closely observed Jonas Cringar while he so desperately labored to
                  acquit himself properly in the business he had undertaken, and apprehended that
                  some powerful influence had been exerted to subdue the natural impulses which she
                  was certain his heart felt toward the family of his late partner. She therefore,
                  on seeing Emma and Alice, instantly formed a resolve to re-enforce these
                  impulses.
               "Emma," she said, "will you and Alice please sing that duet which Mr. Cringar
                  loved so much to hear when he came to see your father."
               Emma was surprised by this request, for it was the first time her mother had
                  desired them to sing since their father's death.
               As for the merchant, he already began to experience those reactionary emotions on
                  which Mrs. Paige had calculated. He was silent, however.
               Emma went up to the piano with Alice, and opening it for the first time for many
                  weeks, turned and said, while she looked inquiringly toward the merchant,—
               "Mr. Cringar loved to hear more than one duet?"
               The merchant said nothing in answer to this remark, but his face betrayed the
                  internal struggle of his soul.
               "Your German song, Stille Nacht," said Mrs.
                  Paige.
               This beautiful trio, sung as a duet by the sisters, so well calculated both to
                  touch and soothe the spirit in its varied moods and to awake in the soul the
                  tenderest reminiscences, began at once to produce a remarkable effect on the
                  already agitated countenance of Jonas Cringar. The German words had formerly been
                  interpreted to him, so that he understood
                  their meaning, while they lent to the song a sweetness which no translation could
                  have done.
               Emma and Alice had not sung this song since their father died, and though their
                  tones were firm when they began, thoughts of this beloved father soon caused their
                  voices to tremble, and the exertion they were compelled to make to master their
                  emotions served but to enhance the profoundly touching effect of the music.
               This, added to the natural character of the song, seemed to bring the merchant
                  into the very presence of the departed soldier, and with an audible groan he
                  buried his face in his hands.
               Mrs. Paige now rose, and, advancing, placed her hand on his shoulder.
               At this instant the bell sounded through the house with a loud, harsh ring.
               As his ears were greeted by this ominous sound, Jonas Cringar suddenly lifted his
                  head, clasped the arm of the chair with his quivering hand, and gazed at the door
                  with a face so distorted with fear, that Emma and Alice, who had turned when the
                  bell rang, stopped in the last measures of the song, startled and alarmed by his
                  extraordinary aspect; while the mother seemed to divine the cause of this
                  agitation, to which her own heart to a degree responded.
               In another moment the thick and ursine form of Daniel Garvin presented itself at
                  the threshold.
               "I trust I do not intrude," he said in a rasping voice, at the same time sending a
                  terrific glance at the blanching merchant.
               The ladies made no answer, but Jonas Cringar muttered in a scarcely audible
                  voice,—
               "You're entirely welcome."
               "I thought so," returned the broker, coming forward and making a formal bow to all
                  in the room at once, while his upper lip drew back so as to expose his threatening
                  teeth.
               Then taking a chair he turned to Mrs. Paige and said:—
               "I was at Mr. Cringar's store a short time since, and, though I did not find him
                  there, I found your note requesting him to meet you here this evening, on business
                  concerning the estate of your late husband. And notwithstanding you intimated,
                  madam, that it might not be so agreeable a task for me to perform as for him, I at
                  once decided that you should not be left half enlightened from any lack of zeal on
                  my part, and therefore I am here, at your service, madam."
               The closing words of this speech, "at you service, madam," were uttered in a tone
                  in which the hidden sarcasm of it culminated, being also accompanied by a slight
                  bow.
               Mrs. Paige heard him through with a firm, steady look; while Jonas Cringar, having
                  cast his eyes on the speaker when he commenced, withdrew them and riveted them to
                  the carpet with a look of distress on Garvin's informing the widow of his finding
                  the note. He immediately cursed himself for his carelessness.
               The broker waited a moment, while he changed his glance from Mrs. Paige to the
                  daughters, who still remained at the piano, and then to the merchant.
               Then he asked in a harsh, cutting voice,—
               "Is the business finished? or is this music only serving you as an interlude?"
               We have before seen that Cringar was not without spirit; and the overbearing
                  manner of the broker toward this
                  family, for whom he really had so high a regard, and who, through his villanous
                  schemes, were now on the brink of ruin, served to rouse him for an instant from
                  his lethargic fears.
               He leaned forward in his chair, and fixed on Garvin a look of indignant
                  rebuke.
               "The music," he answered, "was an act of attention to one who has spent many happy
                  hours in this house."
               The only answer the broker vouchsafed to this was a gleam of his malevolent eye,
                  and an apparently unconscious movement of his hand to the pocket from which he had
                  taken the damning paper on the night of Allen Paige's death.
               The merchant turned pale, and again sank helplessly back.
               Mrs. Paige now spoke.
               "Mr. Garvin, Mr. Cringar had barely commenced detailing the condition in what he
                  is pleased to affirm my late husband's business was in when he left me. What he
                  has already told me I must say to you as I have said to him, that it is
                  impossible."
               "What have you told her?" demanded Garvin, sharply, fixing his ringed orb on the
                  once more cowering eye of the merchant.
               "The cotton," was Cringar's simple answer.
               "Well, what of it?" returned the broker, while a frown began to darken his
                  features.
               "Simply this," said Mrs. Paige, "that what he has told me about Mr. Paige's cotton
                  transaction is entirely contradictory to my husband's own statements, and is to me
                  incredible."
               Garvin's features now began to gather that expression which we have beheld at the
                  crises of his interviews with the merchant. On beholding these signs of an
                  approaching scene, Cringar closed his eyes and shuddered.
               Having darkened his direful visage with the gloomy clouds of the coming storm, the
                  broker prepared to let loose the thunder.
               "Madam!" he exclaimed, in his harshest and most penetrating accents, "we have
                  found our work sufficiently ungrateful, without the addition of your own
                  ingratitude. Your husband, madam, appears to have been a rash and reckless man;
                  and when he appointed his partner and myself as executors of his estate, he seems
                  to have calculated on our friendship to conceal his folly."
               Mrs. Paige now made a motion as if she would interrupt; but Garvin extended his
                  right hand, and cried,—
               "You must hear me, madam!"
               She remained silent.
               "Now, madam, I will at once to business. You may believe my statements or not, but
                  let me assure you your belief does n't affect the result. We 've not taken oath to
                  act according to your belief, but according to law. Know then that Mr. Allen
                  Paige's accounts show up a loss of some twenty thousand dollars in cotton, losses
                  amounting to over seventy-five thousand dollars in mining and oil, and thousands
                  with Mr. Cringar himself in cotton goods, and also from complications in their
                  business, resulting from his speculative mania. Is this not so, Mr. Cringar?"
               The merchant did not seem to hear this question.
               The broker bent his lurid eyes upon him, and repeated it in a voice that would
                  seem to penetrate to the merchant's marrow.
               "Jonas Cringar, is this not so?"
               The wretched man looked up like a defenceless animal wounded by a beast of prey,
                  and said in a faint voice,—
               
               "It is all too true! too true!"
               "And now, madam," continued Garvin, rising from his chair, "it is my duty to
                  inform you, without further delay, that you can no longer support this costly
                  house, for it is not yours. It must be sold to pay the debts of the estate, and
                  that immediately. And let me tell you, as a sort of guardian,"—the broker could
                  not keep entirely back the appearance of a sardonic grin as he said this,—"that
                  you must either live on the charity of others, or seek some means of support with
                  your daughters here,"—he turned his satanic visage on Emma and Alice,—"who, I am
                  happy to see, look hearty and strong."
               Mrs. Paige had risen at the last of this heartless speech, and stood, overwhelmed
                  with conflicting emotions, supporting herself at the table. She was moved by
                  profound indignation, not unmingled with disgust; but at the same time her soul
                  sickened with the conviction that the man before her held the power to make real
                  all that, in his words, threatened her and her family. She stood gazing on this
                  diabolical destroyer of her peace, while her various emotions displayed themselves
                  on her countenance, but she could find no words.
               Daniel Garvin enjoyed for a space the distressed confusion of this unhappy widow
                  of his patriotic half-brother, and then, drawing back his upper lip, he said,—
               "Mrs. Paige, I would add—"
               Ere he could say more Emma stepped forward to her mother's rescue.
               Her beautiful face was flushed, and her clear hazel eyes were lit by an
                  indignation so deep and strong that even Daniel Garvin could not meet their gaze
                  unmoved. As she thus stood before him, with her form erect, and her head thrown
                  back, she recalled to the mind of this unnatural ural uncle her father, when his
                  generous and impulsive spirit would be stirred by passion. As this recollection
                  thus crossed his mind, he experienced a secret smiting of his conscience, which
                  mingled with emotions of dark and brooding triumph.
               "Sir!" exclaimed this noble daughter, in a voice corresponding with her looks,
                  "you have said you came here on business. That business is for the present
                  finished. Whatever of truth or falsehood there may be in your statements, my
                  mother can hear no more. We would be alone."
               "Certainly, my dear," returned Garvin; and, taking his hat, he withdrew, followed
                  by Jonas Cringar.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               A FEW days after the interview between Mrs. Paige and the merchant and broker,
                  Emma sat meditating in her room. She thought of Cringar and her uncle, and a
                  shudder went through her frame. A woful future loomed before her vision. She
                  thought, too, of her mother, who had just risen from an illness brought on by the
                  revelation, in all its fulness, of the atrocious plot which the previous
                  whisperings and rumors had presaged, and her eyes were wet with tears. The events
                  of the past few days had proved too much for even her brave and elastic nature.
                  Her cheeks had paled, and a shade of blue appeared under her hazel eyes, which
                  gave signs of anxiety and weeping.
               In her sorrow, however, there were two figures which continually came to her mind;
                  these were the figures of the Veteran and Prescott Marland. The former rose
                     before fore her as a power which was
                  indefinably mingled with her future. When the image of her father came to her
                  mind, this majestic form ever seemed to accompany it. She could not think of one
                  without recalling the other.
               But from the Veteran she invariably passed to another, who was also associated in
                  her mind with her father. This association was, however, of a more tender
                  character. When she thought of him, the blood slightly flushed the pale cheeks,
                  and the saddened eye kindled with the heart's involuntary emotions.
               She would continually recall to her mind the look which appeared in his eyes, when
                  he took her by the hand after his brave contest with the ruffians who had
                  assaulted her. The look was only for an instant, but it was none the less to be
                  remembered. It was one of those impressions that pass beyond the retina of the
                  eye, beyond the brain, to be ineffaceably fixed within the heart itself, where it
                  remains forever.
               Her own soul had responded to the thrill which was experienced by Prescott when he
                  held her hand, and which was simultaneous with the look so vividly impressed upon
                  her heart. But scarcely would she acknowledge it to herself.
               It is a charming feature of virgin love, that the maiden who experiences its first
                  throbs not only shrinks from the thought that it may be perceived by the world,
                  but she will even shut out her own common self from the scrutiny; and while the
                  budding sentiment is nursed in the most secret and the tenderest depths of the
                  heart, she closes the eye of introspection just enough to lend a delicate
                  fascination to what it beholds; like one who, gazing at the dawn, gently closes
                  the lid that its glory may be seen through the lashes, and acquire a dreamlike
                  charm and beauty.
               It was from this maidenly by-play, probably, that the Veteran was generally first
                  allowed to assume definite shape in her mind. It would seem as if he was kept in
                  the foreground, that her own mind might rest satisfied that the heart was not
                  playing false; while in reality the object held in the distance was continually
                  drawing the mind away, lit up in an entrancing haze by the rays of the golden
                  sunlight.
               As Emma sat in her room on the day we have mentioned, she had, as we have said,
                  been thinking of those things which filled her heart with apprehension and
                  grief.
               At length her thoughts began to dwell on the Veteran and Prescott Marland. Neither
                  had as yet responded to her invitation to visit the home of their comrade, her own
                  sainted father. They had promised to do so, and she could not readily believe the
                  promise would be broken.
               Yet, after weeks had passed, and one day succeeded another with no word from
                  either, a fear began to steal into her mind that their adieus, made when they
                  parted on the evening they had so 
                     strangley
                     strangely
                   met, might, perchance, be the last.
               While in the midst of these thoughts she heard a knock at the door.
               "Come in," she said.
               The maid entered, bearing a card on which was written the name of Prescott
                  Marland.
               This name, announcing the presence, below, of one of whom she was at that moment
                  so earnestly thinking, caused the telltale blood to mount to her cheeks.
               "Tell him," she said in some confusion, "that I will be down in a few
                  moments."
               The maid, who had observed her mistress's confusion, retired, saying to herself,
                  "It is the common lot!" while Emma
                  hastily prepared herself to meet one who had recently occupied so large a share of
                  her thoughts.
               "Mr. Marland," said Emma, as she entered the drawing-room into which Prescott had
                  been ushered, "I welcome you to the home of my dear father and your friend."
               "I thank you, Miss Paige; but I would amend your kind welcome."
               "You may do so," returned Emma, with a smile.
               "You said, 'my dear father and your friend.' I would say, 'my dear father and your
                  dear friend.'"
               "Thank you."
               An expression of tender sadness mingled with her smile, as Emma uttered this
                  response. At the same time she experienced a sentiment of pride, on hearing such
                  words from one of whom her father had spoken so highly, and whom she herself
                  looked upon as the type of nobleness.
               "My father never dreamed of such a first meeting as was ours, when he used to
                  speak so warmly of your friendship," she said.
               "Neither did I," returned Prescott, "when he used to speak of you in our
                  conversations at the hospital. And yet, Miss Paige, being of a somewhat romantic
                  turn of mind, I will confess that my knowledge of the father, added to the
                  pictures he drew of his daughter, led me into youthful dreams of saving her from
                  some great peril; and here the dream is fulfilled,—that is, in a measure."
               Both blushed. Such youthful dreams are associated with ideal love; and what
                  Prescott intended in the commencement to be a gallant remark was to both, before
                  he had finished, evidently something that went much further than gallantry.
               "You say, 'in a measure,'" remarked Emma, after a moment's silence. "Why in a
                  measure?"
               "Because others were engaged in the rescue as well as myself," laughingly answered
                  Prescott.
               "I am grateful to all," returned Emma; "but if it had not been for your courage
                  and strength, Mr. Marland, I fear I should not now be here to welcome you."
               Having discharged himself of his duty, which modesty demanded to others, Prescott
                  was but too happy to hear his praises from lips so charming.
               Both now felt more at their ease, and the conversation flowed on with a mutual
                  enjoyment which each secretly wished might be prolonged into hours. That
                  confidence which underlies all true affection began to manifest itself in a manner
                  which a reader of the human heart would at once interpret.
               None had greater reason to repose confidence in each other, at this early stage of
                  their acquaintance, than these young people. That noble and affectionate father,
                  whom both loved, one as a parent and the other as a friend, had brought them
                  together in spirit long before they had ever seen each other in the body. As we
                  have seen, their very hearts had reached out toward each other in response to the
                  utterances of the now beatified patriot; and it only remained that the ideal they
                  had each drawn be tested by the presence of the real.
               This test, made under circumstances, as formerly narrated, so favorable to the
                  heart's emotions, had confirmed all that the ideal had fondly pictured; and now,
                  as they conversed, they seemed to have been acquainted for years.
               Emma had apologized in behalf of her mother, on account of illness, at an early
                  stage of the visit. When she thus apologized, the ill-boding presence of Daniel
                  Garvin came to her mind, as he appeared on the night that he revealed the future
                  he had prepared for them. She shuddered
                  dered at this recollection, and for a moment seemed to forget even the presence of
                  her visitor.
               Prescott observed her agitation, but ascribed it to emotions connected with her
                  mother's illness and father's death. She had more than once felt impelled to
                  reveal to him the situation of affairs, and the cause of her mother's illness,
                  which would explain also the evidences of sorrow that appeared on her own
                  countenance; for, with woman's intuition, she knew that he not only perceived
                  these evidences, but that his mind was disturbed with conjectures as to their
                  cause.
               At length, in the course of this interview, in which minutes seemed to these
                  youthful hearts but seconds, Emma was sent for by her mother. Excusing herself for
                  a few moments, she left Prescott alone.
               He now contemplated, as had Joseph on a former occasion, the evidences of
                  affluence which surrounded him. Like Joseph he admired the works of art, though,
                  unlike this poor boy, the richly carved furniture did not so much engross his
                  attention, nor did the warmth which came from the ornamented registers remind him
                  of a cold mother and sisters in a home of want; for though his family were not
                  wealthy, they never lacked for those things essential to comfort, and had,
                  moreover, been able to gratify, to a considerable extent, their naturally fine
                  taste. But, as I have said, Prescott contemplated the works of art about him with
                  admiration.
               The paintings had been evidently selected for their true artistic qualities.
                  Harmony, force, and freedom indicated the master, while here and there a small
                  painting, in which crudities mingled with the touches of genius, confirmed the
                  reputation won by Allen Paige, of kindly encouraging the young and struggling
                  artist.
               The statuary indicated equally good taste. In the midst of classic copies appeared
                  some of the famous groups by John Rogers, which present in so vivid and
                  instructive a manner the various phases of the Rebellion.
               But what fastened the attention of this already ardent lover more than all else
                  was a water-color, in one corner of which, as he approached it, his quick eye had
                  detected the name of Emma Paige. It was much above the standard of the usual
                  artistic performances of young ladies (no imputation is intended; the young women
                  of America are showing a commendable zeal in the direction of art culture, and are
                  worthily improving their opportunities), being characterized by originality, and a
                  freedom from the conventional hardness and stiffness which results from a false
                  idea as to what constitutes finish.
               The subject of this sketch was a vista, formed by lofty and graceful elms, through
                  which appeared the western sky in the glory of an autumnal sunset. Walking down
                  this vista, their forms borrowing a slight glory from the distance against which
                  they were boldly painted, were a youth and a maiden hand in hand.
               Prescott stood entranced before this picture, forgetting all else; and as the
                  rumbling of the carriages without had combined with the silence within to enhance
                  the abstraction of Joseph's mind, as he profoundly meditated on the vicissitudes
                  of earthly fortunes, so now this rumbling in the street, combined with the silence
                  about him, served to deepen Prescott's contemplations, as he gazed on those two
                  forms against the golden sky.
               With the fervor of newly awakened passion his heart read a prophecy in this
                  picture. It seemed as if the lovely artist had painted herself, thus hand in hand
                  with him.
               
               Ah! the egotism of love, and yet its insidious and tormenting fears! The smitten
                  lover absorbs all things to himself, and yet his heart is an unceasing victim of
                  uncertainty and apprehension. Does one who fancies himself in love not experience
                  this?—then he is not in love.
               Thus with the young lover who contemplates this picture from the hand of the one
                  he loves. His heart pictures that fair hand giving to each touch a prophetic
                  meaning, and he the object of that prophecy. Then immediately it is oppressed with
                  doubtful thoughts. "Is her love not pledged to another? And even if it is not,
                  what claims have I, Prescott Marland, a rough fellow, a fellow who has been
                  knocking around the world, and got the smell of camp-fires on me.—A hand" (here he
                  eyes his large muscular hand) well enough to knock a rascal down with who insults
                  her, but hardly the hand to clasp her delicate little fingers,—a fellow that needs
                  smoothing down before he can expect to win one like her." Then, in his enamored
                  musings, he pictured this lovely girl as the one of all others to make him the man
                  he wanted to be. Under her potent influence he would become as gentle as a lamb,
                  and his hasty passions only be reserved for her defence. And all the time the
                  distant rumbling of the teams and the surrounding silence lent their aid to the
                  increasing and all-absorbing influence of the picture before him.
               While thus standing, rapt in tender contemplation of her sketch, Emma so lightly
                  entered the room that he did not hear her. He so stood that, while his back was
                  mostly turned toward her, a quarter-view of his face was revealed. In this view
                  the profounder manifestations of the soul often appear on the countenance with
                  remarkable effect. In the present instance Prescott's expressive face, though so
                  nearly turned from her, revealed, in combination with his attitude, the nature of
                  the thoughts which agitated his soul with such tender and conflicting
                  emotions.
               In an instant this fair girl's cheeks were covered with blushes.
               That the reader may understand the cause of this charming confusion, it is
                  necessary for us to remark that she had more than once stood before that same
                  picture, as her visitor now stood before it, and formed into living portraits the
                  figures of the two lovers who were wending their way down the romantic vista.
               These portraits were Prescott Marland and herself!
               Becoming suddenly aware of her presence, Prescott turned. Thus finding himself
                  surprised in the midst of his enamored thoughts, and perceiving the blushes on the
                  fair face of her who had so engrossed his meditations, this dreaming lover felt
                  himself detected, and blush responded to blush.
               A celebrated preacher and lecturer recently informed his audience that he never
                  saw two young people in love that he didn't wish himself one of them. We doubt not
                  that if he could have looked in at the moment Prescott turned, he would have had
                  but little hesitation in deciding that such a wish here would have been
                  legitimate.
               They now resumed their seats.
               "Miss Paige," said Prescott, impelled by his momentary confusion to utter what
                  first came to his mind, "I have been admiring your art-treasures, for such I must
                  call them. You certainly must be very happy in the possession of so many mementos
                  of your father, to whose taste, judging from his conversations with me at the
                  hospital, these walls are largely indebted. I should think," he continued, seeing
                  that his listener remained silent, "that you would always wish to remain here. To your mother everything must
                  be especially dear—"
               Ere he could go on Emma had quickly covered her face with her handkerchief, and
                  then, with one great struggle to control herself, she broke into violent
                  weeping.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               AS we have remarked, Prescott, in his momentary confusion, uttered that which
                  first came to his mind. He could have said nothing, to one whose soul had already
                  been so deeply agitated, more calculated to affect her in the manner which now
                  threw him into dismay.
               He began inwardly to berate himself as a stupid fellow, who thus early gave
                  indubitable evidence of his unfitness for a mind so sensitive and refined.
               "Why did I talk to her in that way?" he said to himself. "Couldn't I have seen
                  that her grief for her father's death is as keen as ever?"
               But Emma did not thus accuse him. Even in the midst of her sobbing she felt drawn
                  still nearer to him.
               "Miss Emma," he at length said, at the same time rising and placing his right hand
                  tenderly on her arm, "forgive me for touching a tender chord so roughly."
               This was the first time he had called her by her given name.
               From an irresistible impulse, Emma raised her own right hand, while the other
                  still covered her face. Prescott saw this movement. He withdrew his from her arm,
                  and in the next instant their two hands were clasped together.
               For a moment it seemed as though each heart was pouring all its streams of life
                  into the other, and then the hands unclapsed.
               In the common routine of life, months could not have accomplished what was
                  attained in that moment toward establishing relations of confidence between these
                  two souls.
               Emma suddenly, as it were, found herself with one to whom she could unbosom all
                  her sorrows.
               When their hands were unclasped, Prescott said,—
               "Let me be a brother to you."
               "Ah yes! an elder brother. Do you know," continued Emma, now wiping away the team,
                  while she smiled upon him through her glistening lashes,—"do you know that I have
                  longed for an elder brother, in whom to confide, for several weeks past? And my
                  dear mother needs a son. You will be a son to her, will you not?"
               "I will," responded Prescott.
               The delightful emotion, on hearing himself thus associated with the mother's name
                  as her son was quickly resolved into a profound sentiment of devotion to the widow
                  and orphan children of his comrade.
               "I suspect," he continued, "that you have other causes for sorrow beside the death
                  of your father. Is it here that I can help you?"
               "Alas! I can hardly tell!" exclaimed Emma, "but you shall know all."
               She thereupon gave Prescott a detailed account of all that had occurred; of the
                  appointment of Jonas Cringar and her uncle as executors; and of the whisperings
                  and rumors, followed by the scene which was described in the previous chapter, and
                  in which Garvin declared to them their
                  state of beggary. When she came to her mother's illness the tears again filled her
                  eyes.
               Prescott's fine countenance assumed varied expressions as Emma recounted this
                  tale. Sympathy, indignation, and contempt, in turn, displayed themselves. But when
                  he beheld these tears his wrath broke forth.
               "Villains!" he exclaimed. "We will see!" At the same time he rested his clenched
                  hand on his knee.
               "Poor mother!" continued Emma. "She hardly knows how to act. If my uncle told the
                  truth, then she cannot bear to think that for a day she is living on the property
                  of others; for not only are we left penniless, but the estate is in debt."
               "What does your mother propose to do?"
               "She has n't been able to think. She was taken ill the night of the interview with
                  Mr. Cringar and my uncle, and any effort to think of this business makes her
                  dizzy."
               "Then please tell her not to think at present. I believe there is a base plot
                  under all this, and I know of one who can ferret it out, if such is the case."
               Emma looked at Prescott with inquiring interest.
               "It is Thorbolt."
               "General Hammond?"
               "Yes."
               "But would General Hammond trouble himself for us?"
               "Your father sacrificed his life on the altar of his country. His death leaves his
                  family exposed to what I believe a villanous plot. When I shall have laid all the
                  circumstances before the General, depend on his hearty co-operation with me. He
                  has leisure, which enables him to do much that otherwise he could not do. It will
                  not be the first time. I cannot now tell you of the number of the families of his
                  comrades he has aided in different ways."
               "But my father was not a member of your Order, and we cannot be considered as
                  destitute."
               "Ah, Miss Emma! here lies one of the noblest characteristics of our organization.
                  We do not confine our benefactions to its members. We reach out to all Union
                  soldiers, or their families, who suffer. Of course one of our prominent duties is
                  to seek out those families of the soldier who are in need, and relieve their
                  wants. Our fund, which is devoted to this purpose, is often called a Charity fund,
                  but it should always be called a Relief fund. When we aided our comrades, who were
                  suffering on the field for want of food or clothing, we did not call our help charity, but relief. So with those who demand our aid
                  at home. They are not objects of charity, they justly claim relief; and therefore
                  the fund which accomplishes this should be called the Relief fund. Charity
                  presupposes no obligation, in the common acceptation of that term, on the part of
                  the donor, whereas the suffering families of the patriot soldier have claims which
                  no lack of memory can obliterate from the records of a preserved Union."
               "True! oh, how true! It is what we always told the Deerings. Father would say,
                  'Tell Mrs. Deering that if I had been lying a sufferer on the field, and her
                  husband had been at hand, he would have given me all the aid in his power as a
                  comrade; and now that I cannot be of aid to him as a comrade I want to do my duty
                  to his family.'"
               "Yes, your father's sentiments are the sentiments of our Order. He did his duty as
                  an individual; the Grand Army is formed that as an organization it may enable the
                  million of returned soldiers to do their duty in the same way, as ONE. But I have
                  not fully answered your former remark. Though the more prominent work, which the
                  Grand Army has laid out for itself, is the relief of soldiers' families who are in want, yet it intends also to
                  fulfil the spirit of the law!"
               "The spirit of the law?" repeated Emma, with an inquiring smile.
               "It is an expression that came ready to my lips. This is what I mean by it,"
                  returned Prescott, to whose ardor in the cause of the Grand Army was added an
                  exquisite happiness in thus being permitted to expound its principles to one in
                  whose presence he so loved to linger, and whom, in the swift pictures that crossed
                  his enamored imagination, he associated with himself in the noble labors he
                  contemplated in connection with the future work of the organization which so
                  engrossed his attention,—"this is what I mean by it: I mean that the Grand Army of
                  the Republic intends to see fulfilled the spirit of all promises made to the
                  soldier when he left his home and went to the field to help put down the
                  Rebellion. When those promises were made, the country was in danger, and the men
                  who went forth to save it departed with "God bless yous!" that filled the whole
                  Northern air. If they should fall their families would be adopted by a grateful
                  people, and know naught else but comfort; and to their memory should be erected
                  monuments to remind future generations of their heroic patriotism and a nation's
                  gratitude. If they should escape the dangers of war and return in safety, then
                  would they in person feel this undying gratitude. Nothing that could be done for
                  them should be left undone. They would be objects of special favor; and, other
                  things being equal, the name of soldier would be the talisman that should open the
                  way to employment at all times. All this, and much more, rang forth as in an
                  anthem, and with a fervor it seemed as if the chill of a hundred winters could not
                  cool."
               "You speak only words of truth," uttered Emma, who had listened to Prescott's
                  words with unutterable emotions. "How well do I remember all that was said when my
                  own father went to the war; but," she added, "do you not think many of these
                  promises have been fulfilled?"
               "I do. There are, in every community, men who forget not their obligations. And
                  God bless the loyal press of the country for the sympathy they have displayed
                  toward the soldier! The press is a great power in the land, Miss Emma; and it has
                  done much to keep alive the memory of those obligations, so freely acknowledged by
                  the loyal citizens while war still made them tremble. I would not speak too
                  harshly. Forgetfulness of obligations is a tendency of public bodies; and
                  therefore it is that the soldiers are combining that they may keep alive the
                  public memory, and act as executors of the consequent public will."
               "And will this not accomplish what my dear father so often desired? He used to say
                  that none could so value liberty as those who had offered up their lives for it;
                  and he hoped the returned soldiers would so unite that the deep love of the
                  Republic, which service in the field had implanted in their breasts, would be
                  infused into the hearts of the whole nation, and forever kept alive."
               "It will, Miss Emma. "Your father presaged in his hope one of the great principles
                  of our Order. So long as the Grand Army of the Republic lives, liberty
                     cannot die!"
               During this conversation on the Grand Army, Emma's soul had been moved by the
                  profoundest emotions; but now her beautiful countenance glowed as by inspiration.
                  Raising her humid eyes to heaven, "O father!" she exclaimed, "ask kind Heaven to
                  look down and bless these noble men! All that you prayed for so earnestly, when
                  you lay on your bed of suffering, they are to accomplish!"
               
               Prescott was in turn profoundly affected as he gazed upon the face of this lovely
                  girl, thus lit up by her exalted emotions, and listened to the words which she
                  uttered with such inspired accent to her sainted father. He, in that moment,
                  realized the holiness to which the sentiment of pure love is akin; for while his
                  soul went out with hers in that touching appeal, his heart went out with it, and
                  he prayed God that a woman, gifted with a nature so elevated, might yet aid him as
                  a companion in the patriotic labors he contemplated for the future.
               When Emma lowered her eyes she met Prescott's ardent gaze, in which inspiration
                  and rapture mingled. A slight blush suffused her already glowing countenance; but
                  it was not the blush of shame. It seemed to lend a yet more exalted character to
                  her expression.
               "Prescott," she uttered in a voice of surpassing sweetness, as if all further form
                  had been swept away by this holy and lofty communion, "I feel that it is God who
                  is calling into existence this noble unity of the nation's soldiers. You are to
                  fulfil a sacred mission. The blessings of liberty will be yours, and the blessings
                  of the widow and the fatherless!" Her hand, which she had raised in an earnest
                  gesture, now fell to her side, and her eyes were dimmed with tears. "My dear
                  father," she continued, "would have been made very happy if he had met with you
                  before he passed away. Your name was on his lips, while he was unconscious, in his
                  last moments."
               Prescott's own eyes glistened with tender sympathy as he said in answer:—
               "I cannot express to you the gratification it gives me to hear of the regard in
                  which I was held by your father. He was brave and noble, and when you tell me of
                  his sentiments, which so accord with the spirit and purpose of the Grand Army, I
                  feel spurred on to work with still greater zeal for an organization I love so
                  much. But, Emma," he added, with a half-affectionate, half-venturesome smile, as
                  the name "Emma" fell from his lips, "I have not even yet fully answered your
                  question,—the question concerning the General's interest in your case, as a member
                  of the Grand Army. Let me assure you that he will sacrifice much in behalf of
                  Allen Paige's family. And if once he is satisfied that there is foul play on the
                  part of the executors, depend upon it he will not leave a stone unturned to
                  confound these men."
               "Ah, Prescott!" returned Emma, who having uttered that name when inspired by her
                  exalted emotions, now repeated it with a freedom which the circumstances of that
                  first utterance seemed in a subtle manner to insure for all coming time,—"ah,
                  Prescott! I now feel that we have friends about us, come whatever may."
               "Ay, and I trust the day is not far distant, when throughout the land there will
                  not be one family of the soldier who can say there are not watchful friends about
                  them."
               With this ardent wish, Prescott took his leave, and Emma, after musing awhile
                  alone, returned to her mother, to whom she recounted that portion of the interview
                  which interested her in so special a manner.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XV.
               TWO months have rolled away, and now, on the day this chapter opens, a storm is
                  howling through the streets and byways with wild and savage fury.
               Late in the afternoon a man of colossal stature, who wore a military overcoat that
                  effectually protected him from the wind and sleet, turned from Fifth Avenue and
                  entered West Twenty-Seventh Street. It was the Veteran.
               Arriving at the house he sought, he mounted the steps and rang the bell.
               It would seem as if the noise of the wind prevailed throughout the house, for
                  there was no response.
               He again pulled the bell-handle, but more vigorously than before, for the storm
                  followed him up the steps and blew his cape uncomfortably about his head.
               This time the ring was answered. A servant opened the door.
               "Is Mrs. Paige within?" inquired the Veteran.
               "Mrs. Paige?" repeated the servant, wonderingly. "I've been in this house but
                  since this morning same; but I think no sich woman lives here."
               A harsh voice now sounded through the hall.
               "Who has that front door open?" it exclaimed. "Shut it instantly!"
               At the same moment the dark visage of Daniel Garvin appeared at the farther end of
                  the hall, from an opened door.
               A scowl of impatience disturbed his sardonic countenance; and the wind, that
                  whistled through the house, blew his thin dry hair about in such a manner that the
                  first thought of the Veteran, as he beheld him, was of a man touched with the
                  insanity of a demoniac.
               The broker, on his part, left an expletive unuttered, as the looming form of the
                  Veteran met his gaze, covered with the driving sleet, the face half concealed by
                  the flying cape.
               "Ask the gentleman in, and close the door!" he cried, advancing into the hall.
               The Veteran stepped inside, followed by the sleet, and the servant closed the door
                  against the storm.
               As these two men now stood face to face, undisturbed by the fury of the elements,
                  they at once recognized each other.
               "I seek Mrs. Paige," said the Veteran, at the same time fixing on the broker a
                  look that made him inwardly quail.
               "She does not now reside here."
               There was in the broker's tone a slight touch of fierceness, as if his own secret
                  trembling somewhat maddened him.
               "She has moved then?"
               "Yes."
               "Will you be so kind as to inform me where?"
               "I cannot."
               As the broker uttered this sententious reply, in a voice which combined a snarl
                  with a perceptible tone of defiance, the Veteran bent upon him a penetrating gaze,
                  and his countenance assumed its expression of iron sternness, while the object of
                  his gaze cursed himself for his lack of self-command.
               "Excuse me for troubling you," he said; and opening the door he passed out,
                  letting in the howling storm again for an instant, which flew through the hall,
                  and once more sported with the broker's dry and scanty locks.
               An hour subsequent to this scene Prescott Marland, on entering his boarding-house, found the Veteran
                  awaiting him.
               "General," he exclaimed, clasping both of the Veteran's hands in his own, "I fear
                  all is lost, and the family of our comrade ruined!"
               "Let us be calm," said the Veteran, who, at the same time he experienced the
                  deepest sympathy for his friend's distress, could scarcely forbear a smile at this
                  impulsive evidence of his all-absorbing interest in the family of Allen Paige.
               "Ah, yes, General!" returned Prescott, "that is the word, 'be calm'; but with me
                  it has been impossible for many a day. Villains that they are!" he cried,
                  releasing the Veteran's hands, and clenching his muscular fists, "I could mash
                  their accursed heads till they could plot no more! Executors! Heaven save the
                  mark,—Executors! Executioners! that's the word, and executioners of
                  the innocent! Worse than executioners! Robbers! thieves! the foulest of thieves!
                  and God only knows whether they will not have been murderers in reality!" he
                  added, while the tears started to his eyes.
               "Lieutenant," said the Veteran with emotion, "you know how I feel for both them
                  and you; but feeling alone can do but little good. If the family of a comrade is
                  in trouble, depend on my assistance."
               "Ah, General! but you may have to do almost everything!"
               "Then I will do it."
               As the Veteran uttered these words with undemonstrative firmness, Prescott Marland
                  seized his hand, and a single tear hung for a moment on the lashes, and then
                  dampened his cheek.
               "God bless you, General!" he exclaimed. "I told her it would be so!" Then his
                  countenance immediately gave way to an expression of deep dejection. "But," he
                  continued, "I fear that even you can do nothing now. "O, why did you not come
                  sooner?"
               "I did not get your second letter till four says ago."
               "O, these mails! these mails! Do you know, General, that I felt like flying back
                  to the West" (Prescott had just returned from a visit to the West when he called
                  at the house of Mrs. Paige two months before), "and seeking you ahead of that
                  letter. I knew it would be so. It was fate!"
               "Do not use that word," said the Veteran, gently. "Say, rather, Providence. He who
                  ascribes the events of life to fate has not the strength to work with which he
                  possesses who ascribes them to Providence. As soon as I received your letter,
                  informing me of the imminent danger to which this family was exposed by the speedy
                  action of the executors, I immediately made my arrangements and started for New
                  York. I arrived here this afternoon, and at once called to see you. Not finding
                  you in, I proceeded to West Twenty-Seventh Street, and there learned sufficient to
                  confirm my worst fears."
               "Yes, instead of the happy family of our dead comrade, you found the accursed
                  uncle!"
               "I presumed it was Colonel Paige's brother."
               "In the name of Heaven! call him the half-brother—or the
                     step-brother—that's even better—but don't, don't call this
                  unmitigated scoundrel Allen Paige's brother!"
               An almost imperceptible smile flitted across the stern face of the Veteran.
               "I presume it was this step-brother I met there. It was the same face I saw in
                  Colonel Paige's chamber."
               "That's the man,—a man with a dark, piratical look, that showed his teeth, and had
                  a bald head, and whiskers cut in this
                  way?" responded Prescott, at the same time putting the thumb and forefinger of
                  each hand to either corner of his mouth, and bringing them down with a quick
                  jerk.
               "The same. I judged he lived there."
               "Yes, and there is where the refinement of his devilish spirit appears. In my
                  letter I wrote you that this Garvin and a man whom I believe to be only his
                  miserable tool—"
               "Jonas Cringar?"
               "That's the man!—a man that looks as if the crack of doom was continually sounding
                  in his ears!—a wretched-looking man, who goes about after Garvin as if this black
                  schemer had a rope around his neck! Well, as I was saying in my letter, I told you
                  that these men were preparing to sell off all property of the estate immediately,
                  and, unless they were soon headed off, they would have Mrs. Paige, Emma, and the
                  children turned out of doors."
               "Yes; and, Prescott, you cannot imagine my feelings when I read this information
                  in a letter I should have received nearly a month before."
               As the Veteran uttered this, he displayed more feeling than had heretofore
                  appeared on his countenance.
               "I think I can imagine your feelings, General. Well, you did not appear; they went
                  at it, and have done their damnable work!"
               "And you could do nothing?"
               "Nothing. That Garvin is too deep for me. Villany is his trade; and commerce,
                  finances, and law are right under his hands,—and such hands!—did you ever notice
                  them?"
               "I have only seen him twice, and his hand I did not observe," replied the Veteran,
                  his features again relaxing.
               "A hand that looks as if it were made up of five bloated, broken-backed lizards
                  and a flattened toad. Well, everything thing is under his ugly hands. He, with
                  Cringar, filed the inventories, and got out the license to sell; and the more I
                  tried to look into it the more I was afraid to do it, for fear of tipping over the
                  dish; and as I expected you on every day,—for you know you told me, when you left,
                  you should undoubtedly be back here last month, even without the incentive of my
                  letter,—I held off till it was too late."
               "And all is gone?"
               "All! everything! Turned out of that home, in which they had lived so many years,
                  and which the memory of Mr. Paige—their husband and father, and our comrade—made
                  so dear to them! And with a devilish refinement of cruelty Garvin bid off the
                  house and all that was in it, affirming, with tears in his crocodile eyes, that he
                  could n't endure to see the house which his lamented brother's taste had made so
                  attractive pass into the hands of a stranger! And there he lives, the sneaking
                  hound!"
               "And do you feel certain still that there is fraud in the case?"
               "I would be willing to swear to it. Mrs. Paige tells me that her husband trusted
                  her in all things, and that, if such a state of affairs had existed in his
                  business, he never would have concealed it from her. To assert it to be otherwise
                  is to assert that he deceived her in the most cruel manner, and that this noble
                  patriot was guilty of a gross falsehood."
               "Are there no friends that would help her,—friends who knew him well, and would
                  credit her statements?"
               "None. General, after you have lived in New York a few years you will realize that
                  business men here have no time to attend to other people's affairs. And even if
                  there were, there seems to be no one who is not easily convinced by these cunning executors that Allen Paige
                  followed in the track of scores of merchants, who could lay claim to cooler heads
                  than he was known to possess. I tell you, General, New York has, of late, been one
                  vast caldron of financial whirlpools; and like those rotary gulfs that suddenly
                  spring to the surface of the caldron below Niagara Bridge and suck everything down
                  within their reach, so have these speculative whirlpools ingulfed, one after
                  another, many who have stood among the highest in this city. No, Mrs. Paige can
                  depend on no one here. You must bear in mind that both Garvin and Cringar stand
                  high before the world; and there is not one to be found so unselfish as to venture
                  to unmask them, even if he believed they were rascals; especially as they have had
                  everything all their own way, and have baked up the whole business in such a
                  manner that it is next to impossible to discover a flaw."
               "I see how the matter stands," uttered the Veteran, bending his head in deep
                  thought.
               "And they are driven from their home!" exclaimed Prescott, with a voice in which
                  the passions of rage and grief were mingled.
               The Veteran did not seem to hear this outburst. His eyes still remained fixed to
                  the floor in deep meditation.
               Marland, struck by his appearance, remained silent also, and observed him with
                  anxious interest.
               In the mean while the storm was whistling and mourning without; and presently the
                  thoughts of the young lover reverted back to the time when he stood before the
                  sketch in Mrs. Paige's drawing-room, thinking of her who then seemed in the midst
                  of opulence, while the silence was only broken by the distant rumbling of the busy
                  city. As his mind returned to the present, with the stern face of the Veteran bent
                  in thought before him in the contemplation of the situation, which involved the
                  picture of this loved one driven like a wanderer from that opulent and happy home,
                  while instead of the soothing sounds of distant vehicles his ears were filled with
                  the shrieks and howls of the driving storm, his heart threatened to give way to
                  its powerful but pent-up emotions.
               He again watched the countenance of Thorbolt with anxious attention.
               At length he perceived the strong muscles of the Veteran's cheeks—those muscles
                  which seem only to respond to the action of a conquering will—begin to articulate
                  themselves, like some commanding face of the great masters; while on the brow
                  there appeared rather a general air of awakened irresistible power than a frown of
                  emotional resolution.
               This look, as Prescott gazed, seemed to grow for a space, until even he, who had
                  seen Thorbolt in some of his grandest moments, thought he never could have
                  conceived of a mortal being displaying in his expression such an air of invincible
                  strength.
               Suddenly this remarkable man, whose face now seemed fixed in a cast of iron, rose
                  to his feet; and bending his stern gray eye on the young lieutenant, he spoke in a
                  tone so deep and penetrating that his listener, whose mind was somewhat
                  overwrought, instinctively started back in his chair.
               "Prescott," he said, "I see my duty to the end. I am convinced of the foulness of
                  this business. So be that the Lord gives me his assistance, I pledge you I will
                  work till the question of villany or no villany is solved. The comrade who has
                  gone above," he continued, pointing upwards, "shall not, I trust, have reason to
                  complain of lack of effort on the part
                  of comrades left by Heaven to perform that work, which it seems those who went not
                  to the war are scarcely expected to attend to."
               Prescott sprang from his chair, and seizing his comrade's hand, pressed it in
                  silence.
               The Veteran then took his departure.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               NEAR an old cobbler's shop in Vandam Street stands a brick house, which, though
                  not in a state of dilapidation, exhibits the weather-beaten signs of age.
               The apartments on the third floor of this house have not the unsightly aspect of
                  the room in which the family of the soldier, Joseph Deering, were presented to the
                  reader. The appearance is, however, humble, and indicates a certain degree of
                  want. An evidence there is of a struggle with the inexorable demands and
                  necessities of life.
               Here live now the family of the soldier, Allen Paige.
               These apartments consist of a kitchen and dining-room combined, two chambers, and
                  a small bedroom.
               Driven from their home by the implacable vengeance of the broker, they have fled
                  to this uninviting precinct of the ever-changing city of New York, to struggle
                  with the situation into which they have been precipitated.
               Sorrow has succeeded sorrow. Scarcely have they begun to recover from the profound
                  grief into which they were thrown by the sentence of exile pronounced upon them by
                  the unrelenting voice of Daniel Garvin, when bereavement again threatens them
                  through the dangerous illness of their little boy Albert.
               His overwrought brain had yielded to the mental anguish which, young as he was, he
                  experienced on account of the treatment his beloved mother had undergone from the
                  heartless and unnatural uncle.
               An overwrought brain!
               This unfortunate boy's case impels us to a brief digression, which we make with
                  the conviction that the subject glanced at by us concerns, to an important degree,
                  the future welfare of our nation to which the Grand Army of the Republic is so
                  ardently devoted; for that which vitally concerns the intellectual and moral
                  welfare of our children concerns the country in the coming generation.
               Albert has fallen a victim to the pernicious system, existing in various forms
                  throughout our schools, of forcing the intellect by means of extraneous
                  incentives. All incentives, involving prizes and the like, and which inevitably
                  result in invidious comparisons, are antagonistic to healthy intellectual and
                  moral development. And while they may seem, in special cases, to spur on the
                  object of their influence to extraordinary efforts, they fail in a very signal
                  manner to accomplish the good it is their professed purpose to attain.
               No incentive can be depended upon for the greatest number which is not founded in
                  broad and unselfish principles. A few may be caught up in the whirl of an
                  unhealthily aroused emulation, but the remainder look on, first with juvenile
                  contempt, then with a blighting apathy, which gathers influence over the mind it
                  seizes in proportion as a morbid ambition urges on those other tender minds, whose
                  love of study has become transformed into a feverish desire for the coveted prize.
                  And we regret to say that the teacher does not always escape the insidious
                  influence of these selfish principles of action.
               
               Pure patriotism was the great power that annihilated the Rebellion. The selfish
                  ambition for prizes (in which we include high military position) was the
                  Rebellion's greatest ally—perhaps not excluding even copperheadism—which this pure
                  patriotism had to contend against. It culminated in defeat after defeat, till the
                  strong hand of General Grant brought it into subjection. And to all observing men
                  this important victory of the great commander presaged all future victories. By
                  all means, let the efficient be placed in responsible positions, but not for the
                  purpose of feeding their vanity.
               An impressive manifestation, in the late war, of the truth we would enforce was
                  the manner in which the soldier would, on sight of his country's flag, forget all
                  promised honors, and, inspired by the principles of pure patriotism, implanted
                  silently and unconsciously in his breast, and led by that all-potent emblem, rush
                  on into the cannon's mouth to die; while, perchance, the commanding officer of his
                  division gazed on the field from the rear, gnawed by disappointed ambition, and
                  secretly exulting over the dreadful sacrifice offered up before his unquiet eye,
                  because he knew it was hopeless, and likely to defeat the general in command, whom
                  possibly he looked upon as an arrogant upstart, occupying the place with which he
                  himself should have been honored. While the statement may be severe, it yet seems
                  but just, to remark that this malign spirit was but a legitimate outshoot from
                  those motives with which the young are impelled on to unnatural and demoralizing
                  efforts. And we trust that the Grand Army of the Republic, from which we expect so
                  much in behalf of our country's future welfare, will never be compromised in its
                  workings by that selfish ambition which lusts for personal aggrandizement at the
                  expense of the common good.
               The hypothesis, that the excitement of selfishness is the great aid to the
                  attainment of lasting good, will undoubtedly be acknowledged a manifest absurdity
                  by all. Such, however, is the basis on which the pernicious system referred to is
                  founded. Forgetfulness of self, and single-minded devotion to duty and truth, are
                  the principles on which this vast nation, with its future conflicting interests,
                  must rest its great hope.
               But it is a lamentable truth, that demoralization is not the only result of
                  unnatural incentive in connection with our schools.*
                   Prostration, sickness, and death are of frequent occurrence, bearing from
                  the sight of an expectant world many a bright young intellect, that might, under
                  proper influence, have remained to develop into powerful minds, fitted for the
                  great work of life.
               
                  
                  *We congratulate Boston on the final abolishment of the prize system in its
                     grammar schools, due, in a great degree, to the earnest and persistent
                     efforts of the Superintendent.
               
               The white and blue ribbons, associated with the prizes that are held up before the
                  children of many schools as the bait is held before cattle to be gathered for the
                  shambles, are symbols, one of the gravestones which mark the last resting-place of
                  many a tender form that has yielded to an over-wrought, undeveloped mind, and the
                  other of the sky, to which the bereaved parents gaze as they contemplate the
                  premature death of their promising children.
               As we stated in a former chapter, Albert, who was but eleven years old, was of
                  precocious mind, and even at that early age stood at the head of his school. We
                  spoke of it then in a manner that would seem to indicate pride in the statement.
                  If so, we made a serious mistake. Rather should a sentiment of fear have pervaded
                  that statement. It would have been confirmed by the results. This little boy, now rendered doubly precious to a
                  widowed mother, driven in a day from affluence to want, at the same time that her
                  departed husband's good name was covered with obloquy, this precious boy had been
                  brought down to a bed of sickness and impending death by the unnatural tension
                  brought to bear on his brain, through the pernicious practice we have spoken
                  of.
               It is due Mrs. Paige to remark that she had admonished this ambitious child
                  against overworking himself; but often, when every other eye in the house was
                  closed in slumber, he could have been seen sitting up in his bed in the old home,
                  studying by the gas-light near him.
               It was through this means that the boy had been brought to a condition which
                  prepared the way for the wickedness of his uncle to finally prostrate him on a bed
                  of sickness.
               At first, seized by what appeared to be a simple cold, Albert is now threatened
                  with death from brain-fever. Mrs. Paige sits by the side of the bed, nearly worn
                  down with her distress and anxiety, moistening her palm with cooling water, and
                  then passing it gently over her boy's forehead. No one else is in the room. Emma
                  is away, and Alice is preparing supper in the kitchen.
               It is the same hour in which the Veteran appeared in his sleet-covered garments at
                  the door of that mansion on which the mother's mind now so often and so sadly
                  dwells. The storm, which has seemed so fit an accompaniment to the scene that
                  occurred between the two remarkable men who represent the two opposing forces of
                  our story, and which had shrieked into the ears of Prescott Marland as he
                  contemplated the silent figure of the absorbed Thorbolt, sweeps past the window of
                  this sick-chamber with wild and dismal sound.
               Albert, who had been lying with closed eyes, opened them and cast upon his mother
                  a look which, though laden with the languor of sickness, conveyed an unutterable
                  expression of filial love and gratitude. He then closed them again.
               "Do you feel better, my child?" asked Mrs. Paige, bending over him.
               Albert did not answer.
               She repeated the question, but Albert did not speak.
               All at once a scowl came over his forehead, and he began to mutter
                  incoherently.
               The mother started from her chair in dismay.
               Ah! the difference between the unconsciousness of the father, dying from a wound
                  received in the defence of his country, and this dread symptom of a terrible
                  fever!
               She raised her clasped hands to heaven. Her eyes, which were uplifted, yielded to
                  an overwhelming emotion, and the tears of agony poured down her care-worn
                  cheeks.
               "O Father in Heaven!" she cried, "spare him! spare my boy!"
               Then she again bent over her child, and taking his head tenderly in her arm, she
                  bathed his face with her tears.
               "What is it that wets my cheek?" he exclaimed, staring up at this suffering
                  mother. "It rains," he muttered, as his lids began to droop. Suddenly they were
                  again raised, and his face assumed a look of terror, and he cried in a sort of
                  muttered shriek: "Don't turn mother out in such a storm as this, Uncle Garvin! O
                  Uncle, don't!—not my darling mother!"
               This was more than the afflicted woman could endure. Her head sank upon the
                  pillow, and, with her arm still around the neck of her boy, she uttered a loud
                  wail of grief.
               
               Alice heard this cry, and hastened from the kitchen in alarm.
               When she beheld her mother thus completely over-whelmed with woe, and heard the
                  mutterings of her wandering brother mingled with the utterances of this sorrow,
                  the picture of her dying father rose vividly to her mind. With frantic haste she
                  rushed to the bedside, threw her arms about her mother, and cried,—
               "Mother, dear mother! he is n't dying! O mother, no!"
               The mother, without raising her head, threw the disengaged arm around the
                  terror-stricken daughter, and pressed her to her bosom; and for a while her
                  convulsive sobs and the wailing storm, as it drove the sleet against the
                  window-panes, was the only answer.
               Once there seemed in the midst of the tempest's wail a mocking laugh. We had nigh
                  said it could easily be fancied the laugh of the half-brother; but no,—even Daniel
                  Garvin could not have looked in upon this scene unmoved, and without experiencing
                  an irrepressible pang of remorse.
               While this sad group were thus expressing the passions of grief, anguish, and
                  terror, another figure entered the outer room, having just come from the
                  street.
               It was Emma, who wore a water-proof which was covered with the sleet.
               She had just returned from a visit in answer to an advertisement. This
                  advertisement was for a teacher, who could give instruction both in music and the
                  French language. She had seen it in a paper dating two days back, which had been
                  wrapped around a bundle that was brought to them, and, fearing to delay a moment,
                  she put on her things and went out into the storm to respond to it; but her errand
                  was fruitless,—it had been answered the day before, and an engagement made.
               As she entered this outer room her countenance bore evidence of a mental struggle
                  just passed, which had evidently yielded to a determination to be cheerful.
                  Looking out from her water-proof hood was a face bearing testimony to its contact
                  with the storm, but lit by an encouraging smile.
               Her attention was first attracted to a cake which was burning in the oven. She at
                  once hastened to take it out, wondering what could have happened to Alice, who
                  usually performed her household duties with so much faithfulness and care.
               Then, in the midst of the noise of the elements without, she heard for the first
                  time the sounds of grief in the sick-chamber.
               Hastening to the door, she looked in and beheld the mournful group. There lay the
                  mother as she had fallen on the side of the bed, supporting Alice in one arm, and
                  with the other enfolding the neck of her suffering brother. She saw this brother's
                  eyes glazed in unconsciousness, and heard his incoherent mutterings, with which
                  were mingled the mother's deep and convulsive sobs.
               As we have seen, Emma's nature was strong, but it had now nearly given way. Her
                  first impulse was to rush to the bedside with a terror-fraught cry, as Alice had
                  done; but with a mighty effort, which seemed to her to be aided by a higher power,
                  she controlled herself.
               Advancing to the bedside softly, she gently placed her left hand under her
                  mother's head, and with her right she soothed her temples. Her palm was still cold
                  from contact with the outer air, and this, with the exquisite touch of filial
                  tenderness, together with Emma's gentle and soothing words, began to produce a
                  visible effect on the distracted mother.
               
               Alice also, over whom the mind of Emma had always held a gentle sway, began to
                  experience the quieting influence of her sister's presence.
               And it would seem as if the boy himself felt this sister's soothing influence; for
                  after having made a few passes over her mother's forehead, she alternated between
                  hers and his, and in a few moments he sank into a restful sleep.
               After Mrs. Paige had sufficiently recovered her composure, she seated herself and
                  conversed with Emma regarding her mission.
               "You know, mother," she said, "I did not expect it, but I thought it only my duty
                  to try."
               Mrs. Paige contemplated her with an air of grateful affection.
               "My dear daughter," she said, "I do not know what we should do if it were not for
                  you."
               "Ah, dear mother," returned this devoted daughter and sister, "I would that I
                  could do a hundred times more." Then with an expression of unconscious sadness she
                  said, "I can do but little. I would like to earn money enough to make us all
                  comfortable, but you know I am only a woman, and I cannot get the pay I could if I
                  were a man." And as a mournful smile made more touching her look of sadness, she
                  added, "I do not know but that I should become a Woman's Rights advocate, if by so
                  doing I could help raise the wages of women who have to support those they love,
                  as I now wish to support you."
               Mrs. Paige's gaze was now directed to Emma's neck, and with a quick start she
                  exclaimed,—
               "Emma, you have lost your pin!"
               Emma instantly placed her hand over the spot where her mother had seen the pin
                  before she went out, as if she would conceal it.
               "It is gone!" uttered the mother in a voice of deep concern. "I fear you have
                  indeed lost it!"
               This pin had been a gift from the father.
               Emma now produced a package, and hastily untying it, exposed to view various
                  little dainties so welcome to the sick.
               "You know the doctor said Albert needed these, and so I bought them."
               Mrs. Paige cast upon Emma a quick glance of pain.
               Emma understood it, and again put her hand instinctively to her neck.
               "It is n't sold, dear mother. I am to redeem it."
               She had pawned it.
               The mother rose in silence, and approaching Emma, placed her hand upon her head,
                  and kissed her on her brow. Then with a hastening but feeble step she passed from
                  the chamber into the small bedroom, where little Dorrit had all this time been
                  asleep, the tears starting down her cheeks as she closed the door.
               At the same moment a bold rap sounded at the kitchen door.
               Alice answered the summons, and Prescott Marland entered.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               EMMA, who had been profoundly affected by her mother's manner, heard Prescott's
                  voice in greeting, and confusion immediately displayed itself. The pin, which had
                  been the cause of the scene he had so nearly interrupted, seemed at this instant
                  to have left a space at her neck so
                  perceptible, that she felt certain it would be observed by their visitor; and like
                  one excited by the consciousness of guilt, she, poor girl! could not help fancying
                  him at once divining the reason.
               It were easy to say she should not feel ashamed, but, on the other hand, should be
                  sustained by a consciousness of duty nobly performed. The necessities consequent
                  on a change of situation from affluence to privation, however, do not always
                  succeed in compelling at once the instinctive and involuntary emotions to meet
                  their inexorable demands. Perhaps this is one of the most touching features of
                  those trials which follow in the wake of misfortune. A strong will and a resigned
                  spirit will sustain the mind and soul under the most adverse circumstances, and
                  the demeanor ordinarily reveal but little of the inward trial; but the involuntary
                  emotions of the heart ever and anon arise to remind the sufferer of what has been
                  in a manner that rends and pierces.
               It were vain, also, to say to this abashed girl, with the supposed taint of the
                  pawn-shop still on her skirts: "Prescott Marland is a young man of a high and
                  generous nature, and he will respect you tenfold more when he shall come to know
                  of this thing you have done. He will profoundly appreciate your self-sacrifice and
                  the nobility of your spirit."
               All this will be well afterwards, but at just this time her heart experiences a
                  sinking sensation, and her cheeks are tinged with a slight blush of shame.
               She casts about for another pin to take its place; but there is no time to carry
                  the desires of her mind into execution, for Prescott, accompanied by Alice, is on
                  the threshold.
               It is a face that would carry cheerfulness into the dungeon geon itself; and with
                  it a form that looks as if its great delight is to be out in such a storm as is
                  raging without, and buffet with the winds.
               In an instant Emma's distress on account of the pin was gone. She now only saw
                  this noble specimen of young manhood coming to greet her,—coming with his great
                  heart and courageous nature, to shed, in that chamber of sickness and privation,
                  an atmosphere of health and hope.
               O, how strong her impulse to throw herself into his arms, and claim that
                  protection which had been denied by the unnatural uncle!
               BROTHER!
               SISTER!
               Thus they entitled each other, and they did so in full sincerity. But would
                  William Garvin have so announced it, had he flown by on the gale, and looked
                  through the window at the moment Prescott stood upon that threshold? It is not
                  probable.
               And yet this spoken relation of brother and sister is the result, not of
                  self-deception, but of the most manly delicacy; for it is evident that if Prescott
                  should press his suit, the "brother" and "sister" would disappear as mist before
                  the sun. But he realizes that, under the peculiar circumstances, much that may be
                  done on his part will, from an accepted brother, do less violence to a natural
                  sensitiveness than if done by an accepted lover.
               He has now come from his interview with the Veteran, and a look of hope lights up
                  his handsome features.
               His air is contagious, and through Emma's soul there darts an indefinable emotion
                  of kindred hope.
               "Emma," he said, advancing and taking her hand, "General Hammond arrived from the
                  West to-day."
               
               He spoke somewhat loudly, and Emma, at the same time that a gleam of a yet more
                  definable hope overspread her features, placed her finger to her lips, and pointed
                  to the now deeply slumbering boy.
               Prescott lowered his tone, and for a moment gazed upon Emma's face in silence, as
                  he perceived the traces of the trial to which her spirit had been that day
                  subjected. She understood this gaze, and her eyes were bedewed with tears.
               The ardent but high-souled Marland could scarcely refrain from at once embracing
                  her in his strong, protecting arms, and giving vent to the full expression of his
                  all-absorbing love. But he commanded himself, and leading her to a chair with the
                  careful tenderness of a devoted elder brother, he narrated to her the interview
                  which had just occurred between himself and the Veteran.
               Emma, on her part, told him of the dangerous turn which Albert's illness had
                  taken.
               She was still speaking when Mrs. Paige came from the bedroom, her swollen eyes
                  telling of the anguish through which she had passed. As Prescott rose and greeted
                  her the sick boy began to show signs of restlessness.
               The mother looked up at a watch which was hanging by the bed.
               This watch was the last gift of her husband, to commemorate the twentieth
                  anniversary of their wedding-day. She had up to the present moment held this gift,
                  with others, as mementos so sacred, that she could entertain no thought of in any
                  way disposing of them; but in that little room she had yielded, after a severe but
                  noble struggle; and she had come forth resolved to follow the example of her
                  devoted daughter, whose precious token of her father was in the hands of the
                  pawnbroker, and devote all gifts, mementos, everything not absolutely essential to
                  the sustenance of life, to the support of that family which should never beg of
                  living man, so long as they possessed one object of the least possible value not
                  absolutely necessary to keep the soul and body together.
               But as she now looked at this watch, she started and exclaimed in a suppressed
                  voice,—
               "The time has passed when the medicine should be given him!" And hastening to the
                  mantel-piece, she took the medicine and spoon, and approached the bedside.
               Prescott extended his hand.
               "Don't awake him, I beg of you. It may be his death. No medicine can take the
                  place of sleep, in such a case as this. I once sat up with a little nephew of
                  mine, who had been given over by the doctors. He was suffering from brain-fever,
                  and was unconscious. For several days and nights he seemed to have scarcely slept.
                  As his mother left me with him on this night, which all expected to be his last,
                  she opened a bureau drawer and showed me a plaid piece of goods, and, with tears
                  in her eyes, she repeated those lines, suggested by an old saying,— 
                     
                        'Death often stays his hand
                        When friends prepare the shroud,
                        And joy returns to saddened hearts
                        When life dispels the cloud.'
                     
                   It was the last resort of despair,—a superstitious little act, as you
                  probably know, which many sorrowing ones indulge in, springing from hearts that
                  would make the last effort in their power to drive back the dreaded messenger.
                  When I was left alone with my charge I at once commenced gently passing my hand
                  down from his knees to the extremities of his feet, which I drew out soothingly as
                  I relinquished them to recommence at the knee. When I began, his head was tossing from side to side in the most
                  painful restlessness; but soon it settled into the pillow, and he began to
                  slumber. When at different times he would show signs of awakening from this
                  slumber, I would assist the manipulations on his feet by a low humming sound like
                  a top or a 
                     humblebee
                     bumblebee
                  ."
               "And what was the result?" asked Emma, eagerly.
               "The result was, I kept him asleep nine hours; and though I ignored the hours I
                  was instructed to give him medicine, the doctors, the next morning, announced a
                  remarkable change for the better."
               "And did he wear the plaid?"
               "He did; and is now a strong boy who wears sack and waistcoat."
               The mother had listened with absorbed attention, while Emma hung on every word, as
                  if this story, from the lips of him whom she secretly idolized and believed
                  capable of accomplishing almost anything in the power of man, was an account of
                  her own brother's redemption from death.
               "I will show you," continued Prescott; and approaching the invalid, who now moved
                  restlessly as if about to awake, he placed his hand under the quilt, and stroked
                  his feet as he had described, at the same time producing the humming sound with
                  his lips.
               The effect was remarkable. The boy almost instantly settled his heated cheek in
                  the pillow, and commenced breathing deeply. As Prescott continued his labors he
                  breathed more and more easily, and his cheek settled still deeper into the pillow,
                  until with a sigh he went off into a slumber so gentle, and yet so profound, that
                  the mother, reading the prophecy of life, took Prescott's disengaged hand between
                  her own, and said,—
               "It seems to me as if you had been sent to us by Heaven! Your friendship and
                  presence ever seem to me a blessing!"
               Emma cast upon Prescott a look of inexpressible happiness.
               He remained through the evening, and when he left, the boy was still sleeping.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               AT the time the incidents narrated in our story occurred, the New York Surrogate's
                  office was situated on Park Row, up one flight of stairs. It was a long room, by
                  no means diminutive in size; but its capacity was far from commensurate with the
                  immense amount of business there transacted. The accumulating posthumous documents
                  of generations, that had come and gone in this great city whose numbers had rolled
                  up like some vast invading army, were overflowing all available space, and
                  demanded more ample accommodation. Since the date of these incidents, therefore,
                  the office has been transferred to its present commodious quarters; and we learn
                  with satisfaction that the newly elected Surrogate is eminently qualified for the
                  arduous and increasing responsibilities devolving upon this office, which requires
                  in such a marked degree that judgment should be tempered by courtesy and
                     consideration.*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *This seems to the authors a fitting opportunity of expressing their
                     obligations to the Hon. Amos G. Hull, who, through his legal ability,
                     courtesy, and honor, rendered them important favors during an experience
                     which has afforded groundwork for a considerable portion of this
                     narrative.
               
               
               On the third day following the events recorded in the preceding pages, Mr. —,
                  Surrogate's clerk, was, as usual, buried in the midst of wills, inventories, and
                  clouds of other papers, which only a clerk of the Surrogate's office, or Probate
                  Court, can really appreciate.
               Men and women are seated or standing, awaiting their turn to be heard. They are
                  mostly persons who, as executors or administrators, or recipients of some deceased
                  friend's bounty, or, perchance, simply the objects of his remembrance, have come
                  here to subject this clerk, with others, to an endless series of questioning and
                  cross-questioning, most of them without counsel, and therefore the more dogmatic
                  and troublesome.
               "I've been left out of my sister's will!" says a sharp-faced, vinegary looking
                  woman, evidently unmarried, as she hastens to take her turn, "and I'd like to know
                  whether I've got the law on my side or not!"
               "That's for your counsel to answer, madam," courteously replies the clerk, turning
                  to the next applicant.
               "But don't you give full information here,—all about wills, and who's got their
                  rights, and who has n't?" persists the incorrigible applicant.
               "Let me advise you, madam," says the clerk somewhat testily, "if you have been
                  left out of a will where you ought to have been in it, to apply at once to
                  counsel. We can do nothing for you here."
               The questioner stares at the speaker a moment, who prepares to listen to the next
                  in turn, and seeing persistence is no longer of avail, she retires mumbling.
               The next applicant, behind whom the clerk observed a man of remarkable height,
                  with a deep scar on his cheek, was evidently a young man with whom Mr. — was
                  acquainted.
               The reader is also acquainted with him, somewhat, for it is Billings, formerly
                  Cringar's dry goods clerk,—now his book-keeper.
               "How are you, Billings?" said the clerk. "Any hitch in your business?"
               "I don't call it a hitch exactly, but I'm bothered by Tom Greeder, who says he'll
                  come down on me if I don't pay him his part of my brother's legacy at once. It's
                  only a hundred dollars, anyway."
               "What did you tell him?"
               "I told him I must have a chance, as executor, to turn, and I should n't pay a
                  cent till I had, if I knew what was law."
               "Right! The law's on your side. Anything else?"
               "I should like to look a moment at the records of the Paige estate."
               "Allen Paige?"
               "Yes. Cringar, you know, is one of the executors."
               "Yes," responded the clerk, as he turned for the records with a grimace. "Do you
                  know much about this affair?" he said in a low voice as he handed them to
                  Billings, at the same time casting a cautious glance around, as if this were an
                  unusual style of questioning for him to indulge in.
               The tall stranger heard this question, and slightly inclined his head.
               "I know a little about it," answered Billings. "Why, do you know anything?"
               The stranger listened attentively.
               The Surrogate's clerk cast a quick glance at this man.
               "I'm in no hurry," uttered the object of his scrutiny.
               Though the book-keeper knew this voice very well, he did not turn.
               "If I did, it would n't do for me to say so," replied Mr. —, with a
                  half-laugh.
               
               "Do you believe it is all right?" said Billings, in an abrupt, cross-questioning
                  tone, loud enough for the stranger to hear.
               The clerk did not answer this question, but the penetrating gray eyes of him who
                  was watching read his mind.
               Handing the papers to Billings, Mr. — said, in a manner that indicated a
                  consciousness of having slightly infringed on the proprieties of his office,—"They
                  are open to your inspection," and then turned his attention to the applicant who
                  had been so attentively watching him.
               The stranger stepped aside.
               "I will give way to my neighbor," he said. "In the mean time, if you and this
                  young gentleman will permit me, I would be pleased to glance at these papers,
                  which, if my ears caught the name aright, concern the estate of Allen Paige, who
                  happened to have been a warm friend of an acquaintance of mine."
               "I have no objections to your looking them over whatever," said Billings. "I also
                  have an acquaintance to whom Mr. Paige was a dear friend, and therefore we are
                  well met."
               The book-keeper and the stranger, whom the reader has readily recognized, now
                  proceeded to examine the papers put in by Cringar and Garvin as executors of Allen
                  Paige's estate. It is needless to say that they had understood each other from the
                  first.
               We will see how this came about.
               On the night succeeding his interview with Prescott Marland, the Veteran lay
                  awake, revolving in his mind the whole business to which he had resolved to devote
                  himself, for the sake of the family of a fallen comrade. As we have formerly
                  stated, his mind was of a high strategic order. He could do nothing without taking
                  a survey of all the bearings of the work in hand.
               The following morning he waited on Prescott.
               "I need a point to start with," he said, after he had obtained all the particulars
                  Prescott could give. "Perhaps you can help me to it."
               "What is it?"
               "Communication with some one who is able to open Cringar more or less to me."
               Prescott thought.
               The Veteran continued:—
               "Cringar is undoubtedly a tool, as you have before said. Garvin is the scoundrel
                  at heart, and the leader in this business. But it is evident that Garvin works
                  much through Cringar. I would work through Cringar also,—flank the one through the
                  other. If I can confound the merchant, I have the broker in my grasp. If I may
                  judge from what little I have seen and heard, Garvin is a man remarkably astute
                  and wary, and he would have those about him that could not be readily used by
                  others. I therefore must have some one, if possible, who is constantly about
                  Cringar."
               "The very man!" exclaimed Prescott, abruptly.
               "Who?"
               "Billings."
               "Billings?"
               "The clerk who throttled that fellow the night we met Emma Paige."
               "Ah, yes. And a young man of much acuteness, I judge."
               "You're right there. The very man!—the very man! He's been a clerk in Cringar's
                  store, and is now one of the book-keepers. Only three days ago he told me it was
                     notorious torious in the whole
                  store, that Cringar was troubled with a bad conscience. He pronounces him the most
                  miserable and God-forsaken looking man he has ever laid his eyes on. The very
                  ghost of a man, he calls him, and an unshrived one at that."
               "I am well pleased. Between this book-keeper, hard work, and Cringar's conscience,
                  I have hopes of accomplishing something."
               "Do you think you can fix them?" cried Prescott in excitement, as the picture of
                  the family, suffering from sickness and privation, which he visited the day
                  before, came to his mind.
               "Be calm," said the Veteran, kindly. "I can promise nothing more than work. The
                  situation in which we now find things has been legally as well as publicly
                  indorsed, and while I promise you that, if nothing unforeseen prevents, I will not
                  cease working till I get to the bottom of the whole business, yet in what state I
                  shall find that business remains to be seen."
               "You are right," returned Prescott in a subdued voice,—"perfectly right."
               "So let us to the work. I would see this young book-keeper at once."
               "You say you do not wish to touch Daniel Garvin at present?"
               "Not directly. Why?"
               "Because if you did, I think I know of one who would assist you."
               "Who?"
               "His son, William, whom we met with his cousin Emma that night."
               "Why do you think so?"
               "Because he thinks everything of the family, especially of Emma."
               The Veteran cast a penetrating glance into the countenance of the young
                  lieutenant, but he observed no jealousy there.
               "That may be, Prescott," he said; "but he appeared to me to be a young man who
                  would not readily act against his own father. While it is evident that his
                  attachments are strong, it is also evident that his conscience is equally
                  tender."
               "You may be correct. But still, General, I'm confident that you already hold a
                  strong influence over his mind."
               "Ah; and how do you know this?"
               "From his own talk. He's just the person, General, for you to hold with magnetic
                  power. He's an artist, with a woman's organization, and a fanciful imagination
                  that seems to me decidedly morbid. He says that picture of your appearance in the
                  street, when Emma's shrieks awoke him from unconsciousness, and he beheld her in
                  the arms of the abducting scoundrel, is before his eyes continually, by day and by
                  night. If he sits down to think, it's there. If he sleeps, it's there. If he
                  reads, or listens to sermon or lecture, it's there,—always right before him. He
                  affirms it's a vision that conveys to his mind a realization of Homer's
                  description of Jove in the midst of war. And by this very Jove! I verily believe
                  he looks on you as a sort of god incarnate! I told him how you got your sobriquet of Thorbolt, and you would have laughed to see how soberly
                  he took it. He looked as if, to his mind, you ought to have been christened with
                  it."
               "Pshaw! Lieutenant!" uttered the Veteran, not over-displeased by this flattering
                  account of a young artist's infatuation. Up to your old camp tricks, I see."
               "Not a bit of it, General. That's the way this young cousin talks. And between
                  that and his infatuation for Emma—"
               
               The Veteran smiled.
               "You think I ought to be jealous, I suppose," uttered the Lieutenant, interrupting
                  himself, and speaking with a freedom to the Veteran in which he would have
                  indulged before no other person; "but it doesn't take that course. On the
                  contrary, it delights me to see it. You know what I wouldn't say to any one else
                  but you, that I think her an angel, and I want everybody else to think so. Now
                  that her young cousin's whole soul is absorbed in her, and he looks upon her as a
                  very goddess—"
               "In that case (begging Mrs. Hammond's pardon) I ought to be the one to marry her
                  it seems to me," interrupted the Veteran, who could be facetious at times.
               "O, because he makes you a god, eh!" rejoined Prescott, relishing Thorbolt's
                  good-natured sally. "Well, what I was going to say is this, that putting his
                  infatuation for you and his infatuation for his cousin together, and knowing as he
                  must somewhat, at least, of his father's character, I have no doubt that he would
                  yield to your influence, if it directed him in work that should be of aid to one I
                  know he idolizes."
               Ah! the difference between strength and weakness! Prescott is strong,—William is
                  weak. The one takes pride in the other's love, as flattering evidence of the
                  estimation in which the object of his own love is held. The other looks upon his
                  rival's love as the iconoclast that shatters the divine image of his own fond
                  dreams.
               "I trust," said the Veteran, "that I shall never find it necessary to set him at
                  work against his own father; though Heaven only knows, in such an affair as this,
                  what instrumentalities will have to be used before we get through with it."
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               THE result of the interview between General Hammond and Prescott Marland was the
                  immediate introduction of the former to the book-keeper, Billings.
               They found in this young man a ready and willing assistant. He had by no means
                  been unobservant of all the external indications of remorse on the part of his
                  employer, Jonas Cringar, and of the satanic influence of this wretched man's
                  destroyer, Daniel Garvin. The broker came often into the store, and the merchant
                  made him an occasional messenger to Garvin's office, so that his opportunities for
                  observation were good; but he had detected nothing beyond what was revealed by the
                  general actions of the two men. When, however, the Veteran cautiously opened his
                  business to him he at once entered into the spirit of the work; for he was
                  convinced of the existence of an unprincipled plot, and his nature, besides
                  leading him into sympathy with the wronged, was calculated to enjoy the labor of
                  ferreting out this evidently dark and wicked scheme.
               The first documents the Veteran desired to examine were the records at the
                  Surrogate's office. But it was necessary for him to so accomplish this that wind
                  of his errand should not get to the ears of Daniel Garvin. What relations existed
                  between this deep schemer and the Surrogate's office he had no means of knowing.
                  That a direct visit from a man of his appearance for the purpose of examining the
                  records would excite attention, his past experience had warned him would be
                  inevitable; and yet these records he
                  must see himself, preparatory to the work he had undertaken.
               His astute mind had been perplexed by this part of the business, and up to the
                  time of his introduction to the book-keeper he had not been able to see his way
                  clear. He was still turning and revolving it in his mind.
               As soon as he was convinced that Billings was enlisted heart and soul in the
                  undertaking, and could be implicitly trusted, he made known his perplexity
                  regarding the records.
               "Good!" cried the book-keeper. "I can help you out of that difficulty at
                  once!"
               The Veteran bent on him a look of surprised inquiry.
               "I'm acquainted with Mr. —, recording clerk," said Billings in answer to this
                  look.
               "Then we can work it!" exclaimed the Veteran with an air of relief and
                  satisfaction.
               "Perfectly."
               "This is excellent! We will proceed at once to business."
               "I will obtain the items for you, myself, General."
               "I thank you, but I prefer to see the records in person."
               "Then depend on my hearty assistance here, and anywhere else, where I can be of
                  service."
               "Thanks."
               The reader has already witnessed the manner in which the book-keeper kept his
                  word, up to the point where we left him with the Veteran at the Surrogate's
                  office, examining the records.
               The Veteran was for a moment staggered. There was a boldness and openness in the
                  statements of the inventories that he was hardly prepared for. He could detect no
                  appearance of a trumped-up job. Names, dates, everything necessary for a clear,
                  unequivocal return by the executors of the estate, were here in black and
                  white.
               The book-keeper, who understood something of these things, cast a blank look at
                  his staggered companion.
               "It's a hard show," he said.
               The Veteran did not answer, but studiously examined the statements.
               At length the expression of his face changed from its surprise to a look of deep
                  determination, and he said,—
               "This Garvin is either not the rogue we have taken him to be, or he is a
                  marvellous expert in villany. Which horn of the dilemma do you choose?"
               The book-keeper thought a moment over this somewhat unexpected question, and then
                  answered,—
               "The latter."
               "That he is a marvellous villain?"
               "Yes."
               "I think your choice a good one."
               "It is yours?"
               "It is. This man is an able tactician. He would have made his mark in the Rebel
                  army."
               "But not in ours?"
               "No. His mark must be an infamous one."
               "What, General! do you think all in the Rebel army who made a mark made an
                  infamous one?"
               "No; but it was a place for infamous work."
               "I do not understand the connection."
               "Good men may be led into infamous business," returned the Veteran, with his grave
                  smile.
               "Ah—yes," ejaculated Billings, depressing his brows in thought.
               "While very good men were engaged in the Rebellion, very bad men imparted to it
                  its ruling spirit."
               
               "Like this Garvin," responded the book-keeper, the depression of his brows
                  gathering into a scowl.
               "Yes. And here is where the absurdity of those men appears, who, because there
                  were some men in the Rebellion that were misled, therefore they are to be placed
                  on an equality, in history, with the vast army of patriots who brought them to
                  their senses. What should we think of a youth, who, having heretofore enjoyed a
                  good character, is enticed into a criminal transaction; and being pardoned, he
                  claims as much credit for his earnest labors in behalf of crime as can he whose
                  loyal efforts defeated both him and his accomplices?"
               "Or as though we should succeed in knocking this array of figures, presented by
                  Cringar and Garvin, into a thousand atoms, and put the rascals in jail, and then,
                  forsooth, they cry from their bars, 'We did nobly! Write us down as criminals
                  devoted to our cause, and therefore entitled to glory!' It seems to me, now that I
                  think of it, quite as bad as that."
               "In many cases it certainly does," returned the Veteran. "But let us come back to
                  Garvin in earnest. As I remarked, this man is an able tactician, and with the
                  position he now holds in this affair, I am willing to acknowledge that it seems a
                  desperate undertaking to attempt to drive him from his works."
               "For my part, General, I confess I should never dare undertake it."
               "That would depend, I think," answered the Veteran, closely studying the
                  physiognomy of the book-keeper. Then turning his attention to the records, he
                  requested his companion to cautiously write down such items as he should read
                  off.
               Billings took out his memorandum-book, and holding it so that no one behind could
                  see his movements, proceeded to do so.
               In a long list of items, prepared with that sagacity on which the unprincipled
                  learn so much to depend, there were entered one or two statements, which, from
                  their important relation to the development of this story, we will here record for
                  the benefit of the reader.
               The first of these was an account of indebtedness to Jonas Cringar for settlement
                  of note for $50,000, given by Allen Paige to one Richard Slaycut, in payment for
                  25,000 shares of stock in the Long Ridge Silver and Copper Mining Company of
                  Montana, at $2 per share, said note bearing date October 2, 1864, to run six
                  months, and indorsed by said Jonas Cringar. The second was also indebtedness to
                  Jonas Cringar, for settlement of note for $12,000 to Slaycut & Drorblude, in
                  payment for 8,000 shares of stock in the Pulverizing Gold Mining Company of
                  Colorado, at $1.50 per share, bearing date October 4, 1864, to run four
                  months,—indorsed by said Jonas Cringar. The third was an account of indebtedness
                  to one Timothy Augoring, by privately protested note for one fifth interest in the
                  Pioneer Oil Well, $15,000, said note bearing date October 9, 1864.
               Besides these bold and startling statements, there were accounts of indebtedness
                  to the concern of Paige & Cringar, amounting to nearly $45,000.
               At length the Veteran stopped dictating to the book-keeper, and silently ran his
                  eye up and down the formidable columns.
               "Have you done," asked Billings.
               "Yes. We have, I think, all I require. I have seen to my satisfaction how the
                  enemy marshals his forces."
               "General," said the book-keeper, "I don't pretend to know much about law; but I'll tell you how this
                  appears to me."
               "Well."
               "It appears like a pretty thoroughly locked up safe."
               "Very true," responded the Veteran with an air of concern. "But," he continued,
                  while his features assumed that stern aspect on which we have before had reason to
                  remark, "have you known of a safe that has defied the continued efforts of
                  determined men?"
               "I must acknowledge I have not, though I am somewhat interested, just now, in a
                  new burglar-proof lock myself. To tell you the truth, I've come to the conclusion
                  that iron and steel are no proof against brains."
               "It is so. Neither is the sagacity of a rascal proof against the determination of
                  circumspect honesty."
               "That is true also."
               All this time the Veteran had been busy studying the records before him.
               "This is a formidable array," he said, in continuance of their conversation, "and
                  I can detect no flaw in it. It is consistent with itself in every part. The flanks
                  are well guarded. The position seems impregnable, the forces invincible; but only
                  by battle can the reality be revealed.
               The book-keeper, who had seen much of men in his as yet brief life, contemplated
                  his companion with sentiments of the profoundest admiration. Though he may not
                  have known so much as many others about law, he knew enough to realize that the
                  array of statements and figures put in by the executors of Allen Paige's estate,
                  and there displayed in those records, with such a man as Daniel Garvin behind
                  them, was of so formidable a character that probably no lawyer could be found to
                  attack them, at any price, if he valued a special reputation for success. And yet
                  here stood a man, whose education had been almost entirely in the field, who
                  contemplated the impending battle with this powerful broker, intrenched as he was
                  behind legal works that would seem to defy the power of men to storm, with a
                  calmness of determination such as would characterize but few, even with a fair and
                  easy contest before them.
               Finally the Veteran gave the records a slight push toward the book-keeper, and
                  then with the off-hand remark, "A sad piece of work, but very thoroughly done,"
                  which he uttered aloud, he turned away, informing the Surrogate's clerk—who was
                  busy with an old German that had come all the way from Chicago to inquire about a
                  will his son Hans had left in New York for him when he died—that he would have to
                  call at a future time.
               Billings returned the records to the clerk, and said in a low voice,—
               "Mr. —, for very important reasons, which I will make known to you at another
                  time, will you be so good as to mention this visit of mine, and this gentleman's,
                  also, to no one?"
               "By no means, if you so desire. But that is a man I should like to be introduced
                  to, Billings."
               "At another time, if you will be so gracious as to wait."
               "Certainly," replied the clerk with a slight laugh; and then he turned his
                  attention again to the poor old German, with whose case he really sympathized,
                  while the book-keeper accompanied the Veteran from the office.
               As they descended the stairs, the latter said,—
               "Billings, there is one piece of business, whereby Mr. Paige is asserted to have
                  lost a great deal of money, which it seems does not enter into the settlement of
                  the estate."
               "What is that?"
               "His cotton speculation. I understand that that was given Mrs. Paige as one of the losses which reduced
                  the estate."
               "You understood aright. I overheard Cringar and Garvin talking about that myself,
                  not long ago. It seemed to me as though they intended some one to hear, as a
                  blind."
               "They have treated it rather as an open matter then?"
               "Yes."
               The Veteran with a sudden movement placed his hand on the book-keeper's arm.
               "Was the cotton bought in New York?"
               "I am quite certain it was."
               "Is it possible for you to obtain the name of the house he bought it of."
               "I will try and make it possible."
               "Thank you. You speak like a man of success."
               "You think of making an attack there?"
               "I will skirmish a little. Their fortress, which seems so impregnable under their
                  masterly engineering, may yet have its weak point."
               They now parted at one of the entrances of City Hall Park.
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               DANIEL GARVIN'S office was, three years ago, in the basement of a building, on the
                  left side of Wall Street, about midway between William and Pearl Streets. At the
                  left, as one entered the door, was a counter with a desk upon it for the
                  transaction of general business. In the rear was a small room, partitioned off, in
                  which was transacted business of a more confidential nature; and the reader will
                  readily surmise that with Daniel Garvin such a room would find considerable
                  use.
               It is evening. Garvin has done a hard day's work, and made money. He has given
                  "points" to men who called him a friend, and thereby put them on the wrong scent,
                  and then taken them in, points and all, through a third party. The victims think
                  he is a fellow-victim; but now, as he is left alone, he sits by the gas-light and
                  reckons up his plunder.
               That conscience yet deals with him, in its own way, is made evident by the manner
                  in which he starts and glances at the street door, which is locked, as a sudden
                  and unexpected click of the large latch strikes his ear. He looks through the
                  partition window with a restless scowl, but receding steps indicate that the
                  threatened intruder simply raised the latch to look in as he passed by, or ask
                  direction to some place or person he was seeking.
               The broker went on counting up his booty, every now and then casting a look of
                  impatience toward the street.
               At length footsteps, slow and shambling, were heard descending from the sidewalk,
                  and then three raps, partaking of the nature of these shambling steps, sounded on
                  the door.
               The broker instantly gathered his papers into a drawer, and then advancing to the
                  door with his grinding tread, he turned the key with a quick, abrupt movement, and
                  admitted the visitor.
               "Cringar!" he said imperiously, "I have been waiting for you!"
               "I am sorry," answered the merchant, meekly; "but I have come as promptly as I
                  could."
               Garvin uttered a "humph!" and led the way into the back room.
               
               The strong picture which Prescott Marland had drawn of Jonas Cringar, in his
                  interview with the Veteran the day the latter arrived in New York from the West,
                  was not an exaggerated one. As he now follows the broker into the lighted
                  apartment he presents an object of unutterable misery. His shoulders, which in the
                  opening chapter of this tale we described as somewhat stooping, now round over
                  upon his chest, as if the weight and cares of troublesome years had borne them
                  down. His step is feeble, uncertain, and shuffling.
               As he seats himself his countenance comes into full view. It is a pitiable
                  countenance,—haggard, worn, and weary. It looks as if all spirit were gone; as
                  though death were prevented from claiming its own only by the infusion of a will
                  outside this miserable man,—the will of his master, Daniel Garvin, who appears to
                  hold his shattered mind and body together by a species of mental galvanism.
               That habit of painfully elongating his facial muscles seems, under the incessant
                  action of remorse, to have settled into absolute fixedness, imparting an
                  impression of terrible internal suffering.
               The broker sat for a moment in silence, contemplating with a secret emotion of
                  diabolical triumph this ghastly work of his hands.
               Cringar, on his part, once ventured to raise his downcast eyes to his destroyer's,
                  in which the rings began now to display themselves with deadly distinctness; but
                  he could endure this no longer than a passing moment. With a perceptible shudder
                  his gaze again fell to the floor, and he sat like some statue of despair.
               Garvin suddenly broke the silence.
               "Cringar!" he exclaimed with his penetrating voice, "are you playing me false
                  again?"
               "Playing you false!" uttered this broken victim, raising his eyes this time with a
                  look of terror, "playing you false! Before God—"
               "What have you to do with God now? You had better take your oath on the Devil!"
                  was the broker's blasphemous interruption.
               Garvin was an atheist.
               Cringar, who was naturally possessed of strong religious feelings, experienced an
                  emotion of horror at this remark; and for an instant he was impressed with a
                  feeling, as if the being before him was himself the Fiend Incarnate. His eyes, in
                  place of falling as on the former occasion, became riveted to the demoniacal orbs
                  before him by a terrible fascination.
               The broker burst into a loud, contemptuous laugh.
               "You are losing your senses, man!" he exclaimed.
               "I think I am," returned the merchant, whose eyes had been released by this laugh,
                  and now fell again to the floor, while a tremor went through his shattered
                  frame.
               The broker's laugh continued for a single moment, and then it closed as abruptly
                  as it had opened; and bending his annihilating eye on his victim, his face
                  darkened, and his brows met.
               "Cringar," he said, "some one is playing me false! Have you seen Baling
                  lately?"
               As he put this question he bent a scrutinizing gaze on the merchant.
               "I've not seen him for two weeks."
               "His books have been examined."
               The merchant started in affright.
               "His books examined!" he cried hoarsely.
               "Yes."
               "By whom?"
               
               "An enemy."
               "An enemy?"
               "An enemy."
               "Impossible!"
               "I lie then?"
               "You—lie. I—protest—"
               "Bah! I tell you that an enemy has been through Baling's accounts."
               "And—and discovered all!"
               "Fool!"
               "Your pardon!" ejaculated the miserable merchant, shrinking back.
               "Do you think I leave business open in that way?"
               "My head is not strong,—I did not think."
               The broker contemplated the miserable object of his mental by-play with scornful
                  pity.
               "Is nothing discovered, then?" at length asked Cringar, tremblingly.
               "Nothing, sir. I do not leave my tracks to be followed up by every spy that
                  happens behind me."
               "I am aware of it, Mr. Garvin," returned Cringar, reviving a little under a change
                  in Garvin's voice.
               The broker grimly smiled.
               "I will tell you, sir, and then you can judge," said this scheming egotist, at the
                  same time throwing himself back in his chair, and thrusting the thumb of his left
                  hand into the armhole of his vest. "You have not forgotten, sir, that Mr. Baling,
                  being my very particular friend, changed the date of Mr. Allen Paige's purchase to
                  meet the facts in the case."
               "That is, he found a mistake in his entry and rectified it," joined in Jonas
                  Cringar with a sickly smile, his anxiety to hold the good-will of his master, who
                  he perceived had some reason to suspect him of treachery, now beginning to
                  unloosen his tongue.
               "You have it. You now talk like a man of sense," responded the broker. "In the
                  meanwhile let me go over this business a little, for circumstances may occur that
                  will require your memory to be clear."
               The merchant, encouraged, straightened a little, and prepared respectfully to
                  listen.
               The broker, on his part, thrust his thumb still deeper into the armhole of his
                  vest, and expanding his chest by a slow inspiration, prepared with the egotism of
                  plotting villany to rehearse his sagacious performances.
               "As you probably recollect, the original entry was dated August 3d. When I called
                  to see him, last November, he acknowledged the error on its being pointed out to
                  him by so particular and trustworthy a friend as myself, and immediately set it
                  right by a proper attendance to the day-book. And by two simple touches the ledger
                  was made properly to accord with it."
               "By inserting the figure 2," again uttered the abject merchant, "and changing 8
                  into 9. It was a very sagacious bit of business."
               "A just correction, you mean, Mr. Cringar."
               "A just correction, I should have said."
               "And thus August 3d was properly transformed into August 23d, and $ 87,315,
                  amount, into $ 97,315, with the more marked success, inasmuch as there happened to
                  be ample space left between the t of August and the figure 3; and
                  the 8 was more like a 9 than an 8 at the start. All this you have not
                  forgotten."
               "By no means, sir. It is a monument of your—r—justice."
               "Of Mr. Baling's justice, you probably intended to say."
               
               "I should have said, of Mr. Baling's justice."
               "Thus, as you perceive, making an important difference between buying cotton on
                  the 3d of August, at a dollar sixty-eight cents, to be sold on the 24th, at an
                  advance of twenty cents to the pound, and buying it on the 23d of August, at a
                  dollar eighty-seven cents, to be held and put on a sinking market, September 24th,
                  at a loss of forty-eight cents to the pound."
               "A very important difference."
               "A difference so important, that instead of ten thousand dollars' profit appearing
                  in favor of my deceased brother's estate, a loss of over twenty thousand is the
                  just entry."
               "It is quite true."
               "A transaction, so consistent with the excitement of those days, is doubted by no
                  one, who recollects the great whirl that caught up the brains of deeper men than
                  Mr. Paige."
               "No one can doubt it."
               "They remember that cotton started in June from about a dollar, and went up like a
                  pyrotechnic serpent, every now and then taking a downward twist, to mount upwards
                  with a still fiercer rush, and dazzling the eyes of all beholders."
               "Yes, all were dazzled. And when Allen went in at one sixty-eight, I feared—"
               "At one eighty-seven, sir!" thundered the broker.
               "Pardon my treacherous memory!" uttered the merchant, sinking back in a sort of
                  cowering stupefaction.
               "See to it that your treacherous memory doesn't play its treachery with me
                  elsewhere, sir!" returned the broker, at the same time slowly rubbing the outside
                  of his breast-pocket, as if by an unconscious movement.
               The merchant blanched.
               "Yes, sir. You will recollect the excitement with which your partner hurried to
                  Baling & Co., and bought one hundred and eleven bales of middling, at one
                  dollar and eighty-seven cents, amid the hot predictions that the market wouldn't
                  stop till cotton soared—the Heavens, toward which it was going, only knew
                  where."
               "I recollect it perfectly well," responded Cringar, reviving a little. "The Red
                  River expedition started it up,—the fall of Atlanta sent it back. My partner was
                  so unfortunate as to take it on the turn."
               "Very true. I am glad to perceive your memory improving. Your partner—my lamented
                  brother" (the merchant sickened at this heartless attempt at humor)—"was so
                  unfortunate as to fall into the snare set by those predictions, and put in his
                  money, and held on to his cotton when the market began to fall, convinced it was
                  one of those twisting descents, preparatory to another grand upward flight; and
                  down he went with it, scarcely giving him time to think, till, as he passed one
                  forty, he threw the whole lot over to save himself; and not a day too soon, for
                  you undoubtedly recollect that a blank appears in the quotations after this, till
                  four days later it lights on one twenty to one twenty-five. There was wailing and
                  gnashing of teeth in those days, was there not, sir?" asked the broker with a
                  sardonic grin.
               "A lamentable amount of it," responded the merchant.
               "Your memory is now clear on all these points, and beyond the chance of
                  slipping—or treachery?" continued Garvin, with a significant emphasis on the last
                  word.
               "Beyond all doubt, sir,—beyond all doubt, I assure you."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXI.
               THE broker now contemplated Cringar for a while in silence. He moved a little,
                  that his own eyes might be relieved from the direct glare of the gas, as he threw
                  into them all his reserved power of penetration, while he brought them to bear on
                  the very soul of his victim. Instantly he made this change his pupils expanded
                  with marvellous rapidity, and the rings increased with the intensity of their
                  lurid light in proportion as this action of the pupils diminished their width. At
                  the same time the upper lip drew slowly back, more slowly than we have yet seen
                  it, and in a manner that gave to his glistening fangs their deadliest aspect.
               Cringar, though he did not venture to look up,—having invariably dropped his eyes
                  after each response to the foregoing recapitulation and admonitions of Daniel
                  Garvin,—felt this deadly scrutiny of the broker, and trembled. He was not
                  conscious of any overt act of treachery, but he was conscious of a
                  state of rebellion within, which only the terrible power his tormentor held over
                  him prevented from breaking forth with violence.
               The most positively abject, under a crushing power, are those who, possessing a
                  certain kind of strength themselves, have vainly contended against this power,
                  their struggles only serving to exhaust them and leave their contending spirit
                  demoralized and broken; which now and then, it is true, flashes up under its
                  fearful trial, but in a manner that but too surely indicates its helpless
                  condition.
               Suddenly the broker spoke.
               "Cringar," he said, "if I thought you were so much as turning the little finger of
                  your hand, I would—" Here he tapped his breast-pocket with two or three strokes,
                  made with such venomous rapidity that one is instantly reminded of the simile of
                  the lizards, uttered by the excited Marland in his interview with the Veteran.
               The merchant, whose spirit, under the reaction of the broker's sustained,
                  imperious, and penetrating gaze, was preparing to make one of those rebellious,
                  flickering efforts to which we have alluded, threw up his head with a frightened
                  stare; and in a tremulous voice he ejaculated,—
               "Ah, great God!" Then as Garvin continued his studious gaze, he uttered in a
                  broken voice, "Mr. Garvin—give me a Bible—and I—will swear!"
               The broker responded with another mocking laugh.
               "Never mind your calf-bound paper!" he exclaimed. "I'll trust my eyes quicker than
                  I will your God-packed oaths. You are innocent. That's my verdict. Now I'll tell
                  you what has been done."
               As the broker gave vent to this second blasphemous mockery, Jonas Cringar, who had
                  been wrought up to a high pitch of terror by the former's significant,
                  reptile-like action at his breast-pocket, could not withdraw his startled gaze
                  from the blasphemer's face, and for a moment he fancied himself in the regions
                  Infernal.
               These fancies were not diminished by the action of the gas-light, which suddenly
                  failed, ere Garvin had finished the last word of his sacrilegious speech, and
                  after seeming for a moment to cling to the burner, went out.
               Garvin uttered a curse, and rising from his chair, groped about the room for a
                  match, which finding, he lit it and looked about him.
               "There's water in the pipes," he muttered. "It's played me the same trick before. It's gone for this
                  night, that's certain."
               Cringar, who was overcome with dread, now rose.
               "I will come in at another time," he said in a quivering voice. "Don't trouble
                  yourself on my account."
               "Keep your seat, sir!" commanded the broker in a sharp, snarling voice. "I'll
                  furnish a light!"
               Cringar fell back in his chair as though he had been shot.
               The match in Garvin's fingers here burned out. Lighting another he went to an old
                  stand in one corner of the room, and opening the drawer, took out a small piece of
                  candle. He lit this, and then looked about for something that would serve as a
                  candlestick.
               "Ah, I have it!" he exclaimed; and he approached an odd-looking parcel, lying on
                  the floor in another corner. "That boy of mine can do some good with his mud,
                  which I think you and I will acknowledge in a moment, Mr. Cringar."
               Undoing the thick brown paper, he brought to view a small mess of modelling clay,
                  which William Garvin had left to take the next morning. Then he took an empty tin
                  box from the shelf, and filling it with the damp clay, punched a hole with his
                  ugly thumb, and inserting the bit of candle placed it on the table, and rubbed the
                  clay from his hands with an almost comical air of triumph.
               "No need of going home yet, Mr. Cringar," said he, thrusting his thumb into the
                  armhole of his vest again. "Gas companies are not allowed to control Daniel
                  Garvin's business. Now, sir, I'll proceed to recount to you what has been
                  done."
               "I shall be happy to hear," responded Cringar, resigning himself.
               "No doubt. Well, as I have told you, Baling's books have been examined, and with
                  direct reference to that transaction of my worthy half-brother."
               The merchant again looked frightened.
               "Fear not," said the broker contemptuously; "but listen. Baling came the other day
                  and informed me that a man had been to his office, while he was out, and under one
                  plausible pretext and another had with great sagacity endeavored to work on his
                  clerk to let him look at the accounts of sales for 1864. 'But,' says Baling,
                  'Bob's got his eye teeth cut, and he wouldn't give him so much as a squint till he
                  had seen me. So he told the stranger to call again.' In the mean time Baling had
                  come to me to let me know what was up, for his suspicions pointed to this
                  ill-advised purchase of your partner; which, you will bear in mind, though justly
                  corrected on the books, he would naturally feel sensitive about, inasmuch as he is
                  not often committed to such mistakes, and more especially to blunders where ten
                  thousand dollars are made instead of twenty thousand lost. You can understand his
                  feelings, Mr. Cringar?"
               "Very well, sir, indeed. I understand them very well."
               "Now, sir, what do you suppose I said to him?"
               "To Mr. Baling?"
               "Yes, sir, Mr. Baling."
               "Really, sir, you must have told him not to allow it."
               "The books not to be examined you mean?"
               "Certainly, sir."
               "Then certainly, sir, I have to inform you that I did no such thing."
               "Great Heavens! you—"
               "Told him by all means to open his whole safeful of books to the inquisitive gentleman, if he wanted to
                  look at them."
               The merchant stared at Garvin in dismay.
               The broker gave utterance to a guttural laugh of self-satisfaction, a tone of
                  contempt for the terrified merchant being mingled with it.
               "Well, do you take me for a fool that is not to be prepared for this sort of
                  exigency? Know, sir, that I have made this cotton a bold point. I apprehended that
                  it would be one of the first points attacked, if any one should ever be fool
                  enough to assail us; and now, sir, let them examine. What do they find? They find
                  a faultless entry. A daybook out of the reach of microscopes and chemicals. I paid
                  money, sir, to have that daybook put in condition. Daniel Garvin leaves nothing to
                  chance,—nothing, sir. The daybook being all right, the ledger was easily adjusted.
                  Now, sir, the more boldly they are pushed under the eyes of curious persons the
                  more thoroughly are these presumptuous meddlers repulsed, and beaten off from
                  further attempts."
               "I trust this will happen in the present instance."
               "Depend upon it, sir, that such is the case."
               "This man has visited Mr. Baling's office a second time?"
               "He has, and went away with a flea in his ear. Do you not see the great point of
                  this business, sir? Mr. Paige, who is declared by his admiring friends to have
                  been a man of immaculate integrity and above all lies, is known to have reported
                  that he cleared a large profit on his cotton speculation. The mining and oil-well
                  business they confess they never heard him talk about,—and perhaps for a very good
                  reason, Mr. Cringar,"—here the broker indulged in a low ironical fit of laughter,
                  and closed it by repeating, "and perhaps for a very good reason, Mr. Cringar." He
                  continued: "Well, sir, these admirable friends became sagacious friends. 'Let us
                  ascertain the name of the firm he bought the cotton of, and judge by the
                  quotations,' they say to themselves. So with profound cunning they find out that
                  he bought of Baling & Co. They go in,—ask to see his books with a depth of
                  shrewd simplicity to be admired,—and find out for themselves that he bought on a
                  market that must have inevitably let him down. They then find their eyes opened to
                  the revelation, that their much-esteemed and lamented friend was no exception to
                  the scores of deluded merchants of this inflammable city, who could tell a
                  business lie as easily as they could eat their supper, provided they had the money
                  left to pay for it. They will then give up the scent in disgust. Do you see it,
                  sir?"
               The merchant did see it, and his soul was seized with renewed pangs of remorse, as
                  Garvin thus pictured the ruined reputation of the partner, whom he had loved,
                  which was but an accompaniment to the ruin of his unfortunate family. These pangs
                  refused him speech.
               The broker divined his thoughts, and his own soul was filled with quivering
                  rage.
               This depraved schemer was not, as we have before intimated, free from the secret
                  scourgings of his conscience. Could he have slain this conscience it would long
                  ago have ceased to exist. This being beyond his power, all he could do was to
                  throw about his heart the thick veil of wickedness, to make it, if possible, deaf
                  to the voice of the everliving and faithful monitor. But this veil would
                  occasionally be rent; and then, in addition to the dull sounds that never ceased
                  to be heard, and which placed him before the pure enjoyments of the world somewhat
                  as one racked with inward pain is situated while he endeavors to listen to an entertainment, his exposed heart would
                  be penetrated by a voice so quick, so sharp, so terrible, that he would inwardly
                  tremble with a sort of desperate fury. Atheist that he was, there would in these
                  moments sweep over him the overwhelming truth that there is a God that judgeth in
                  the earth. The realization would be irresistibly forced upon his self-absorbing
                  egotism, that over him was held the all-controlling power of a Supreme Master.
               In the present instance he was subject to one of these secret dramas of the soul.
                  He had, in the self-complacency of his criminal triumph, yielded somewhat to
                  impulse; and his vanity, which with such men, in conjunction with their inordinate
                  egotism, partakes of the spirit of monomania, had been allowed to lead in his
                  recital to Jonas Cringar. While thus indulging this vanity, his mind had been more
                  or less preoccupied with his self-exultant utterances, and he had consequently
                  failed to observe those signs of the internal workings of his victim's soul which
                  he usually so well understood. But when he closed his abominable dissertation with
                  the abrupt question, "Do you see it, sir?" and received only silence in return, he
                  suddenly bent his piercing gaze on the conscience-smitten merchant. Then it was
                  that the reaction of his own indulged weakness, combined with the reaction, also,
                  upon himself of his listener's terrible remorse, caused the veil about his heart
                  to be rent as never before; and then followed his furious perturbation.
               Cringar's first intimation of the existence of this rage was the grating sound of
                  Garvin's teeth, as they gnashed together. Thus recalled to his senses he raised
                  his eyes.
               He had seen the broker many times with an aspect that struck him with terror, but
                  never had he appeared to him so horrible as now. His eyes had broken from their
                  intense tense gleam into a consuming blaze, which appeared to shoot forth, as it
                  were, from two caverns; the beetling brows were bent into one continuous black
                  ridge, and the prominent high cheekbones seemed to press outward and upward to
                  oppose themselves to these ridges, while the sockets between them had the
                  appearance of being drawn far back into the head. An unusual darkness seemed to
                  gather on the skin, and the upper lip twitched with a spasmodic action, revealing
                  the grinding teeth in contrast with this darkening flesh, and, to the merchant's
                  agitated mind, in ghastly combination with the cavernous fires above.
               As Jonas Cringar beheld this sombre and terrific visage, a cold sweat burst from
                  the pores of his creeping skin, and for the third time during this interview he
                  felt that horrid shuddering of the soul, which he had so often heard pictured as
                  the disembodied spirit's first experience when ushered into the precincts of the
                  damned.
               "Wretch!" finally exclaimed this wrathful semblance of a madman, "do you sit there
                  leading me on to gabble into your heedless ass's ears, while you are thinking how
                  to betray me?"
               "Before a just God!—"
               The broker sprang to his feet.
               "Fool! scoundrel! idiot! dare to speak that name here again, and I'll show you
                  that I am God in this place!"
               "In God's name, hush!" cried the merchant, rising also to his feet, while a look
                  of solemn terror took possession of his features; "hush! or He will strike you
                  dead!"
               At this instant a wild peal of laughter rose into the night air, which was
                  immediately followed by a shrill voice, singing with a jumbling accent,— 
                     
                        "My gentle sirs, be very kind!
                        Your candle's out,
                        
                        My gentle sirs!
                        You'll be found out,
                        My gentle sirs!
                        But gentle me you cannot find!"
                     
                  
               
               As their ears were greeted by this laughter, the broker and merchant both started
                  back, appalled by what seemed so unearthly an interruption. Their distended eyes
                  were simultaneously directed toward the back window whence the laughter came, and
                  there they beheld an impish face, pressed against the pane, while from its mouth
                  issued the gibberish transcribed above.
               The diabolical character of the scene was enhanced to these startled beholders by
                  the candle's verification of the singer's words; for having burned to the bottom
                  of the hole made by Garvin's thumb, it now sent up, preparatory to going slowly
                  out, a ghastly, bluish light, which clung to the sides of the cavity as it
                  ascended, as if the greasy substance of the clay lent itself to the flame.
               "Ha! ha! ha!" burst from the throat of the broker, as the face swiftly disappeared
                  on the utterance of the last word of the song. "It's simple Sal, the janitor's
                  daughter! You look frightened, sir," he said, turning to the trembling merchant,
                  while he closed his jaws and compressed his lips in a powerful effort to control
                  his own agitation.
               The merchant was incapable of speech. The broker's awful blasphemy, the effort of
                  his own solemn adjuration, the laugh, the song, with its idiotic, but to him its
                  deadly prophecy, the dying, ghastly flame of the clay-entombed candle, and the
                  broker's guttural, fear-fraught laugh, which penetrated his ears with an effect
                  scarcely less horrid than the laugh of the idiot, all had left him utterly
                  unstrung and speechless.
               As Garvin was about again to speak, the blue flame ran up the socket of clay, and,
                  hanging for a moment in the air, went out like a vanishing spirit, leaving the
                  room in utter darkness.
               The broker grumbled out a strongly aspirated but suppressed curse.
               "Take your hat, Cringar, and come along!" he grumbled. "No more talk
                  to-night!"
               Cringar obeyed with alacrity, and hurried from the office as if he sought to
                  escape the awful curse that he felt was now brooding there.
               Garvin scowled in the darkness as he followed him; and while he locked the door
                  with his right hand, he brandished his left, clenched and unseen by the object of
                  his malignant ire, and with the fourth line of the idiot's impish song still
                  ringing in his ears, he muttered,—
               "Craven! dare to fail me, and Daniel Garvin will teach you whose God can be
                  depended upon!"
            
            
               CHAPTER XXII.
               IT is a warm and pleasant day. A train is passing over the track of the New Jersey
                  Central, and as we shall find in the third car a spirit as bright, as buoyant, and
                  warm as the sunlight, we will enter by touching this talisman which I hold in my
                  hand, the author's pen.
               It is Prescott Marland of whom I speak. He sits by the open window—for in New
                  Jersey a warm April day is like a summer's day in a more Northern clime.
               "Ice-cream candy!"
               Prescott stops the boy who cries this, and takes from his vest-pocket a ten-cent
                  scrip.
               
               The boy hands him a paper of the candy.
               As Prescott receives it he catches sight of a little fellow, who, sitting on the
                  opposite side, has turned and now wistfully eyes the paper.
               Prescott, on the instant, whipped out another piece of currency, which proved to
                  be twenty-five cents, and taking a second parcel from the basket handed it to the
                  longing boy, who blushed, stammered out a "Thank you, sir!" and then proceeded,
                  without more ado, to tear away the paper and devour its contents.
               As the young vender was preparing to give the fifteen cents change, Prescott asked
                  him if he could afford to eat much of the candy himself.
               "As much as my hide 'ld be worth, sir! Dad don't 'low it."
               "Well, then, give me back five cents, and sit down beside me here (the boy was a
                  neat-looking lad) and eat a paper at my expense, if you have time. I want to talk
                  with you."
               The little vender, with the characteristic freedom of a boy of his class,
                  immediately responded to Prescott's invitation.
               The young Lieutenant had seen at a glance that this boy was intelligent; and if
                  there was anything he relished while travelling, it was to gather information from
                  those sources which are passed unheeded by most travellers. As the lad ate his
                  candy he led him into conversation, and gleaned much knowledge.
               "I make a good deal of money for dad here some days," said the boy in the course
                  of the conversation. "But it 's strange how it works! Some days everybody likes
                  candy, and then some days they don't. I tell you what it is, I likes them days
                  when the mammas bring in their little youngsters to see New York; then, whew! how
                  it goes!"
               "I suppose you have your ups and downs in this business, as they have in all
                  others," rejoined Prescott with a smile.
               "Yes, and no mistake. That's what Joe Deering said when I took his place."
               "Joe Deering!" exclaimed Prescott.
               "Yes, Joe Deering. And a mighty fine chap he was, too. I liked that chum, I did;
                  and if he should get well, and come back here for this place, I'd be glad to give
                  it to him."
               "Is his father living?" inquired the Lieutenant, anxiously.
               "His father, no! He was killed at the war!"
               As the lad gave this answer, a man who sat in the next seat, front, turned his
                  head half round to listen. He was about thirty, and had a look of energy.
               "It is the same," uttered Prescott, in a ruminating voice.
               The boy looked up at his interlocutor with an inquisitive air of surprise.
               "Do you know what regiment his father went out in?"
               "No, I don't," said the lad, scratching his head; "but I'll tell you what I do
                  know, and that is that he was killed under McClellan."
               "It's the same. Do you know where they live?"
               "No, I don't. He did live on the Bowery; but I went up there one time to see him,
                  and they were gone."
               "Yes, the Bowery. That's where they lived. What do you think has become of them?"
                  asked Prescott, anxiously.
               "I can't tell you. Are they acquaintances of yours, sir?"
               "I have friends, my boy, that knew them," replied Prescott, at the same time that
                  his mind flew off to her whom he first met while she was in search of Joseph
                     Deering's ing's family. He then
                  thought of her anxiety for this family, who had disappeared from the old house on
                  the Bowery, since he first met her, and for whose welfare she still experienced a
                  deep solicitude.
               The lad observed his emotion, but misunderstood his silence.
               "Excuse me, sir," he said. "I don't want to be asking impudent questions; that
                  ain't my business."
               Prescott smiled in the midst of his anxiety.
               "Your question wasn't at all impudent, my boy. But I'm sorry you can't tell me
                  where he lives. Do you think they are in want?"
               The listener in front here turned his head a little more.
               "I'm afraid they are badly off," said the boy. "He told me his mother was sick,
                  and he's got two little sisters, and he supported 'em all,—and when he had to give
                  up sick himself, I tell you he felt bad, and I felt bad too, sir; for he was a
                  fine fellow and no mistake. I wish I knew where they lived. You'd help 'em, I
                  reckon?"
               "Yes, my boy, I would."
               "I knowed you'd say it, sir! You see, sir, it's a soldier's family; and I've heard
                  a good many that rides in and out here say soldiers' families ought n't to be made
                  beggars of, and allowed to starve after fighting for the stars and stripes."
               "Good!" exclaimed the man in front.
               "And I say amen to that," responded Prescott.
               The boy looked up keenly at both men, and then muttered to
                  himself,—"Soldiers!"
               "Prescott at the same time fixed his eye on the stranger, and reaching forward his
                  hand, said,—
               "Comrade."
               The other accepted the proffered hand, and said in response,—
               "I thought you had seen service. Glad to see a soldier any time."
               "That's my mind exactly," returned Prescott.
               The stranger now looked toward the boy's seat.
               "Take it," said the lad, rising; and thanking Prescott he picked up his basket and
                  went to the rear of the car, for his vending was through with for that trip.
               Prescott's new acquaintance now came and sat by his side.
               "I've been listening to your talk with the lad about that soldier's family. It
                  seems to me they must be seeing hard times, if that boy tells the truth."
               "I don't doubt him."
               "Neither do I."
               "I've known of this family before; and I know that if the mother is sick, and that
                  boy Joseph too, they are starving unless they've been helped," said Prescott.
               His companion frowned.
               "Promises! promises! promises! that was the song!" he muttered. "Do you think," he
                  continued, "that this would have happened four years ago?"
               "I do not."
               "Or, say, when the Merrimack threw these Atlantic cities into a ferment,
                  threatening them with destruction?"
               "This family would not have then been forgotten."
               "No."
               "But, after all, it's human nature."
               "'T is true. It's human nature."
               "And therefore we must n't reflect too hard on the people at large, provided they
                  'll sustain others in doing what they haven't the time to think of doing
                  themselves."
               "That's so! I'm a little riled now and then when I hear of this soldier's family
                  starving, and that soldier's family
                  freezing, and no one seeming to look out for them, and when I call to mind the
                  pledges the people who stayed at home made to the fathers of these families,
                  before they were shot down by the Rebels; but, as you say, it's human nature, and
                  the best thing to do is for the soldiers, themselves, to go to work in such a way
                  to make these pledges good that the citizens will take hold and help us."
               "You have it. It's the only sensible way. Look here, what's the use of a man's
                  crying out broken pledges! to a railroad train that's left him
                  behind, because they promised to take him on and did n't, and stand yelling to the
                  winds, letting the next train pass by instead of hopping on!"
               Prescott's new companion laughed.
               "That's the idea!" said he. "It's no use at all. If human nature's human nature, I
                  suppose we've got to treat it as human nature. In short, we've got to keep up with
                  it."
               "Yes, and if soldiers can't do it, who can?" rejoined Prescott, laughing in his
                  turn. "Now let me tell you," he continued, "what is going to do it."
               "Go on," said the other with a significant look.
               "An association."
               "Yes."
               "An organization."
               "Yes."
               "An association of the soldiers themselves,—organized efforts."
               "You have it!"
               Prescott looked at his companion intently, and then uttered the three words,
               "G. A. R."
               The other looked in turn. "I take it you are a member of the G. A. R.," he
                  said.
               Prescott nodded.
               "Glad to hear it, comrade," exclaimed the companion clasping him again by the hand
                  in fraternal greeting. "We've just organized in New York."
               "You are engaged in this New York movement then?"
               "Yes. If any city needs us it is New York."
               "True. You will have cases enough to attend to."
               "True again. And that is the reason we should be at it. We shall have enough to
                  do. I presume I must look upon you as my senior as a comrade?"
               "I joined in Illinois, in the first of it."
               "Well, it's wonderful how it's going!"
               "Yes, wonderful! And yet not so much to be wondered at. The men that went into
                  this war are n't the kind, generally speaking, to stand, after the war's over, and
                  see the families of their comrades suffer."
               "That's so, comrade, every word! And I'm confident that every true-hearted soldier
                  will take hold with us as soon as he knows what we are about."
               "We shall have to contend against one thing."
               "What's that?"
               "The outcries of our enemies."
               "They can't hurt us."
               "Excuse me, comrade; but I think they can."
               "Not materially."
               "For the time being, at least."
               "How?"
               "By their usual vituperative statements. You see we are necessarily a secret
                  organization. Men have a good deal to say about secret societies, but I'll tell
                  you what it is, you've got to put powder and ball pretty well out of sight to make
                  them do the work when the priming sets them off. But here's the chance for our
                  enemies. They'll have more stories to
                  tell about us than there were colors in Joseph's coat."
               "Bah! I've heard their stories; but who'll believe them?"
               "A great many; for, do you see, we are compelled to confine ourselves to denials.
                  What we may or may not do cannot be proved in all cases to outsiders, inasmuch as
                  they are not admitted to our meetings to see for themselves."
               "It is true. But I believe in the end their libels will do us good."
               "I believe so, too. Libels, with but few exceptions, inevitably work that
                  way."
               "When I hear them talking about 'pandering to military ambition,' a 'political
                  machine,' and the like, I think to myself that such venomous attacks will be sure
                  to react on those that make them."
               "All this, however, is an admonition."
               "An admonition?"
               "That we cannot be too strict in eschewing all these things. The very fact that we
                  consider it important to refute the accusations of our enemies, should be
                  sufficient warning that such indulgences would be inimical and disastrous to the
                  Order."
               "I agree with you there. I have understood that some of the soldiers' and sailors'
                  clubs lent themselves to this outside business, and accordingly lost the
                  confidence of the community."
               "Yes, many of those clubs seem to have been formed rather for the purpose of
                  making their voices heard in complaints than for good hard work in behalf of those
                  who honestly stood in need of fraternal aid. And when men gather together to
                  complain, they simply offer themselves to the first intriguer that happens
                  along."
               "That's true. Still, we should give due credit to these clubs. They have
                  undoubtedly done much good."
               "Undoubtedly. But they did not form a responsible body, whereby the part is
                  accountable to the whole. They have been valuable as forerunners of our present
                  organization."
               "I see that."
               "From their very nature they were not calculated to resist the strong current that
                  was bearing, and would always bear, against them, as it will bear against us, and
                  which we are sure to withstand."
               As Prescott uttered this remark, a booming sound announced that the train was
                  advancing upon the long bridge that spans Newark Bay.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               THE two soldiers gazed in silence for a moment over the calm, sunlit water, dotted
                  here and there by small craft that lazily awaited any "cat's-paws" which might
                  occasionally touch their sails as they swiftly passed, ruffling the water in their
                  shifting course.
               "This bridge offers a very good illustration of your remark," said Prescott's
                  companion, who had withdrawn his gaze from the distance, and directed it to the
                  powerful current immediately under them. "When the contractor undertook to build
                  it there was a great cry that he would fail. The rush of water, as you see, is
                  very powerful here, and it was predicted that his attempt would be his ruin; for
                  this current would, before winter and spring had done with it, send it down the
                  stream to be sold for old lumber."
               
               "I have heard something about it," said Prescott, with interest; and he gazed on
                  the rushing waters as they tore away from the bridge in their onward course, as if
                  in rage at their impotent efforts to rend its foundations asunder. "Former
                  experience lent force to these predictions; but the contractor put good hard sense
                  against past failures and present predictions combined. This is how he did it. He
                  sank a great mass of stone with every pile, all so fastened together that an
                  earthquake would have to come along to undo the job."
               "We are riding over a stone quarry then, I should think," said Prescott,
                  laughing.
               "That's about what it amounts to. And if this current can lug off a stone quarry
                  it can lug off this bridge. Now, comrade, the foundations of an Order like ours
                  must be the same. As you say, there will ever be strong currents bearing upon it,
                  and it must be founded in the granite of strict and consistent principles to stand
                  against them."
               "I like to hear you talk that way," rejoined Prescott, bringing a hand
                  emphatically down on the other's knee. "Many entertain the idea that all that
                  soldiers can have in mind, in gathering together, is to cut up their old camp
                  shines, and keep their hands in so as to slaughter, one of these days, every
                  unlucky dog who doesn't happen to think as they do."
               "Ha! ha! you are about right there. There's a certain class of men that's mighty
                  afraid of soldiers!"
               "Yes," returned Prescott with a significant glance at a hard-visaged old fellow,
                  sitting just back, whom he had observed to scowl when the word soldier, uttered by them, had once met his ear; "and well they might be, seeing
                  we have been so successful in putting down their friends."
               "Of course," said the other, "they will stand ready to denounce everything as
                  politics, or dangerously military, that they can possibly get hold of."
               "Certainly. It's in their nature. But all we've got to do is to be sure our base
                  is right, and then push on, undisturbed by every little crack of a buckshot musket
                  that we hear in the woods."
               "There's one thing about it. We shall often have to fight down unprincipled
                  opposition in one form or another, and no doubt when we do so they'll raise the
                  hue and cry of 'Politics!' as their last resource."
               "O yes, there are men mean enough for anything; and if to carry out their petty
                  spite they knew they were surely exposing a thousand families of the soldier to
                  starvation, it would make no difference. They would probably say 'D—n the soldier,
                  and his family too!' and let drive their venom with a louder hiss than ever."
               The hard-faced old fellow behind heard this remark, and winced perceptibly, while
                  Prescott, who had kept one eye on him, put his hand to his mouth and nudged his
                  companion. At the same time he bent his head to the other's ear and
                  whispered,—
               "An old copperhead in the rear rank!"
               "Let's ask him to subscribe for the new Post!" returned the other with a
                  grimace.
               "He's been posted as much as he'll bear, I'm thinking," rejoined Prescott.
               His comrade laughed, and turning his head, took in, with an offhand glance, the
                  features of the object of this sally.
               He instantly turned back to Marland.
               "I know the old fellow like a book. It's Copperhead Snarling,—that's what the boys
                  all call him. He ought to have been hung. But General Dix did the next-best thing,—he put him into Fort Lafayette.
                  Why, that old sinner would work night and day, if he thought he could do us an
                  injury. A son of his was drafted, and the young scion had to go; and when he
                  thinks it's for his interest the hypocrite prates about his 'soldier
                  boy!' I shouldn't be at all astonished yet, if through this 'soldier
                  boy' he were to work away with malcontents to get up some kind of a flash
                  opposition concern; and as he's always yelled 'Constitution!' when
                  we've shouted 'Republic!' he'd be sure and stick that into the name
                  somewhere; and, again, as we should be powerful by that time he would undoubtedly
                  advocate stealing all the thunder from us he could, and back it up by proposing to
                  harness as much of our name on as they could trot under."
               "Who knows?" returned Prescott, amused. "Of course they would give a wide berth to
                  politics, seeing that is the cry with which they fill the air, when they denounce
                  the Grand Army of the Republic."
               "Lord, yes, sir! they would undoubtedly give politics a wide berth,—that is, in
                  this way: They would probably come up from their sea of troubles groaning and
                  sobbing, declaring to the world that, seeing no chance in the Grand Army of the
                  Republic—rampant with its political demagoguism—they were going to have an
                  organization so free from politics, so pure and immaculate, that as none but those
                  of their own stripe could live in it, they should have it understood that here
                  these harmonious spirits could find a political asylum, and none others."
               "Well, well!" replied Prescott, still more amused. "I'll note that down, and if it
                  happens, I'll call you a prophet.*
                   But coming back to the G. A. R. in New York, I am greatly rejoiced to see
                  the work going on. I have known of this movement, for, besides a slight influence
                  I have been able to exert to this end, I have a friend who has been able to effect
                  a good deal more.
               
                  
                  *Aside from the brusque language of Prescott's hearty comrade, especially
                     that having direct reference to the man behind him, whom he called
                     Copperhead Snarling, his implied prophecy seems in the main to have been
                     fulfilled by individuals, who have recently taken preliminary steps toward
                     organizing a society, to be called The Grand Army of the Constitution; the
                     manifest absurdity of whose position is, that, while they make pretence of
                     complaint, on the ground of politics, against the G. A. R., one of whose
                     cardinal principles is the exclusion of politics, they themselves make
                     politics the distinctive feature of their organization.
               
               "Is he from the West?"
               "He is."
               "I think I know whom you mean."
               "Who?"
               "General Hammond."
               "You have it at the first guess."
               "His soul seems done up in the Grand Army."
               "It is. He would assist a deserving comrade at the risk of his life."
               "I have no doubt of it, from what I've heard of him."
               "One such man giving his heart and soul to the cause, after having the time he has
                  had to thoroughly understand it, does more to refute the slanders and libels of
                  our enemies than could reams of foolscap."
               "'T is true. But now tell me of the family you were talking about with the
                  candy-boy. That seems to be one of the first cases for us to attend to."
               "It is a family named Deering. The soldier's name was Joseph Deering. He went out
                  in a New York regiment, and was killed in the Peninsular campaign, under
                  McClellan," answered Prescott.
               The other took out a memorandum-book, and proceeded to write this information
                  down.
               
               Prescott watched his companion's movements with intense satisfaction. Not only did
                  he realize that a systematic effort would now be made to seek out and relieve this
                  family, whose situation had so excited his sympathies, but he could bear the
                  cheerful news to that other soldier's family; for even in the midst of their own
                  trials they forgot not these suffering ones, whom they could not trace after they
                  had left the old house in the Bowery.
               "I trust you will find them," he said.
               "If they are to be found in New York, we'll find them," said the other with
                  decision. At the same time he turned the leaf of his memorandum-book.
               Prescott observed several names entered, with directions. Among these his eye
                  detected one that looked familiar. As it was written very hastily he did not feel
                  quite certain.
               "Can I look over your list?" he asked.
               "Certainly. They are all soldiers' families. They are to be looked up."
               Prescott took the book, and examined it with an anxious eye.
               "You have the name of Allen Paige here, I perceive," he said, slightly
                  flushing.
               "Yes. He was a true soldier. He was reported to be wealthy when he died, but it
                  was found that speculation had ruined him; and I understand his family are in a
                  state of destitution, and are really objects of relief."
               Prescott reddened so suddenly that he was obliged to turn and gaze out of the
                  opposite car-windows, with an air as if he had unexpectedly caught sight of an
                  object of great curiosity.
               It was a hard thing for an ardent lover to see the name of his loved one's family
                  written down in a list of the destitute, to be aided from a Relief fund.
               He recovered himself as quickly as possible, and turned to his comrade.
               "I do not think this family will need your aid," he said. "I am quite well
                  acquainted with them; and though they suffer privation, they go on the principle
                  that everything they own, that seems in the least degree superfluous, must go
                  toward their support before they will consent to receive aid from others."
               "That's the spirit I like!" exclaimed the other. "But look here," said he,
                  thoughtfully; "sometimes these are the very kind—who have the true pride of a
                  soldier's family—that allow themselves to suffer too much before accepting relief.
                  Now I don't pretend to know much about this family, but I was told something by a
                  comrade that looks as though they were in a hard situation."
               "What was it?" inquired Prescott, whose emotions were growing every moment more
                  painful.
               "You see, he happened to be in a pawnbroker's shop the other day, and I will
                  relate to you what occurred just as he gave it to me, dialect and all. The Jew was
                  slightly acquainted with him, and it seems he had heard of the Grand Army; so he
                  asked him if the soldiers were going to have Posts in New York. Comrade Walker
                  told him 'Yes.' 'Vell den,' says he, 'I 'sh glad of it, for I likes der soldiers
                  first-rate. I was always a goot. Union man. Now look here,' and he took a box out
                  of his safe, 'I show not der pawns to everypody that comes into mine
                  establishment, boot you ish von good Union soldier, and I vill show you someding,
                  and tell you der story. In der midst of der great storm, mit der sleet and wind
                  and cold wedder, dat we have stronger than never were yet sence der month of
                  January, dare come into mine shop a young lady mit der face so sweet and beautiful
                  under der—what you call 'im
                  —vater-proof hood, all covered mit der sleet, and der sweet face looking so sad
                  and worn mit der sorrow, that mine heart was very mooch touched. And then, ven she
                  takes off der pin and tells me she vants to pawn it, and I see dat it must pe der
                  portrait of her fader, and ish one vary fine-looking man, as you see, I felt mit
                  mine eyes as if I must cry, and I advanced more than ever were yet py me, and I
                  say to mineself—while she give von big sob when I takes der pin an' gives her der
                  monish—if I was von soldier, I would go and work mit all my might and main, and
                  make von big society of der soldiers; and mit der same I would help the family of
                  der soldier—because, you tink of it, and you vill see dat der world ish vary apt
                  to forget der big promises made to der brave soldier, ven he goes off to der wars.
                  Their heads, and der houses, and der money-boxes, dey all pe safe and sound, and
                  dey say to der poor soldier, 'Have a dundering jolly time at der war, you fine
                  fellers, eh! An' mit der time you pe gone, I pay von hundred dollar to buy
                  substitute for der town.' And then dey botton up their pokets, and mit der hands
                  dey pat on der pocket-book jest so, and say, 'Der war, it tam near ruin me, an' I
                  can give no more monish. Der soldier dat was killed was von tamned unlucky dog,
                  and his family, dey must go to de authorities or to der tuyfel!' Well, den, mit
                  mine eyes dey pe snapping ven I tink of dis, I say to der young lady, 'Vill you
                  not take der seat and warm yourself?' but she was in von great haste, and mit der
                  'tank you,' she opens der door and flies away in der big storm."
               "Well, all this while Comrade Walker was keeping his ear open to Isaac, and at the
                  same time staring in amazement at the pin. 'You know der soldier?' said the Jew.
                  'Yes,' said Walker. You see it was Allen Paige, his Lieutenant-Colonel before
                  Petersburg, but he didn't let on to the pawnbroker. He just asked what was to pay,
                  and told him to please say nothing to any one, but to keep the pin safe, and if it
                  was not called for he would redeem it; for you see he felt mighty sensitive about
                  the matter; he thought a good deal of Colonel Paige, and had heard a great deal of
                  his family. The Jew's figure was a high one, compared to what pawnbrokers usually
                  advance on their pawned securities, which went to show that his talk was not all
                  gab, but that he really felt for Colonel Paige's daughter, who undoubtedly was the
                  one that called at his shop."
               The speaker now stopped in surprise, and looked intently at his companion.
               Prescott's face indicated the profound strength of his varied emotions.
               His comrade's recital of the Jew's quaint but touching story had produced an
                  effect, which the former little imagined as he rattled off the dialect of the
                  kind-hearted pawnbroker. Prescott had observed the absence of that pin from Emma's
                  beautiful throat, but he had said nothing. Now it was explained to him, and in a
                  manner that wrung his heart again and again.
               
                  The Pawnbroker!
               
               One usually hears this name in connection with the fortunes of a loved friend with
                  dread. There are men who serve to redeem this business of the traditionary,
                  hardhearted avariciousness usually associated with it, one pawnbroker of our
                  acquaintance being of unusually generous and open-hearted disposition, who has
                  kept goods months after the expiration of the time allowed by law to redeem them,
                  from pure kind-heartedness; but this does not render the knowledge that a dear and
                  beloved friend has been driven to the pawn-shop in order to sustain existence the
                  less significant nificant of privation,
                  and a consequent source of apprehensive dread.
               But with Prescott Marland dread formed only a part of his present emotions. A sort
                  of horror seized him; for he had good reason to remember the storm which the Jew
                  had described; and the picture so vividly drawn of that devoted daughter and
                  sister, flying in the driving, blinding sleet to a pawnbroker's shop to pledge her
                  dear, sainted father's gift, that those she loved might live, was one well
                  calculated to stir this generous and ardent lover's soul to its profoundest
                  depths. He could scarcely repress a groan of anguish.
               "What ails you, comrade?" asked his companion, somewhat startled.
               "Nothing," replied Prescott, making a great effort to recover his self-composure.
                  "I may tell you at some future time." He added, "I am well acquainted with this
                  family, and I promise you the Post shall be notified if they need your
                  assistance."
               The train now entered the depot on North River, and the two soldiers, taking the
                  boat, parted in New York City.
               As they were about separating, Prescott said, with a half-laugh,—
               "Comrade, I seem to have known you so well from the first, I've not taken the
                  pains to ask your name."
               "The same with me. My name is Charles Roberts."
               "And mine Prescott Marland."
               "Good by, comrade."
               "Good by."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               THE reader has surmised that the examination of Baling & Co.'s books, as
                  recounted by the broker to Jonas Cringar in Chapter XXI., was made at the
                  instigation of the Veteran. We left him, at the time he parted with the
                  book-keeper after the visit to the Surrogate's office, thinking of the cotton
                  speculation in which Allen Paige was known to have been engaged, having expressed
                  to Billings his judgment that here might, perchance, be found the weak point of
                  the enemy's fortifications.
               With this man of action, to think was to do. He accordingly determined at once to
                  feel out the strength in this direction.
               He again found in the book-keeper a ready assistant. Through his aid he
                  ascertained that the cotton was bought of Baling & Co., cotton dealers. The
                  next thing was to examine the books of this firm. The Veteran did not deem it
                  policy to appear in person for the purpose of examining these books; Billings
                  therefore undertook to perform this service. Disguising himself sufficiently to
                  prevent recognition by any one who might have seen him in Cringar's store, he
                  proceeded to the work with much sagacity; but, as Garvin had reported to the
                  merchant, his sagacity did not succeed in hoodwinking Baling, who, having
                  previously been warned by the broker, was on the alert for any movement of this
                  kind.
               We have also learned, through the broker, of the entire freedom given to the
                  Veteran's assistant in his examination of the books.
               
               Billings's report to the Veteran was in accordance with Daniel Garvin's statements
                  to the merchant. He had found no evidence that the accounts had been tampered
                  with; on the contrary, all appeared in regular order. When, therefore, they came
                  to compare the report with the quotations of the cotton market of that day, they
                  saw naught but very conclusive evidence that Allen Paige must have lost by his
                  venture in cotton.
               The book-keeper, who had looked with such dismay upon the array of statements in
                  the inventories filed by Cringar and Garvin at the Surrogate's office, viewed with
                  equal dismay the result of his visit to the house of Baling & Co.
               The Veteran sat in deep thought.
               Suddenly he seized the paper on which Billings had cautiously transcribed the
                  entries from Baling & Co.'s books, and fixing his eye on a particular portion
                  of it, he spoke with an energy which almost startled his companion.
               "I can rely on every word, letter, and mark?"
               "You can."
               "These marks I can rely upon to go over the world with, if necessary?"
               "I'll stake my life on them!" returned the book-keeper, surveying the Veteran with
                  a puzzled air.
               "Time is wasted in New York! Next week I go to Boston!"
               The book-keeper looked amazed; but his brief 
                     aquaintance
                     acquaintance
                   had taught him that the Veteran was, in a case like this, neither to be
                  fathomed nor questioned.
               On the same afternoon that comrades Marland and Roberts were entering New York by
                  the New Jersey Central the Veteran took the Fall River boat for Boston.
               This man of a former cosmopolitan life was always glad to see his native town,
                  with all its little foibles, and crooked streets. His experience in the wide world
                  had, in his later years, taught him to hold in profound respect the character of a
                  city whose voice could ever be depended upon in the cause of the great humanity.
                  Like some stanch old uncle, who, while he occasionally entertains his neighbors
                  with his innocent conceits and happy self-complacency, yet is held in profound
                  respect by all lovers of their fellow-men, so seemed this good old city of Boston
                  to its now famous Thorbolt.
               But the Veteran had more important business on hand than the sentimental
                  contemplation of this city of his birth.
               At an early hour we find him in the Merchants' Exchange.
               "Is Mr. Drammen in?" he inquired.
               Drammen was a Norwegian, who had fought with a strong arm under the flag of his
                  adopted country. He now had charge of the books of the Exchange.
               The Veteran was informed that he was out, but would be in soon.
               While waiting for him he looked over the gold quotations of the previous day,
                  which had not yet been erased from the board. This gradually led him into a
                  revery, in which the circumstances and incidents associated with his present
                  mission to Boston passed one by one in review. These quotations brought before him
                  with especial vividness the gloomy and satanic visage of Daniel Garvin, the Wall
                  Street broker—who, perchance, had swindled some confiding customer by means of
                  those very figures—as it had appeared before him in that home which, having driven
                  from it his patriot brother's family, he now defiled with his own presence. He
                  recalled the look of this heartless
                  schemer while he questioned him on that stormy day,—a look in which ferocity
                  seemed combined with an irrepressible fear; and a look also that had fastened
                  itself deep in the mind of him who was now in revery, spurring him on in his
                  self-imposed task for the sake of the plotter's victims. That distorted visage
                  rose above the solid phalanx of statements and figures in the Surrogate's office;
                  it peered over the entries transcribed from the books of Baling & Co., its
                  ferocity rousing his soul in behalf of those suffering loved ones of his fallen
                  comrade,—its fear fastening upon his mind the conviction that behind all
                  statements, figures, and entries was that weakness of guilt which an unswerving
                  energy might sooner or later reach and confound.
               His meditations were interrupted by Drammen, who, having returned, was informed of
                  the visitor's desire to see him.
               The Norwegian did not require two glances to tell him that a soldier stood before
                  him. The greeting, therefore, on the Veteran's introducing himself, was, though
                  between strangers, as warm as if they had been friends for twenty years.
               "How can I serve you?" inquired Drammen.
               "By allowing me to see the reports of cotton shipments from New York for the
                  summer and fall of 1864."
               "That you shall see at once," replied Drammen; and in a few moments he brought the
                  book which contained the reports of the arrival of merchandise during the period
                  mentioned by the Veteran. He opened the book to the month of July, 1864, and then
                  excusing himself for a few moments, left the Veteran to examine it at his
                  leisure.
               The latter instinctively turned several leaves at once, which brought him into
                  October. Then he turned slowly back.
               Scarcely had he commenced doing so when his eye caught an entry of 111 bales of
                  cotton, to O. U. Waite & Co. Even his strong heart sunk. If this was the lot
                  of 111 bales bought and sold by Allen Paige, the date of the arrival, September
                  28th, corroborated Cringar's and Garvin's statements. At this time the market had
                  been falling at a terrible pace, as had been described by Garvin in his interview
                  with Cringar, the week previous, at his office in Wall Street.
               Drammen was now returning, and the Veteran, raising his eyes awaited his approach
                  with a calm, grave countenance, although his heart was secretly troubled.
               "This is all the information to be obtained from your books?"
               "It is."
               The Veteran fingered a few of the leaves, and as he directed his eyes again to the
                  book, he released them, one after another, in an abstracted manner.
               He started. Great as was his self-command, a quick flush appeared on either cheek,
                  and he sharply bent the falling leaf as he threw it back.
               On the left-hand page, where he now held the book open, was another record of 111
                  bales, to F. Jaques & Co., and this date was August 25th!
               "Comrade," he said, addressing Drammen, "I am here on an errand,—of which you will
                  please say nothing,—that concerns the family of a soldier. I find recorded in this
                  book the arrival of two lots. It is of the utmost importance that I obtain further
                  information regarding them. Can I not obtain it of the parties to whom they were
                  shipped?"
               
               "I think you can," answered Drammen. "I am acquainted with both firms, and will
                  call on them with you as soon as I am disengaged, if you desire."
               "Thank you. It would be a great favor. How soon will you be at liberty?"
               "In an hour."
               "I will call on the minute."
               "I will be ready for you."
               At the end of an hour the Veteran promptly appeared, and they departed on their
                  errand, which to the Veteran contained so much of import.
               Waite & Co. were near at hand, on Kilby Street, and thither they first
                  directed their steps.
               Neither member of the firm was in, but both were expected every moment.
               While waiting in the office, or rather room, of this enterprising house, the
                  battle-scarred warrior had an opportunity of witnessing such a series of
                  skirmishes as it had not before been his good fortune to behold.
               In a long row of bins, situated on one side of the room, which extended from front
                  to rear of the building, was thrown loose cotton that had once served as samples,
                  together with old samples still rolled up in their papers, and having, to the
                  Veteran's military eye, the appearance of dismantled guns. On a counter in the
                  middle of the room was deposited a lot ready for present use, while the floor
                  about him was white with others exposed to view like so many cotton dumplings, and
                  so arranged as to receive the light to the best advantage. Each paper contained as
                  many samples as there were bales to be sold, unless the number of the latter
                  compelled the use of more than one paper, which was exceptional.
               Presently a young man rushed in as if madness had seized him, and looking wildly
                  about, shouted,—
               "Where's Waite? Where's Lookum?"
               "Will be in soon," answered the clerk.
               "Can sell that lot of a hundred and fifty bales middling. Must have it right
                  away!"
               "Who to?"
               The broker—for such was the excited visitor—put his forefinger quickly to the side
                  of his nose in an inimitable manner, at the same time squinting toward the
                  door.
               This significant glance was explained by the entrance of a second broker on the
                  scene. He was older than the first, but evidently quite as active, with a slight
                  tendency to obesity, which indicated a happy possession of what was known in
                  cotton circles, as well as in camp, as "cheek."
               Without any ado he made for a large lot of the opened samples, and turned up the
                  paper to read the marks.
               "Right up to sample?" said he, picking a bit of cotton from one of the cotton
                  dumplings, and drawing the staple rapidly between the thumb and forefinger of each
                  hand, followed by a vigorous snap.
               "Right straight up!" answered the clerk.
               Without another word this second comer proceeded to roll the paper, and turn in
                  the ends with a skill only attained by cotton-men.
               "Hallo!" cried the first, reddening with anxiety and anger, "who told you you
                  might have those samples?"
               "Met Waite on the street a minute and a half ago, and he told me I
                  might take 'em."
               "Yes!" cried the younger broker, turning toward the clerk, "but Lookum promised
                  'em to me, and I can sell 'em too!"
               "What time?" asked the clerk.
               "He said I might have 'em at ten o'clock."
               The second broker laughed, at the same time giving the roll a swing as he held it by one end, and bringing
                  it to bear like a small cannon upon his younger competitor; and then squinting
                  along the top cried, "Bang!" with so loud and abrupt a tone that even the Veteran,
                  whose ears had rang with thousands of cannon-peals, started in his chair.
               "You're a dead man!" exclaimed this facetious broker. "Don't you see you 're time
                  's up and ten minutes to spare?" And with this he disappeared, leaving this young
                  competitor standing where he had been shot, red with disappointment, and chagrin
                  that the other should have got the better of him.
               "Curse that Bummeer's cheek!" he spluttered out, to the silent amusement of the
                  Veteran. "Why did n't you stop him, Philbut? He'll sell to my man! That's what
                  he's after! O, hang his confounded cheek! P-s-h! I'm done for on that job! He 'll
                  sell him, if cheek 'll do it!"
               The clerk laughed.
               Just then in glided another broker, with a look as if he could ferret out a rat,
                  though its hole ran zigzag through to China. Casting a look of contempt on his
                  young brother of the craft, and a glance of suspicion at the Veteran, while he
                  gave a slight nod to Drammen, he went straight up to the clerk and whispered in
                  his ear.
               The clerk whispered an answer, accompanying it by a nod at the young victim of
                  another's "cheek," and then sweeping this nod around to the door.
               The new-comer gnawed his lip, and glided from the room with a swiftness which
                  evidently meant sharp competition with some other dealer's samples.
               The disappointed applicant cried out, as this man slipped from the room,—
               "By thunder! I bet he'll settle Bummeer's hash for him yet! He's on the soft with
                  Evans, and 'll sell to him, I'll wager coat, hat, and boots!"
               As he was speaking with his head turned to the clerk, in danced another young man
                  with a sort of hungry, devouring look.
               "Evans after cotton?" he exclaimed, rushing up, and catching the speaker by the
                  arm. "By Jove!—say!—what does he want? I took supper with his agent's grandfather
                  yesterday. I can sell him, you bet! What does he want?"
               "O, you git!" cried the other. "Go 'nd find out what he wants! And then get the
                  cotton if you can,—that's what's the matter!"
               In their eagerness and excitement none of these competing brokers had paid any
                  apparent attention to the presence of the Veteran and Drammen, except the third
                  comer. This gave the Grand Army hero an opportunity of resting, by pleasant
                  observation, a mind which had for several days been severely taxed in its efforts
                  to unravel the dark and complicated plot which the subtle brain of Daniel Garvin
                  had woven with such consummate art. To a man of his observation the scene he had
                  just witnessed was as enjoyable and recreative as a comedy. And we have been led
                  to delineate this little episode, from a sympathy with the state of tension to
                  which the mind of this hard and indefatigable mental worker for the good of others
                  had been brought. There was something, too, in the appearance of the white, fleecy
                  cotton, flung about like foam on a surf-beaten shore, which captivated his eye,
                  and lent its aid in soothing his mind.
               Soon after the departure of the fourth broker Waite entered, and on recognizing
                  the Veteran came forward and shook him heartily by the hand.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXV.
               "GENERAL," said the cotton-dealer, "I'm very glad to see you!"
               "Thank you."
               "Is there anything I can do for you?"
               "I've called on you for a slight favor."
               "I'm sorry for that. I was in hopes it was an important favor. I am continually
                  wishing something might turn up that would give me an opportunity of returning
                  your kindness to me in Rebeldom."
               "Say nothing about it, Mr. Waite. It was my duty to protect you, as a sound Union
                  man. Nothing pleased me more, while in this Rebeldom you speak of, than to see an
                  out-and-out cotton man that was an out-and-out Union man."
               The Veteran, at one time in the Southwest, had rendered an important service to
                  Mr. Waite, who was down there buying cotton under the protection of the
                  government, and who, at the time of the service, was threatened with ruin through
                  suspicion excited by a rival cotton-buyer, of being in treasonable intercourse
                  with the enemy. It was only through the good judgment and decision of the Veteran
                  that he escaped.
               "Well, if you don't want anything said about it I won't say it; but make the
                  favors I can do for you as large as possible."
               "Thank you again. The fact is, though I remarked it was a slight favor I had to
                  ask of you, I will do it the justice to say it is of great importance to me."
               "Well, I'm glad of that. Now please name it."
               "It is that you let me look at your invoice book for September, 1864. A lot of one
                  hundred and eleven bales of cotton arrived on the 28th of that month for you."
               "Yes," returned the cotton-dealer, laughing, "I recollect it very well. I lost
                  more money than it would take to buy a first-class farm by that lot of cotton. You
                  see it came down reeling from a dollar ninety to a dollar eighty, and there it
                  tumbled about awhile, and then took a long downward lurch to one fifty. The day it
                  stood there I got a telegram from New York that a party who had one hundred and
                  eleven bales was thoroughly demoralized, with a good many others, and would sell
                  five cents less than market price to get rid of it. Well, I'm willing to
                  acknowledge that I was fool enough to think that the market would get sober again,
                  stop its reeling and tumbling, and take another flight upward, so I telegraphed on
                  to buy it, intending to hold it. And hold it I did, till it burned my fingers to
                  the bone."
               This rapid account by the cotton-dealer fell with the weight of lead on the ear of
                  his listener. It was in striking accordance with the reports of Garvin which he
                  had gathered, confirmed as they were by the copy Billings had made from the books
                  of Baling & Co.
               In the mean time Waite had obtained the invoice book the Veteran desired. The
                  latter opened to the entry he sought, and then with a long-drawn breath proceeded
                  to copy it into his memorandum-book.
               The cotton-dealer was too well-bred to ask any questions on the strength of the
                  privilege he was granting his former benefactor.
               The Veteran, on his part, simply said,
               "Mr. Waite, I am greatly obliged to you. At a future time I may be free to make known to you my object
                  for this—as it probably seems to you—rather strange visit. I wish to ask a similar
                  favor of Messrs. Jaques & Co. Do you think they will grant it?"
               "I at least will accompany you with pleasure, if you desire, and open the way,"
                  replied the cotton-dealer, with an air that indicated probable difficulty.
               "Very good," said Drammen. "General, I should be glad to accompany you, but the
                  truth is, Mr. Waite can do more for you than I, and I am therefore glad to resign
                  you into his hands. If convenient to you, I shall be very much pleased to learn if
                  you find all you desire."
               "You shall know, comrade, and many thanks to you," responded the Veteran, shaking
                  him warmly by the hand.
               This large-hearted sailor then returned to his duties at the News Rooms, and the
                  cotton-dealer departed with his charge for the house of Jaques & Co.
               "Jaques is a little sore on the soldier business," said Waite, as he led the way
                  to his brother dealer's rooms. "He's lost money by them."
               "How's that?"
               "Well, the fact is, he got bitten a good deal worse than I did, and all because he
                  would n't believe the South could be subdued. He made money in the first of it
                  because he judged more correctly than a good many others that the South would
                  fight longer than ninety days, and would make downright war of it; so he laid in
                  cotton, and sold at an immense profit. But you see he pinned his faith at the
                  wrong end, when he went about declaring that Sherman would be destroyed, and Grant
                  was a humbug, and Lee would whip them out yet. He lost money by it. Then, again,
                  after Lee's surrender he fastened on the guerillas, and those kind of fellows who
                  started the Ku Klux, and prophesied such a state of anarchy that cotton could n't
                  be raised, which would bring the price up again. But his guerillas were soon
                  disposed of; and I happened to be in the Southwest when this Grand Army of the
                  Republic, that's springing up over the land, settled the Ku Klux business in
                  Mississippi, Tennessee, and thereabouts, as quick as lightning is quicker than a
                  lame cow."
               "Yes, the Grand Army did a good work there," responded the Veteran.
               "It's a fine institution, this Grand Army of the Republic; and for one I think
                  it's high time that the soldiers formed such an organization," continued the
                  cotton-dealer. "I have done what I could for the families of fallen soldiers,
                  because I promised to do so when these brave fellows left them in our charge. But
                  the difficulty is to find them out. They are mostly people who are not given to
                  begging any more than you or I; and it is a fact that many a family, in a most
                  distressing condition, is unwilling to compete with forward beggars, who always
                  stand ready to impose themselves upon the charitable whether they are needy or
                  not. But, as I understand this Grand Army business, they are formed so as to bring
                  organized work into the field, and act, so to speak, as responsible agents of the
                  public, who through them can be sure of giving aid where it belongs, and thus
                  intelligently keep their promises. Certain acquaintances of mine are down on this
                  organization, but between you and me, they did n't do much for the Union; and I
                  happen to know that the families of our fallen braves might go a long way toward
                  starvation before they would get any help from them. This G. A. R., as you call
                  it, has taken root in Boston, and my calculations are out if it does n't flourish
                  like a green bay-tree."
               "I'm pleased to hear you speak, as a citizen, in such strong and just terms of our
                  Order," said the Veteran.
               
               "I take it you're a member, General?"
               "I am. I joined in the West."
               "Glad to know it. Excuse me for saying that my experience with you on the
                  Mississippi assures me that the Order and its objects will not suffer from your
                  hands."
               "I thank you. I shall endeavor to do all that lies in my power for an organization
                  which I know every American, loyal at heart, will sustain when he comes to
                  understand it."
               "True!" responded the cotton-dealer. Then studying the Veteran for a moment, he
                  said to himself, "One such man is enough to give the lie to a thousand vilifiers
                  of the association which he so nobly represents."
               They now arrived at the rooms of Jaques & Co.
               Here the Veteran had another opportunity of observing the peculiar rush and
                  scramble of the cotton brokerage business, which, as one of the results of the
                  war, had been transformed from a business whereby a few strong and influential
                  houses had been built up in the mercantile community, to an occupation in which
                  vastly increased numbers contended, each separate day, for such morsels as might
                  be offered them; though there still remained those old houses to remind one of
                  what had been.
               Jaques, who had been engaged in his private office, soon joined his visitors, and
                  Waite made known the object of their call.
               This speculator had, as Waite had said, lost much money through the courage and
                  pertinacity of the Northern soldier, and the Veteran did not fail to detect an
                  expression of annoyance as he was introduced by his military title.
               "You would like to look at my books? Humph! an unusual request from a stranger,
                  sir."
               "I grant it, Mr. Jaques," said the Veteran with a dignified nified courtesy,
                  which, in combination with the air of nature's royalty that sat upon his face,
                  began at once to affect the somewhat irascible and very suspicious Jaques.
               Jaques was also made to feel, by the presence and manner of this man, that he was
                  likely to make a fool of himself by any useless attempt at "bluff," which
                  speculators are apt to indulge in. He had seen enough of human nature to perceive
                  that his strange visitor was not one to be easily baffled or trifled with; and
                  though himself a strong man, he could not entirely suppress a feeling of
                  admiration, conflicting with his annoyance at sight of a leader of Union soldiery,
                  as he viewed this noble specimen of manhood.
               The Veteran in the mean time contemplated the cotton speculator (such we entitle
                  Jaques in contradistinction to the term cotton dealer as applied to
                  Waite, the latter having always been engaged in cotton as a business, while the
                  former simply took it up after the war opened as a speculation) with the
                  solicitous attention of one who feels that much is at stake, in what he judged
                  might appear to Jaques as an inquisitive and impertinent request, and of a
                  character naturally repugnant to all speculators, especially one of Jaques's
                  business predilections. He questioned to himself whether he should not make known
                  to Jaques what he wished to transcribe from his books, and render his request more
                  simple by asking him to do it for him; but his military experience at once gave
                  the negative, until, at least, he had pushed the speculator to the utmost on the
                  original request; for this experience had made him wary of plots, and all that
                  appertained to them; and, working in the dark as he was, it was impossible for him
                  to judge how far the ramifications of the subtle Garvin's schemes might have
                  extended in the direction of this very speculator, who perhaps held in his books the identical secret,
                  which, if the astute broker had been wise enough to foresee all the possible
                  contingencies connected with his nefarious business (this, however, being where
                  the profoundest scoundrels are weak), he might have provided against by enlisting
                  the speculative Jaques in his interest,—though it is but justice to Jaques to
                  remark, that it could have been done only by means of artful lies, as he was
                  evidently not a man to knowingly assist Garvin in his damnable undertaking.
               "I assure you, sir," he said after a pause, "I would not ask this favor, unusual
                  as it must appear to you, if it did not have to do with important business which I
                  am not at liberty to even hint at just now, but which I pledge you does not
                  compromise nor in the least affect you."
               "Mr. Jaques," interposed Waite, "my experience with General Hammond enables me to
                  indorse, heart and hand, any assurance he may give you. It was he, if you will
                  recollect, who saved me from ruin, down South, in sixty-four."
               The cotton speculator's face relaxed.
               "My friend does not allow himself to forget that," said the Veteran, while a smile
                  flitted over his features. "Please consider it nothing but an officer's duty; who,
                  if he had not been under the fear of a court-martial, might have demanded half the
                  proceeds of that venture of Mr. Waite's as a condition of performing it."
               Waite shook his head, and Jaques's face relaxed yet more.
               "I believe," continued the Veteran, perceiving this to be the moment for the final
                  charge, "that you will grant me the favor when I tell you that perhaps it may lead
                  to as important results in behalf of others, whom I cannot now name, as was the
                  result of my official action in behalf of our friend, Mr. Waite. Come to me, sir,
                  and ask to look over my own books as an idle pastime, or from some private motive
                  which I am not sure will not compromise me, and you may depend upon a positive
                  denial; but assure me, as a man of honor, that much good to others may result, and
                  that it shall not affect me in the least, and, sir, you shall be welcome to look
                  from beginning to end."
               The cotton speculator, whose eyes had been riveted on the Veteran's commanding
                  features, which sent forth the influence of his strong will as he spoke, now gave
                  vent to a quick, yielding laugh.
               "General," he said, "I make no pretence of love for the Northern soldier; on the
                  other hand, I owe him a grudge. But you have prevailed, and what no outsider has
                  done yet I'll permit you to do. You can look at my books."
               "Thank you. I simply desire to look at your invoices for the summer and fall of
                  1864."
               "Look through the whole if you want to," laughed Jaques, who only offered another
                  example of the effective power of the Veteran's magnetic will. Then ordering one
                  of the book-keepers to furnish his visitor with what he desired, he entered into
                  conversation with his friend, the cotton-dealer.
               The Veteran being furnished with the entries of arrivals, turned to August 25th,
                  1864.
               At the instant his eye fell upon the record Jaques happened to glance toward
                  him.
               "Waite!" he exclaimed under his breath, "look at your friend, the General!"
               The cotton-dealer looked, and he with Jaques beheld the Veteran with his eye
                  seeming to pour out his whole great soul upon the page before him, and then
                  suddenly change to an expression which, to their astonished gaze, seemed
                     fraught with impending retribution
                  to some object of his thoughts; while his right hand, with which he had turned the
                  leaves, was clenched as if he held a sabre in his grasp.
               This was only for a moment. As suddenly as they had before changed, his features
                  now assumed that air of settled sternness, so habitual to them when he
                  contemplated the accomplishment of important work demanding powerful will and
                  energy.
               Then he took his memorandum-book, and they saw him copy the record with a motion
                  of his pencil which seemed at each stroke as though it must leave a mark that
                  could never be effaced.
               When he had finished transcribing he scanned both original and copy with great
                  care, as if each separate line were an object of his scrutiny, and then closed the
                  book with an action as though he would securely shut the page from the curious
                  eyes of men.
               That evening, after notifying his comrade at the Exchange as he had promised, he
                  took the express-train for New York.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               WHILE plots and counter-plots are opposing each other under the direction of minds
                  subtle, powerful, and persevering, we will visit the present abode of wretched
                  unfortunates who have indirectly fallen victims to the machinations of one of
                  these minds.
               We enter Baxter Street, and ascend a dilapidated tenement, in front of which a
                  crowd of ragged and dirty children are amusing themselves by hooting after a
                  drunkard, every now and then one bolder than the rest running up and pelting him
                  with handfuls of the filth and garbage which here reek with pestilential
                  odors.
               We mount flight after flight, the banisters here and there broken away, and
                  threatening each moment to yield under our hands, while the rickety stairs shake
                  beneath our weight at every step.
               Finally after occasional halts, from an instinctive fear that the stairs are
                  really about to give way beneath us, we reach the attic floor of the tenement,
                  where we perceive two doors hanging so loosely to their hinges and fastenings that
                  a child, if he should desire to enter as a burglar, could break them down with his
                  slight weight.
               We knock at the first door. There is no response. We glance through the cracks,
                  and judging it is empty, we do not lift the latch, but proceed to the second
                  door.
               We knock at this also. Presently it is opened, and we step into the midst of one
                  of those scenes of woe which in the great city of New York abound in such pitiable
                  numbers, and yet of which comparatively so few are known to those who would reduce
                  them.
               In a low garret, not more than twelve feet square, the roof broken and gaping, and
                  the shattered skylight scarcely admitting one dull ray through the mass of old
                  rags and paper which bulge from the warped sashes, while a cold, drizzling rain
                  imparts a penetrating chill to the noxious air,—in this fireless, exposed and
                  almost sunless garret were huddled together the unfortunate family of the soldier
                  Joseph Deering.
               In one corner, on an old tattered mattress, lay an emaciated lad, hardly covered
                  by the rags which served as a quilt, whom it would be difficult to recognize as
                  that noble boy we have formerly seen to sustain the spirits of his mother with
                  such exemplary fortitude, and on whom his little sisters had learned to look as a
                  protector.
               
               Bending over him is his mother, scarcely less emaciated than himself, giving him a
                  drink from a stained earthen mug, while at the foot of the mattress sits Mary and
                  the little crippled sister, shivering under their scanty clothes, their childish
                  faces gaunt with want and starvation. The garments of mother and children seem in
                  perfect keeping with the dreary garret, so worn, so thin, and tattered are
                  they.
               The soul yearns to fly to their rescue, and the heart bleeds in the contemplation
                  of this harrowing scene. But we cannot help them, for it is only by our mental
                  vision that we behold them. Solid feet of flesh and blood must ascend those
                  shaking stairs; a real hand must raise the broken latch; a face that actually
                  pales at sight of this group, and eyes that actually see them, and fill with
                  pitying tears, must appear at the dilapidated door before aid can come to
                  them.
               Misfortune has driven these unhappy beings downward with a swift and relentless
                  hand. Since we last beheld them their course to this appalling stage of
                  destitution has been like a benighted traveller tumbling headlong down some rugged
                  precipice.
               Sickness had seized the mother while they lived on the Bowery, and, unable to pay
                  the rent of even these dingy lodgings, they were compelled to take yet meaner
                  quarters. Here they had just begun to eke out a miserable existence through the
                  little that Joseph was able to earn by vending candy on the New Jersey Central
                  Road, when this devoted boy was himself prostrated, and they were heartlessly
                  driven forth, the mother wan, emaciated, broken-hearted, and poor Joseph stooping,
                  tottering, and nearly blind with his fever, to find a refuge in this cold and
                  gloomy garret, where starvation has caught them in its tightening gripe, and Death
                  stands waiting with his grim and sombre presence.
               When Mrs. Deering was taken sick Joseph went to West Twenty-Seventh Street to see
                  Mrs. Paige, whom he had not visited for several weeks, but on whom he had promised
                  to call at the time he announced to her his situation as candy-vender, if they
                  should be threatened with new difficulties; for though Allen Paige's widow was
                  then suffering from the effects of her interview with Cringar and Garvin, she did
                  not forget the family of that other soldier who had fallen in the same cause which
                  had claimed the life of her own husband.
               This sensitive boy was met at the door, as was the Veteran, by the man, who had,
                  in his youthful mind, seemed the incarnation of those diabolical fiends of which
                  he had often read in his story-books.
               "Boy!" cried Garvin, who, on opening the door, beheld the lad that had so
                  penetrated his guilty conscience with his look on his former visit to this
                  house,—"boy! what do you want here?"
               Joseph was nigh staggering backward down the steps, as he was thus greeted by the
                  voice and visage of this malevolent being, whose presence was so abhorrent to his
                  sensitive mind. Steadying himself, however, he asked in a tone which, though
                  determined, quivered with his emotions,—
               "Is Mrs. Paige within?"
               "Mrs. Paige, you young vagabond!" replied the broker, showing his teeth. "What do
                  you mean by your impertinence? Mrs. Paige is poorer than you are—do you
                  understand?—and is probably begging!—do you understand me, boy?" (Joseph stood
                  staring with amazement and grief, but could utter no response.) "And be off with
                  you and do likewise! but dare to come here again to do it and I'll shut you up in
                  jail!"
               
               "She don't live here, then?" stammered Joseph, who was determined to have an
                  answer to his question, notwithstanding his injured pride, his grief and
                  confusion.
               "You young scapegrace!" exclaimed Garvin, showing a few more of his teeth, "this
                  house is occupied by me! Did I not just tell you that she was poorer than you are?
                  No, you impudent soldier's cub, she does not live here! She lodges as you do!—Be
                  off!"
               "Where—"
               Before Joseph, who had wonderful persistence, could say any more, Garvin slammed
                  the door in his face, and the confounded boy heard his vindictive footsteps
                  receding through the hall.
               When Mrs. Deering heard from the lips of her son the recital of what we have just
                  related, her heart beat in sympathy and sorrow for those who had been in the past
                  so kind to them, and her own trials were for the moment forgotten in the thought
                  of their probable sufferings; and the first impulse was to urge her boy to try if
                  he could not make enough at his candy-vending and occasional choring to enable
                  them to offer some return to these friends, who in their prosperity had been so
                  kind to them.
               But, alas! Joseph's sickness forbade even the first effort toward carrying out so
                  noble an impulse, and now, instead of proffering a testimonial of their gratitude
                  to those who had so often aided them, they are presented to our eyes in a state of
                  such deep despair that it would seem as if thoughts of the world around them had
                  ceased to move their souls.
               At the instant our gaze fell upon them the mother was moistening the parched lips
                  of her boy with water from the earthen mug. She knelt by the side of the tattered
                  mattress, which was stretched on the floor, there being no bed or other furniture
                  except a single broken chair.
               Joseph, whose head she slightly raised, took a little of the water, and then fell
                  back exhausted and painfully gasping.
               Mrs. Deering passed her thin, worn hand over his forehead.
               He turned his eyes toward her, and even in his helpless condition his tender
                  filial care and affection displayed itself.
               "Mother," he murmured, scarcely able to speak above a whisper, while his voice was
                  broken by his ominous gasps, "your poor—thin arm trembles—very much. Don't please
                  trouble—yourself any—more for me."
               This arm was the one on which she rested, as she bent over him.
               The mother remained silent, her arm still trembling under its but too slight
                  weight, while her hollow eyes looked as if tears had ceased to flow from their
                  exhausted fountains.
               Joseph again spoke.
               "Thank you,—dear mother.—I—feel—better—now"; and then with an effort that sadly
                  contradicted his words, he turned his head away, and lay like one dying.
               She withdrew the hand, and letting it drop mechanically upon the mattress, raised
                  her tearless eyes to heaven.
               Her appearance at this moment would have excited in the breast of the beholder the
                  deepest commiseration. Kneeling there on the floor of that desolate garret, with
                  either hand resting on the torn mattress, her thin, gaunt form bent with
                  suffering, while it perceptibly shivered with the cold, damp, penetrating air, and
                  her sick boy lying before her wasted nigh unto death with both fever and
                     starvation vation,—all this was of a
                  character to awaken in the soul the profoundest pity, not unmingled with a feeling
                  as if death in this group was making itself visible. But as the gaze rested on her
                  upturned eyes, there was presented in the whole a picture in which was realized
                  the appalling solemnity of the spirit, still confined within its earthly
                  tabernacle, reaching out beyond the dark presence of impending death, and pouring
                  forth the awful anguish of its tearless, almost emotionless despair into that
                  invisible world, which seemed to have closed in upon her while the visible had
                  receded from her presence.
               The endless turmoil of the great metropolis, the struggles of ambition, the strife
                  for wealth, all vain displays, and acts of hardened pride, pass in imagination by
                  this silent figure of despair, and in the contrast appear an empty, mocking
                  train,—shadows, as it were, before the dread reality.
               A human being, driven by incessant blows of misfortune to the uttermost depths of
                  poverty and desolation, in the midst of a great community, as hopeless of aid as
                  the dying wanderer lost in some boundless desert, is an object that never fails to
                  move the most hardened heart,—unless it be of some monster who may have worked for
                  the accomplishment of this very end,—and the cry of sympathy and horror which goes
                  up throughout the land, when such a case is discovered and made known, is the
                  strongest evidence that the great public heart is equal to the prevention, through
                  charity, of this suffering, if efficient means are but adopted to bring it before
                  the public eye.
               As this desolate and dying mother of sick and dying children thus remains without
                  motion, her eyes cast toward heaven with the glassiness of that last terrible
                  moment, when the soul prepares itself for insanity or death, the heart of one who
                  looks upon this scene is torn with sympathetic grief.
               By one of those coincidences which so often occur, and which seem to have assigned
                  to them a special part in the great drama of humanity, we see the two mothers of
                  the soldiers' families which occupy so prominent a place in our narration, each
                  brought first to a state of privation by the death of the husband and father, and
                  then plunged into the darkness of sorrow by the dangerous illness of her darling
                  boy. But, oh! if Mrs. Paige, when her heart was wellnigh breaking with grief,
                  could have had suddenly revealed to her by the hand of Heaven the appalling
                  anguish of this other soldier's widow, her heart would have forgotten its own
                  agony in pity for her sister's woe.
               While this unhappy widow of the soldier—whose bones were mouldering near the spot
                  where he fell in defence of the Union—was thus transfixed by her mute despair, her
                  dying boy lay silent, as he had turned when she withdrew her hand from his
                  head.
               Presently he turned back sufficiently to cast his feeble glance upon his mother.
                  As he did so his gaze became suddenly fastened on her uplifted face, and two tears
                  commenced rolling down his emaciated cheeks.
               "Mother!" he uttered in his weak, gasping tones, "dear mother! look on your boy
                  Joseph!"
               The mother continued for an instant fixed in the attitude in which Joseph had
                  beheld her. Then a quiver shook her frame, and her glassy eyes were directed to
                  her boy.
               A divine smile rested on his worn and pallid countenance; and while the tears were
                  slowly stealing down his cheeks, his eyes beamed with a light that seemed the
                  reflection of heaven.
               
               When she looked down upon him he turned his gaze upward, and in a voice which,
                  though labored, was pervaded by an ineffable sweetness, he said,—
               "Dear mother, God is near!"
               The poor woman continued to look at him with tearless eyes, while her body bent
                  gradually toward him.
               He again turned his gaze upon her, and his heavenfull eye beamed into hers.
               At that instant she thought she heard angels singing in the air above her. Through
                  the broken roof the heavenly visitors seemed to come and go,—coming to behold, and
                  going to bring others that they might see her boy Joseph, who was so much like
                  them; who, ever being so near to God, could never know the chastisement of
                  despair.
               Her eyes were fastened upon his for a while, dry and with no motion of the lids,
                  while all the time the presence of the angels seemed to her a beautiful
                  reality.
               "Mother," again said Joseph, "father is very near to us!"
               On the utterance of these words the mother's lids began to relax, dampness
                  suffused those eyes which had given such dread signs of an impending mortal wreck,
                  and lifting her right hand from the mattress she placed it on Joseph's head. Then,
                  as the tears slowly welled up from those fountains which had so long refused their
                  blessed relief, she looked above, and in tones nearly as weak as her boy's, but
                  strong in their fervor, she solemnly invoked upon him the blessings of an
                  ever-watchful Heaven.
               And then slowly her hand settled upon the roll that served the sick boy for a
                  pillow, and her head bent gradually down, the tears now coming thick and fast,
                  while the angelic company above seemed departing with songs of prophetic joy.
               Yielding at length to the full sway of her long pent-up emotions, the now
                  profoundly agitated mother laid her head beside that of her boy, and gave vent to
                  an outburst of weeping.
               Suddenly Joseph, whose hearing was at the present time preternaturally acute, gave
                  a quick start, and slightly raising his head bent it forward to listen.
               "It inquires for us," he faintly exclaimed.
               The mother looked up, and wiping the tears from her eyes, gazed upon her son with
                  an expression of alarm, for she thought he heard those voices which presage
                  death.
               Mary and the little crippled Etta, who, overcome with cold and hunger, had been
                  shivering and silent witnesses of the foregoing scene, also stared upon Joseph as
                  he started up so suddenly and uttered words so wild.
               "What do you hear, my son?" said the mother, soothingly.
               "The voice. It inquires for Mrs. Deering, and—he is coming!"
               As Joseph uttered these words his hollow eyes opened wide, and were directed with
                  an intense gaze toward the door.
               The mother cast one quick glance to heaven, and then directing her gaze also
                  toward the door, she listened intently.
               Soon she heard energetic footsteps ascending the stairs below.
               They reached the second landing, and then stopped.
               Then a female voice cried out,—
               "You must go to the top!"
               Again the steps were heard ascending, the frail stairs creaking as they
                  mounted.
               In another moment they resounded on the floor outside, and then the latch was
                  raised, and a man with a kind, hearty face opened the door.
               
               He started back, and his countenance assumed a look of horror.
               "Great God!" he exclaimed. "Is this a soldier's family?"
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               WE will pass to another scene. About five o'clock on the afternoon of the second
                  day following the visit of the Veteran to Boston, Daniel Garvin had just crossed
                  from Brooklyn by the Fulton Ferry, and was going up the slip, when he felt himself
                  plucked by the sleeve. He turned, and beheld the anxious features of Baling, the
                  cotton speculator.
               "A moment with you, if you can possibly spare it," he said in a low, hasty
                  voice.
               Garvin at once led the way to the waiting-room.
               "What is it?" inquired Garvin in a tone indicating a mind ill at ease, as soon as
                  they had seated themselves in a distant part of the room.
               "Jaques & Co. have had a visitor this week."
               "Jaques & Co.?"
               "Cotton-dealers in Boston."
               "What of them?" demanded Garvin, in a startled voice of apprehension.
               "They bought Paige's cotton of Peeling & Co."
               The broker's face grew dark.
               "Who called on them?"
               "Jaques, who was in my place this morning, and who, you are aware, knows nothing
                  of this Paige affair—"
               "The man who called is what I want."
               "I am coming to it. Jaques was talking about business affairs in Boston, when
                  presently he commenced telling me of this visitor—"
               "Who?—who was the man?"
               "He described him as a tall man, of imposing appearance, with a deep scar on his
                  face, introduced to him by Waite, a brother dealer, as General Hammond," replied
                  Baling, casting on Garvin a glance full of significance.
               The broker audibly ground his teeth.
               "He said," continued Baling, "that this General Hammond was very anxious to look
                  at his cotton entries for the summer and fall of 1864, and that he was determined
                  to refuse at first; but the man had such a commanding and seductive way with him,
                  besides having saved his friend Waite from ruin in the South during the war—"
               "That he let him look!" again interrupted Garvin with a malignant, yet
                  apprehensive sneer.
               "He did."
               "No more! Not a moment is to be lost!" And the broker hastened from the
                  waiting-room, that grinding step having now mingled with it evidences of
                  nervousness and confusion.
               "May every Union soldier, sound or crippled, be cursed, if there is a God to curse
                  them!" muttered this inwardly quaking blasphemer, as he pursued his way up Fulton
                  Street. "This presumptuous giant thinks, then, to crush me under his clumsy
                  carcass! We will see!" Then rubbing his forehead with a rapid and savage-like
                  motion for an instant, he said with fierce impatience, "His first move? Where does
                  he strike?"
               For a few moments he seemed in perplexed thought. Then suddenly increasing his
                  already rapid step into a long stride, he exclaimed,—
               
               "Cringar, you grovelling imbecile! if he has put on the screws and you have given
                  in with your idiotic snivelling, woe be to you! I'll soon put you under
                  inspection!"
               
               It is about an hour previous to the foregoing scene. The reader is introduced into
                  the private office of Jonas Cringar.
               The merchant is now given to long spells of lonely ruminations, if by such a term
                  can be called the silent but terrible chastisements of remorse that hold him like
                  one petrified with horror, and presents to his guilty soul those pictures which
                  only remorse can summon to the inward eye.
               But terrible as were these inflictions of a violated conscience, they did not
                  alone operate to reduce this victim of another's wiles to his present wretched and
                  miserable condition. Over him was continually held the lash of fear by the
                  unrelenting Garvin.
               In the hands of the ever-watchful broker was held the damning evidence of crime,
                  by which his irretrievable ruin could be compassed at any moment. But besides the
                  forgery Garvin always carried in his breast-pocket, to which pocket we have seen
                  him direct the eyes of the cowering merchant at certain stages of their former
                  interviews, this master of atrocious schemes held another source of power by which
                  to govern his abject accomplice.
               It will be recollected that among other criminal acts committed by Jonas Cringar,
                  in that downward course in speculation which had been directed by the treacherous
                  broker, was the defalcation of forty thousand dollars, as treasurer of the Bald
                  Eagle Silver Mining Company. This defalcation, the reader will also remember,
                  Garvin was to help Cringar provide against, in consideration of what, with a sort
                  of grim humor, he termed unsuccessful ventures with him in Wall Street, and for
                  the base work he was expected to perform in the future.
               As will be readily seen, the broker's own interest demanded that this defalcation
                  be shielded from discovery; for inasmuch as the merchant, as Allen Paige's
                  partner, was the chief and most reliable instrument in his hands for the
                  accomplishment of his infamous purpose, it was necessary that Cringar's credit,
                  before the world, should remain untarnished. He had, therefore, purchased stock in
                  the Bald Eagle Company, and, through his powerful influence, first been made a
                  Director, and then by those means which all who have been intimately connected
                  with joint-stock companies will readily comprehend, the payment of dividends was
                  postponed, and time secured for such manipulations as were necessary to accomplish
                  his object.
               But this arch schemer was not so simple as to keep his promise made to the ruined
                  merchant, that he would, by giving him credit for margins, put him on the up grade
                  of speculative profits, and thus enable him to relieve himself of his terrible
                  financial embarrassment. On the other hand, he continued to hold him over the same
                  gulf above which he dangled in the opening of our story, while he compelled his
                  tongue and hands to move like some wretched automaton, at the bidding of his own
                  will.
               As the reader is now ushered into his presence, Jonas Cringar sits lost to the
                  existence of the outer world, and looks more than usually haggard and
                  abstracted.
               His mind has been more frequently buried than ever in the deep gloom of criminal
                  darkness and remorse, since the fearful interview with Daniel Garvin, at the
                  latter's office, which we last recorded.
               In the midst of the appalling blasphemy of the broker, combined as it was with expressions, threats, and
                  an appearance, calculated to drive almost to frenzy his already shattered mind,
                  the merchant now ever in his tormenting imagination heard the laughter peal, and
                  saw the impish face of simple Sal, as it was horribly presented to his startled
                  gaze, pressed against the window-pane; while from the mouth issued that song of
                  idiotic gibberish, which to his guilty spirit seemed fraught with the prophecy of
                  doom.
               As he now sits before us, his torturing fancies revert again and again to this
                  scene. The laughter, the face, the song are incessantly in his ears and before his
                  eyes; and ever and anon he repeats those words, which, sung by a mischievous
                  idiot, have power to haunt his guilty soul as if uttered by unearthly voices,— 
                     
                        "My gentle sirs, be very kind!
                        
                           Your candle's out,
                        
                           My gentle sirs!
                        YOU'LL BE FOUND OUT,
                        MY GENTLE SIRS!
                        
                           But gentle me you cannot find!"
                     
                  
               
               While an outraged conscience was thus lashing this unhappy merchant's soul, a
                  visitor entered the outer counting-room who seemed to have come at this particular
                  hour by command of the dread Nemesis.
               It was the Veteran.
               Billings, the book-keeper, was at that moment the only person in the
                  counting-room.
               He stepped forward, took the Veteran's hand, and in a low voice said,—
               "He is within, and has given orders, as usual, not to be interrupted. He's growing
                  worse every day. I really think we have reason to pity him."
               "Sinful as he has been, he has evidently been sinned against," returned the
                  Veteran, gravely. "I would see him at once."
               "That you shall, orders or no orders. He has been particularly blue to-day, and
                  I'm inclined to think he's in a good condition to come under your hands."
               With this the book-keeper opened the door of the private office.
               Cringar, who was at the instant repeating the idiot's prophecy for the fiftieth
                  time, heard the turning of the door-knob, and gazed up with a startled frown. But
                  instantly he beheld the grand and severe countenance of the Veteran he sank back
                  in his chair, while an expression of abject terror displayed itself on his
                  cadaverous visage.
               A description of this stern, battle-scarred stranger had been given the now
                  trembling merchant by Daniel Garvin, who, from the hour he was confronted by him
                  in the house which he had robbed from the family of his half-brother, could not
                  shake from his mind the profound conviction that in that visitor, whose glance had
                  for the second time caused him to quail, he had found a dangerous and untiring
                  foe, against whom it was necessary for his victimized and unskilled accomplice to
                  be warned.
               The Veteran closed the door, and stood contemplating the terrified wretch in
                  silence.
               The merchant could not remove his gaze from the deep, searching eye that was upon
                  him, which he felt to be reading his guilty soul to its innermost depths; and as
                  his visitor sustained his own gaze, his eye seeming each moment to increase in its
                  penetrating power, this miserable man began to feel as if oppressed by some
                  frightful nightmare, and his whole being seemed ready to give vent to one
                  prolonged cry.
               At length the Veteran seated himself, and still sternly contemplating the terror-stricken merchant, he said
                  in a low deep voice, which to his auditor's ears sounded like the voice of his
                  inexorable judge,—
               "Is this Jonas Cringar, executor of the estate of Allen Paige?"
               The merchant appeared incapable of speaking, for his voice seemed lost in the
                  gaze, which still remained riveted, as if frozen with nightmare, on his visitor's
                  judge-like visage.
               The Veteran repeated his inquiry,—
               "Is this Jonas Cringar, executor of the estate of Allen Paige?"
               On the repetition of this question Jonas Cringar aroused himself, and in a
                  subdued, broken voice answered,—
               "That is my name."
               "You have associated with you one Daniel Garvin, broker?"
               Instantly the sound of Daniel Garvin's name fell on his ears the merchant
                  experienced, in an extraordinary manner, the effect of another power in opposition
                  to that now exerted by his questioner. It was the power of him whose name had been
                  pronounced.
               It at once served to bring fear into opposition with fright. On the utterance of
                  the name, Cringar instinctively withdrew his eye from the Veteran's, and cast a
                  hasty, startled glance at the window. Then rising he went to this window and gave
                  the curtain a twitch, though it was already drawn, and then with a sweeping stare
                  around the room he resumed his seat, while the perspiration began to appear from
                  the internal commotion into which the presence of the Veteran and the utterance of
                  the broker's name had precipitated him.
               The Veteran did not fail to observe closely this sudden display of a conflicting
                  fear; he surmised the cause of it, and immediately made up his mind how he should
                  act.
               "Mr. Cringar," he said, in a modulated and yet dignified tone, "am I not justly
                  informed that yourself and Daniel Garvin are executors of the late Allen Paige's
                  estate?"
               "I must refer you, sir," answered Cringar, with a sort of desperate firmness, "to
                  Mr. Garvin, if you wish information on this business."
               "Indeed, Mr. Cringar, I had supposed, you having been Mr. Paige's partner, and I
                  also having been given to understand that your relations with him were very
                  intimate, that I could obtain certain information from you of all others."
               As the Veteran uttered this speech, he had allowed his voice and manner to
                  approach gradually that degree of depth and severity which he had momentarily
                  relinquished.
               The merchant felt this change, but the stormy visage of Daniel Garvin, together
                  with that repulsive hand directed to the side-pocket in which he carried his large
                  wallet, came up before him, and casting another glance toward the curtained
                  window, he said with peevish impatience,—
               "When Mr. Paige was living I knew more than any one else about his business; but
                  now he is dead, you must go to another man."
               "Jonas Cringar!" exclaimed the Veteran in a voice of vast but subdued power, "does
                  not the dead Allen Paige sometimes engage your guilty thoughts?" And leaning his
                  massive form slightly forward, his face assumed that appearance of overwhelming
                  power we have formerly witnessed, while his stern gray eye was bent on the
                  merchant with a look before which this gasping wretch shrank as from the eye of
                  Heaven.
               Blanching to a deadly pallidness, Jonas Cringar stared upon the Veteran with open
                  mouth, his haggard features drawn, and
                  slightly quivering. The avenging spirit of his former partner seemed to his
                  frenzied imagination to be lending his supernatural aid to the power of that
                  annihilating gaze. Mechanically reaching for the arms of the large chair in which
                  he sat, he grasped them in his long bony fingers, which trembled as if stricken
                  with palsy.
               "Allen Paige!" he gasped,—"what do you know of the dead Allen Paige?"
               The Veteran did not answer, but continued that terrible gaze, which seemed
                  scorching the merchant's soul, and rolling it up like a heated parchment.
               For an instant Jonas Cringar, by a sort of preternatural fascination, lost sight
                  of the definite form and features of his terrible visitor; and in their place
                  there appeared to his guilt-distorted fancy the image of Allen Paige, casting upon
                  him that last expiring look, that mute appeal, which had haunted him by day and by
                  night, until he were ready to cry from depths, compared to which the effort of the
                  actor on the stage is but simple mouthing,—
               "STILL IT CRIED, SLEEP NO MORE!"
               At length his gaping mouth spasmodically closed itself, and then in a suppressed,
                  but agonized voice, he shrieked,—
               "Allen! before God, my heart was not guilty!"
               This seemed to break the spell. Immediately those haunting, ghostly features
                  vanished, and in their place still remained, confronting him, the silent,
                  immovable, and sombre visage of his visitor.
               His hands relaxed their hold of the arms of his chair, and then with a profound
                  sigh, in which was mingled the ejaculation, "O my God!" he carried them to his
                  face.
               The Veteran still remained silent.
               Suddenly the merchant sprang to his feet, and with another other of those
                  frightened glances at the window, he broke into a storm of invective, pouring out
                  upon the Veteran a torrent of insane fury.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVIII.
               THE Veteran sat beneath Jonas Cringar's sudden and unexpected attack with the same
                  calmness with which he had, day after day, sat in his saddle in the midst of Rebel
                  shot and shell. He was a profound student of the human soul, and accordingly did
                  not fail to understand the symptoms of the merchant's insane fury; and we cannot
                  better liken this remarkable scene than to the maddened waves dashing in foam and
                  spray against some lofty rock-ribbed cliff.
               Finally Cringar was on the verge of being overcome by his own foaming rage, which
                  was lashed on by pictures of the impending vengeance of Daniel Garvin. He
                  evidently realized this, and with one last effort he advanced upon his silent
                  visitor with clenched fist, and in a voice to be compared only to the frenzied
                  utterance of men, who, overcome in battle by rage and fright, will rush with
                  gaping mouth and wide-stretched eyes upon the bayonet or sabre-point, he
                  cried,—
               "Liar! spy! insulter of a weak and broken man! begone!—begone I say! or I'll give
                  you into the hands of the police!"
               "Hush!" commanded the object of this outburst in a calm, admonitory voice, at the
                  same time waving his hand toward the door,—"hush! or you will be heard!"
               
               "I care not! Your black-mail game has failed here! so be gone! Be off, I say!"
               The door at this moment was slightly opened, and Billings, the book-keeper, looked
                  in.
               The Veteran now rose, and drawing a paper from his pocket, he put his mouth to
                  Cringar's ear and exclaimed in a voice of muttering thunder,—
               "Shall I proclaim your guilt in the open ears of the entire city!" Then presenting
                  the paper to his astounded gaze he said, "This is my evidence!"
               The merchant dropped into his chair as from a stroke of electricity, and the
                  book-keeper softly closed the door.
               It seemed the fate of this miserable man to have some damning written evidence of
                  his crimes thrust before his eyes, at the moment of arousing himself to the
                  highest pitch of what, to his frenzied mind, might perchance have appeared
                  annihilating fury. The reader will recollect that the destroying evidence in the
                  hands of Daniel Garvin overwhelmed him under somewhat similar circumstances.
               This was the paper which we have just seen produce so remarkable an effect on the
                  astounded merchant:—
               "One hundred eleven (111) Bales of Cotton, bought by
                  F. Jaques & Co., Boston, of A. M. Peerling & Co., Brokers, New York,
                  August 23d, 1864.
               "MARKS, A. N. Z."
               The Veteran proceeded quietly to open another paper, and holding it before Cringar
                  said in a calm voice,—
               "Here is a list of quotations, dating from August 1st to October 1st."
               The merchant looked at this list mechanically for a moment ment, and then falling
                  back in a sort of stupor, scalding tears began to trickle down his haggard cheeks,
                  and in a voice of unutterable despair he exclaimed,—
               "My God! the idiot's song! Who can save me now!"
               "Confide in me, and I will do my utmost for you," said the Veteran.
               Cringar did not seem to hear at first; but continued in a half-conscious state,
                  while the tears slowly forced themselves from his weary, bloodshot eyes.
               The Veteran contemplated this human wreck with sentiments of sincere
                  commiseration.
               At length the merchant looked up in the midst of his tears, and, as if he had but
                  just heard the assurance addressed to him, said,—
               "You will help me, do you say?"
               "Yes. I pledge you my word that if you will but confide in me, and reveal all you
                  know of this business, I will spare no effort to shield you from such harm as it
                  is in the power of man to prevent."
               "Your name?"
               This brief question was uttered in an indescribable voice.
               "Julius Hammond."
               "Julius Hammond?" repeated the merchant, who began to show signs of returning
                  life. "General of Union cavalry?"
               "The same."
               "I have heard of you. Your honor and humanity I cannot doubt."
               As Jonas Cringar uttered these words he dropped his head, closed his eyes, and
                  drawing a long heavy sigh, seemed lost, for the time being, to all that surrounded
                  him.
               The Veteran had not miscalculated.
               
               The striking appearance of his physiognomy, as observed by Jaques and Waite while
                  he was copying the entry from the former's book, will be remembered by the reader.
                  It presaged danger to those he was arrayed against. From that entry he bore away
                  with him a weapon which in his hands was destined, as we have seen, to be
                  formidable. Having, from the descriptions given him, formed a clear conception of
                  the character and present moral and mental condition of Jonas Cringar, he did not
                  deem it necessary to further risk exposing his plans to the enemy by an attempt to
                  gain added information of Peeling & Co., whom he perceived by the entry to
                  have been the New York brokers that sold to Jaques & Co., but determined to
                  move at once upon the shattered merchant, calculating with a judgment that had
                  often confounded the Rebels at the moment they saw victory perching on their
                  banners, that he could by an opening charge so demoralize the object of his
                  attack, as, at the right moment, to overwhelm him with the evidence he now
                  possessed. We have witnessed the result.
               The potent mental force which he brought to bear upon the weakened and distracted
                  mind of Jonas Cringar was aided in a remarkable degree by the superstitious and
                  guilty terror with which, as we have seen, his thoughts had almost incessantly
                  reverted to the song of Simple Sal, and pictured it as the prophecy of an
                  impending doom; so that when, at the height of his crazy reaction, his accuser
                  with crushing power suddenly confronted him with the paper, whose contents we have
                  transcribed, his diseased fancy instantaneously conjured up the hideous face of
                  the singing idiot grinning from the midst of the writing before him, while into
                  his soul seemed to thunder the judgment he had dreaded with such awful
                  premonition. This state of frenzied commotion did not at first permit him to
                  question tion whether his visitor could compass his and Garvin's downfall by means
                  of this evidence; the picture of certain retribution and final ruin, as held in
                  the hands of this strange man, was the only object presented to his mental
                  vision.
               But as he now sat with head dropped and eyes closed, he realized that this man
                  pitied him, and his mind began confusedly to revolve the situation into which he
                  found himself so suddenly and unexpectedly thrown.
               At length the Veteran broke the silence.
               "Mr. Cringar," he said, in a low, soothing voice, with a tenderness singularly
                  characteristic of men of his physical and mental power, "the evidence I hold in my
                  possession is for the purpose of saving a wronged family from the fate to which a
                  heartless and unprincipled man would consign them. This man I propose to punish,
                  but not you. You have done great wrong to this family, but you can atone for
                  it."
               These words penetrated to the depths of the merchant's heart. He was moved by an
                  almost overpowering impulse to throw himself before the Veteran like a child, and
                  utter aloud all that was passing within him.
               But a remarkable revulsion took place.
               Suddenly opening his eyes he rose to his feet, and with one more of those fearful
                  glances at the curtained window, he exclaimed in a frenzied voice, at the same
                  time smiting his breast,—
               "O God! how that reckless act has bound me here!"
               The Veteran gazed upon him in astonishment.
               Cringar instantly reseated himself and sat for a while in silence, startled by his
                  own outburst. Then after another internal struggle he addressed the Veteran.
               "General Hammond," he said, "I am in the power of a man who, so long as he holds that power, can and
                  will destroy me the instant it is for his interest to do so. I pray you believe
                  me, sir, when I say that I am ready to do everything I possibly can, even to the
                  giving of my life if necessary—and God knows it would not be giving much now!—to
                  atone for the part I have taken in wronging the family of my former partner, whom,
                  sir, I esteemed and loved." His voice was here choked; controlling his emotions,
                  he went on: "But, sir, this man, Daniel Garvin, of whom you have just spoken,
                  carries constantly about him a paper by which he can crush me at any moment, and
                  render useless any attempt you may make through me to restore to their rights
                  those whom he, with my constrained assistance, has so wickedly defrauded."
               "What is the nature of this paper?"
               "A note."
               "Only a note?"
               "An indorsement."
               "Simply an indorsement?"
               "To you alone I tell it: an indorsement forged by my hand."
               The Veteran did not speak.
               "A reckless act; done, sir, in a moment of desperation, when threatened with ruin
                  by speculation, as many another criminal act has been done by many another man in
                  this city within these past few years. I realized not what I was doing, General
                  Hammond, until it was done."
               The merchant then confessed to the Veteran the manner in which he had been led on
                  to his ruin, through the agency of speculation, by Daniel Garvin, and was then
                  made use of to carry out the broker's long-contemplated plot against the name and
                  family of Allen Paige.
               In the course of this confession Cringar conveyed to his listener a full idea of
                  the position which Garvin then occupied, the power he wielded, the manner in which
                  he held the Paige estate, and the instrumentalities he had at command in
                  connection with it.
               The Veteran, as will be readily imagined, lent to this recital an earnest
                  attention. His comprehensive mind grasped the whole situation as Cringar unfolded
                  the details that composed it. He perceived that, whatever might be the ultimate
                  result of his other criminal acts, in the unfortunate forgery, of which Cringar
                  had been so recklessly guilty, lay an insuperable barrier to his progress, so long
                  as it remained in the hands of Daniel Garvin. He saw at a glance, that the subtle
                  broker had so marshalled his other forces, that if Cringar, whom he evidently had
                  never trusted, should finally threaten to be dangerous, he could instantly destroy
                  him by means of the damning evidence of crime he possessed, and then hold his
                  position against all "babbling" he might indulge in. This leader of cavalry had
                  not been unobservant of the labyrinthian courses of the law. That possession was
                  "nine points" of it he was very thoroughly convinced, especially when this
                  possession was backed up by moneyed power and influence in New York City. He saw
                  that if he were to undertake to use Cringar as evidence, and move directly against
                  the broker with that forgery in his possession, he not only would himself give the
                  signal for Cringar's immediate destruction, but would plunge the whole business
                  into a contest where money in unlimited amounts must be supplied, or defeat
                  inevitably result.
               Strategy, not money, must do the work for him. Mind he could depend upon; money he
                  had not for such a contest.
               As he now sat in that office, while Cringar watched him with intense anxiety, these things passed in swift
                  review before his mind. He had accomplished much up to this moment, but he
                  realized that work was before him, and a false step would ruin all.
               His decision was taken; and Cringar experienced an indefinable hope as he
                  witnessed the expression of that decision on those grand features, which, but a
                  short time before, had so terrified him.
               The Veteran rose to depart.
               "Mr. Cringar," he said, "I must enjoin upon you, in this matter, absolute secrecy
                  and silence."
               The merchant bowed his head.
               A pause ensued; and then Cringar, in a broken voice, said,—
               "The boy, Albert,—I heard he was very ill." And with a smile of unspeakable
                  sadness he added, "Mr. Cringar was a great favorite of his."
               "The boy," answered the Veteran, feelingly, "is out of danger, and is doing
                  well."
               He moved toward the door as he spoke, while the merchant, having fallen back in
                  his chair apparently exhausted by this interview, sat with his eyes cast to the
                  floor, a prey to melancholy thoughts. The departing visitor had scarcely opened
                  the door when a well-known voice was heard outside.
               The instant this voice struck the ears of the exhausted and abstracted Cringar, he
                  seemed to forget all else, and the old look of terror took possession of his
                  countenance. His whole body trembled violently, and the cold sweat started out
                  anew upon his forehead.
               "Fear not," said the Veteran in a firm but soothing tone, as he turned and beheld
                  the effect this voice had produced on the merchant. "It is not his interest at
                  present to destroy your reputation."
               He then passed out, closing the door behind him.
               He was met by Daniel Garvin, who, having stopped to question the book-keeper, was
                  now advancing toward the private office.
               The broker's malevolent eye shot forth a gleam of defiant and revengeful rage,
                  which the Veteran met with a glance fraught with what the book-keeper afterwards
                  described as that deadly calmness which, in a voyage to the tropics, made a few
                  years previous, he had observed to be ominous of an approaching tempest.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               THE scene we have depicted occurred on Thursday. Friday the Veteran sat in his
                  room, deeply engaged in revolving plans for the intricate work that was before
                  him, when Prescott Marland was ushered in.
               "General!" he exclaimed, "I have just seen two as precious scoundrels as walk the
                  streets of New York!"
               "Indeed! and who are they, pray?"
               "Slaycut and Drorblude!"
               "Slaycut and Drorblude!" repeated the Veteran.
               "The same!" cried Prescott, snapping his fingers. "And if I don't draw blood out
                  of both of 'em, then I'm no friend of the Paige family, that's all!"
               The Veteran smiled. There was an irresistible tendency on the part of Prescott to
                  make this grave man smile, no matter under what circumstances. If the latter had,
                  like an old Roman consul, been in position where he must condemn this young friend
                  to death, it were a question whether the condemned would not have compelled a
                     significant relaxation of his
                  judge's features, before he had done with him.
               "I will tell you how it was," continued Marland. "You see I happened to be in
                  Cringar's place to speak with Billings, when I heard the sound of voices in the
                  private office. I recognized Garvin's and Cringar's; but I was more particularly
                  struck with the others. There was something about them that sounded familiar, and
                  I asked Billings who was in there.
               "'Slaycut and Drorblude talking with Garvin and Cringar,' said he.
               "'What, the men who held Allen Paige's notes for mining stock?' cried I, all of a
                  sudden smelling a mighty big rat.
               "'Hush!' whispered Billings. 'Not so loud! They are the gentlemen named in the
                  inventory put in by Cringar and Garvin, and mighty attractive-looking men they are
                  too.'
               "Just then the door opened, and, by Jove! if there were n't two of the biggest
                  rascals that ever cursed Montana, grinning and nodding like circus clowns. The
                  moment their eyes fell on me, back they started, one of their boots coming down on
                  Garvin's corns, I should judge by the growl, and there they stood staring at me.
                  'T was a rich sight!" exclaimed Prescott, laughing. "I did n't move a peg; but
                  remained calm and majestic, like the ghost of Hamlet's father, and fancied I heard
                  them mutter between their teeth,— 
                     
                        'Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned,
                        Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
                        Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
                        Thou com'st in such a questionable shape,
                        That I will speak to thee.'
                     
                  
               
               "But if that was their intention, that precious pirate of a Garvin did n't give
                  'em time to carry it out; for, drawing them back with that ugly hand of his, he
                  slammed the door to, first sending a look at me that had more of the cut-throat in
                  it than anything of the kind I've seen for a good while."
               "Well, you've got them shut up with Garvin for the purpose of telling him who you
                  are; now please tell me who they are," said the Veteran with
                  interest.
               "In about three words: they are by name, as I knew them West, Jim Fitch and Sam
                  Ratter, two blacklegs and cut-throats who got jugged one day,—and the same night
                  the miners went up to lynch 'em and found them gone. That's the last I ever saw or
                  heard of them till they burst upon me in the glory of Garvin's presence."
               "So they never pre-empted out there?"
               "Well, as to that I can't say. But if they did, it was to swindle the green ones
                  with."
               "A good many intelligent men have been swindled by those kind of fellows, here in
                  New York," said the Veteran, seriously.
               "Very true," returned Prescott, sobered by the Veteran's manner.
               "'Even a scoundrel may pre-empt, and on the basis of real property get up a
                  swindle here that it would be difficult to get behind, if there were plenty of
                  money to stop one's progress."
               "It is indeed so," said Prescott, in a meditative voice. "That Garvin seems to
                  have things knotted up badly."
               "As I will show you," responded the Veteran; and thereupon he proceeded to give
                  Prescott a succinct account of his interview with Cringar on the previous day, and
                  its results. "This discovery of yours," he said in conclusion, "is of the utmost importance in the future working
                  of my plans, though it may not produce results so immediate as you had hoped."
               "Yes," replied Prescott, "I see how it is. Law chastises scoundrels, and protects
                  them too. That is to say, a rogue may swindle a victim, and then hop behind the
                  technical meshes of the law for safety. And if he's got money enough, Heaven only
                  knows how long he will stay there! General, I think lynch-law is a capital thing
                  sometimes."
               "A desperate remedy, but effective in desperate cases."
               They now parted.
               On the evening immediately after the foregoing conversation between the Veteran
                  and Prescott Marland, Daniel Garvin might have been seen, hat in hand, about
                  taking his departure from the house of Dr. Pennell, who at that time had charge of
                  a private madhouse in the upper part of the city.
               "You understand everything clearly, Doctor?" said the broker, as he proceeded
                  first to smooth his hat with his hand, and then to draw his handkerchief slowly
                  around it, as if he would leave no stubborn ruffle unsubdued. "You will not forget
                  that a nephew of such promise must receive from you a very special care."
               The doctor, whose form was not unlike Garvin's, but whose visage, though partaking
                  somewhat of the bony structure of his visitor's, was of a complexion light, sandy,
                  and freckled,—this doctor gave vent to a subdued but sinister laugh, and
                  said,—
               "Do not fear, Mr. Garvin. If this nephew is the unfortunate victim of the
                  hallucination you have described, he must necessarily receive from us more than
                  usual care. I know of no cases so dangerous as these patients whose mania consists
                  in the fancy that all about them are thieves and assassins."
               "You will have the carriage there at the hour?"
               "Without fail."
               
               A day passes by, when Prescott Marland on entering his boarding-house in the
                  evening receives the following note, written in pencil:—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              MR. MARLAND.
                           
                           I have called to see you, but do not find you in. I have just
                              discovered a little girl, dying from starvation, whom I have
                              ascertained to be the unfortunate child of a soldier, named Joseph
                              Deering, who was killed in the war of the Rebellion. I have sent
                              temporary relief; but I am unexpectedly compelled to leave the city by
                              the afternoon train, and therefore am prevented from doing all my
                              heart dictates. I have been directed to you as one who belongs to an
                              association that helps the suffering families of the fallen brave. In
                              God's name, then, delay not in this case! To provide against all
                              accidents I have ordered the same hackman that drove me to the place
                              where this wretched little girl is now lying a skeleton to call for
                              you at eight o'clock. Heaven pity the unfortunate!
                           
                              Sincerely yours,
                              EDWARD SMALL,
                              A Friend of the Soldier.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Prescott called the landlady.
               "How long ago was this left here?" he asked.
               "About two hours ago," answered the landlady. "The gentleman who left it seemed
                  much disappointed at not finding you in, and said he would like to write a line
                  for you. So he came in and wrote the note I have given you, and begged me not to
                  forget to deliver it the instant you returned, for life or death might hang on
                  it."
               
               "Strange!" muttered Prescott, after the landlady had left him. "Why did n't he
                  inquire where I could be found? But all men are not born Solomons,
                  and he must have been in a driving hurry. Well, he's a good fellow, and has done
                  what he could, that's evident."
               He now commenced pacing his room impatiently, at the same time re-reading the
                  letter.
               "Why did n't the man think to tell me where she was?" he again muttered. "The
                  hackman be hanged! I should have been half-way there by this time, instead of
                  making these boards creak under my boots! Poor child! Poor child! And what of the
                  rest of this unhappy family? Dead, perhaps!" Then, after a silent pacing of
                  several moments, he clenched his hand and exclaimed, "If that coachman is five
                  minutes late I'll strangle him!"
               But the hack drove up to the door just on the hour.
               "I had promised myself to strangle you if you were behind time," said Prescott,
                  with a half-laugh, as he prepared to enter the coach.
               "No danger of that on such an errand as this, sir, I assure you."
               "That's a good fellow! Don't spare the horses."
               "Never fear, sir."
               The clatter of the horses' hoofs and the rattling of the coach-wheels gave
                  evidence to Prescott that the coachman was in earnest.
               The drive seemed long and interminable to the anxious soldier. The coach whirled
                  from street to street until he thought the whole city must have been travelled
                  over.
               Finally they stopped before a tenement in which Prescott, as he beheld it by the
                  gas-light, judged poverty reigned in all its hideous deformity, and the coachman
                  sprang to the sidewalk. He was instantly accosted by a man who had evidently been
                  waiting, and who now spoke a few words to him in a low tone.
               "All right," he returned loud enough for his passenger to hear.
               Then opening the coach door, he said,—
               "The girl has been carried to more comfortable quarters just above. Shall I drive
                  you there?"
               "Don't stop to ask, but drive ahead."
               The coach again rattled over the pavements, and presently drew up before a
                  substantial brick building.
               "She has been brought here," said the driver, as he opened the door to let
                  Prescott out.
               The door of the house was opened as he ascended the steps.
               He entered, and the hackman, with a meaning gesture, remounted his seat, and
                  taking the reins in his hands prepared to drive off.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXX.
               THE door closed on the young Lieutenant with an ominous sound that did not fail to
                  strike ears rendered alert by service in the midst of an enemy's country.
                  Impatient though he was to see the child he had been ostensibly driven hither to
                  help, his soldierly intuitions caused him to take a glance about him.
               He heard a distant howl, and at the same time a powerfully built man with a brutal
                  face crossed the lower end of the hall, glancing toward him, as he passed, with a
                  wolfish look.
               
               He perceived, also, that the man who had admitted him was strongly built, with the
                  same wolfish countenance.
               All at once a terrible suspicion flashed across his mind. He would test it.
               "A moment," he said, stepping back. "I wish to speak to the coachman."
               He laid hold of the door, but he could not open it!
               Turning to the man by his side he said in a low but commanding voice,—
               "Will you be so kind as to open this door?"
               "You had better see the child first," answered the man with an ill-concealed look
                  of brutal triumph.
               "Open this door!"
               The young Lieutenant's eyes blazed as he uttered this command in a tone as short,
                  quick, and distinct, as he would have given an order on the battle-field.
               The man saw his game was up, and with a mocking laugh he said,—
               "Them ain't the sort of orders we calculate to obey in this 'ere place, my young
                  cove."
               Prescott now shook the door violently.
               "Open it!" he cried, "or I'll batter it down with your skull!"
               "Well!" exclaimed the fellow, sending a leering glance down the hall where the
                  other man had crossed, "if 'ere ain't a mad un, an' no mistake!" Then, putting his
                  hand to his mouth, he cried: "Say, Gryper! here's a patient that's crazy as a
                  loon! Jest bear a hand!"
               Prescott's terrible suspicion was confirmed. He was in a mad-house!
               But this active and determined young soldier was not one to yield without a
                  struggle to the fate prepared for him. With a spring as quick as the tiger's he
                  planted a blow on the attendant's forehead that felled him like an ox. Then
                  leaping to the door he hastily sought the fastenings.
               Suddenly he felt himself clasped by two powerful arms around the body; and then he
                  was dragged back from the door.
               In another moment he heard the sound of many feet,—a cloth was thrown over his
                  head,—and as numberless strong hands were laid on him he was tripped up by a
                  skilful and vigorous stroke, and, after one tremendous struggle, lay at the mercy
                  of his assailants.
               He thought with a shudder of the strait-jacket, and expected every moment to feel
                  its horrid embrace. This did not seem, however, to be the intention of his captors
                  at present. They simply bound his hands, and then a rough voice commanded him to
                  rise.
               "I'll obey no orders here!" he exclaimed in muffled tones, but with
                  determination.
               "He's dangerous! secure him and put him in No. 7!" cried a shrill voice from the
                  hall above.
               "Tie his feet, and we'll obey the doctor's orders!" responded he who had bid him
                  rise.
               His feet were bound accordingly, and then he felt himself raised in two or three
                  pairs of sturdy arms, and borne away, his head still covered by the cloth, while
                  another of his captors, whom he recognized as the attendant he had knocked down,
                  sang out with frightful cadence,— 
                     
                        "The dead! the dead! who'll bear the dead?
                        The coffin waits! who'll bear the dead?"
                     
                   which was followed by a laugh of mocking merriment, accompanied by the
                  scuffling of feet.
               He heard door after door open, until at length he felt a current of cool air at
                  the same time that he found himself being carried down a flight of stairs.
               
               He now heard howls, and peals of insane laughter, and for an instant he thought
                  himself in the confines of Pandemonium. He could not prevent a shudder as he
                  wondered if those that bore him were about to fling him into the den of one of
                  these howling wretches, as the Cæsars drove the doomed Christian martyrs into the
                  jaws of roaring beasts of prey.
               When the suspicion flashed across his mind in the hall above that he was in a
                  mad-house, instantaneously with that suspicion had come before him the sinister
                  and murderous visages of Garvin, Slaycut, alias
                  Fitch, and Drorblude, alias Ratter. That this
                  was a sequence of that unexpected meeting of the previous day he was fully
                  convinced; and knowing well that no crime would be too great for them, and having
                  already become aware of Garvin's diabolical method of accomplishing his aims, he
                  had good cause to shudder as he now felt himself borne down into that chilly air,
                  and heard the howls and laughter of the confined maniacs.
               The voice that had bawled the sombre cadence above now sang again, this time the
                  singer bringing his foot down with emphasis on the descending steps in time to his
                  atrocious verse:— 
                     
                        "Sweet songsters of this stony deep,
                        We bring you merry company.
                        He'll make ye laugh, he'll make ye weep,
                        He will, I swear by Jemminy!"
                     
                  
               
               The young Lieutenant felt the arms under him shake with the suppressed laughter
                  that followed this essay. Then a voice at his head cried out,—
               "Stop that, Mat! You'll make me laugh till I drop 'im!"
               "All right," responded the singer, closing a guttural laugh in which he had
                  himself indulged by repeating in a sort of double bass hum,— 
                     
                        "The dead! the dead! who'll bear the dead?
                        The coffin waits! who'll bear the dead?"
                     
                  
               
               By this time they had reached the bottom of the stairway, and Prescott felt as if
                  he would like just one leg free to kick the malicious songster, who was evidently
                  affected by the crazy atmosphere about him, from basement to roof.
               The next moment he was thrust into a cell, in which he heard the incoherent
                  gibbering of a maniac, the cords were cut from his limbs, the thick door was
                  closed with a dull slam, and the bolt turned upon him.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXI.
               DANIEL GARVIN again waits in his office after the shades and silence of night have
                  succeeded the din and confusion of the day's financial struggles. He has reckoned
                  his gains, and, on this occasion, his losses, and now sits with one hand clenched
                  upon the table, while the deep-wrinkling scowl, and the general look of
                  bitterness, fierceness, and hatred that mark his unattractive features, tell of
                  some unusual agitation.
               That look of self-complacency and self-confidence, formerly so characteristic of
                  him, has given place to an expression in which passionate and desperate
                  determination predominates.
               At a moment when he had congratulated himself on the success of his
                  long-contemplated schemes, whereby avarice and revenge were to be satiated; when,
                  with the air of some devastating monster of the fairy-books, he beheld before him nothing but impotence and
                  fear, and had already begun to mock his unfortunate victims, who seemed beyond all
                  chance of aid,—at this moment a champion had appeared upon the scene, whose
                  puissant blows had already shattered the gateway of his infernal fortress, and now
                  threatened to lop off his own abhorrent head.
               Daniel Garvin prided himself on the power of his intellect to accomplish what he
                  might undertake. He revelled, as we have seen, in the game in which living men
                  should stand as the pieces on his chess-board. He had come to believe himself
                  invincible in any such game, when sufficient inducements were offered for him to
                  engage in it with the whole force of his will. But he now sits with his clenched
                  hand upon the table, and his features distorted by desperate passion, because he
                  has suddenly found himself in danger of utter defeat in the contest of
                  intellectual forces, and is compelled to resort for safety to those means which,
                  while he is capable of any deed that promises to save him from defeat and ruin, he
                  has heretofore ascribed to the ignorant and brutal villains of a sensational
                  romance.
               At length a low series of taps on the outer door caused him to start with a sort
                  of guilty terror that was undoubtedly new in his experience, and for a moment he
                  stared toward the door without attempting to rise.
               A renewal of the taps brought him to his feet, and going to the door with a
                  creeping step which we have not before seen in him, he unfastened it, when the
                  hag, Mammy Roone, walked in.
               This man of inordinate egotism becomes almost an object of pity, as we behold him
                  now compelled to lead this revolting old woman into his private office, there to
                  make her a partner in the execution of his endangered schemes.
               She remained with him an hour.
               When they came forth two faces presented themselves that would have furnished
                  studies not often obtained by even a Le Brun. Mammy Roone's horrible visage was
                  lit up by a ferocious smile, while the dark face of the broker was made scarcely
                  less horrible by an expression in which devilish malignancy was mingled with an
                  irrepressible fear, and withal an air of fierce disgust and loathing, as he
                  furtively glanced at the foul instrument of his designs.
               An hour afterwards Mammy Roone was in secret conference with two characters whom
                  we have also met with before,—Dick Smasher, and him whom that burly ruffian
                  denominated the "Doctor."
               "Well, me lads," said the hag, after having opened the business she had on hand,
                  "how does ye like this swate job? for swate it must be to both of yez, I'm
                  thinking."
               "Yes, sweet and pretty," answered Dick Smasher. "I'd give that mighty fine soldier
                  a few taps that'd put 'im to sleep according to regulation."
               This witticism caused the "Doctor" to break out into a fit of thin, dyspeptic
                  laughter.
               "S-h!" commanded Mammy Roone, her own repulsive features relaxing into a
                  responsive grin, which revealed in all their horrid array the broken fangs that
                  she would have so relished to fasten in Emma's soft and rounded flesh; "do ye both
                  mind that the walls about us have ears!"
               "All right, mammy," returned the "Doctor"; "but that 'ere joke about the taps broke on me all of a sudden. You see the pictur' of Dick's
                  tapping that 'ere big sheep's head for tallow was too funny. Why, dagger it!
                  atween his taps and my lancet we'll have 'im laid out on his bunk quick 'n
                  regulation specifies. Won't we, Dick?"
               
               "Don't ye go for being so confident, Doctor," said Dick, dubiously. "You were fast
                  asleep, yerself, when this big fellow got his fives on me."
               The "Doctor" didn't seem to relish this reminder.
               "Niver ye mind," broke in the old woman, as she observed the scowl on his
                  murderous-looking features. "The Smasher himself didn't come away from the young
                  gintleman's fine fist without a beauty spot; that's what ye 'll not be denying, me
                  honey."
               The powerful shoulder-hitter could bear twitting better than his weaker but more
                  murderous companion.
               "No, I'll deny it not!" he exclaimed. "That young chicken's got the true grit, and
                  th' science to back it up. I'd give 'im a shake of my hand any time he'd ask for
                  it."
               "D—n him!" muttered the other, "I'd give 'im a prick of my lancet!"
               "Well, never mind about that, young man," returned Dick. "Give 'im a taste of yer
                  blood-letter when you get the chance; but let me tell you that the man you 've got
                  to deal with, if ye take hold of this 'ere job, ain't so sure of taking a lancet.
                  Ye 'd better have a plenty of powder and ball, and the Devil take the 'peeler'
                  that disturbs ye!"
               "Yis, it's better to be prepared ag'inst accidents; an' that is what me owld man
                  would always be afther saying, the Holy Virgin protict his blissed soul! and tin
                  thousand curses descind on the heads of every mither's son of a Union sowldhier in
                  Purgatory!"
               As Mammy Roone commenced this sentence, she spoke in a low subdued voice; but ere
                  she had ended her tones had risen—on memory of the deceased Patrick Roone's
                  fate—to a pitch of savage frenzy.
               "Easy!" uttered Dick Smasher, with a glance at the walls of the room. "Don't be
                  forgetting that ye told us a spell ago that walls have ears. Now, I guess the
                  Doctor and myself will undertake this delicate job, for that leetle pile of
                  greenbacks ye 've agreed to lay down. How is it with ye, Doctor?"
               "Count me in, an' this ere professional instrument, too," returned the "Doctor,"
                  at the same time drawing a long, keen knife from his bosom, and laying it down
                  with a smile of satisfaction on the table.
               "Bah!" muttered Dick Smasher to himself. "I'd bet ten to one I could knock the
                  wind out of him every time afore he could scratch my waistcoat with his confounded
                  skin-pricker!"
               "Ye 'll say it's a good bit of work Mammy Roone's secured for yez whin ye 'll be
                  afther countin' thim same granebacks," hissed rather than spoke the beldam, who
                  could not suppress a grin that made her auditors question whether they were not
                  themselves in Purgatory.
               
               Days had passed, and nothing had been heard from Prescott Marland. The Veteran had
                  called repeatedly at his boarding-house, but his landlady, of whom Prescott was a
                  favorite, and who was in a great state of alarm, could give only one answer, which
                  was that she had heard nothing from him since the evening she had delivered him
                  the note left by the stranger who had displayed such extraordinary anxiety.
               The Veteran endeavored to assure her that she need feel no alarm; but she had
                  learned to expect any form of crime in New York, and her fears could not be
                  allayed. As for himself he had his own thoughts. Prescott's disappearance
                  immediately followed his visit to him when he made known his rencounter with the
                  Western impostors at Cringar's store,
                  and his quick mind was not long left in doubt as to the man whose interests were
                  involved in this disappearance, and whose scruples would not interfere with any
                  action necessary to secure his own safety, or the safety of a scheme which the
                  discovery made by Prescott would so seriously compromise.
               It was about ten o'clock at night. He was returning to his rooms after a visit to
                  Prescott's boarding-house, where he had been detained by an endless string of
                  surmises from the landlady regarding her favorite boarder's extraordinary
                  absence.
               Suddenly he felt himself plucked by the sleeve, and on turning discovered a boy
                  who seemed to be in great trepidation.
               After looking cautiously around, this boy thrust a piece of folded paper into his
                  hand, and then placing his finger to his lips he whispered, "I durn't risk being
                  seen with you," and then with the words, "I'll see you ag'in tomorrow," he
                  disappeared.
               Two thoughts instantly flashed through the Veteran's mind. One was the suspicion
                  that here was some kind of trap set for him similar to that which he was assured
                  had been set for Prescott; the other was the hope that it might possibly convey
                     bona fide intelligence of the whereabouts of
                  his missing young friend.
               Approaching the nearest street-lamp, he opened the paper and read the following,
                  written in a coarse hand:—
               "General Hamond i am hired to watch a young man named Prescot marland. i carnt
                  Stand it no longer and if You wil com and help me we can git him away. he told me
                  to call you thorbolt and then you wood know that he is Realy here. come tonite or
                  i am Affrade it wil be to late. i send my son with this meet me at haf parst ten
                  at the corner of prince and Green streets."
               The Veteran read this singular missive over two or three times. Was it indeed a
                  trap for himself, or did it really open the way to the discovery of the trap into
                  which Prescott had been inveigled? The question was, Would he risk forsaking his
                  comrade by refusing to go to the place appointed by this note, or would he risk
                  his own safety by going?
               With a man of his character the time occupied by such a discussion was but short.
                  He balanced a heavy walking-stick in his hand an instant, and then stepping up to
                  a patrolman who, in a doorway near by, had been a silent observer of all that had
                  passed, he inquired the way to the place designated in the note. The latter
                  instructed him as desired, and he directed his steps accordingly.
               But this patrolman, though a silent observer, had not been a disinterested one. He
                  had recognized the boy by the street-lamp, and he instantly suspected foul play.
                  He said nothing to the Veteran, however, but followed him at a distance just
                  sufficient to keep him in sight.
               At length the object of this watchful officer's attention passed out of his
                  beat.
               Another was soon notified, who continued on the track.
               Finally, after one or two inquiries of passers-by, the Veteran found himself
                  nearing the appointed spot.
               He now began very ardently to hope that the missive was genuine, and that he might
                  hear something of the young Lieutenant, whom he loved as a son; and especially was
                  he anxious that something might result to clear the gloom which the ominous
                  absence of this noble and generous friend had cast over that home in Vandam
                  Street, where his presence had come to be depended upon as the sunlight.
               But this hope did not cause him to relax his grasp on his heavy walking-stick.
               
               Suddenly as he passed a small alley his meditations were aroused by what sounded
                  to his ears as a cry of distress.
               He stopped and listened. The cry again reached him, and this time it was surely a
                  smothered appeal for help, and was accompanied by sounds of a murderous
                  struggle.
               Tightening the gripe upon his heavy cane, he hastened with his long stride down
                  the alley.
               This alley opened into a small yard piled with rubbish, in which the Veteran
                  speedily found himself. Here he stopped and looked about him.
               At the same instant a slung-shot descended obliquely from behind with tremendous
                  force, and striking on the side of the hat, fell with great violence on his
                  shoulder.
               Simultaneously with this attack a man with a motion like a great rat sprang from
                  behind a pile of old wood, with a long knife in his hand; and as he saw the
                  gigantic figure before him reel under the blow of the slung-shot, he cried with a
                  suppressed yell of uncontrollable exultation as he leaped for this figure while
                  his deadly blade threw off a swift gleam in the starlight,—
               "One for the Lancet and Mammy Roone!"
               But he reckoned without his host. The unusual height of the intended victim had
                  disconcerted his confederate's aim, and though reeling under the assault at his
                  back, the Veteran instantly proved that he was not disabled; for raising his
                  walking-stick with the instinct of a cavalryman, he made a rear mouleaut, and catching the glint of the murderous steel in the uplifted hand of
                  his second assailant he brought his improvised but formidable weapon down with a
                  front cut, delivering so fearful a blow that the skull upon which it descended was
                  crushed in like a shell,—and the "Doctor" dropped to the ground, with the knife
                  still grasped in his hand, but not again to be used with its owner's vaunted
                  professional skill, for that owner was now dead.
               With a curse Dick Smasher, whose aim with the slung-shot had been so faulty, now
                  drew a pistol, levelled it at the head of the man, who through his prodigious
                  strength threatened to become master of the situation, and fired.
               The massive form of the Veteran swayed for a moment, and then fell extended at
                  full length on the earth.
               An alarm now pierced the air, and steps were heard hurrying along the street and
                  up the alley, and the assassin, with a curse on all intermeddling "peelers,"
                  leaped the fence and disappeared just as the patrolman who had been following the
                  Veteran entered the yard.
               With a watchman's habit, the new-comer took a hasty survey of the field, and then
                  listened. In the next instant he had sprung the fence in pursuit of footsteps
                  which his quick ears detected as retreating steps of guilt.
               As he disappeared a second patrolman entered on the scene, who proceeded to
                  examine the two lifeless men who lay extended before him.
               When he lifted the Veteran's head a stream of crimson blood flowed from a wound
                  just above the ear.
               "He's gone! and a superb specimen of a man too," he muttered, as he let the head
                  fall back.
               Then he went to the other, and when his hand came in contact with the "Doctor's"
                  broken skull he gave utterance to a loud "Whew!" and then, as he cast his eye from
                  the glittering knife, still clasped by the dead ruffian, to the heavy cane also
                  grasped in the muscular hand of its lifeless owner, he exclaimed,—
               "This fellow might as well have had a tin sword!"
               Rising, he looked around and muttered to himself, while he awaited the signal from
                  the first patrolman.
               
               In another moment that officer reappeared, his pursuit having been
                  unsuccessful.
               Men who had heard both pistol-shot and alarm now entered the yard and tendered
                  their aid, while windows in the neighborhood were opened and utterances of horror
                  followed as the startled gazers beheld two inanimate bodies carried away, leaving
                  what their strained eyes detected in the bright starlight as dark stains on the
                  gravel and rotten boards of the old yard beneath them.
               As the sombre burdens were borne into the street, a small man of active movements
                  arrived, and with pencil and memorandum-book in hand passed from one body to the
                  other, making examinations and asking questions of the patrolmen, which they
                  attentively answered, he being a newspaper reporter.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXII.
               IN the old house on Vandam Street there was anxiety and sorrow. We have seen the
                  Veteran almost forgetting any probable danger to himself, as he neared the place
                  of rendezvous appointed in the note which the boy had given him, in the hope that
                  something might really result to clear the gloom from the hearts of those who had
                  so learned to love the noble and generous Prescott Marland.
               The mother loved him as a son, and the young children as a brother; and both
                  mother and children experienced a distress resulting from the mysterious
                  disappearance of their favorite, which the sympathetic reader will readily
                  comprehend.
               We say a favorite; but while this word conveys an idea of the sentiments of
                  welcome with which they were wont to receive him to their now humble home, it does
                  by no means express the profound feelings of gratitude and affection which they
                  entertained toward him. He was ever so thoughtful, so kind, so considerate; and,
                  withal, he had such a way of raising them out of a consciousness of their present
                  sad condition, and placing them for the time being in a bright sunlight, which had
                  the effect of making their hearts lighter and their lives happier during the time
                  that intervened between his visits.
               And then he of all others had a power, peculiarly his own, of shedding a lustre
                  over the memory of the patriot husband and father. While the world without had
                  allowed itself to be led by a designing knave into a universal judgment, which was
                  but little short of a denunciation of that husband and father for reckless and
                  unscrupulous conduct in business, this feature in Prescott's character, this
                  fidelity to the memory of one between whom and himself there had existed an
                  affection so pure and noble, and so worthy the great cause the defence of which
                  had brought them together wounded and disabled, this rare, unswerving fidelity was
                  calculated, as the reader may readily imagine, to surround him in the midst of
                  this home with a sort of halo, as if the unseen spirit of the patriot blessed him
                  for his steadfast devotion to that sacred friendship.
               We may readily surmise, then, what sorrow, what grief must have been theirs as
                  they waited day after day with no word from this missing friend.
               But what shall be said of the secret anguish of that heart which, under the formal
                  relation of brother and sister, had suffered itself to become gradually so
                  absorbed that its very life depended upon the responsive love of the heart of him over whose fate there hung
                  such a terrible uncertainty?
               Darkness seemed suddenly to have closed in upon her young life. As she looked back
                  on her existence in that home of privation, as it was before this object of her
                  supreme love had so strangely disappeared, she wondered how, with him so often by
                  her side, she could have ever supposed it otherwise than a haven of unalloyed
                  happiness; her heart offering an example of that great truth, that in life, as
                  well as in art, the highest lights and deepest shades are relative, depending for
                  their effect on those contrasts which the hand of Providence throws into the
                  existence of men with all-wise and beneficent spirit.
               In the midst of their gloomy anxiety this distressed family had indeed found one
                  friend whose influence was strongly exerted toward buoying up their tried and
                  dejected spirits. This friend was the Veteran. They knew that if Prescott was
                  alive Thorbolt would never rest till be had been found. His self-sacrificing
                  efforts for themselves they had almost forgotten in the contemplation of his
                  untiring labors to solve the mystery that hung around his comrade's disappearance.
                  Since the latter's abduction he had not failed to call on them every day, and
                  though unable to report any definite progress in the direction which now
                  interested all so deeply, yet his presence served to lighten the gloom, and
                  inspire them with some of that spirit which in him seemed ever to ride the storm
                  with an unwavering faith in the Almighty Disposer of events.
               On the same evening that he was led into the snare of assassins through his
                  anxiety for the fate of his comrade, he had made one of these welcome calls, and
                  had, by more than ordinary effort, succeeded in planting in their hearts a feeling
                  of hope such as they had not before experienced; and when he left them the mother
                  had turned to Emma and said,—
               "This self-sacrificing soldier deserves the richest blessings which Heaven can
                  vouchsafe! He seems a grand and noble guardian, and I feel myself to be a child in
                  his presence!"
               But not many hours were to pass ere another blow was to fall, which would wellnigh
                  crush them to the earth.
               On the morning following this last-mentioned visit of the Veteran, the family were
                  seated around their humble breakfast-table, of whom Albert, who was now
                  convalescent, formed one of the number, when a light nervous rap announced a
                  visitor.
               Alice opened the door, and William Garvin entered, looking pale and anxious.
               This innocent son of a guilty father was an occasional visitor to the present home
                  of his aunt and cousins, but never had he called before at this hour of the day.
                  An event, therefore, so unusual, together with his agitation, filled Mrs. Paige
                  and Emma with emotions of vague alarm.
               William observed the effect produced by his unexpected visit, which tended to
                  increase his agitation, and caused him to stammer somewhat in his speech as,
                  unfolding a paper he held in his hand, he hurriedly said,—
               "Happening this way this morning, and hearing the news-boys crying a murder in the
                  city last night, I bought a paper; and I could not go home without first bringing
                  it to you."
               Then pointing to a flaming paragraph headed "HORRIBLE MURDER!" he handed the paper
                  to his anxious auditors.
               This is what they read:—
               
               "HORRIBLE MURDER!!!
               "A GENERAL OF THE UNION ARMY THE VICTIM!
               "Last night one of the most horrible affairs that has ever cursed this city of
                  horrible deeds occurred about half past ten o'clock, in the vicinity of Prince
                  Street. At the time mentioned Patrolman McNeal was instructed by Patrolman Owen
                  that a stranger who had just left his beat, and whom he pointed out ahead, was
                  likely to be led on to some foul play, and suggested his keeping his eye on him.
                  Officer McNeal accordingly followed and kept him in sight. Presently he observed
                  the stranger, who was evidently a man of much more than ordinary size, turn
                  suddenly into an alleyway. He now quickened his steps, and had nearly arrived at
                  the passage when he heard the sharp report of a pistol. Hastening down the alley
                  he discovered in a small back yard two bodies stretched on the earth. He instantly
                  sounded an alarm, and thinking he heard the footsteps of the flying assassin in an
                  adjoining yard he gave pursuit, but without success. Returning he found Patrolman
                  Darley on the ground. Here was a fearful sight. In a pool of gore lay the victim,
                  a man of immense size, with a fearful wound from a bullet in the side of his head,
                  who was instantly identified by Patrolman McNeal, himself a returned soldier, as
                  General Hammond, the celebrated cavalry leader. And even in death his terrible arm
                  seems to have proved too formidable for at least one of his assailants. In his
                  hand was still grasped a heavy cane, while near him lay the second body—which was
                  instantly recognized as the body of a low and desperate character who has usually
                  gone under the sobriquet of the Doctor—with his skull
                  smashed in by what was evidently a powerful blow from this cane. Persons attracted
                  to the spot by the report of the pistol and the watchman's alarm now lent their
                  aid, and the bodies were conveyed to the station-house. Those who were on the
                  ground immediately after the assassination pronounce the appearance of the
                  murdered soldier to have been, with all its horror, singularly impressive. So
                  great was his size that it required four strong men to carry him. His face was a
                  grand one in that sleep of sudden death; and a deep, wide scar hollowed out his
                  left cheekbone in a manner sufficient alone to identify him. To what a fate has
                  this veteran of a hundred battles been doomed!"
               Emma, who had borne up so bravely under circumstances that would try the strongest
                  natures, turned deadly pale, and fell back fainting into the chair from which she
                  had risen to read that terrible account.
               Mrs. Paige, whose hopes, kindled by a knowledge of the labors of the Veteran in
                  her behalf, were in this instant utterly extinguished, turned in alarm to her
                  daughter, and dropping that fatal paper, hastened to her assistance, while Alice,
                  also hastening to her aid, exclaimed,—
               "O mother! what has happened? Is Prescott—?"
               "No," interrupted the mother with a warning gesture. "A kind Heaven must have
                  spared him to us."
               In the mean time Albert had sprung for the paper, and his quick eye having caught
                  the name of General Hammond in the account of the murder, he hastened to Alice,
                  his eyes filled with grief and horror, and whispered the story in her ear.
               Alice's face in turn expressed her startled emotions, as she continued her efforts
                  to revive her fainting sister.
               William Garvin on his part stood rooted to the floor, looking as if he felt
                  himself to be guilty of the murder and all this sudden anguish.
               When Emma fainted his first impulse was to spring to her support; but instantly he
                  saw the mother hasten to perform this office a reaction occurred. Instead of
                  flying to her assistance he felt like flying from her presence.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXIII.
               MORE sensitive and more morbid even than when we parted with him on the evening of
                  his adventure with the ruffians who attempted to abduct his cousin, the broker's
                  son now presents a complete type of a young, sensitive, overwrought mind, scarcely
                  more able to endure contact with the every-day world than are certain invalids to
                  endure direct rays of the sun, who from a singular disease of the nervous system
                  experience the most acute physical suffering if brought in contact with such a
                  light.
               But with this increased morbid sensitiveness has increased his secret adoration of
                  his charming cousin. To the effect of her beauty has been added the influence of
                  her misfortunes. With his idealizing and dreaming mind nothing could have happened
                  more calculated to enhance his infatuation than the event by which she had been
                  driven from the home where in early days he had been wont to join with her in the
                  sports of childhood, and where as years advanced his love had taken root and grown
                  to be almost his only life.
               He had watched the progress of the intimacy between Emma and Prescott Marland with
                  feelings that are wellnigh indescribable. Jealousy is scarcely the word to express
                  these emotions. It does not comprehend that feeling in which wonderment and a
                  profound incredulity are mingled with a deep, vague, tormenting anguish, as if one
                  who has lived in the rapturous contemplation of a spirit whom he believes to be
                  his guardian angel, should awake after a troublesome dream to find this spirit
                  suddenly incarnated and borne away before his eyes by a man of the most undoubted
                  flesh and blood of this material world.
               When the news of Prescott's disappearance reached his ears he experienced
                  sensations equally indescribable. The first impression was as if a dark shadow had
                  quickly vanished from before him. Then in its place came another shadow caused by
                  thoughts of the inevitable anguish of her whom he so adored. As we have formerly
                  remarked, his love for her was not associated with ideas of possession; it was an
                  adoration through which he saw her a being to be possessed by no mortal man, but
                  who, exempt from the weaknesses of the common humanity, was created to live near
                  the sky, on the ideal mount and in the ideal shades allotted her by his adoring
                  fancies. Therefore thoughts of possible grief, whatever the cause, disturbing the
                  happiness of this idealized queen of his secluded life would invariably throw a
                  shadow across his heart.
               As days passed and Prescott's fate seemed more and more certain, he began to
                  experience a feeling which partook somewhat of superstition, as though no man
                  could possibly presume to cast such glances as he had observed Prescott direct
                  toward Emma, and live long enough to consummate his desires in possession. And
                  that such a sentiment existed in this highly fanciful and morbid mind is not so
                  much to be wondered at when we remember that even the strongest natures will yield
                  to like feelings,—such as refusing with vague dread to give a child a name which
                  has been borne successively by two or three generations of ancestors, all of whom
                  have died young and under the same circumstances; and other innumerable displays
                  of this sort, which those not concerned may smile at, but who, when the test shall
                  come to them, will probably be found to govern their actions by similar
                  motives.
               
               But toward the Veteran this young artist entertained sentiments as exaggerated in
                  their way as were his sentiments toward his fair cousin. As Prescott had informed
                  Thorbolt in the interview that resulted in his introduction to Billings the
                  book-keeper, he had affirmed that the picture of this man of immense stature, as
                  he first appeared in the street when he was awakened to consciousness by Emma's
                  shrieks, and saw her struggling in the arms of the desperate ruffian who was
                  bearing her away, was before his eyes continually by day and in his dreams by
                  night,—a vision that conveyed to his mind a realization of Homer's description of
                  Jove in the midst of war.
               Emma he associated with the angels; the Veteran with the gods. There was that in
                  the majesty of the latter's mien and the lofty dignity of his mind which had the
                  effect to overwhelm him. When in his presence he seemed to have no mind of his own
                  nor individuality. All seemed absorbed in that grand character whose smile or
                  frown caused the sun of his life, for the time being, either to shine with
                  inspiring lustre or disappear behind dark and gloomy clouds.
               The Veteran had met William at the house in which the Paiges now lived, and had
                  requested the family to make known to him his desire that nothing of his own
                  visits to their home should be mentioned outside to any person whatever; thus by
                  this request including his father without specifying him. Emma had taken it upon
                  herself to convey this request to William; and coming from such a source, and
                  through such a channel, it was made ten times more binding than the law of the
                  Medes and Persians.
               So far as his father was concerned, however, there was not the slightest danger;
                  for, though he did not in the least apprehend the foul business of which this
                  parent had been guilty, his intuitions told him that relations existed between the
                  broker and his half-brother's family which utterly forbade any reference to his
                  visits there. We would here remark that the Paiges were careful never to express,
                  in any way, their opinion of the father's actions in the presence of the son.
               When William Garvin opened the paper in the street and read the dreadful news, he
                  had nearly fallen to the pavement. The shock was tremendous. An unspeakable horror
                  seized his senses as if the very sun had turned blood red, and then left the world
                  in impenetrable darkness.
               That man of sublime strength! of superhuman power! with the majesty of a god!—he
                  dead! murdered! killed in an obscure back yard by a beastly ruffian, the bullet
                  even tainted with the penitentiary that disgorged him!
               This young idealist was stupefied, and for an instant everything around him was in
                  a whirl. The earth itself seemed rolling from beneath his feet, and the passers-by
                  appeared as unreal shadows luridly lit up by red letters which formed the word
                  "MURDER!"
               Immediately he had gathered his scattered senses, and was able to look at the
                  reality with a degree of understanding, he hastened to Vandam Street, near which
                  he often wandered in the early morning, and conveyed the dreadful news in the
                  manner we have described.
               As we have said, his first impulse when his cousin fainted was to spring to her
                  support, and then as the mother hastened to her assistance the second impulse was
                  to fly. He felt guilty of what was to him an inexcusable rashness in thus bursting
                  in upon them with his startling and melancholy intelligence, and for a few moments
                  he presented a picture of the most acute mental misery.
               
               But now, as he stood gazing upon the anguish-stricken group before him, he
                  suddenly experienced an emotion, vague but deep, which first caused within him a
                  strange and ominous tremor, that was followed almost instantly by an overwhelming
                  sensation as if the very soul were breaking up and losing its past identity.
               This remarkable agitation was the result of a powerful reaction. Stupefied as he
                  was by the perusal in the street of the account of the murder, he had, as we have
                  seen, thought of nothing after but to rush to the family of his deceased uncle to
                  break to them the news. But now as he contemplated his cousin rendered almost
                  unconscious by the terrible blow this announcement had inflicted, the full
                  realization of the Veteran's mortality, with all its dependences on the natural
                  laws that governed him with the rest of our common humanity, swept in upon him.
                  And then his ideal world seemed a chaos, without shape and void, and for a moment
                  objects around him were in a sort of maze, as if the outer world were passing away
                  from his vision.
               But presently these objects began to reassume a definite aspect. His now reviving
                  cousin especially stood out in strong relief to his vision like the central figure
                  of an effective painting, and the object of his gaze happening at that moment to
                  lift her sorrowful eyes to his face was startled by the new, strange look which
                  appeared there; and confused, withal, for it was an unmistakable expression of the
                  most intense and all-devouring love. That gaze which heretofore had beamed upon
                  her with a timid adoration, and which she had ascribed to the natural ardency of a
                  young artist, who would contemplate with the same expression everything in nature
                  to which his soul might, in an ideal sense, be devoted,—this gaze had suddenly
                  transformed formed itself, and now gave evidence of emotions which no heart of
                  woman can mistake.
               A blush instantly tinged the cheeks of this maiden, whose paleness, combined with
                  her look of deep sorrow, only served to enhance in the eyes of the young artist
                  that beauty which to him was so transcendent. Instead of falling to the ground, as
                  but an hour before he would have expected, if, perchance, he should blindly permit
                  himself to meet her eye with a glance of such fervid love, his gaze remained
                  fixed, while it continued to increase in the intensity of its ardor until its
                  object, no longer able to endure it, cast down her eyes with a look of deep
                  pain.
               A vague thought entered Emma's mind that this sudden and extraordinary display of
                  passion was but a sequence of Prescott Marland's disappearance, and the
                  assassination of the Veteran, and an exclamation that was on her lips, when she
                  revived and encountered his gaze, was only uttered by her heart.
               "O Heaven!" was the unspoken utterance, "this friend murdered! Then never shall we
                  see dear Prescott again!"
               The mother, who was bending over Emma, now rose, and seeing William still
                  standing, requested him to be seated.
               Her voice thus addressing him broke the spell; the hot blood rushed to the very
                  roots of his hair, and stammering out an incoherent excuse, he hastily departed in
                  the greatest confusion, leaving the family to indulge in sacred privacy a grief
                  with which was mingled a feeling of utter loneliness and desolation.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXIV.
               THE merchant and the broker both read that morning the news of the
                  assassination.
               On Jonas Cringar the blow descended with even more deadly force than was
                  experienced by the family of his former partner. Since the hour of the Veteran's
                  visit to his office the broker had concentrated upon this unhappy man the entire
                  reserve power of his malevolent will, and his eye seemed scarcely a moment to be
                  elsewhere than upon his tormented victim. But while the merchant had nearly sunk
                  under his renewed torments he did not utterly lose the hope which the Veteran at
                  the close of his interview with him had inspired in his breast. He felt like a
                  captive, who, being tortured at the stake, expects each instant to hear the
                  rifle-shots of rescuing friends.
               The reader may well imagine his emotions, then, when he opened the morning paper,
                  after his now usual night of sleeplessness and horrid dreams, and read the account
                  which we have transcribed on a former page.
               With him the blow came with the more crushing weight, for he instantly recognized
                  in this bloody deed the hand of Daniel Garvin; and to the mercy of a desperate
                  assassin, as well as an infamous schemer and robber, he felt himself now given up
                  beyond all hope.
               As for Daniel Garvin, when he heard the cries of the news-boys he could not
                  entirely conceal a look of fierce expectation as he bought a paper and opened
                  it.
               He read the story, and instantly the cries seemed directed toward him; and with
                  the announcement of a "Horrible Murder" his ears were pierced with
                  what seemed to him the word "MURDERER" continually repeated. The gnashing of his
                  teeth, the exultant yet fearful and guilty light in his eye, and the irrepressible
                  shudder which seized him while he strode the street with the paper clutched
                  convulsively in his quivering hand, told of the terrible commotion within, and the
                  fierce efforts this hirer of assassins was making to control himself.
               Arrived at his office, the first thing his eye fell upon was the same detailed
                  account with its flaming heading confronting him on a table, where the paper
                  containing it had been thrown by the clerk.
               He seized it instantly and bore it from sight into his private office, as if he
                  feared his guilt was there proclaimed.
               After a while the fever into which his sudden sense of an enormous guilt had
                  thrown him somewhat subsided, and this untiring plotter, having given orders not
                  to be interrupted for an hour, began, like the spider that has beaten off his
                  enemy, to take a survey of his broken web preparatory to making it whole
                  again.
               With his head buried in his hands he gathered his thoughts as best he could, and
                  concentrated them on plans for future work.
               
               Several days had passed, and the broker again sat in his rear office plunged in
                  deep and troubled meditation. Suddenly he rose, and proceeding to the door ordered
                  the messenger to go immediately for his son William.
               In due course of time William arrived, and was immediately closeted with his
                  father.
               "William," said the broker, seating his son opposite him and then looking intently
                  into his face,—"William, you are old enough to marry."
               
               William reddened and slightly trembled, but made no answer.
               "Would you not like to marry?"
               The young artist blushed still deeper, but continued silent, while he gazed at his
                  father with evident fear.
               "Tell me, boy, would you not like to marry?" repeated the broker in a voice
                  intended to be soothing, but in which the penetrating quality of an authoritative
                  will predominated.
               "I—I—can—can—not—say," stammered the son.
               "Pshaw, my boy!" returned the father with a grim smile, "it would be the making of
                  you. You would be a stronger and a happier man by marrying."
               The young artist displayed great agitation, but answered not.
               The broker now bent forward, and bringing his face close to William's, he
                  said,—
               "I would have you marry immediately, William."
               The young artist now stared on his father with unmistakable consternation. This
                  father was about to command, and he had never up to this time dared to disobey
                  him.
               "Don't be so frightened," said Daniel Garvin, with a light laugh. "She's neither a
                  stranger nor a bugbear, if your father is any judge of a beautiful young woman. I
                  would have you marry your cousin Emma."
               William's stare changed into a wild sort of gleam, and the hot blood rushed
                  tumultuously through his veins, turning his face and neck to a bright scarlet.
               "How does it please you, boy?"
               Within the time which had passed since he hurried in such confusion from the
                  presence of that adored cousin, whose lids had drooped beneath the look which had
                  never before appeared in his timid glances, William Garvin's whole being had been,
                  as it were, a scene of incessant and increasing tumult. The blow that had
                  overthrown the ideal in which he had enshrined the grand Thorbolt had also
                  disturbed the ideal world in which he had spiritualized his cousin, and suddenly,
                  as we have formerly seen, passion revealed its ardent presence; and during those
                  days there had been going on a strong conflict between the old ideal and this new
                  passion, which, in violation of long-cherished sentiments, began to fill his heart
                  with vague thoughts of possession. But the old ideal was tenacious in its hold on
                  this young heart with its exquisite sensibilities, and its influence was strongly
                  exerted toward subjugating what the timid and morbidly fearful lover felt to be a
                  passion, which, if it should gain full possession of him, would drive him to
                  despair; for while she had heretofore seemed an angel to be not even approached
                  with words of earthly love, she now had to his mind all the beauty of an angel,
                  with the addition of that terrible capacity for scorn and contempt which sensitive
                  and timid young lovers so much fear in the beautiful object of their secret
                  adoration.
               Then, again, in the midst of this internal commotion appeared the dark presence of
                  his father in a storm of fury, and commanding him to desist from desires so
                  obnoxious to himself; and thoughts of disobedience to this imperious autocrat were
                  calculated to make him turn pale at the very idea.
               He was, in short, shaken like a reed in the wind, and his soul tossed about as a
                  plaything by the contending emotions with which he was agitated.
               Now it happened that while suffering the most unendurable pangs of heart and soul
                  he had yet experienced, he received the commands of the broker to attend upon
                     him at his office immediately. This
                  message, breaking in upon him at this instant with such peremptory sternness,
                  filled him with dismay. He was assured that his father, whom he looked upon as one
                  able to read all men as if a glass were set in their bosoms, had scrutinized him
                  for the past few days as if he were searching the most secret depths of his heart;
                  and to be brought before his stern and penetrating eye, with his breast in such an
                  extraordinary state of commotion, was to him a terrible ordeal.
               Tremblingly, therefore, had this young artist entered into his dread father's
                  presence, to be confronted by that gaze before which he had learned to shrink when
                  it would read his hidden thoughts.
               The strange and abrupt manner in which the broker had opened the interview did by
                  no means tend to allay the fears with which the son had come before him. This
                  idolizing worshipper, whose love had inflicted upon him such exquisite torments,
                  felt certain that his father had discovered all, and in order to head off this
                  love was about to command him to marry some young woman of his own selection; and
                  the dismay with which he had received the command from the messenger to hasten
                  hither was increased tenfold, and began speedily to display itself on his
                  countenance in that look of consternation which we have observed.
               His emotion then, when the inexorable father pronounced the name of his cousin, we
                  must leave to the imagination of the reader, which can see so much more than our
                  pen can delineate.
               When the broker said, "How does it please you, boy?" the young artist could
                  scarcely contain himself; but that natural cunning which love puts on to protect
                  itself, even in the most innocent bosom, came to his aid in time to modify
                  somewhat, at least, the impulse that threatened to overpower him; though, as it
                  was, the display of his feelings partook of vehemence. Rising to his feet, he
                  seized one of his father's hands in both of his, and in a voice of extreme
                  agitation, he exclaimed,—
               "My dear father, I do not think I have ever disobeyed you!"
               "No, my son," said the broker graciously, "you have been an obedient child."
               "Then great as is this command which you are pleased to give me, I will not even
                  now venture to disobey you!"
               "You are a good son,—a good son," responded the father, at the same time casting
                  an admonitory look toward the door to indicate that his son must not speak so
                  loud.
               "But, father," stammered William in a lowered but not less agitated voice,
                  "will—she—obey?"
               "Who?—your cousin?"
               "Yes—Emma."
               The broker gave vent to a self-complacent laugh.
               "Borrow no trouble in that direction, my boy," he said, purring his son's upper
                  hand with his own disengaged palm. "Your own consent obtained,—and I trust you
                  will not change your mind,—there will be no difficulty in that direction."
               The implied deference to the young lover's will did not fail to produce its
                  effect.
               "Father!" exclaimed the youth, warmly, "your will is law in such a case as this,
                  and it will be impossible for my mind to change!"
               "A good son, a very good son," again said the father. "Your cousin is very
                  beautiful," he added, while the slightest of smiles appeared, which an attentive
                     observer would have pronounced grim,
                  but which the infatuated young artist took to be a smile of kindly pleasure.
               "Yes," answered William with an emotion he could not conceal, "she
                  is—beautiful—very beautiful!" Then with a look of deep concern, in which the light
                  of jealousy appeared, he said, "She has thought much of another."
               "You mean the young soldier," returned Daniel Garvin, with an expression which,
                  while it startled his son, the latter could not interpret,—"Phillip Mar—"
               "Prescott Marland," interrupted the son, correcting the apparent mistake of his
                  father, whose memory was not so bad as its owner would make it appear.
               "Ah, yes! Prescott Marland!"
               "He thought a great deal of Emma."
               "And Emma of him, you say," rejoined the broker, with a satirical smile.
               "I fear so, father," uttered the young artist; and his brow was bent into a scowl
                  which for the first time indicated that, while he was a transcript of his mother
                  in the common acceptation of the term, there was hidden away in his composition an
                  infusion of his father's blood.
               "You need fear him not!" said the broker, harshly. "This young man was an
                  impostor!"
               "They think him dead."
               "Very likely he is," returned Daniel Garvin, with a twitch of his brows. "Now go,
                  and say nothing. I will arrange for the bridal. So prepare yourself."
               William obeyed his father's command, and departed without another word.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXV.
               IT is necessary that we explain the strange move which we have just seen the
                  broker initiate.
               With the incarceration of Prescott Marland in the madhouse, followed by the
                  startling yet fiercely welcome news of the Veteran's assassination, Daniel Garvin,
                  as we have seen, proceeded to bend his thoughts as best he could to the
                  consideration of the future.
               The blow which his schemes had received from the hand of the Veteran had unsettled
                  his inordinate egotism, and shaken him in his own estimation. He attempted with a
                  sort of desperation to shut out such convictions as would naturally follow so
                  severe a jar, but they came in forms too potent for his resistance. But now as he
                  sat day after day in his private office, a conscious murderer, having been
                  compelled by the power of another to resort to foul assassination as the only
                  means left for that intellect of his which he had heretofore considered so
                  all-powerful, he felt himself tossed on the waves of circumstance, and his
                  thoughts were troubled by a distraction which was an unusual experience of his
                  astute brain.
               In the midst of these confused deliberations one thought leaped into his mind, and
                  for the time being took entire possession of it. It was no more nor less than the
                  marriage of Emma Paige to his son William. Here was a waist anchor to be thrown
                  out in case of storms, which he now could but feel were likely to burst upon him
                  at any moment,—for he had come to look with ill-suppressed fear on the existence
                  of that organization from which had
                  issued the two champions who had given him so hard a combat, and which, for aught
                  he knew, might furnish a hundred more to do battle in the same cause.
               Like a monarch who seeks to intermarry a member of his family into the royal
                  family of another kingdom, that he may there have power, so did this scheming
                  broker conceive that if his son were married into the family of his deceased
                  half-brother, he would be provided with a base on which he could fall back if
                  occasion demanded.
               His hate for this family did not interfere with the plan, for his son was scarcely
                  more to him than the son of an utter stranger. If the boy had taken after him, and
                  as he grew up manifested an interest in his own hard money-getting business, he
                  might, perchance, have entertained toward him a degree of paternal feeling. But he
                  did not take after him; on the contrary, he had inherited his character from his
                  mother, whom Daniel Garvin remembered as a weak, sickly, and, to him, complaining
                  woman, who cost him a heavy doctor's bill; and, moreover, he stupidly took to
                  making pictures like a girl, and whined sentiment like an idiot, instead, of
                  making calculations and counting money like a man. Occasionally he had discovered
                  lurking in his disposition a faint shadow, as it were, of his own, but so vague
                  that only under extraordinary circumstances, when it would assume a more distinct
                  form, could he perceive any semblance to himself.
               There was, therefore, nothing in this direction to prevent him from using the
                  young lover as a tool, for that he was a most enraptured lover, and that his
                  cousin was the object of his love, he had long and silently been aware. A tool
                  would this young artist be, to follow the beck of his hand as undeviatingly as the
                  chisel follows the hand of the master mechanic,—not ready by calculation to do a
                  base deed, but subservient to a will that would move him as by the hand of
                  fate.
               Regarding Emma, he understood her spirit of devotion to her mother and sisters,—he
                  knew well their present condition, their poverty and privation; and he calculated
                  on drawing those strings of a devoted daughter's heart, which every reader has
                  undoubtedly seen worked by some wealthy villain in story or drama, from whom we
                  might suspect he had taken his own cue, if it were possible to imagine him either
                  reading a story or beholding a drama, which not being able thus to imagine, we
                  must ascribe it to his own deep study of men and things around him.
               On this morning, while in the midst of confused meditations, he came suddenly to a
                  decision which resulted in the interview we have described.
               When William Garvin was released from the presence of his father, he flew as on
                  wings through the streets toward his studio. His feet seemed scarcely to touch the
                  pavements, and all about him as he sped along had the appearance of a dream.
                  Everything seemed beneath him and his head had nearly touched the clouds.
               Arrived at the studio he locked the door and threw himself on the lounge, and
                  clasped his throbbing forehead with his hand.
               As the light streamed down from the upper portion of one window, which only
                  remained uncurtained, it fell directly upon this fevered youth, and revealed him a
                  figure suitable for a representation of the fabled lover whom the pangs of love
                  drove mad.
               As one gazes about this studio he is not impressed with the presence of a thorough
                  and proficient genius, but perceives, instead, those crude, vague, ambitious
                  efforts of a young man, who, with an
                  all-absorbing yet baseless enthusiasm, is essentially lacking in the important
                  requisites of a successful artist; here and there, it is true, displaying an
                  exceptionally striking effect, or tolerably drawn figure, which, however, are
                  rather the result of accident than performances that are sure to be repeated. A
                  certain grace, innate in himself, pervades much that he has done, but it is the
                  grace with which the child, if his motions be graceful, will draw his untutored
                  pencil over the paper before he can read the print which he may, perchance, be
                  defacing.
               In short, the works we behold are a complete expression of the character which has
                  conceived them,—one of those natures of extreme sensibility, with emotional
                  temperament, and aspirations which never permit him to touch the solid earth; but
                  leaping as he supposes the winged steed that is to bear him to the region where
                  art only exists, he awakes after a comparatively fruitless life to find that he
                  has been astride a wooden horse, the rocking of which has to his dazed imagination
                  seemed the progress of flying.
               Perhaps no difference exists in the world more marked than that which lies between
                  the man of true artistic genius and him who, with a highly sensitive and morbid
                  disposition, talks of art, and dreams a comparatively inactive life away in the
                  midst of shifting clouds. The former is possessed of the most concentrated
                  energies, and will, like Michael Angelo, hew a law-giving Moses, paint a Sistine
                  ceiling, defy a Pope of Rome, or defend the fortifications of a native Florence;
                  the latter has no self-made type in history, for he makes no history, passing
                  through the world like a fleeting shadow, except that his emotional nature, with
                  its morbid sensibility and impressibility, is ever a source of exquisite torment
                  and unrest.
               In the young man who has now thrown himself upon the lounge we see an example of
                  the latter type. Artist we call him, for as such he has written his name on his
                  cards and tacked it on his door; and so entrancing are his daily dreams in
                  connection with art that we have not the heart to deny him a title in which he
                  takes such infinite pride.
               The subdued light and solitary silence of the studio by no means tended to
                  diminish the burning fever which now seemed to threaten him with utter
                  prostration. His body surged with the surging blood, and presently both hands were
                  pressed hard upon his temples as if his senses were threatening to leave by these
                  avenues.
               At length he rose, and approached an easel on which was a painting covered with
                  crimson cloth. He nervously snatched this covering from the picture, and stood
                  gazing upon it with unutterable rapture. It was a portrait of his lovely cousin.
                  Having drawn in the outlines from a photograph which Emma had given him with her
                  own hand several months before, he had occupied himself day after day during those
                  hours when he could lock his door against all intruding visitors, in giving vent
                  with his pencil to the ecstasies which so completely mastered him.
               Indifferent though it was as a work of art, it was yet characterized by an
                  expression which only such sentiments and emotions as had directed this entranced
                  lover's hand could have conveyed to the canvas.
               He stood before it a moment as if spell-bound, and then dropping into a chair he
                  shaded his eyes for an instant with his hand, while a look of the most incredulous
                  joy overspread his delicate countenance.
               Then again rising to his feet he quickly advanced to the painting and pressed his
                  lips to it. Instantly on performing ing
                  this act his entire face and neck were suffused with a deep blush, and a tremor
                  took possession of his slight frame.
               "O heavens!" he exclaimed in an uncontrollable transport, "can it be possible that
                  my father has thus ordained my happiness!" And now giving rein to his emotions, as
                  if madness had actually seized him, he covered the forehead, eyes, cheeks, lips,
                  with kisses of rapture.
               Just before this culmination of his ungovernable emotions two knocks had been
                  given outside, the second after a moment's interval of waiting; but the infatuated
                  young artist had not heard them. His senses seemed closed to all things except
                  this picture of his idol. But now the door, which in his excitement he had left
                  unlocked, was opened and closed with a hand so firm that but little noise was
                  made, and then a stately form appeared beyond the screen and there stopped, as if
                  he, whose presence was so unbeknown to the owner of the studio, were transfixed
                  with amazement.
               The portrait was partly turned toward him, while the face of the young artist was
                  to the same degree turned away. He had entered upon the scene just as the broker's
                  son was in the midst of his final rhapsodies.
               Mingled with the wild display of his intoxicating love were the most impetuous and
                  incoherent utterances.
               "My father commanded this?—Dearest cousin! are you indeed mine?—Yes, you shall be
                  happy, for my father says it!—You will be his daughter, and you shall no longer
                  suffer!—No! No! I will make you happy with my kisses! Thus!—and thus!—and thus!"
                  Then with a sudden vehemence he kissed the lips again and again, and exclaimed,
                  with a voice in which the tones of his father's voice were perceptible, "Prescott
                  Marland was a traitor! a despicable traitor! and not worthy so much as the
                  faintest smile of these lips!"
               This vehement denunciation of the bold and generous Lieutenant seemed to startle
                  him into a realization of the outer world, and he cast his eye about him with a
                  frightened glance of apprehension.
               In the next instant he had staggered back against the wall, with his hands
                  outstretched for support, while his effeminate features, recently so deeply
                  suffused with his hot blood, turned to a livid white, as he gazed appalled on that
                  silent visitor.
               It was the Veteran, pale and worn with recent suffering, which served to enhance
                  the expression of commanding sternness and severity with which he now contemplated
                  the awe-stricken youth before him.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVI.
               AN hour subsequent to the incidents narrated in the last chapter the Veteran came
                  forth from the studio of William Garvin, with a countenance in which an ineffable
                  expression of pity was mingled with a look of inexorable resolution.
               We will explain to the reader first, this apparent resurrection from the dead, and
                  then the cause of this strange visit to the studio.
               The wound inflicted by the bullet from Dick Smasher's pistol was severe, but not
                  mortal. The ball struck the skull obliquely, and glanced off, tearing the scalp
                  badly, and rendering the intended victim of the shot insensible. He awoke to
                  consciousness at the station-house, not long after he had been conveyed thither, and on being informed
                  by Officer McNeal, who was by when he revived, of all that had happened, including
                  the appearance of the reporter on the scene, his unresting brain, alive to the
                  situation even after this terrible shock, at once apprehended who was the
                  instigator of the attempted assassination, and he took action accordingly. To his
                  great satisfaction he found McNeal to be not only a soldier, as stated in the
                  report of the attempted murder, but a comrade, and ready to assist him in the
                  design he had in view, which was to let the report of his death remain
                  uncontradicted in the papers, until he was ready to show himself in person, and
                  the more effectually confound the schemer whose plans and actions would now be
                  based on the supposition of his death.
               McNeal not only securely provided against discovery by any who might come to the
                  station-house, but he took the Veteran to his own home that night, and there kept
                  him until he was convalescent.
               The object of his strange visit to William Garvin's studio, which was the first
                  made after his confinement, was nothing less than the employment of the young
                  artist as an agent against the designs of his own father.
               To a man of the Veteran's high principles of action it cost much profound
                  consideration before he could decide to make this move, a circumstance the more
                  marked as his decisions were usually made with clearness and rapidity after
                  acquiring a careful knowledge of his ground. The reader will recall the earnest
                  expression of a hope, made to Prescott Marland as recorded in a former chapter,
                  that he might never find it necessary to set this young man at work against his
                  own father, together with that utterance of prophetic fears in his concluding
                  words: "Though Heaven only knows, in such an affair as this, what
                  instrumentalities will have to be used before we get through with it." But the
                  necessity for immediate action was now imperative, and no other instrument was to
                  him available for the accomplishment of that which was now all-important to his
                  plans: namely, the recovery of Jonas Cringar's forgery.
               When he entered the studio, as we have described, he was first amazed to behold a
                  youth, who had always impressed him as singularly shy and timid, thus kissing a
                  portrait in the frenzied madness of love; but the next moment, when he had
                  recognized a resemblance to Emma Paige, and heard his wild utterances, closing
                  with the vehement denunciation of Prescott Marland, his amazement was changed into
                  a feeling of the sternest severity, for he saw in those utterances the motive
                  spirit of the unprincipled and scheming father.
               Nothing could have more effectually subserved his purpose than this remarkable
                  manner of his introduction. Those sensations with which William Garvin had read of
                  the Veteran's assassination, the morning succeeding the murderous attempt upon
                  him, were not stronger than were the counter-sensations, so to speak, which he
                  experienced when, in the midst of his frantic demonstrations of love and wild and
                  vehement utterances, he turned and found himself as by supernatural agencies in
                  the presence of him whom he had thought dead.
               We have told the reader how the ideal image into which he had formed the Veteran,
                  making him as one of the gods, was shattered by the announcement of his murder in
                  an obscure yard by common ruffians. But how can we describe the emotions with
                  which he now beheld that formerly idealized being standing thus unsummoned and
                  unheralded in his studio, his lofty form almost lost in the dim shades there pervading, while the pale and
                  slightly attenuated face which received the descending and concentrated rays from
                  the upper portion of the curtained window was bent upon him, with its strong
                  lights and deep shadows, in the full power of its impressive grandeur? As he
                  staggered against the wall appalled by this sombre vision, which at that moment
                  was as terrible to his conscience as it was sombre to his sight, his mind seemed
                  swept up as by a whirlwind, and then sent dizzy and helpless into the grasp of him
                  who now appeared vested with attributes far transcending those which his
                  idealizing fancies had conjured up for him before the news of the
                  assassination.
               His heart was seized with a deadly sickness, for a voice seemed to thunder to his
                  soul that the presence of this apparent vanquisher of death itself was the signal
                  for the annihilation of those fevered hopes which, alas! had been so fiercely
                  kindled to be extinguished in one short hour!
               But even with all this endured, it were a question whether if that which was to
                  come had been hurled in upon him unaccompanied by the sustaining will of his
                  visitor, his distracted mind would not have yielded to the blow. As it was, the
                  shock, when the full purpose of the Veteran's visit was in the course of that next
                  hour revealed to him, had wellnigh left him utterly undone.
               Subject though he was to the will of the Veteran, almost as the volition of the
                  mesmeric subject has been affirmed to be under the absolute control of the
                  mesmerizer, yet for a brief space there ensued a struggle which threatened to
                  burst the bonds of that powerful influence, and render vain the purposes of this
                  extraordinary visit. But the Veteran relied not alone on the power of his great
                  will; he depended chiefly on the justice of his cause, his will acting as a
                  necessary instrument by which to press home this justice so that the mind of
                  William Garvin, while it might be subjugated by forces not to be resisted, would
                  in this condition be made to realize the righteousness of the task allotted him in
                  the rôle of the remarkable drama that was being
                  enacted. Profoundly versed in the mysteries of the human heart, this man, with a
                  comprehensiveness of mind equal to the strength of his will, proceeded to bring to
                  the aid of his object that all-devouring love which the broker's son experienced
                  for his cousin, in combination with those qualities he inherited from his
                  mother.
               Without revealing all the heinousness of the father's crime, he had made known
                  sufficient to serve his purposes. At first, though told by one whom he looked upon
                  as reflecting the virtues of Heaven itself, the spirit of the astounded son rose
                  against the arraignment of that father who had but just now ordained so infinite a
                  happiness for him; but his visitor soon compelled this spirit to yield to the
                  truth, though the realization of it nearly drove him to despair.
               But we will not occupy time and space in recounting the details of an interview
                  the like of which, fortunately, the events of life do not compel often to be
                  enacted. Suffice it to say, that when the Veteran went forth from the studio, with
                  his inexorable resolution softened by the heart's unutterable pity, he left a
                  soul, which he had found so full of wild ecstasy and joy, now crushed under what
                  to the hapless youth seemed the iron hand of a relentless fate.
               Night gradually advanced, and the studio grew dark while the light that descended
                  through the curtained winnow came only from the stars; but still that slight form
                  remained silent and motionless, as if it were wrought from the inanimate clay in
                  which he himself had formerly endeavored to embody his impracticable dreams.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXVII.
               WE will return to Prescott Marland, whom we left thrust into the cell of a
                  mad-house, with the thongs which bound him severed and the door locked against
                  him, while his ears were greeted by the gibbering of a maniac.
               With the use of his limbs he instantly rose to his feet, and the gibbering ceased.
                  He looked about him and found himself in a square cell, with walls of stone and a
                  small, heavily grated window, which was dimly defined against the slightly
                  illuminated atmosphere of night without. But what especially attracted his
                  attention was the appearance of two lights, which he knew to be the eyes of a
                  human being, glaring upon him from the darkness of one of the rear corners of the
                  cell.
               Suddenly this corner was lit up by dim, greenish rays from above, and Prescott
                  beheld a maniac chained to the wall, his face long and haggard, with the beard and
                  hair standing out like quills of the porcupine, sitting on a square stone fixed to
                  the floor, while with his elbows on his knees he gnawed the finger-nails of either
                  hand, and silently glared upon his new companion.
               Prescott comprehended the situation in an instant. The cell, the maniac, and the
                  light, which he perceived to issue from an aperture in which was set a bull's-eye
                  of greenish hue, were all intended to carry out a diabolical object, such as he
                  had read of in published accounts of places of this kind. He knew that abject
                  submission, lunacy, or death, one of these three, was now the only end to be
                  expected unless he could escape a prison so horrible.
               Presently the maniac began again to mumble as he gnawed his nails, while his eyes
                  remained fixed with their wild glare on the young Lieutenant.
               Prescott, who had studied somewhat into the laws that govern the eccentric courses
                  of insanity, began with a stout heart to consider how he should conduct himself
                  toward his crazy fellow-prisoner. It occurred to him that, even with this raving
                  maniac, he might so exert a strong will directed by an alert mind as to make
                  himself, to a degree at least, master of the situation, and by this means enjoy
                  perhaps some immunity from the terrible fate which it seemed probable had been
                  prepared for him.
               While this indomitable young soldier was busy with his thoughts the maniac
                  continued to stare upon him, his mutterings increasing with a sort of guttural
                  violence preparatory to an outburst.
               Suddenly he leaped to his feet, and, brandishing his clenched hands before him,
                  his countenance assumed a look of defiant rage.
               "Vile shadow-legs!" he yelled in a screeching voice, "I saw it with these eyes!
                  You shot him to get your furlough of sixty days!—He writhed! he writhed! he
                  writhed! O, how he writhed!" screamed the madman, gnashing his teeth and raising
                  his hands in the air. Then advancing on Prescott he exclaimed, "You lie, you Rebel
                  dog! You shot him for a furlough! He fell on your accursed dead line
                  when he dropped his crutch, and you shot him, and he writhed and kicked his one
                  leg, and you mocked him and grinned at him! He was my brother, you infernal
                  monster! and I'll tear your heart—no, no! I'll splinter it, for 't is made for the
                  hammer!" And, rushing to the length of his chain, he beat the air with furious
                  blows of his fist, while Prescott stood just out of reach calmly meeting the
                  frenzied eye before him with a steady gaze.
               
               The young Lieutenant at once apprehended that he was in the presence of a Union
                  soldier, who had been driven mad by terrible suffering while in the hands of the
                  Rebels as a prisoner, and whose raving recalled to his mind, with an inward horror
                  that even surpassed the feeling aroused by his own present terrible situation, the
                  atrocious order from Rebel head-quarters that "Any sentinel killing a Federal
                  soldier, approaching the dead line, shall receive a furlough of sixty days; while
                  for wounding one, he shall receive a furlough for thirty days."
               All at once the maniac ceased smiting the air, and falling back a pace, stared at
                  the object of his insane fury, and exclaimed,—
               "Thou art no Rebel, to brave me with such a front as that!"
               Prescott, whose eye still remained steadily fixed, now cried in a sharp military
                  voice of command,—
               "About—face!"
               The mad soldier instantly brought his feet into position, and obeyed the order,
                  the chains clanking with his movement.
               "Forward—march!"
               The left foot struck out with a prompt step, and a direct line of march was taken
                  to the stone seat.
               "Halt!—about—face!"
               These orders were obeyed with the same alacrity, and the maniac stood with his
                  left hand hanging by his side, and his right slightly raised, with the fingers
                  bent as if he held a gun at shoulder arms.
               Prescott now felt in his pockets for paper and pencil; but he found them empty,
                  which recalled the action of hands about these pockets during the struggle in the
                  hall. Without showing his momentary discomposure, he made a movement as if about
                  to write on a tablet, and said, in the same voice of command,—
               "Your full name and rank?"
               "Charles Albertson Lenning, Third Corporal!"
               "You are commended for your promptness and soldierly appearance, Corporal Lenning.
                  Left face!—Arms—port!—Break ranks!—March!"
               The mad soldier, whose wild and shrunken visage lit up with a gleam of pleasure at
                  the compliment of his improvised commander, having "broken ranks," sat down on the
                  stone, tore a shred from his tattered clothing, and picking up his chain commenced
                  rubbing it as if it were a part of his accoutrements, which the compliment he had
                  received had spurred him on to polish with unusual care.
               Prescott now retired to another stone seat on the opposite side of the cell, and
                  sitting down contemplated this miserable victim of Rebel cruelty with thoughts so
                  absorbing that he forgot for a while that he himself was reserved for a fate
                  perhaps equally as cruel. The maniac recalled to mind the reports that continually
                  came into camp during the war of the horrible sufferings of Union prisoners; and
                  he again experienced that feeling of bitter hatred of the savage and barbarous
                  spirit displayed by the Southern leaders which myriads of his comrades felt who
                  nervously grasped their weapons and strained their eyes in the direction of the
                  scene of those Rebel atrocities.
               This present bitterness was not diminished by the thought of the odious sentiments
                  which had already found expression in the land by some who enjoyed the reputation
                  of loyalty during the war,—by men who did not know the difference between
                  magnanimity and the most abject toadyism,—men who with indecent haste were rushing
                  to necks that an enlightened mercy had spared from the noose, and clasping them
                  with eager arms, were crying with
                  heart-sickening fervor: "Dear friends! we rejoice to see you once more in our
                  fold! Utter not even a word of apology, but allow us to hang like penitents on
                  these noble bosoms and we shall be happy! You displayed as much heroism, as much
                  devotion to a principle, as we of the North, and your motives were as high and
                  noble! Forgive you? We shall be but too happy if you forgive us!"
               We say that the thought of the prevalence of sentiments such as these did not
                  serve to allay the bitterness of the young Lieutenant's heart as he contemplated
                  the human wreck before him. Here was a being driven mad through the terrible
                  sufferings inflicted by the very objects of this disgraceful flunkyism,—a being
                  doomed day after day to reproduce in his ravings the impression of the awful
                  scenes in which he had been both actor and witness.
               This young soldier represented the true magnanimity of the war, inasmuch as he
                  represented the spirit of the Northern armies,—a magnanimity which can only belong
                  to that high courage, that lofty devotion to principle, which causes him who
                  possesses it to hazard his own life to preserve that of his country. The solemnity
                  of the conflict is felt by him as by no other. Puerilities and mawkish sentiment
                  are sloughed off. He comes to see things in the true reality of their bearing. He
                  apprehends, with the profoundest philosopher, that, while thousands of men,
                  through ignorance of those principles by which humanity alone can live, may have
                  been deluded into a monstrous Rebellion, and their crime palliated accordingly;
                  yet no intelligent leaders could have been guilty of the brutalities practised
                  upon Union prisoners, and at the same time have believed themselves in the right.
                  He realizes that such atrocities are the revelation of their consciousness of
                  guilt, writing, as it were, in characters that flame with the fires of Hell,
                     "We fight against God and the powers of Heaven!"
               Our young hero represents the spirit which found such noble expression in the
                  great commander of our armies, now the chief magistrate of that Union he did so
                  much to preserve among the nations. General Grant fought the Rebellion with iron
                  hand; but he stood ready to receive the truly repentant, as the father received
                  the prodigal son. He did not demand that they should grovel before him as captives
                  before a conqueror. All he required was that they practically acknowledge their
                  error by submitting to the arbitrament of the sword, and henceforth conduct
                  themselves like good citizens. While on the one hand he suppresses with
                  unflinching resolution the outbreaks of a rampant rebellious spirit, on the other
                  he nominates to an important office one who, though prominent and active in the
                  war, is equally so in efforts that prove his enlightened repentance.
               A desire for sleep finally terminated Prescott's thoughts in this direction. The
                  maniac, now mumbling to himself, still continued polishing the links of his chain
                  which in his insane fancy he had metamorphosed into his accoutrements, and the
                  young Lieutenant began to cogitate some plan by which he could secure himself
                  against an immediate interruption by his crazy cell-mate.
               Presently an idea struck him. He possessed admirable powers of imitation; so
                  putting his hand to his mouth he sounded the tattoo like a bugle a short distance
                  off.
               The instant it struck the ears of the maniac he stopped his rubbing, and with the
                  remark, "Old Hiram's prompt to-night!" he carefully put aside both rag and chain,
                  and, extending himself on the stone floor, was soon fast asleep.
               Prescott, who could not help smiling with amusement at the success of his stratagem, though in the midst
                  of circumstances so gloomy and depressing, now laid himself down for slumber,
                  which after a while bore him away as he was in the midst of thoughts of her who
                  was to suffer such anguish from his sudden and mysterious absence.
               He slept with tolerable soundness for several hours, when he was awakened by the
                  howling of the maniac, who was raving again on his prison life with the
                  Rebels.
               "O God!" he screamed, "don't shoot him! He's my brother, I tell you! Don't you see
                  he's got but one leg? He's a cripple, you hireling of the Devil! He's starving and
                  weak, and fell against it! O God o' mercy! he's fired!" Here the maniac covered
                  his eyes with his hands, and stood trembling. Suddenly uncovering them he glared
                  in front of him, and staggering back cried, "He writhes! he writhes!" Then
                  bursting into a fit of wild laughter he exclaimed, "Have a care, you lantern-jawed
                  Reb! or he 'll kick your grinning teeth out! Ha, ha, ha! Have a care, I say! He
                  kicks! he kicks! Tell Bob Lee he kicks!"
               Prescott suspected that he had been put in this cell with his brother-soldier to
                  carry out a grim jest of his persecutors, who expected to have him utterly broken
                  of his sleep, which, with the terrible presence of the madman, and the damp,
                  noxious air of the cell, would secure the result they aimed at. He therefore
                  decided to act cautiously, and let them be confirmed in the idea that his rest and
                  quiet were at the mercy of the maniac; so lying quietly, and making no noise, he
                  allowed him to rave on with his screaming, howling, and laughter, to be heard by
                  any one above who perchance might be awake.
               The mad soldier abruptly changed the scene of his terrible fantasms. Suddenly
                  beginning to rush about as far as his clanking chain would permit, he cried as he
                  waved his hands toward the door, "Drive in the pickets! Drive 'em in! Drive 'em
                  in! Now scamper!" he yelled with another wild laugh,—"scamper, you infernal
                  Johnnies! Bang! Bang! Take that and be off! Hi, hi, there! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!" He
                  was evidently, with his imaginary prisoners, hunting down the vermin of one of his
                  prisons.
               Thus he continued to rave, shifting from one horrible scene to another, and
                  picturing some of them so vividly in his madness that Prescott shuddered as he
                  listened.
               Finally, when the latter judged his purpose in reference to those above had been
                  sufficiently accomplished, he cried in suppressed but commanding tones,—
               "Corporal Lenning, silence your men, and go to sleep!"
               The mad corporal immediately responded by a loud "Hist!" as if to his
                  men, and again lying down was soon once more asleep.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVIII.
               LONG, interminable days, and long and gloomy nights passed by. What with the
                  incessant exertion of his will on the maniac, the cold, damp cell, and the meagre
                  food,—which, with a wretched attempt at wit, the brutal attendant had once
                  informed him "was such rations as was ruin to the government to furnish two such
                  drones in the service,"—these rations, as the reader will infer from the remark,
                  being divided between him and his mad messmate,—the strong and robust Prescott
                  Marland was growing thin, pale, and anxious.
               Once he had sprung upon this attendant as he came to the door, but besides being
                  powerful himself the fellow had called
                  reinforcements, and the young soldier was tumbled about in his cell, promised
                  short rations for a few days, and threatened with the "walking-over-him"
                  performance,—which meant that a heavy, powerful attendant would break in his ribs
                  with his knees,—if he tried it again.
               But just as even the elastic and buoyant spirit of Prescott Marland was about to
                  settle into a sort of dull despair an event occurred on which the watchful doctor
                  and his wolf-like, vigilant attendants had not calculated.
               One night, when all was still throughout the mad-house, Prescott, who was awake,
                  heard a peculiar clicking sound at his door; in another moment the hinges slightly
                  creaked, and some one whispered,—
               "Is Marland here?"
               Prescott instantly returned the answer, also in a whisper,—
               "I am here."
               "I am a friend,—come!"
               Prescott went to the door.
               "Who are you?" he asked.
               "A friend who will open every door between ourselves and freedom in an hour."
               Prescott thought a moment.
               "I understand you," said the other, while the young Lieutenant was made aware that
                  this strange and unexpected friend was silently laughing. "But I am no more crazy
                  than you are. I'm an unfortunate inventor, that is all. But I can't stop here to
                  talk! Come with me into the open air, or stay here, as you choose. I have that
                  here"—and he showed two pieces of bent wire—"which will pass us along without
                  tickets."
               The maniac, who had also been asleep, now stirred, and Prescott, startled for fear
                  his voice would expose the open door, darted out, and in another moment the
                  inventor had silently closed it, and, taking his companion by the sleeve, began
                  ascending a stairway.
               The young Lieutenant looked back and mentally uttered a "good-by," and sighed as
                  he thought of the unfortunate being whom he had learned to regard, with all his
                  raving madness, with the sympathy of a messmate.
               "If I succeed in getting out of here, my poor comrade, you shall have better
                  quarters than this nest of devils furnishes you!" he exclaimed to himself as he
                  cautiously mounted the stairs.
               As each succeeding door was reached his guide proved as good as his word. To
                  Prescott's astonishment, bolt after bolt of the heavy locks, which fastened insane
                  patients and sane prisoners alike in this abominable and falsely named asylum,
                  yielded to the pressure of his simple implements, and flew back to let them
                  pass.
               Once they stopped in suspense, startled by a noise above. It was only the voice of
                  a harmless lunatic. They heard nothing else and went on.
               They neared the hall which led to the front door.
               "Here," whispered the inventor, "is the doctor's private office."
               A thought struck Prescott.
               "If I but had a light," said he, "I would like to take a survey of this same
                  office."
               "It shall be done," said his companion with another of those silent laughs.
                  Opening the door with his magic wires he bade Prescott enter, and following him
                  took a match from some cotton-padding which he got at through a rent in his vest,
                  and lit it, at the same time saying with a grin, "When these stupid fellows prove
                  a match for Jacob Easter then Jacob Easter 'll give up the match."
               
               Prescott's eyes now fell upon a small nursery-lamp, which had evidently been left
                  there that night by Dr. Pennell in somewhat of a hurry, inasmuch as the cap was
                  left carelessly hanging. After a little effort the lamp was lighted, and the young
                  Lieutenant, with the assistance of the inventor, quickly proceeded to
                  business.
               With the aid of smaller instruments than he had been using, which he improvised
                  from the wire of the doctor's gas-shade, the inventor rapidly opened desk,
                  drawers, and safe, the lock of which was not complicated, and all papers that
                  Prescott could lay hands on were confiscated as contraband of war. Tying them into
                  a bundle quicker even than he had ever packed his knapsack on a ten minutes'
                  notice to march, he gave the word to his companion to put out the light, and left
                  the office with a look of supreme satisfaction.
               When they arrived at the front door Prescott's heart beat with quickened pulse as
                  in anticipation he breathed the free air of heaven into those lungs that had for
                  so many days inhaled the pestiferous vapors of his cell.
               This lock gave the inventor more trouble than had any of the others.
               While he was working away at the obstinate bolts they heard a loud yawn; and then
                  a rough voice, which Prescott recognized as the one that sung his funeral dirge
                  when he was borne to his gloomy quarters, called out,—
               "Betty! have done with that scratching! You know what I told ye if ye did n't stop
                  that kind of night work!"
               The inventor reached out his hand, and placed it over the young Lieutenant's mouth
                  as a warning for perfect silence; but the latter was already as motionless as were
                  he and the scouts whom he often commanded, when in the night they would suddenly
                  find themselves in the vicinity of Rebel pickets, though as he listened a light
                  would have revealed a face in which the determination to die rather than again be
                  incarcerated was strongly apparent.
               But nothing more was heard. Silence again reigned throughout the mad-house, broken
                  only by a faint howl, which Prescott shudderingly fancied to be the wail of the
                  mad corporal on finding his commander gone, and once more the inventor essayed to
                  pick the last lock, his very fingers seeming conscious of the necessity for the
                  most extreme caution.
               Presently one or two sounds, so slight that they could hardly be called clicks,
                  were heard, and then the door was silently swung on its hinges, and in another
                  instant the two captives stood in the open air.
               Closing the door as quickly and silently as he had opened it, the inventor
                  exclaimed in a whisper,—
               "Now the quicker our legs carry us out of this the better!"
               And thereupon they sped away, keeping a lookout for patrolmen, who might take them
                  to be thieves.
               When they felt confident that they had put themselves beyond all attempts at
                  pursuit, they slackened their pace and fell into conversation.
               Prescott expressed his astonishment at what had just been done by his
                  companion.
               "If I had been told all this I should scarcely have believed the story," he
                  said.
               The inventor laughed. "With the exception of taking along a companion as I have
                  to-night, all this has been done before in a much larger place than this den of
                  iniquity, and under more extraordinary circumstances. The freedom given me enabled
                  me, with eyes and ears made alert by a
                  speedy knowledge of the character of the place, to post myself in regard to your
                  sanity and the number of your cell; and as for my performance with my wires, if
                  you would like to hear it, I will tell you what happened in Massachusetts several
                  years ago, which really suggested to me what you have just seen me do."
               "Now is the very time to hear it," answered Prescott. "After my incarceration in
                  that terrible cell with the ravings of a madman forever in my ears, nothing would
                  please me more than a narrative of more wonderful exploits than yours has been
                  to-night."
               "It happened several years ago in Boston and vicinity, and the actor was an
                  inventor like myself," said the other. "He had been quite sick, his illness
                  threatening to settle on the lungs. One day he was attacked with a paroxysm, as
                  near as I could ascertain, and he cried out for air. Those about him would give
                  him none. He was suffocating, and again demanded air, telling the servant to let
                  down the window; but he was again refused, and interference combined with the
                  refusal in a manner which tended to excite his already fevered brain, and a will
                  naturally intense and calculated to repel such interference. His chest was now
                  terribly oppressed, and leaping from his bed he opened the window himself. It was
                  immediately closed by one whom he considered had no authority to do so. This
                  treatment, together with his condition, which those about him should have seen
                  required that his wish be granted, increased his paroxysm to such a degree that he
                  rushed out of the room and through the entry crying, "Air! air!" and reaching the
                  front door he kicked out the side-lights and commenced breathing the fresh air
                  into his laboring lungs.
               "The cry now arose, 'He's mad! he's mad!' and strong men for whom he entertained
                  an intense personal dislike were sent for, and forthwith everything was done to
                  increase a temporary paroxysm—started by congestion and aggravated by unwise
                  treatment—into the symptoms of madness. While the men whom he so intensely
                  disliked were hastening to ignorantly do all in their power to increase these
                  symptoms, he was making his way to the yard for "air! more air!"
               "The end of it was, he was driven an hour or so afterwards to the Somerville
                  Asylum, and there treated as insane. He had a high spirit, and would not brook
                  being treated as a madman. He did not choose to lie and cringe, nor did he wish to
                  adopt the policy of enduring his treatment with pretended patience. He behaved as
                  you or I would, if any one should come to our houses and undertake to treat us as
                  if we were crazy. If you have studied the history of insanity to any extent, you
                  will readily apprehend that if once a sane man gets into an asylum as an insane
                  man, any display of that high spirit with which sanity will repel insulting and
                  unjust treatment will be set down, with perhaps rare exceptions, as the evidence
                  of insanity!
               "'I am going to leave your place,' said my fellow-crafts-man one day to Dr. —,
                  'and you can't prevent me.' The doctor smiled. But his smiling didn't prevent his
                  so-called patient from keeping his word; for being allowed to walk in the garden,
                  one day he secured an apple-twig, and that night with this and a piece of wire he
                  picked every lock that stood in his way, and went home."
               "It seems incredible!" exclaimed Prescott.
               "Hold on," said the inventor. "I haven't finished yet. You see this going directly
                  home was to me the only really insane act he seems to have committed. The doctor
                     sent right over there as soon as he
                  found him gone, and his wife, whom I understand to have been a woman of rare
                  excellence, was induced by the ill-considered warnings that were poured into her
                  ears, to give her consent that he be again incarcerated. He was accordingly seized
                  and taken back to the asylum, where he complained he was treated worse than he was
                  before,—and he declared that his former treatment was bad enough. He told Dr. — a
                  second time that he should leave. I don't recollect distinctly what he reported
                  the doctor's answer to be, but I think it was a threat of severe punishment if he
                  should attempt it. But go he did, in spite of an extra watch that was set on him,
                  this time picking his way out with a wire and bent nail, if I remember
                  aright."
               "And did they catch him again?" asked Prescott, deeply interested in this
                  remarkable account.
               "They did not. He did in a cornfield the rest of the night, and then contrived to
                  send a message to his wife through relations in Charlestown, informing her of his
                  escape, and telling her that if she would send word that he could return home and
                  remain in peace, he would come; but if not, he should leave the place, I think
                  forever."
               "And she sent the promise?" said Prescott.
               "Yes. And the striking part is, that this man who had been twice incarcerated in
                  an asylum, escaping the first time and then the second, in spite of the doctor who
                  pronounced him insane, and treated him as such, and, according to his statements,
                  in a manner to be condemned,—this man today is exactly the man, as to sanity, that
                  he was when he picked his way out of the asylum; and yet since that time he not
                  only has borne a sound reputation as a worthy and useful citizen, but has produced
                  an invention the value of which may be judged from innumerable infringements, and
                  has fought his way back in some degree to the pecuniary position which he enjoyed
                  before his sickness, but which he lost during this illness through the dishonesty
                  of others; moreover, having lost his first wife, he has again married,—which is
                  the only evidence of insanity, I presume, that even Dr. — would venture to
                     adduce."*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *This account is literally true, the authors being personally cognizant of
                     the facts.
               
               Prescott, who had continued beyond the corner where he was to turn, that he might
                  not interrupt his companion's interesting narration, now stopped, and after a
                  moment's thought he said,—
               "This seems to me an impressive lesson in reference to private asylums. If such a
                  case could happen in a public asylum under the direction of a State which is known
                  to devote so much attention to the subject of insanity, what may we not expect of
                  those private mad-houses where it is for the interest of the proprietors to have
                  their establishments well filled, and which, say what men please, are to a degree
                  irresponsible? Of course this villain, from whose clutches we have just escaped,
                  is an exception. He evidently is a monster who, like the wolves that put on the
                  preacher's garb as a covering for their crimes, institutes a private mad-house as
                  a means for his own infamous ends,—and if I have that here," he said tapping the
                  bundle of papers taken from Dr. Pennell's office, "that will in any way enable me
                  to break up his den, I shall account my sojourn under his roof as well
                  recompensed. But aside from this fellow, I think there is something about private
                  mad-houses which requires that they be looked into."
               "You speak my thought," responded the inventor, shaking hands with the young
                  Lieutenant. "I know myself to be the intended victim of designing men, and I
                     suppose you know equally as well
                  from whence your madness springs!"
               "I presume I do," returned Prescott, compressing his lips in a manner that boded
                  ill to those whom the inventor's words called up to his mind. Then with another
                  shake of the hand they parted, promising to see each other again.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIX.
               PRESCOTT had scarcely passed a dozen blocks when a man suddenly appeared from a
                  side street, and met him on the corner under a street-lamp.
               "Hallo!" exclaimed this man. "Why, comrade! what in the name of these short hours
                  brings you here?"
               Prescott saw to his surprise that it was Charles Roberts.
               Grasping his hand he in turn exclaimed,—
               "Comrade Roberts! You here this time of night!"
               "Well," said Roberts, laughing, "my presence answers your question, but my
                  question remains unanswered."
               "True," returned Prescott, with a change of countenance. "I promise to tell you at
                  some other time, and also why I am looking a little strange and sickly, which I
                  perceive you are wondering at."
               "All right." And as the countenance of the other also changed he said, "I am just
                  returning from a comrade who will tell no more of his adventures here. I watched
                  with him. He died two hours ago, and I remained to help attend to the body."
               "Does he leave a family?"
               "Yes, but they shall be cared for."
               "They are poor, then?"
               "Yes; but, thank God! we are now so organized that we can get at many of our
                  comrades' families and relieve them, from the funds with which so many of our
                  generous citizens respond to our call. Fortunately one or two of these children
                  are nearly old enough to help the whole family, and all they need is a little
                  bridging over."
               The Deering family was continually in Prescott's mind. He now asked Roberts if he
                  had yet heard from them.
               "Heard from them! Heavens, comrade! Save me from another sight like that!"
               "My worst fears were realized, then!"
               "Realized, comrade! You could not have pictured it! Up, up, up I went, the broken
                  and rickety stairs threatening to crush in at every step, and then I opened a door
                  that was ready to fall at a touch, and there was a sight that beggars my tongue to
                  describe to you! My first exclamation was, 'Great God! is this a soldier's
                     family?' I've read of such scenes, but I never saw one before. They were
                  dying of starvation, comrade, in a wretched, dilapidated attic, the roof broken
                  in, and no fire! Another day of such sickness and starvation would have finished
                  the boy, and two days would have seen the sad work completed! Scarcely was there
                  flesh enough on the whole four from which to draw a single drop of blood. Their
                  eyes were as sunken as the eyes of the dead, and their faces looked like masks of
                  parchment! And the cold was raw enough to make me shiver even in my warm
                  garments!"
               "And they but meagrely dressed?" uttered Prescott, forgetting his own recent
                  trials in the contemplation of this suffering family.
               "'Dressed!' Comrade, if I could but have marched that wife and those three
                  children of a fallen soldier through
                  these streets as they then looked, with their pinched and sickly visages, and
                  their attenuated forms draggling with their scant and tattered garments, and
                  placed a banner over them with the motto, 'BEHOLD A FAMILY OF THE COUNTRY'S
                  DEFENDERS!' I fear me more than one heart would have bled that does not often move
                  with emotion, and eyes that rarely weep would have viewed the passing train
                  through tears they could not hold back!"
               "But, thank God, you have found them!" exclaimed Prescott, deeply affected.
               "Yes. It was a long, close search, but I persevered and traced them at last. My
                  first move was to obtain nourishing food. Ah, comrade! you should have seen the
                  two little girls eat! The crippled one would have killed herself if I had not
                  stood by to watch her. Then I had them removed to comfortable quarters, and they
                  are all doing well. It won't be long before Joseph will be able to go to work for
                  their support."
               "From all accounts this Joseph is a noble boy, and deserves a better position than
                  vending candy on the cars."
               "The Grand Army will attend to that. As soon as he is sufficiently recovered he
                  shall not want for a good situation that will pay him enough to make them
                  comfortable, with what the mother may be able to earn; and the G. A. R. will see
                  that she has plenty to do, at a price that will pay for her labor."
               "Comrade!" exclaimed Prescott, clasping the other's hand, "may Heaven bless the
                  soldier who conceived and initiated the Grand Army of the Republic! This one
                  family preserved from so terrible a death is sufficient to repay our Order in this
                  city for years of labor!"
               "True, comrade! every word true! But this is only one of many cases—though the
                  others may not be so bad— which we have already taken in hand, and which would
                  probably not have been reached by any but ourselves. The idea of the soldier
                  taking care of the family of the soldier has been tested to the satisfaction of
                  every one who desires that the vows made to the Union volunteer when he enlisted
                  shall be sacredly fulfilled. And I tell you, comrade, I think every day of the
                  talk we had on the train about the principles of our Order. As one case after
                  another comes up where we find soldiers' families in want and are able to relieve
                  them, they each add emphasis to that principle whereby we are to eschew all acts
                  which demoralize, and which are sure in the end to prove disastrous.
               "I knew your experience here would confirm in your mind all we then said."
               "My observation has also shown me that care must be taken not to tire our friends
                  by incessant cries dinned into their ears. Let us be bold, but circumspect; not
                  backward in pressing the just claims of the soldier, but judicious in so doing. If
                  Justice herself bawls with a loud voice she is repelled,—you know that,
                  comrade,—and the soldier cannot expect to fare better. Let us rather imitate our
                  own victorious commanders, whose heads and arms did the work, the tongue wagging
                  sufficiently for the purpose, but no more."
               "You are right, comrade. The soldier should make it a point to teach rather than
                  be taught that practical common sense which it is believed service in the field
                  imparts. Of course it is the impulse of the soldier to fight; but it is also his
                  training to see that he fights to some purpose."
               "That's so every time! As regards politics, I by no means would advise silence
                  where citizens as represented by their local governments manifestly fail year
                  after year to keep their pledges to the soldiers, as in the case of monuments ments to the memory of the fallen, and
                  other forms in which the promises of a nation can only be fulfilled through such
                  governments. Here it may become absolutely necessary that the soldiers rise in
                  their united strength and enforce the fulfilment of these pledges. But not as
                  politicians,—simply as the executors of justice."
               "And executors of the loyal and patriotic spirit of the country too."
               "Yes. But this once accomplished, let the soldier not display weakness, and become
                  demoralized by the smell of the political blood which may have been necessarily
                  spilt in the operation. Let him fall back to his proper base, and attend to the
                  work that belongs to him; and if he wishes to engage in politics simply as a
                  politician, let him not advance his claims in this business as a member of the
                  Grand Army of the Republic, nor in any way attempt to involve the G. A. R. in
                  political schemes. My sentiments on this subject have been made if possible the
                  more decided by a letter which I received last week from a soldier, where no Post
                  has yet been organized, who writes that a soldiers' club to which he belongs,
                  though flourishing a short time since, is now threatened with dissolution from
                  tampering with politics, having not only lost the respect and sympathy of the
                  citizens, but created dissension in their own ranks. The difficulty was, they were
                  made use of by an ambitious member, under the specious plea that if he got into
                  office he should look out for the soldier at every turn."
               "A good warning," replied Prescott. "In view of all these things, it is gratifying
                  to know that the national officers of the Order are so strict and emphatic in
                  their injunctions to shun all such causes of disaffection in organized
                  bodies."
               "And no Order should be kept more pure than ours," responded Roberts. "Besides its
                  beneficent work, the Grand Army of the Republic is to stand as the representative
                  of that loyalty and patriotism which has in so sublime a manner been displayed in
                  the recent conflict of liberty and freedom against slavery and servitude,—which in
                  a day transformed the American citizen into a soldier with rifle on his shoulder
                  and knapsack at his back, and sustained him through the horrors of one of the most
                  terrible of wars, with a spirit which only a great cause can inspire! Comrade, I
                  think you will agree with me that the principles which govern our Order are the
                  only principles that can insure a thorough and enduring harmony between the North
                  and South. No reconciliation can endure which is not founded in justice; and
                  especially is no reconciliation sure to abide between the North and South that is
                  not founded in that justice which is the result of single-minded devotion to the
                  highest and best interests of the whole country as a country of freedom. And who
                  so likely to appreciate the sacred institutions of liberty as those who have
                  fought for to maintain them? They had too solemn a duty to perform easily to
                  forget that for which they offered up their lives. No; let our principles of
                  Fraternity, Charity, and Loyalty abide and perform their high mission,
                  uncontaminated by those influences which, emanating from private ambition and
                  political aspirations, can only touch to destroy."
               "Nobly uttered, comrade!" exclaimed Prescott. "There's not a true member of the G.
                  A. R. that will not indorse that! While outside issues can only tend to diminish
                  the efficiency in respect to charity, a proper consideration of these great
                  principles of which you speak can but enhance that efficiency by inspiring within
                  us yet higher and more enduring motives
                  of action. I do not understand you to oppose the sentiment," he continued, "which
                  demands that the soldier, other things being equal, shall have the preference in
                  all offices of trust and emolument at the disposal of the government they fought
                  to preserve; and that the promises of citizens, to the effect that the deserving
                  soldier should not lack for employment if their efforts could secure it for him,
                  and other assurances of this kind, be fulfilled in the spirit with which they were
                  made."
               "No, indeed! On the contrary, I stand ready to pronounce any other line of
                  conduct, by either government or citizens, as ingratitude and a violation of their
                  pledges. I regret to say that there have been too many instances in connection
                  with government employ where the just claims of the soldier have been ignored. It
                  is well known, for example, that at the navy-yards such cases have occurred with
                  reprehensible frequency, and demand the rebuke of the loyal public!"
               "You express my own mind. I am convinced these are the sentiments of all just and
                  candid citizens, and to your last words they would give an outspoken response,
                  were they knowing to the facts."
               Prescott and Roberts were now about to part.
               "Tell me, comrade," said the young Lieutenant, "where the Deering family may be
                  found. There are those who will not let many hours pass before visiting them in
                  their new quarters."
               Roberts, taking out the memorandum-book in which Prescott had with such painful
                  emotions seen the name of Allen Paige's family entered, stopped by a street-lamp
                  and wrote the desired direction on a leaf, and tearing it out, gave it to him.
               "Thank you," said Prescott, reading it: "Joseph Deering's family,
                  No. — Eighth Avenue." And the noble fellow actually forgot for the moment the
                  anticipated delight of once more being in Emma's presence, in thinking of the
                  happiness of the whole family when he should give them this direction, and tell
                  them what the Grand Army had done for the poor sufferers to whom it would guide
                  them.
               "You promised to tell me if the family of Allen Paige should need aid from us,"
                  said Roberts. "Have you heard from them lately?"
               "I shall probably see them to-morrow," replied Prescott, while a shadow passed
                  over his face; "and if they need assistance, I'll not fail to inform you. Good
                  night."
               "Good night."
            
            
               CHAPTER XL.
               OUR present chapter opens not far from the Bowery, in Chatham Street. We enter a
                  building which seems nodding to its neighbor over the way; and, mounting three
                  flights of stairs, pass into a kind of loft, now occupied by one of those
                  characters which only New York and California combined can produce.
               As the occupant is out for a few moments, we will take a survey of this singular
                  chamber. One would think, at first sight, that he was inside a menagerie. Bear and
                  buffalo skins form the bed; a panther-skin covers one wooden chair and the hide of
                  a wolf another. A skin so worn that it would be difficult to name it is spread
                  upon the floor as a mat; and the boards which form the walls of the room are
                  covered with a variety of unique California relics, such as an eccentric
                  adventurer would be likely to bring East as trophies of his exploits in that
                  famous region. The effect of these
                  embellishments was enhanced by two fantastic suits, such as are worn by circus
                  clowns.
               A lasso coiled over a nail, one end carried in a picturesque way over two or three
                  adjoining nails, tells of exploits on the prairies with the national weapon of the
                  Mexicans, which perchance brought down the poor buffalo whose hide now serves for
                  a couch.
               Several cannon-balls of various sizes appear in one corner of the loft, not far
                  from which lies a small pile of hides that bear evidence of long and rough usage;
                  while in different parts of the room are heavy weights, clubs, and other
                  implements suggestive of athletic amusement.
               Presently the proprietor of this grotesque apartment enters, and we behold a man
                  of powerful frame, with a face combining simplicity and shrewdness. His gait has
                  that peculiar rolling motion characteristic of the powerful gymnast, whereby is
                  indicated the perfect "floating" of the hips, which seems to be the very
                  foundation of that statuesque grace, yet unrivalled, which characterize the works
                  of the ancient Greeks.
               Preparing his dress for exercise, he takes a couple of the largest clubs and
                  flourishes them about his head as though they were made of bamboo. Then he picks
                  up two of the heaviest weights, and gives them such a handling as indicates
                  prodigious strength.
               After practising awhile with these weights, he puts them down, and approaches that
                  part of the loft where lie the cannon-balls and worn hides. Drawing the latter a
                  little farther into the room he spreads them so as to cover a circular space about
                  four feet in diameter, and then grasping a large ball he proceeds to the
                  performance of the remarkable feats of the circus arena, that causes the spectator
                  to hold his breath as he follows the round mass of iron running ning about the
                  arms and chest of the performer, and thrown high in the air to fall heavily upon
                  his massive neck.
               The use of the skins is now apparent, for as he allows the ball to come to the
                  floor after each performance, it falls on them with so deadened a sound that those
                  below cannot be disturbed in the least.
               We will give a brief sketch of this extraordinary character.
               His real name we never learned. He went by two aliases, Wrenchy and
                  Saxey; as the former is the name by which he was more generally known, we will use
                  it ourselves. During the Mexican war he went out in Stephenson's notorious New
                  York regiment, which was ordered to California. After it was disbanded there,
                  Wrenchy fell into the ranks of that lawless faction known as the Hounds, which was composed of the most reckless characters who gathered so
                  rapidly in California when the gold-fever spread through the country. Deserters
                  from merchant-vessels and men-of-war helped fill their ranks, in which
                  Stephenson's discharged volunteers were the master spirits. These Hounds were led by such men as Sam Roberts and Jack Powers, the latter of whom
                  is reported to have once hired ten men, at $25 a day, to take three wagon-loads of
                  specie, won by gambling, from the mines down to Stockton. Men like Billy Mulligan
                  and Wrenchy associated with him as special aids. There was a certain
                  picturesqueness about this band, their hats being adorned with strings of beads
                  and a handkerchief, to distinguish them from the Coyotes, the
                  opposing faction, which was composed of those determined to sustain the laws, and
                  protect the foreigners, who were chiefly Chilians and Senorians, and
                  whom the Hounds made the special objects of their persecution.
               
               The term Coyotes was applied by the Hounds to their
                  opponents because the latter were industrious miners, always burrowing in the
                  ground like the small prairie-wolf of that name. It acquired additional
                  significance from the fact that often the lawless miner and the law-abiding miner
                  would stake out claims that joined on the same lead, and then while the former
                  would rest on his pickaxe the other would dig down to the gold, and when there
                  would occasionally burrow into his lazy neighbor's claim, replacing ore with dirt.
                  On the other hand, the lawless fellows would often wait till these industrious
                  miners had struck gold, and then leap in and drive them off, sending the contents
                  of their pistols after them as they fled through the camp. Hence the term Hounds, the chief occupation of the dog for which they were thus
                  named being to hunt down the coyote on the prairies when crossing with the
                  trains.
               An idea of the state of society in California at this period may be formed from
                  the fact that in Tuolumne County, with a population of 15,000, there were 1,700
                  murders in one year, and the only man hanged was a man that stole a mule!
               While engaged in his lawless proceedings as a Hound, Wrenchy would
                  have lost his life on one occasion, had it not been for the interposition, under
                  circumstances of rare magnanimity, of Julius Hammond, who was then acting as
                  sheriff, and who appreciated what was really good in the man.
               After running a course of this kind of life he travelled with Winde &
                  Provost's circus as the "Strong Man," and was famous as a "cannon-ball tosser,"
                  besides being a first-rate acrobat and clown.
               The Rebellion brought him East; he having enlisted in the California Battalion
                  which was attached to the Second Massachusetts Cavalry; and he is now back again
                  in New York, the practice in which we see him at present engaged indicating that
                  he still catches cannon-balls on his neck to put bread into his stomach, which
                  occupation his remarkable constitution has enabled him to continue beyond the age
                  usually attained by such men.
               After changing awhile to two smaller balls, the gymnast returned to the large one,
                  and with the cry, "Come, my little mouse! run! run! run!" he commenced rolling it
                  about on his person until it seemed alive. Presently grasping it in both hands he
                  gave it a more than ordinarily strong toss, and bent his head to receive it as
                  usual on his neck.
               Just as it was reaching its highest altitude the door opened, and a man with a
                  strong, bear-like form, full black beard, and green spectacles entered.
               He started back in alarm as his eye fell on the heavy sphere of iron just
                  beginning to descend upon the bended neck of the athlete; and when it struck with
                  its terrible weight he could not suppress an ejaculation.
               The clown turned, and on seeing his alarmed visitor cried out with a laugh,—"Hyer,*
                   stranger! coming into the show as a deadhead? Ye look scared, old hoss!
                   Conscience bad, eh? Then I'll set one of my mice after ye!"
               
                  
                  *Pronounced Hi-yar'.
               
               His mice were, as we have seen, his cannon-balls.
               As Wrenchy thus addressed him, the visitor started in alarm, for his conscience
                  instinctively made that in earnest which the athlete only meant in play.
               That his conscience is bad the reader will at once apprehend when we inform him
                  that this bearded stranger with the green spectacles is none other than the
                  redoubtable Daniel Garvin, who as we now look at him recalls a statement we heard
                  some time ago, that insanity ran in this family of bilious temperament and intense passions. His present errand,
                  undertaken in so questionable a guise, has certainly an insane tinge to it.
               He has found himself driven into a corner, and he rushes hither and thither like a
                  wild animal who is irresistibly driven into an enclosure by converging fires.
               This deep-dyed sinner realizes that the wicked have no place to stand upon, and
                  when the desperate clutch which they have fastened on the object of their criminal
                  cupidity is threatened, they move their feet to find no firm and solid
                  earth,—nothing but miry and slippery places.
               The disconcerted broker, the forces of whose intellect have become to a degree
                  demoralized, has received news of the failure of the attempt to assassinate the
                  Veteran, and like the worst class of Southern Rebels, who, after their power had
                  been broken in a fair fight, savagely resorted to the most brutal means to
                  continue their flagrant work, so this unprincipled man of schemes can see no way
                  through his own iniquitous business except by a continuance of such atrocious
                  instrumentalities as he has already found himself compelled to use.
               It did not take the athlete long to learn the object of his visitor. He had met
                  such men before, but he inwardly pronounced the broker the greatest scoundrel of
                  them all, and resolved to repay him for so complimentary a call, which was made
                  under the supposition that he was a cold-blooded hireling. As a man of quaint
                  humor, also, he perceived that game for a little entertainment was here offered
                  him.
               This singular being therefore met his would-be employer in the performance of a
                  dastardly deed full half-way, and put on such an air that Satan himself, with all
                  his reputed shrewdness, would have been taken in were he in Garvin's place. As his
                  visitor opened his business in a manner as cautiously as one would cut a bit of
                  steel from the cornea of a machinist's eye, the clown lit up his face with a gleam
                  of savage intelligence, mingled with fear and apprehension. He fixed upon the
                  broker a look of the most intense suspicion, and cast his glance with subdued
                  fierceness well assumed on one of the heavy clubs near by. In short, he ogled his
                  tempter into the self-complacent idea that his never-failing sagacity had
                  discovered in the returned Californian a criminal, on whose secret consciousness
                  of guilt he could work with his usual subtlety and mastery of the manipulative
                  art. The result was, that in the course of an hour this clown of the strong
                  muscle, with a face so simple, and yet so shrewd, was in possession of the whole
                  plot.
               He also had the name of the intended victim; and this was where he felt as if he
                  had nearly exposed himself. When the broker first uttered it, the old-time Hound and recent soldier gave a start which caused a shade of
                  suspicion to pass over the ever-wary face of the schemer. Wrenchy perceived this,
                  and hastened to remove it. Frowning and gnashing his teeth, he exclaimed in a
                  suppressed but intensely vindictive voice,—
               "Was this Hammond in California in 1849 as a sheriff?"
               "He was," returned the broker with triumphant emphasis.
               "Then may the Devil take him, when I've done with him! You perhaps have heard of
                  the Hounds, a fine set of fellows in California at that time?"
               "I have."
               "Well!" cried the "cannon-ball tosser," in a voice like the rolling of distant
                  thunder, "I was a Hound, and this Hammond was a sheriff!" And he
                  fixed on the broker a diabolical look which brought to the face of the latter a gleam of secret exultation. In another
                  moment the latter was nodding with a look of the most infusive and sympathetic
                  villany.
               "I see! I see!" he said, showing his own white teeth under his false mustache, in
                  a manner which suggested to the athlete a charnel-house lit up by the moonlight.
                  "Those rascally sheriffs! They were the ones that ought to have been hung!"
               Wrenchy continued to chew his self-generated rage, and looked with a furtive scowl
                  toward a heavy horse-pistol which helped adorn the side of the loft.
               At that moment the clock struck seven, and this well-assumed villain sprang to his
                  feet, and turning slightly away, as if, with the instinct of guilt, to conceal his
                  watch,—a gold one which he had carried as a keepsake for fifteen years,—he
                  exclaimed,—
               "Too many irons in the fire spoils the whole! If I have n't slipped up on this
                  other engagement I'm a lucky dog!" Then suddenly lowering his voice almost to a
                  whisper, he said, "Be here to-morrow at this time, and"—with a knowing and
                  ferocious leer—"we'll start this job to our mutual satisfaction."
               The broker departed, saying to himself with an intelligent nod,—
               "That watch had the snuff of blood about it. This is verily a most unconscionable
                  villain!"
            
            
               CHAPTER XLI.
               ABOUT the time the foregoing visit was made by the broker to the fantastic
                  apartment of the athlete, the object of his conspiracy was closeted with Jonas
                  Cringar.
               The pen would fail to convey an idea of the emotions experienced by the desolate
                  merchant when he received information from Billings, the book-keeper, that the
                  Veteran was not dead as reported, but was actually at that moment moving with the
                  old indomitable will in the working of his plans to confound the now desperate
                  Garvin. It seemed to his reacting spirit as if the very hand of Heaven had reached
                  down to direct the battle against his Satanic tempter.
               The interview in question was of a very different character from the one we have
                  formerly described, as the reader will readily imagine. Jonas Cringar greeted the
                  Veteran, not with the stare of consternation which was then his welcome, but his
                  haggard face bore a look of joy unutterable. And this joy was not for himself
                  alone, but for those whom he had so deeply wronged; for since his heart had been
                  opened to the Veteran on that first visit he had continually prayed to God that
                  the promise regarding the family of Allen Paige, which the presence of his visitor
                  then awakened in his soul, might in some providential manner be fulfilled.
               The Veteran gave an account of the attempted assassination, and the manner in
                  which he had secluded himself during his recovery; and then after speaking of the
                  Paige family (whose rejoicing on once more seeing their friend alive was one of those scenes which brightened a
                  life that had seen many shadows), and the ominous disappearance of Prescott
                  Marland, he came to the subject of the forgery. He told Cringar of the visit to
                  the studio of William Garvin for the purpose we have previously mentioned.
               "It is very sad!" uttered the merchant, while the look of wearing pain on his
                  features increased in such a manner as to indicate the direction of his thoughts.
                  "How much does one reckless act cost! A son against a father! General, if this
                  unhappy young man accomplishes the object you have assigned him he secures his own
                  father's downfall!"
               "It is not pleasant to think of," said the Veteran with deep feeling. "More
                  especially has it become painful since his interview with me last evening. He came
                  to me and wept as he told me of the trial which his heart had experienced, since
                  he consented to undertake the recovery of that forgery. I could see that it was in
                  danger of driving him mad, and I am informed that madness runs somewhat in that
                  blood."
               "My God!" ejaculated the merchant under his breath as he recalled the broker's
                  appearance that night when Simple Sal's laugh burst upon them, "I think it
                  does!"
               "He told me," continued the Veteran, "that he had wrought himself up to an attempt
                  night before last, but the Laocoön so distracted his mind that he was utterly
                  unfitted for the work."
               "The Laocoön!" exclaimed Cringar in astonishment.
               "Yes. He said that with his mind strung to the working-point, but still in despair
                  at the very thought that he must do it, he was passing down Broadway, and thinking
                  to find a little relief from a distraction which was little short of craziness, he
                  entered an art store to view the works there on exhibition. Nothing could fix his
                  attention. All seemed in a whirl. Presently he came to a small copy of the Laocoön
                  in alabaster. This commanded more of his attention, for the agony which the
                  ancient sculptor has depicted with such power was to him a reflex of his own
                  internal state. He said it held him as by fascination, and he seemed to exult in
                  measuring his own torments with theirs. But erelong the group was changed, to him,
                  into a terrible vision. The two sons became as mist before his eyes, and the
                  father alone riveted his gaze. The awful agony and anguish which is expressed in
                  the face and throughout the entire body held him in a trance of stupefied horror,
                  for he had suddenly seen that struggling priest of Neptune transformed into his
                  own father, and himself he saw in the dread serpent whose fangs, charged to his
                  frenzied mind with venom, were fastened in the palpitating side! He felt himself
                  rooted to the floor, and his soul cried out to him, as if it were another being
                  separate from himself, 'The fangs of the son are prepared for the father!
                     Let him strike and see his father die!' Then he said the statue and the
                  serpent seemed to live, and he witnessed as a reality the dying struggles of the
                  one, while the skin of the other swelled and quivered, and its eyes shot forth
                  flames, as the folds tightened about its victim, and its jaws, with their deadly
                  fangs, closed deeper and deeper into the purpling flesh. Then everything swam, and
                  he knew no more till he found himself lying on a couch with a group of persons
                  around him, from whom he learned that he had fainted."
               "This is indeed terrible!" exclaimed the merchant, through whom there shot a pang
                  of remorse wellnigh as overwhelming as the anguish described by the wretched young
                  artist.
               "So terrible," said the Veteran, "that I could not do otherwise than tell him that he should be released
                  from the unnatural office,—for the present, at least,—and I would, if possible,
                  study up some other means of accomplishing the object."
               "And this made him happy!"
               "I cannot say so much as that," returned the Veteran, thoughtfully. "He seemed
                  distressed by an internal conflict. He knows that those whom he deeply esteems are
                  in their turn suffering from the fangs of their unnatural relative, and will
                  continue to suffer till the power which he obtained by treachery shall have been
                  taken from him."
               The merchant now became absorbed in the most gloomy thoughts, and the Veteran took
                  his leave, after a few kindly words, which the former responded to without seeming
                  to understand.
               That evening the Veteran sat in his room, meditating on the interview with William
                  Garvin which he had described to the merchant, and turning over in his mind one
                  expedient after another by which he might attain his end without the aid of this
                  miserable son of the guilty broker.
               While in the midst of these meditations a rap sounded on his door. He opened it
                  and Wrenchy stood before him!
               They recognized each other at once, and their greeting was a hearty one.
                  Especially was this the case with the gymnast, who ever remembered the Veteran
                  with gratitude for saving his life.
               After a little introductory talk about the old times, Wrenchy entered at once on
                  the business for which he had called, with an account of the extraordinary visit
                  made him that evening by the man with the black beard and green spectacles. His
                  description was close, and the ready mind of the Veteran found no difficulty in
                  identifying this strange and sinister visitor.
               "When he came to your name I was pretty nigh spoiling the whole thing," said the
                  clown. "But I caught my balance, and gave him such a taste of the diabolical that
                  he saw you pinned right there before his black devil's eyes!"
               "You are to meet him again to-morrow?"
               "Yes."
               The Veteran's brows were for a moment contracted in thought, and then a smile that
                  was scarcely perceptible stole over his face.
               "Wrenchy," said he, "do you think you could handle your fingers with your former
                  skill?"
               By one of those apparent anomalies of nature this "strong man," who tossed
                  cannon-balls so easily that he called them his "mice," was wonderfully expert in
                  the manipulation of minute objects.
               "Quien sabe?" he laughed, mixing his dialect as
                  he and the Veteran were wont to do in California,—"Who know?" Then he added, "If
                  you will stand up a moment, I will show you."
               The Veteran stood up.
               "Now," said the ex-Hound, "the day was when I could engage a man's
                  attention and then show him this."
               The Veteran looked casually down at the other's extended palm, and to his
                  astonishment he saw his watch therein.
               "I'll put it back," said Wrenchy; and he proceeded to attach it to the chain and
                  replace it in the fob. "Hyer!" he exclaimed, and making a pretence of
                  stooping for it, he presented the Veteran with his memorandum-book.
               "A truce!" cried the latter, laughing. "If my eyes ever trouble me I'll get you to
                  take them out! But for the time being I'll keep them to look upon a document
                     which I believe, with your skill,
                  you can obtain as readily as you just now obtained my memorandum-book." And
                  thereupon he proceeded to enlighten the athlete as to the object of the question
                  which caused his remarkable display of the sleight-of-hand talent. This object was
                  to engage him in a plan for the recovery of the forgery and the release of William
                  Garvin.
               The gymnast gave emphatic approval. It was a work that pleased him. His honest
                  course of life for several years past had afforded him no opportunity for the
                  actual use of his accomplishments in this direction, though he had from habit and
                  taste kept up his skill, occasionally delighting a circle of friends by tricks of
                  magic, in which he excelled, and which to see this Hercules perform was like
                  witnessing the exquisitely finished boxing of the grizzly bear.
               "For once we can give the 'cly-faker' profession a touch of honesty," he said with
                  a broad grin.
               The Veteran experienced a deep feeling of relief when he thought of the load that
                  would be taken from the suffering heart of William Garvin, if his object could
                  thus be accomplished through the very instrumentality which the broker would make
                  use of for his own heinous ends, thus doing his work through the laws of
                  retribution.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLII.
               ON the following day the disguised broker again appeared at the apartment of the
                  gymnast, according to appointment. He was received by that odd genius in the
                  fantastic suit of a clown. The latter did not take up much time in preliminaries
                  on this occasion, but at once proceeded to call the attention of his would-be
                  employer to the lasso which hung festooned upon the wall.
               The eyes of the latter glistened under his green spectacles. This thong of
                  raw-hide in the hands of the "cannonball tosser" and around the neck of the man
                  who stood so stubbornly in his way would be absolutely certain to give that man
                  his quietus without noise or confusion. His power would avail him nothing with
                  this about his throat.
               Wrenchy watched him with an expression of grim humor, which the broker mistook for
                  suppressed exultation at the thought of this opportunity for vengeance.
               "Are you dead sure of your mark?" asked the spectacled Garvin, while his mouth
                  seemed to water as his teeth slightly appeared through his false mustache.
               The clown, who at one time was known in California as a vaquero (herdsman), silently took the lasso from the wall.
               "Esta paso,"*
                   he said; and with a smile which the broker still interpreted as the smile
                  of anticipated triumph over his old enemy, he put the coil on his left arm and
                  proceeded to unwind it to a sufficient length for present use. Then with a quick
                  movement the noose flew in the air and a large empty box, that was standing
                  upright in one corner of the loft, was drawn toward him.
               
                  
                  *This way.
               
               "Bravo!" cried the bearded spectator. "Are you as sure of a man?"
               "Hyer! vm corrajo vejez estafado!"†
                   returned the clown; and having released the box, the lasso was the next
                  instant flying through the room toward the broker's head, and before he could so
                  much as move his tongue he found himself bound to his chair a helpless
                  prisoner.
               
                  
                  †"Here! you cussed old sharper!"
               
               "Ha, ha! Hyer!" laughed the acrobatic clown turning a double somersault, while the simple expression on
                  his countenance, of which we have before spoken, assumed a look of the most
                  innocent glee. "How is that for man, beast, or devil? I care not for the
                  word!"
               The broker neither enjoyed the fun of being lassoed, nor did he relish the
                  sportive language which the eccentric gymnast seemed to apply to him in English,
                  taking aside the Mexican dialect, which was Greek to him. He tried to put a good
                  face on the matter, however.
               "A very good illustration," he said with a forced laugh, while he bit his lips
                  with vexation; "a very convincing illustration indeed!" At the same time he winced
                  under the tightening lasso.
               With another laugh of what seemed simple and mischievous glee, Wrenchy cried, "Now
                  for it!" and with a sudden pull down came broker and chair with a crash.
                  "Heigh-ho! master!" he exclaimed, rushing to the aid of his sprawling victim;
                  "this old clown has carried the joke too far! He forgot himself, and mistook you
                  for a 'greaser'!" and grasping the prostrate Garvin he tumbled him about in rude
                  apparent efforts to right him, until the discomforted plotter cursed the clumsy
                  fellow from the bottom of his soul. Then seizing the hat which rolled off on the
                  floor when its owner fell, Wrenchy put it on the broker's head and, with a stroke
                  he had learned years before on the Bowery, he knocked it over his eyes, sending
                  the green spectacles down over the end of his nose.
               "Ha, ha, ha!" once more laughed the irreverant acrobat. "You must be the Evil One
                  himself to put this clumsiness into old Wrenchy! His skilful hands are turned to
                  the paws of a lout!"
               Finally he succeeded in raising his dupe, who ventured only to mutter his curses
                  between his teeth, while he readjusted his spectacles and clothing.
               "You perceive, master," said the clown with a grin, that this bit of raw-hide is
                  sure. I will explain its peculiarities. You will see that it is plaited, and
                  rendered elastic by greasing, which makes it as soft and pliable as silk. 'T is a
                  very remarkable piece of ingenuity, sir, if you will please examine it."
               "I've tested it very well, my good fellow, very well indeed," replied the broker
                  with a painfully responsive grin, still inwardly boiling with rage at the
                  treatment he had endured. "I haven't time for a particular examination. You can
                  let your old California friend attend to that, and assist him by starting his eyes
                  out a little."
               The gymnast could scarcely refrain from compelling this murderous broker's own
                  eyes to start out by a compression of his windpipe in his powerful fingers, as he
                  uttered this fiendish remark. But he carried out the part he had assigned himself,
                  and his designing visitor at length departed, rubbing his ugly hands with
                  self-congratulation, though mingled with this self-congratulation was an inward
                  trembling, arising from a consciousness of guilt which one attempt at
                  assassination had not been quite able to harden him to.
               
               On the night of the second interview between the broker and his fancied hireling,
                  which we have just transcribed, William Garvin sat in his room, hour after hour, a
                  victim of the most conflicting and disturbing thoughts. It was, in fact, a state
                  of mind but little short of frenzy.
               The reader has already been informed, in the account given by the Veteran to Jonas
                  Cringar, of the terrible experience through which the distracted young artist had
                  passed since his visit to his studio. After the interview referred to by the
                  former, which resulted in his releasing
                  the broker's son for the time being, the sufferings of this miserable youth rather
                  increased than diminished. He felt himself compelled to act upon his own
                  responsibility; and the very claims of justice which had compelled the Veteran to
                  assign him a part so repugnant to his feelings now appealed with direct force to
                  his heart.
               He saw the family to which for so many years he had seemed but little less than a
                  son suffering from wrongs perpetrated by his own father. He saw her by whom his
                  life had been so absorbed living in penury and want. He saw them all, in his
                  mind's eye, in the attitude of pleading, and he heard them in imagination praying
                  him to perform that act which the man, whose word he dreamed not of doubting, had
                  told him would secure the restoration of their property, and relief from their
                  present state of destitution.
               So his mind surged from side to side till it was nearly prostrated by its
                  tumultuous unrest. If he performed the act, his father would be given by his hands
                  into the power of his foes, and probably over to destruction. If he did not do it,
                  the family in which was the object of his wild idolatry might remain in misery
                  forever. With the insight we have given the reader into the mental character and
                  morbid condition of this young man, he can readily comprehend the state in which
                  we now find him, after two days and nights of this internal conflict.
               In the afternoon his mind had surged toward the execution of the deed, the
                  ever-present vision of Emma and her family, in which the majestic but to him now
                  sorrowful figure of the Veteran appeared, proving a stronger influence than the
                  picture of a guilty father's retribution; and not far from the very hour in which
                  that father was engaged in hiring a supposed assassin to do murder, this
                  struggling son had finally resolved to secure the forgery.
               His plan was to abstract the forged paper from the broker's pocket-book while he
                  was asleep. To insure that sleep,—for he paled and trembled at the thought of the
                  slumberer awaking while he was engaged in the contemplated act,—he determined to
                  administer a sleeping-potion by means of the tea which his father was sure to
                  drink in the evening. Having often been obliged to take somnific drugs to secure
                  sleep himself, he had carried out this part of his design with but little
                  difficulty.
               But now as he sat in his room after the father had retired, he was again compelled
                  to undergo an internal conflict; for the strain on his overwrought mind, from the
                  effort already made toward the accomplishment of his object, had been followed by
                  a reaction; and for a while he was again threatened with prostration and utter
                  inability to carry out what he had now begun. Again his mind surged to and fro,
                  and in his mental anguish he was ready to cry out,—
               "Great Power of Heaven! take me hence!"
               It was considerably after midnight when once more that desperate resolve took
                  possession of his spirit, and with a wild start he hastened to his door, opened it
                  convulsively, and stole swiftly toward his father's chamber, carrying in his left
                  hand a small metal lamp.
               He reached forth his right hand to turn the knob, when to his dismay quick, heavy
                  footsteps were heard within, and the door opened.
               Confronting him was the livid, furious face of the broker.
               Seizing his son by the throat he bent this face down to his, and exclaimed in a
                  hissing voice,—
               "Vile thief and burglar! what have you stolen from my pocket-book?"
               "Nothing! before God, nothing!" shrieked the son, overcome with mortal terror.
               
               "Nothing! you dauber of canvas! You lie!" cried the foaming broker, shaking the
                  young artist till the lamp fell extinguished from his hand, and it seemed as
                  though with this rough usage and his own terror he must drop lifeless to the
                  floor.
               "O no, no!" again shrieked the gasping youth. "I swear! I swear! O father! I
                  swear!"
               "As that damnable Cringar swore, you chattering catbird!" And at thoughts of
                  Cringar and the Veteran Daniel Garvin shook his son still more violently. "Swear,
                  you young imp! I'll teach you to utter oaths that'll burst your windpipe!"
                  William's throat now began to gurgle. "The paper!" yelled the broker like a
                  madman. "If you don't give it up right here on this spot, and instantly, I'll kill
                  you!"
               At that moment the commotion of alarmed servants above served to bring the furious
                  man to a consciousness of what he was doing. Relaxing his hold from his son's
                  throat, he grasped him by the collar and, dragging him into the chamber, he
                  slammed to the door.
               The young artist now fell on his knees and declared in the most piteous and
                  heart-rending tones that he had not taken the paper.
               "Why were you at my door at this time of night?" demanded the father in a voice
                  that was still filled with rage.
               "You—you looked sick and wretched at supper, and I could not go to bed for
                  thinking of you, and I came to see if you slept!" uttered the trembling youth with
                  a readiness which fright often imparts.
               William Garvin was not given to uttering lies, and this one caused a blush of
                  shame to tinge the deadly pallor of his cheeks.
               For an instant the broker continued to fix his blazing eye on his son, and then
                  suddenly his features, which had begun slightly to relax, once more grew black,
                  contorted by an expression in which impotent fury and startled fear were darkly
                  mingled. Opening the door he flung the youth from the room, and then again closing
                  it with a loud slam he turned the key, and commenced pacing the floor with strides
                  that even surpassed those with which he started for Jonas Cringar, after the
                  information given him by Baling at the Fulton Ferry.
               "The cannon-ball clown!" he hissed between his grinding teeth. "Duped! Daniel
                  Garvin duped! Duped by a clown! Lassoed like a mule, and robbed like a fool!—A
                  rhyme, Daniel Garvin! You've made a rhyme! Go to work and write poetry for
                  monuments, and first see to it that your own epitaph is written!"
               The last of this speech was uttered with a bitter laugh, and one is startled by
                  its strangeness.
               The furious schemer's large pocket-book lying open on the stand by the bed
                  suggests the cause of this remarkable demonstration.
               The sleeping-potion which William had prepared for his father might have proved 
                     sufficienly
                     sufficiently
                   strong for himself, but its effect on an organization so powerful as the
                  broker's, more than usually excited as it was by his recent interview with the
                  athlete, was of short duration.
               Not long before the young artist grasped his lamp in the desperate resolution to
                  finish the work he had begun, Daniel Garvin, who had thrown himself undressed on
                  his bed, awoke with a violent headache, and troublesome thoughts began to sweep
                  through his mind, as was now usual with him at the dead of night.
               He thought of the Veteran, and his face lit up with exultation ultation as he ruminated on the sure vengeance
                  which would now be visited on his enemy through the athlete and his lasso. Then he
                  passed to the merchant, and his heart gloated over the retribution he intended for
                  this man, whom he now hated with all the intensity of his brooding nature for the
                  traitorous part he felt certain he had acted against him.
               While in the midst of his revengeful pictures he rose and sat on the side of his
                  bed. His lamp still burned, and he drew forth his pocket-book—now a frequent habit
                  with him—to feast his eyes on the evidence by which at any moment he could tumble
                  the merchant into the abyss of irretrievable ruin.
               "Strange!" he muttered, as he opened the wallet, to find the forgery missing from
                  the place in which he usually carried it. "It is not easy for Daniel Garvin to
                  confess it, even to Daniel Garvin, but truly his head is not so clear of late. I
                  like not this confusion," he added, tapping his forehead. "The time was when
                  Daniel Garvin could put his papers away twenty years running, if necessary, and
                  never in the wrong place; but there seems to be a little trouble here."
               With this be commenced nervously searching for the missing forgery among his other
                  papers. But it was nowhere to be found!
               "I've been plundered!" he exclaimed in a suppressed voice of rage and
                  consternation, and throwing the pocket-book upon the stand he leaped to his
                  feet.
               At that instant his ears caught the sound of creeping feet outside; in another
                  moment he was at the door, and then ensued the scene we have described.
               Throughout the remainder of that night sleep visited neither the lids of the
                  father nor son.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLIII.
               ONCE more to the old house on Vandam Street.
               We have spoken of the joy with which the sorrowing family of Allen Paige had
                  greeted that noble friend, whom they supposed had been murdered. On the evening
                  following the night of Prescott Marland's escape from the mad-house they sat
                  talking of this friend with a gratitude and an affection which only such devotion
                  as he, a comparative stranger, had displayed in their behalf could command.
               "Do you observe, mother," said Emma with much feeling, "how pale he is? I fear his
                  anxiety for us has led him to forget himself in so soon recommencing his arduous
                  labors for us."
               "I have observed it," responded the mother, sadly. "And it grieves me. I spoke to
                  him yesterday, and admonished him to think more of his own welfare, but he
                  answered me in such a manner that I could say nothing more. One feels in his
                  presence as if he knew what was best, and so must needs leave him to act according
                  to a judgment which seems beyond questioning. He appears very anxious about
                  Prescott, whom he evidently loves as we all do."
               A blush tinged Emma's cheek; and then tears filled her eyes. Mrs. Paige observed
                  this emotion, and with a mother's sympathy was about to change the subject of
                  conversation, when a well-known knock at the door announced a visit from the one
                  of whom they had been speaking.
               With the words we have heard uttered by Mrs. Paige and her daughter regarding the
                  appearance of this soldier so
                  fraternally devoted to the interests of a comrade's family, one is struck by the
                  paleness of his massive face. It is evident that anxiety for others has caused
                  him, after the confinement from his wound, to venture prematurely on those labors
                  which demand so great an exertion of the mind and will.
               But the observer almost immediately forgets this appearance of illness in an
                  expression of suppressed joy, which beams from his deep gray eye, and pervades his
                  strong, benignant features. He himself sees that this expression has attracted the
                  attention of those who now greet him, and he hastens to say,—
               "My friends, I have to inform you that one great source of power held heretofore
                  by Daniel Garvin has been taken from him; and I am now able to tell you that the
                  prospect of the restitution of your rights is very favorable."
               This did not seem to explain that emotion which still lit up his countenance.
               His gaze now fell on Emma's face, and he observed the tears still standing in her
                  saddened eyes. A look of inexpressible tenderness overspread his features.
               "Perhaps we shall have a visitor soon," he said in a gentle voice.
               Through Emma's tears there instantly appeared a light which brought to the
                  countenance of the Veteran a smile so kind and yet so grave, that, while a blush
                  again heightened the color of the fair girl's cheek, she was strangely moved, as
                  if the presence of her father accompanied this apparently Heaven-appointed
                  friend.
               At that moment another knock was heard at the door.
               Emma partly started from her chair to answer it, but as Albert hastened to do this
                  she gave a quick glance at the Veteran, and sank back trembling in her seat while
                  the tell-tale crimson mounted to her cheeks.
               Albert opened the door, and Prescott Marland crossed the threshold, and stood
                  before them, that handsome, generous face, though pale and thin by his
                  incarceration, still beamed with the old hope-inspiring smile.
               The greeting which now followed caused the young Lieutenant to declare to himself
                  that for a repetition of it he would willingly endure another imprisonment like
                  that from which he had just escaped.
               That day the Veteran had told him of the success which had attended the mission of
                  the gymnast,—who, it is needless to inform the reader, had abstracted the forgery
                  when he gave the broker such a rude handling, and knocked his hat over his eyes,
                  while he was sprawled on the floor,—and as he took Emma's hand he experienced in
                  his hope a thrill of delight which he did not care entirely to suppress, as he
                  looked into her eyes and thought of the possibility of being permitted erelong to
                  throw off the bonds which for so many months had restrained him, and declare with
                  all the fervor he then felt the deep, strong love which trial had but served to
                  render even tenfold more ardent than it was the day he was surprised gazing on the
                  sunset picture.
               Mingled with Emma's joy was a feeling of pain, as she beheld his features so thin
                  and pale; and the indignation of both herself and the rest of the family may well
                  be imagined, as they listened to the story of the manner in which he had been
                  entrapped and held in worse than solitary confinement. When, however, he came to
                  the description of his escape through the ingenuity of the inventor, and told them
                  of his adventure in Dr. Pennell's private office, their countenances were
                  expressive of lively enjoyment.
               Their sympathies were strongly excited toward the poor mad corporal with whom he
                  had been incarcerated.
               
               "It is the height of cruelty to confine even the most dangerous victim of insanity
                  in such a cell as that!" exclaimed Mrs. Paige.
               "Do not fear but that the cruelty and the rascality, in New York at least, of that
                  sweet villain of a mad-house doctor will come to a speedy termination," said
                  Prescott, with a voice of decision. "My raid on his private office was a very
                  successful one, as both he and Garvin will find out to their cost, besides a few
                  others who have used this mad-house for their infamous purposes!"
               But he had another pleasant surprise in store for them, in the report he had to
                  render of the Deering family.
               Nothing could have more effectually served to call forth a display of the goodness
                  of this family of Allen Paige than the young Lieutenant's recital of what had been
                  told him by Charles Roberts. They forgot the hopes for themselves, which the
                  Veteran and Prescott had inspired, in listening to the story of those unfortunate
                  ones, compared to whose sufferings their own seemed to them as naught. The account
                  of their discovery, after a long and seemingly hopeless search, by a comrade of
                  the Grand Army of the Republic, and of their immediate relief by the Post, called
                  forth such expressions as would have made the heart of the comrade who reads this
                  thrill with pleasure, had he been there to hear them.
               The two members of the G. A. R. who were then in their presence forgot all else
                  for the moment, as they listened to the words of blessing poured out on their
                  Order by those who in their prosperity had undertaken the same office which had
                  devolved on the Grand Army.
               "I have never felt so proud of our organization as I do at this moment!" said the
                  Veteran. "I would that all loyal citizens might hear you!"
               "We are not worthy such attention from all loyal citizens," replied Mrs. Paige.
                  "But there is one I have recently heard of who is."
               "Who is that?" asked Prescott, with interest.
               "A lady in Salem, Massachusetts, who, when suffering so much from disease that she
                  was obliged to lie day after day in one position without being moved, held up her
                  hands and knit stockings for the soldiers who were fighting for her country."
               "And does she still live?" asked the Veteran.
               "She does; and is the same devoted friend of the soldier."
               "Then let the united prayers of the Grand Army of the Republic ascend for her to
                  that God who blesses the good!"
               The Veteran uttered these words in a voice so fraught with the deep emotions which
                  this brief story had awakened, that we opine the angels who heard it bore the
                  benediction to her who has proved so worthy of it.
               That was a happy evening for the family of Allen Paige, happier than any evening
                  they had seen for many months; and as the Veteran and Prescott took their leave,
                  the latter clasped Emma's hand closer than had formerly been his wont, which she
                  returned with a look that attended him in his dreams.
               Yes, that family was happy; for though the resources and pertinacity of their wily
                  persecutor had taught them that the morrow might not realize the hope of to-day,
                  yet that "son and brother" whom they loved so much was not dead, but living.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLIV.
               JONAS CRINGAR sat alone in his private office, after all but Billings had departed
                  from the store. He held in his hand a letter which had just been given him by the
                  book-keeper. It was from the Veteran, informing him that he had had an interview
                  with the President and four of the most influential Directors of the Bald Eagle
                  Silver Mining Company, to whom he had stated all that was necessary for his
                  purpose, and who, though shocked and confounded on learning of the merchant's
                  defalcation, had under the circumstances decided to waive immediate action, and
                  await the development of the movement which the Veteran had initiated. The
                  President, he wrote, freely told him in the course of the interview he had with
                  him before seeing the Directors, that both he and some of his associates on the
                  board had for some time past viewed the broker with suspicion, who, as the reader
                  will recollect, had purchased stock and managed to become an officer of this
                  company that he might, through his influence and manipulative skill, cover
                  Cringar's defalcation till such time as its exposure would not endanger his own
                  criminal operations.
               As the merchant now sat with this letter in his left hand, which hung over the arm
                  of his chair, he gave evidence of a marked change for the better. Though still
                  bearing that worn and haggard look, there was apparent on his countenance an
                  indescribable expression of relief, which told of a realization that the clutch on
                  his throat by his hell-inspired tormentor had been loosened by a friendly
                  hand.
               The Veteran, to whom the gymnast had brought the forgery immediately after the
                  departure from the loft of his guilty dupe, chose, for judicious reasons, to
                  retain the document till he had seen all his plans safely carried out. This the
                  merchant expected; but it gave him very little uneasiness, for he knew he had
                  nothing to fear in that direction if he proved himself as good as his word, in
                  endeavoring with all his power to atone for the wrong he had done the family of
                  his former partner. He knew, also, that in the Veteran he had a friend who looked
                  kindly upon him; who, while he did not fail to condemn his guilty acts, yet
                  realized that with a heart not naturally bad he had through his weaknesses been
                  made the victim of a strong and designing man; and he felt that if there were any
                  hope of rising left, this magnanimous soldier would be disposed to do his utmost
                  to assist him.
               "Satan is always near when you're thinking about him," is a saying which is often
                  confirmed; and in Jonas Cringar's case it now held good; for just as he was
                  absorbed in thoughts of that relentless tormentor, from whose clutch he
                  congratulated himself he was about to escape, Garvin's well-known voice was heard
                  questioning the book-keeper, who was preparing to leave the store for the
                  night.
               Its tone was hoarse and unusually vindictive, and for the instant the merchant
                  shrank cowering in his chair.
               The door opened and the broker's visage was thrust in, distorted with an absolute
                  grin of baffled rage.
               On sight of this diabolical visage Jonas Cringar trembled with his old terror, and
                  the sweat began as in former times to appear on his forehead. But as the broker
                  continued to stand at the threshold, bending upon him his lurid eye, in which
                  unsteadiness was now perceptible, he brought to his aid his native strength, and
                  with the realization tion that the
                  dark-browed man before him had lost that by which he had formerly held such
                  terrible power over him, speedily subdued much of his agitation, and fastened his
                  gaze on the other's countenance with a firm and determined air.
               Garvin could not endure this. Closing the door and striding into the room, he
                  brandished his fist, and cried in a voice that was choked with rage,—
               "Jonas Cringar! do you think you are to escape me?" Then as he compressed his
                  beetling brows still farther over his eyes, he almost whispered as he hissed these
                  three words, leaving a marked interval between each one, and increasing his
                  vindictive emphasis as he uttered them,
                  "Traitor!—defaulter!—FORGER!"
               The merchant quailed under this attack, and as his paling countenance gave
                  evidence of his fear the broker laughed derisively.
               "Let me tell you, Jonas Cringar," he exclaimed with fierce sarcasm, "by breaking
                  faith with Daniel Garvin you have incurred his terrible vengeance, and thrown
                  yourself into the jaws of destruction!"
               Cringar recovered himself sufficiently to look with a steadier eye on this baffled
                  but still threatening plotter. It was impossible, however, for him to suppress an
                  agitation which resulted both from the influence of his unwelcome visitor's
                  presence, and the consciousness of guilt which still haunted him with the fear of
                  retribution.
               "Mr. Garvin," he said conciliatingly, "I do not understand this language. You are
                  very hasty."
               This attempt at conciliation, instead of sinking to the very floor under Daniel
                  Garvin's threatening words, was so significant of the change wrought in their
                  relative positions, that the broker could scarcely contain himself. Approaching
                  proaching nearer the merchant, he assumed such an aspect as caused his former
                  victim to tremble for his life, and instinctively to push back his chair with his
                  foot.
               "Clown!"
               As Daniel Garvin uttered this epithet the word recalled the clown who had made
                  such a dupe of him, and his passion, which seemed to have overleaped all bounds,
                  verged on the ravings of insanity.
               "Clown!" he reiterated. "That is the word for such a traitor and swindler!"
               Jonas Cringar was stung to the quick.
               "Have a care, sir!" he exclaimed.
               If the conciliatory words before used by the merchant had the effect to stir the
                  depths of Garvin's wrath, this admonition of one whom he had so long and
                  exultingly held in the most abject mental slavery now served to destroy any
                  self-control he might have had remaining. Seizing Cringar by the throat, as he had
                  his son when he discovered him at his chamber door, he shook him violently,
                  growling savagely through his clenched teeth,—
               "'Have a care!'—do you tell me to have a care? Say, dog of a forger!
                  do you tell me to have a care? I will teach you who is master! Give me back that
                  paper you hired an accursed monkey to steal from me!"
               "I did not!" uttered Cringar in a stifled voice, as he strove in vain with his
                  shattered strength against the powerful and infuriated broker.
               "Liar!" returned the latter, closing his hand still tighter about the throat of
                  the strangling merchant. "I knew you the night that Simple Sal gave us a bit of
                  her jargon! Damn you! you crept out of the door like a skulking traitor! and I
                  determined then that if you dared to fail me I'd teach you whose God was to be
                  depended upon! and I will, you
                  sanctimonious hound!" This word houna again recalled the California
                  clown, and with a renewed burst of fury he shook Jonas Cringar against the wall,
                  crying, "Hound! fox! wolf! cat! and—"
               The raging broker released his grasp as he observed a sudden expression of joy
                  appear in the eyes of the merchant; and while his teeth still remained apart to
                  let the interrupted epithet pass between them, a heavy hand was laid upon him and
                  he was dragged back with irresistible power.
               "Mr. Garvin," said a deep, stern voice, "you are fond of violent deeds."
               Garvin turned, and found himself confronted by the Veteran. The expression of his
                  face was for an instant hideous. The entire strength of his diabolical nature
                  seemed to concentrate itself in his dark visage. Hatred, spite, fury, desperation,
                  each contributed to the seething caldron within, as foul as the caldron of
                  Hecate's witches. His eyes, whose unsteadiness was noticeable as he appeared to
                  Cringar, rolled under the black and lowering brows, sending out shifting and
                  lightning-like gleams; the cheeks became mottled like a reptile; while the upper
                  lip played with spasmodic jerks, showing his teeth in a manner that imparted
                  unwonted fierceness to all the features.
               The Veteran instinctively stepped back as if a poisonous thing had suddenly sprung
                  into his path. Then bending upon this repulsive visage a look of grave severity,
                  he said in a calm voice of still greater depth,—
               "Daniel Garvin, neither the assassin nor the strangler will now avail."
               For a moment the broker seemed about to spring like a foaming beast upon this calm
                  and intrepid soldier; then suddenly turning he went to a chair, leisurely took his
                  seat, and with a ferocious grin similar to the one with which he had greeted
                  Cringar, but kindled by a still intenser passion, he cast his glittering glance
                  from the Veteran to the merchant.
               "Fools!" he exclaimed in a tone of the bitterest scorn, "do you think you have a
                  child to play with?—This is Jonas Cringar, I believe?" he said with mock gravity,
                  grinning at the merchant, while his eye blazed upon him with a look which startled
                  his former slave into a responsive nod. Then directing his glance to the Veteran
                  he said, "And this is General Hammond, alias
                  Thorbolt, if I mistake not?"
               The response in this case was such a look of the firm gray eye, whose power seemed
                  enhanced by the pallor caused by his own guilty act, that he was for a moment
                  discomfited, and his eye rolled toward the door, and then back to the merchant, at
                  sight of whom he regained his voice.
               "Well, Mr. Jonas Cringar and General Thorbolt Hammond," uttered he with a
                  sarcastic snarl, "you think you have—let's see—you called it the right bower, the
                  left bower, ace, king, and queen in California, I believe, Mr. ex-Coyote?—ha, ha! you perceive I'm good-natured and in excellent spirits!
                  Well—that is a word I repeat—well, thinking you have these cards, you
                  propose to sweep the stakes without so much as asking me to show my hand."
               Then taking pencil and blank-book from his pocket, he wrote down several items in
                  silence, while the Veteran as silently observed him, both puzzled and startled by
                  the strange conduct and appearance of this thwarted schemer.
               "There," said the latter, tearing out the leaf on which he had been writing, and
                  holding it up in view of his auditors;
                  "you will perceive that one or two tricks can be made in an humble way, even with
                  such a bad hand as has been dealt to me. Here," he said, laying the point of his
                  pencil on the item specified, "is a card which calls to mind one Richard Slaycut,
                  and here another that reminds one of Slaycut and Drorblude, and others that you
                  can examine after the game is played. A certain card has been spirited away from
                  my deal, on which, gentlemen, you congratulate yourselves as leaving me with no
                  alternative but to throw up the game. But really, my worthy gamesters, you expose
                  a greenness much to be wondered at.—Jonas Cringar!" he cried with an unexpected
                  and startling fierceness, "so you think because my pocket-book has been rifled
                  that you can go with this sheriff Thorbolt, and perjure yourself with lies about
                  certain documentary statements, and be believed, do you?" Then waiting till he had
                  given vent to a sneering laugh, he said, "The Bald Eagle Silver Mining Company
                  will make excellent judges in this case. Do you suppose," he added with an
                  appearance of his old concentrated power, "that Daniel Garvin is a verdant fool to
                  attempt the game with only one trump card?"
               "Make no calculations in that direction," said the Veteran, gravely, "the majority
                  of the officers of the company to which you refer have been informed of
                  everything."
               "A pleasant deception, sir, for passing amusement," uttered the broker, who could
                  not entirely conceal a look of dismay.
               "They understand the part their unhappy treasurer has enacted, and the part you
                  have performed so skilfully."
               Daniel Garvin first showed his teeth, and then bit his under lip till it bled.
               "I care not!" he exclaimed, rising from his chair. "Bury forgeries, defalcations,
                  and all the rest, beneath the crust of the earth, and I tell you in the name of
                  Daniel Garvin's power, that that which my hand is on cannot be taken from me!"
               "You refer to the property of Allen Paige's estate, I presume?" said the Veteran,
                  his countenance beginning to assume that air which indicated the massing of his
                  mental forces.
               "My property, is what I mean!" returned the broker in a voice now
                  loud and harsh. "My property, and none other!"
               "You mean by this, that the property which belongs to the widow and orphan
                  children of your patriot half-brother you do not presume to keep longer from
                  them?"
               "Patriot!" cried Daniel Garvin with a look of the most intense hatred.
                     "Patriot! A curse to all such patriots, who went down to slay
                  their Southern brethren! As for the dam and cubs of this particular patriot, let
                  the maledictions of the South light on their heads, but no property do you wring
                  out of me for them!"
               The broker now took a stride toward the door.
               "Hold!" cried the Veteran in commanding tones. "Daniel Garvin, I have not done
                  with you yet!"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLV.
               GARVIN stopped in his tracks, as his eye encountered the Veteran's commanding
                  look, which corresponded with his voice.
               "Daniel Garvin," repeated the Veteran, who was determined if possible to bring the
                  plotter to terms at this interview, "know you aught of such a man as Dr.
                  Pennell?"
               The broker retreated before both the look and the question, while a startled
                  expression he could not control took possession of his features.
               The Veteran again spoke:—
               "You have heard of a soldier named Prescott Marland?"
               The conspirator stared at his questioner an instant, and then making a powerful
                  effort, controlled to a degree his agitated features and sat down.
               "A lieutenant, whom Mr. Paige met at the hospital?" he said in his craftiest
                  voice.
               "The same."
               "You perceive by my answer that I have heard of him,—that is all."
               "Your name has travelled an equal distance, for he also has heard of you."
               "Indeed!"
               "If I mistake not he had the pleasure of meeting you once in this office."
               "You alarm me! My memory, which has always served me well, has seriously failed if
                  this be so."
               "It matters not. We will suppose an incident.
               "I will not take your time."
               "I will be brief. A young soldier is in a counting-room. A door to the inner
                  office is opened, and he sees before him two desperate criminals who escaped
                  merited punishment by breaking jail. These men, under aliases, are
                  serving another criminal, who, being present, eyes this young soldier with a look
                  that means mischief. The next day the young man receives a note, begging him to
                  attend to a case of charity, and is decoyed into a mad-house. After days and
                  nights of treatment that plainly meant murder, he escapes with a
                  fellow-sufferer."
               "Bah! what care I for this old woman's story?"
               "A moment. On their way out they stop at the Doctor's private office; the
                  companion opens the door, and all valuable papers are secured."
               The broker started, but instantly controlled himself. "Your story, sir, is too
                  long and broad," he said, and was again about to rise.
               "I will close," returned the Veteran, waving him, with a powerful look, back to
                  his seat. "Among these papers are documents which furnish irrefutable evidence
                  against the party through whose machinations this young soldier was
                  incarcerated."
               Daniel Garvin's face suddenly grew black, and losing his self-control he muttered
                  as he ground his teeth,—
               "Has the doctor, too, betrayed me? He pledged himself to burn everything! Why have
                  I not heard of this?"
               At the same instant the door opened with a quick movement, and Prescott Marland
                  entered.
               "Ah, General!" he exclaimed, "I have been looking for you!" Then with a
                  side-glance of scorn at Garvin, he whispered, "Those rascals have fled the
                  city!"
               
               "Slaycut and Drorblude?" said the Veteran aloud, who desired that Daniel Garvin
                  should understand.
               "Yes," returned Prescott, who, perceiving the intention of his friend, turned with
                  a mock bow toward the broker, "Slaycut, alias
                  Fitch, and Drorblude, alias Ratter, have
                  disappeared as speedily as they did from the mines; and one Augoring,
                  oil-merchant, has kept them company."
               Garvin, who had started almost from his chair on seeing the young Lieutenant, now
                  returned his sarcastic bow with a look which caused the object of it to
                  exclaim,—
               "By Jove! you ought to have been jailer at Andersonville!"
               The Veteran gave Prescott an admonitory glance; but the latter did not see it, for
                  his eyes were fastened in wonderment on the broker.
               This baffled and penned-up master of plots and men, as he had deemed himself, now
                  bore an aspect absolutely frightful. As we have seen, both Cringar and the Veteran
                  had wrought him up to a fury which threatened to pass the bounds of sanity; but
                  now with his full situation before him,—his plots and crimes gathering like
                  messengers of vengeance about his own head,—the words and manner of the young
                  Lieutenant seemed to have inflicted the final blow. The combined expression of a
                  wild beast and a venomous reptile at bay could alone give an idea of the looks of
                  this infuriated man.
               Catching the 
                     Vetetan's
                     Veteran's
                   arm, the young Lieutenant pointed at the hideous head as if it were a
                  mask without sight or hearing, and cried,—
               "By Heavens! General, he's mad!"
               Billings, the book-keeper, who, observing Garvin's appearance as he came in, had
                  remained to be ready for any emergency, now appeared at the door.
               The instant the broker's eye lit on this young man he sprang to his feet, and
                  pointing at him with a quivering finger he drew a poniard from his breast, and
                  leaping toward the merchant with his finger still extended toward the book-keeper,
                  he cried in a voice that vied with the unearthly noise of a flying shell,—
               "The tool of your perfidious treachery is there! Here the instrument of my
                  vengeance!"
               Jonas Cringar raised his hands with a half-articulated cry for mercy. The broker
                  responded with a horrible laugh, and clove the air with his dagger.
               In the next instant he was hurled with tremendous force to the other end of the
                  office, and the Veteran, now fully aroused, turned upon him with a face the
                  passionate power of which passes all description.
               "Assassin!" he exclaimed in tones that rolled like the heavy artillery with which
                  he had so often mingled his voice,—"assassin! and hirer of assassins! are you not
                  satisfied with your attempts at human life? Do not beldams, ruffians, mad-house
                  doctors, and desperados serve to satiate your wolfish appetite?"
               "Beldams!" cried the would-be assassin, half-stunned by the treatment
                  he had received from the Veteran. "And has that toothless hag also blown the deed
                  I paid her for?"
               "Your deeds are all made known," returned the Veteran, now advancing toward the
                  broker, who still held the poniard in his hand.
               Garvin perceived the object of this man whose strength he had just felt, and
                  drawing slightly back he raised his weapon.
               The Veteran's eyes now began to blaze with internal fires such as Prescott had
                  often seen preparatory to battle. But his demeanor was calm, and his gaze as
                  steady as the sun.
               
               "Give me the dagger!" he said, in a low, commanding voice.
               The broker glared upon him with rolling eye, and then drawing back his upper lip
                  he revealed in all their threatening array his white, glistening teeth.
               The Veteran understood this look. Bending his gaze with still greater force of
                  will upon those unsteady glaring eyes, he advanced with a firm step, while his
                  pale face assumed an air which was absolutely solemn in the grandeur of its
                  concentrated strength.
               He came within the length of his own arm of Garvin's uplifted wrist. The latter
                  continued to return his gaze with his own fierce glare, but he did not move his
                  threatening hand.
               Prescott and the book-keeper remained silent witnesses of this scene, while the
                  merchant sat half stupefied by his impending death, and unexpected escape.
                  Prescott's first impulse had been to spring to the unarmed Thorbolt's assistance,
                  for the broker with his thick heavy frame was not to be despised, even without his
                  weapon. But there was that in the air of the Veteran as his towering form
                  confronted the muscular, but now somewhat shrinking figure before him, which
                  forbade interference, and the young soldier held back.
               One more step was taken. The broker made a movement of his arm; but it was too
                  late. The Veteran's iron grip was on his wrist. He prepared for a furious
                  struggle; but his antagonist tightened his grasp, and with a yell of rage rather
                  than of pain the dagger dropped from his rigid fingers.
               "Attempt no more murders!" said the Veteran, relaxing his hold. "The arm of an
                  Almighty God is against you, and your own crimes have confounded you!"
               The broker burst into a laugh, which chilled the blood of those who listened.
               "'An Almighty God!'" he sneered, "that was what Cringar talked about one night.
                  You remember it, don't you, my boy?" he cried, looking at the shrinking merchant
                  across the office,—"the night Simple Sal gave us the anthem! She was a pretty
                  young wench, was Sal, with her flattened face framed by the window-sash! eh,
                  Cringar! You looked scared that night, poor dotard!—You see," he continued,
                  addressing the Veteran, with a profound bow, "this same Simple Sal sang words
                  which to a weak, superstitious mind were not agreeable. I'm no singer, but my old
                  friend there, who has fought the bold battle of life, and robbed his beloved
                  partner's family of everything they possessed, he has a very fine voice, full and
                  sonorous; and by the will of Daniel Garvin! I swear he could ring the chorus right
                  well with the sweet songstress of that memorable night. Let's see, Cringar," and
                  he again looked at the merchant; "it ran somewhat in this way, if I recollect
                  aright,— 
                     
                        'My gentle sirs, be very kind!
                        Your candle's out,
                        My gentle sirs!
                        You'll be found out,
                        My gentle sirs!
                        But gentle me you cannot find!'
                     
                   Ha, ha! she withdrew with great alacrity, and left my friend gaping as if
                  he'd spied the Devil! You see there was something in that song, General Thorbolt,
                  that shocked his guilty soul— 
                     
                        'You'll be found out,
                        My gentle sirs!'
                     
                   I remember it all very well, for I've hummed it a good many times since. It struck me, sir, it struck me
                  very ridiculously,—the whole thing,—Cringar and all!" Then with another burst of
                  laughter he exclaimed, "An Almighty God! The arm of an Almighty God is against
                  me!" And now straightening himself, and smiting his chest, he cried: "Daniel
                  Garvin is sufficient unto himself! If there is an Almighty God, let him take care
                  of the imbeciles! Drop the curtain and pick up the swords!—the play is over! ha,
                  ha, ha! Good evening, gentlemen, a right pleasant good evening"; and being near
                  the open door he stepped off with a quick movement, similar to the action of a man
                  intoxicated, who with unsteady head starts briskly away in a straight line to
                  convince himself and others that he is sober.
               The Veteran gazed after him with a perplexed countenance, while Prescott and
                  Billings exchanged meaning glances. The latter tapped his forehead with his
                  finger, and Jonas Cringar looked toward the door, muttering to himself,—
               "His soul was haunted by that song as well as mine."
               Suddenly, as the wind whistled through the store, the Veteran started forward.
               "This is wrong!" he exclaimed. "If I mistake not, that man has lost his wits, and
                  may be even now doing violence as a madman!" and hastening to the outer door,
                  which Garvin had left open, he looked in every direction. But the retreating
                  broker had disappeared.
               The sky was overcast with heavy clouds, and the wind that had been rising for the
                  past half-hour now blew violently through the street, slamming unfastened blinds
                  and shutters to and fro with a loud noise, the creaking signs joining in the
                  dismal concert.
               Presently the sound of rain was heard swiftly advancing cing, and in another
                  moment it swept by the store in a flooding torrent.
               
               Toward midnight two sailors were leaning over the taffrail of a brig that lay at
                  anchor in East River.
               "If this continues," said one of these men, "Hell Gate will have to wait for the
                  Betsey Jane."
               "I am afraid it will," returned the other, impatiently, as he watched the scudding
                  white-caps fly before the wind that whistled loudly in the rigging.
               The rain, which had held up for a space, now poured down in sheets, and began to
                  run in streams through the scuppers.
               "By the shades of old Nep!" cried the second speaker, "I think I'll turn in out of
                  this!" and he moved toward the gangway.
               "Hist!" cried the other in a loud whisper, pointing to the pier near which they
                  were anchored. "Yonder comes a man who is either drunk or crazy! His head is bare,
                  and, by my own bald pate! as near as I can make out through the rain and darkness
                  with this dim light, his hair is but a poor covering."
               His companion turned; but not having the sharp sight of the other, he could only
                  discern an outline of a man striding from side to side at the end of the pier.
               As he was about to speak a shrill, harsh, mocking voice pierced the storm, and the
                  sailors both listened intently.
               "Blow your rain!" cried the apparition on the wharf, brandishing his arms wildly
                  in the air. "Whistle, ye noisy winds! You're dark enough to whistle well! Ha, ha!
                  Ye are negroes all, and whistle the hallelujah of your freedom, eh!" A shrieking
                  gust now tore through the storm. "Ay, join in with your sweet voices, you black
                     and devilish imps! join in, I say!
                  That ape that set you free, let him direct you! Hear ye not my command? Hear and
                  tremble when I proclaim myself! My name is Daniel Garvin! Ha, ha! shriek with
                  terror, for if ye cross him in one single note of your dinning concert he'll be
                  quick with vengeance!"
               "He 's mad!" exclaimed the sailor who first discovered him.
               "As a March hare!"
               "Hush! He 's at it again!"
               "Vengeance! vengeance!" screamed the voice. "Pour down your vengeance on this bald
                  head! Let it receive thy vengeance without stint, thou frowning Heaven! 'T is a
                  traitorous crown! a perfidious crown!" And he beat his bared head with fury.
                  "Burst it, ye elements! Crack the skull with your hammer, old Scandinavian
                  Thor!"
               The madman suddenly dropped his hands, and coming to the edge of the pier, looked
                  straight toward the spellbound mariners, and with a low bow he broke into a fit of
                  wild, ironical laughter.
               "Your servant!" he cried. "General Thorbolt, your servant,—your most humble
                  servant!—What! you give return with an air so patronizing that methinks you take
                  me for a portrait-painter! Ah, you hypocrite! I understand it! Folded in that tail
                  which I see coiled beneath your skirts is the writ! The writ, do you hear!—Cease
                  your nocturnal din!" he yelled, with a commanding gesture toward the heavens.
                  "Cease! for Daniel Garvin would be heard!—The writ, I say! You have the writ! but
                  where's your man? Uncoil your harpoon tail and hang by it to the yard-arm! Grin
                  like the clown who entertained me with his gambols! Laugh! laugh! I'll count you
                  as you laugh! Jonas Cringar, lead the file, and as you pass by split your sides
                  with merriment! And you, you foul denizen 'twixt heaven and hell!—you smiling
                  she-wolf, end off the train, and crack your laughter through your broken fangs!
                  Come haste your steps, for I'm choleric, and feel my temper rising!"
               "Let us go to him," said the sailor who had spoken first before, "or he will drown
                  himself."
               "Ay, ay! but we must do it carefully. A man like that is dangerous."
               Without more ado, they proceeded as quietly as possible to lower the stern boat,
                  which was out of sight of the madman, who continued to rave.
               "Heigh-ho! heigh-ho!" he now cried with an exultant laugh. "How well the heavens
                  tune their strains to the music here!" and he beat his breast. "'T is a secret!
                  Blow it not, O sympathizing Boreas, and I'll tell you what it is! I've built an
                  organ here, and the imps of hell pump in the wind, while the facile fingers of
                  their master play the keys!—the pedals? ha, ha, ha! With his cloven foot he has a
                  knack that beats them all!" Then smiting his breast with blows that resounded
                  through the storm, he howled: "Pump in the wind, you lazy imps! The organ groans!
                  Satan, you defy the very laws of sound! The temple shakes to its foundation with
                  your pealing tones! Now let the choir sing the glory of Daniel Garvin, victorious!
                  Sing! rend your lungs, but you must sing! Ay, All-ruling God! Satan's music vies
                  with thine! Cringar prated, in his fear, of thee! and in spite of thee I've
                  crushed him! Ay, Daniel Garvin is a god unto himself! Sing with a louder strain,
                  ye voices! Satan drowns you with his roof-cracking notes!"
               As the mad broker recommenced the furious blows on his breast, his eye caught
                  sight of the boat which at that instant
                  appeared shooting out from behind the stern of the brig, and with a renewed burst
                  of laughter, he yelled,—
               "Too late! Erie's gone!—Down with your hands and cease your clamor!" turning his
                  eyes to the storm. "You'll break in the walls with your loud-mouthed bids. The
                  bulls have it!—do you hear? The bulls, I say! Go home, ye bears, and lap your
                  chops for honey!" He then bowed low to the sailors. "What! gone short, and want
                  Daniel Garvin to help you out? Go to my namesake,—Uncle Dan! He'll give you a
                  lift, if your hair and claws are long enough!"
               The sailors, who for a moment had rested on their oars, now renewed their strokes
                  with vigor.
               "What!" howled the maniac, straightening himself. "Are ye all traitors! Tell me
                  you come for stock! I see your irons! Your fetters are not for me! Melt them into
                  Union grape, and pepper well that thin-shanked Jonas, and the fangless she-wolf!"
                  Then with a final peal of laughter that curdled the blood of the laboring oarsmen
                  he screamed: "So ye think to cage the strong-horned bull! You're mad! These
                  bawling winds are mad! The heavens are mad! Ay, the whole world is mad! and I'll
                  be mad unless I go hence, quickly!—One!—Avast, you bailiff
                     water-bugs!—Two!—If I rise from the immersion, slip your fingers
                  o'er my watered scalp!—Three!—I'm gone!" And leaping to the opposite
                  side of the pier he plunged into the river.
               With a cry of horror the sailors pulled to the spot where he disappeared; but even
                  the eddies which his body created as it went down were mingled with the waves, and
                  they watched in vain for his reappearance.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLVI.
               A MONTH has passed since the incidents occurred which have just been narrated. We
                  are in that drawing-room in which we have witnessed scenes described in former
                  chapters. All is as it was then,—the same paintings hang in their old places, the
                  same pieces of statuary stand on the accustomed pedestals and brackets, the same
                  piano awaits the familiar touch in its own corner, and the same furniture with its
                  rich carvings invites one to sit and ruminate like Joseph Deering over the
                  comforts of competency.
               But now steps approach the door which, in a manner still more pleasing than all we
                  have just surveyed, tells us of the change this past month has brought about.
               The door is opened, and a face appears in lovely contrast to the forbidding visage
                  which greeted the Veteran on that stormy day when he came to this house and found
                  the family of Allen Paige turned from beneath its roof. It is the face of Emma
                  Paige, radiant with happiness; for she has just left her mother sitting in that
                  room where the patriot husband was tended in his illness, and contemplating the
                  dear objects sacredly associated with his memory, which bring tears of mingled joy
                  and sadness to her eyes.
               A brief statement of the circumstances which have led to this happy result is all
                  that is necessary.
               Directed by the information given by the sailors, the authorities searched for the
                  body of the mad suicide, and after two days' grappling found it at a considerable
                     distance below the pier from which
                  he made his fatal leap. The body was instantly identified as that of Daniel
                  Garvin, and was buried with feelings of grief and desolation by his son
                  William.
               With the broker dead, the young artist hastened to make all the restitution in his
                  power for the wrongs committed by his father. He was assisted in this work by
                  Jonas Cringar, who was well acquainted with the details of the operation by which
                  Daniel Garvin had defrauded the family of his half-brother, and who worked day and
                  night in this labor, with a sort of happiness which seemed to him more like a
                  dream than the reality.
               William, whose conscience, as the reader is aware, was naturally tender, and whose
                  few days' experience before and after his father's tragical death had done the
                  work of twenty years, was not content with an exact restitution of actual property
                  taken by the broker; he also desired to mend as far as possible the harm which he
                  had done for which the law could claim no compensation. In such work he had a wise
                  counsellor in the Veteran, whom he looked up to with perhaps greater reverence
                  than ever before.
               Among other things to be accomplished in this direction was such judicious
                  assistance for Cringar as would enable him to repair, in a degree, his broken
                  life, which had been shattered through the machinations of his tempter; the guilt
                  for which he himself was responsible having been expiated in the terrible
                  sufferings he had experienced. Through the influence of the Veteran an arrangement
                  was made with the Bald Eagle Silver Mining Company, by which the merchant was to
                  return the money he was responsible for by semiannual instalments with interest,
                  William Garvin guaranteeing the same. To enable him to do this, as well as
                  re-establish himself in business, William, under the advice of the Veteran,
                  advanced sufficient to clear pressing liabilities, and set him well on his feet.
                  All this the son was amply able to perform, the father having left property
                  amounting in value to nearly two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
               The Paiges found their old home comparatively undisturbed, one of the great
                  sources of enjoyment on the part of the broker while he occupied it having been to
                  gaze around on the evidences of former comforts experienced by his half-brother,
                  and that family to whom, then, it was apparently lost forever.
               The past few months seemed to them like a shadowy dream, from which sometimes they
                  could hardly believe themselves yet awakened. There was a feeling of strangeness
                  when they first passed from room to room, as though they had been absent for
                  years. Their recent experience had been so crowded with events and trials that it
                  seemed a separate life, not to be measured by the ordinary divisions of time. This
                  served rather to enhance the unspeakable happiness with which they moved in the
                  midst of those sacred associations from which they had so nearly been for all time
                  excluded.
               Emma had enjoyed a communion with her mother in the room which had been sanctified
                  by the impressive death of the husband and father, and in which Daniel Garvin had
                  not obtruded his unholy presence after the first day he moved in; for here his
                  conscience disturbed his gloating vengeance to a degree which, while he with
                  characteristic pride refused to acknowledge it, compelled him nevertheless to
                  retire, no more to cross its threshold. Mother and daughter had wept together as
                  they talked of the loved one who there passed away; and in the interchange of
                     their hearts' grateful sentiments
                  they had not failed to bless the comrade of this loved one, through whose labors
                  they were returned to these cherished scenes. And now the heroine of our story,
                  radiant with that happiness which reflected the tearful yet soul-awakening joy of
                  her whom she had left alone, entered the drawing-room and gazed around with
                  beaming eye. Then approaching the piano she opened it and touched the keys.
               Ah! the heaven-inspired notes which the spirit that deeply feels may bring from
                  this responsive instrument! Under the delicate hand of that fair girl, from whose
                  heart welled emotions she would express in music, the chords swept forth and
                  filled the room, giving her feelings an utterance that words could never yield;
                  and intermingled with them was an air gently yet sadly floating, telling of a soul
                  whose bliss soared to those ideal realms where joy and sadness dwell inseparably
                  together.
               One now came to the door and listened. He had entered the hall without ringing,
                  for he had been affectionately forbidden to pull the bell when he came to visit
                  this home. He listened with his head slightly bowed as if his heart would unite
                  with hers in the utterance of those prayerful and blissful emotions.
               The harmony grew deeper, and the melody more tender, until the instrument seemed
                  voluntarily pouring out its notes from a living spirit. Then suddenly from these
                  strains a simple accompaniment stole tremblingly forth, and Emma with heaving
                  breast and glistening eye commenced to sing.
               He who stood without now wiped the tear from his cheek as he listened, for she was
                  singing "HOME, SWEET HOME!"
               Her voice trembled as she sang, but the heart sustained it, and it hovered in the
                  air with touching sweetness:—
               
                  
                     "Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam,
                     Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home;
                     A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there,
                     Which, seek through the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere.
                     Home, home, sweet, sweet home,
                     Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home.
                  
                  
                     "An exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain,
                     O, give me my lowly thatched cottage again,
                     The birds singing gayly, that come at my call;
                     O, give me that sweet peace of mind, dearer than all.
                     Home, home, sweet, sweet home,
                     Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home."
                  
               
               As the last note died tremulously away, Prescott opened the door. Emma rose to
                  meet him, a smile lighting up her tearful eyes.
               As he took her hand he said,—
               "Emma, I have been a listener for several moments. If I have thus stolen rare
                  happiness I must beg you to forgive me."
               The blush that suffused her cheek when he entered deepened.
               "You must not turn flatterer now," she answered, dropping her eye before his
                  ardent gaze.
               "I cannot flatter you," he returned with a smile, but in a voice not free from
                  agitation. "Such music is beyond even my powers of flattery."
               Then bending over the piano he began looking in a searching manner along the
                  sounding-board and under the wires.
               Emma, who anticipated some quaint turn of Prescott's humor, followed him with her
                  eyes in pleased silence.
               "I do not find them," he said, at length, raising his head.
               "What do you seek there?"
               "Angels."
               
               "Prescott—"
               "You must not scold me, dear sister," exclaimed the young Lieutenant, "for I mean
                  no harm!"
               "You have surely turned to a giddy-headed flatterer," rejoined Emma, who, while
                  rebuking him with a severity which does not often so partake of tenderness, did
                  not fail to observe traces of the feelings with which he had listened to her song.
                  "When one begins flattering a friend 't is a warning that the esteem between them
                  needs the aid of a ready tongue."
               "It may be so,—it must be so if you say 't is so—"
               "Fy, Prescott! you are in strong mood for flattery today."
               "Dear sister," said the young Lieutenant, a look now appearing on his handsome
                  face to which, with maidenly intuition, Emma responded with a fluttering heart, "I
                  cannot satisfy you with my speech-making. I pray you, therefore, let me sit and
                  listen to more of the music which you would have me call so poor."
               Emma concealed a slight confusion which began to manifest itself by hastily
                  seating herself at the piano in response to this request.
               "I did not ask you to call it poor, but I fear you 'll have reason to do so," she
                  said as she swept the keys. "You know I am out of practice."
               This reference to the recent past touched Prescott deeply, and he gazed on Emma
                  with an expression which told how deeply his heart was moved.
               Sheet after sheet was played, the fair performer now throwing a sentiment into her
                  instrument which caused the heart of her listener to thrill with the magnetism
                  with which the notes were charged. In that improvisation to which Prescott had
                  given such rapt attention at the door, the spirit had found its utterance; in
                  these performances the heart was plainly speaking,—and time stole swiftly on.
               At length Emma ceased playing, and rose from the piano. Prescott's head was
                  slightly inclined forward, and his eyes raised in the same degree as their gaze
                  was fixed upon her with all-absorbing love.
               Involuntarily from her own eyes there beamed a responsive look, and then the lids
                  drooped as if to conceal what the maidenly heart would not prematurely make
                  known.
               The enamored lover was entranced by the picture now presented by this charming
                  girl. With an irresistible impulse he rose and took her hand.
               "Emma," he said softly, "will you walk with me? There is a beautiful sunset I have
                  longed for many a day to gaze upon with you."
               She cast upon him a quick glance, and then suffered herself to be led to the
                  painting, which had been enshrined in the memory of both.
               "Emma," he said yet more tenderly, "when I first stood before this picture my
                  heart formed it into a reality. My fancies gave a name to those two figures whose
                  souls seem so united in the midst of that western glory."
               As he thus spoke he pressed her hand more closely.
               "Do you not see, dear Emma, that a halo surrounds them? Their lives are to be
                  happy, for they love one another—"
               Her hand trembled in his.
               "—And their hands are clasped as they behold together the glowing scene; for each
                  knows the love which burns in the heart of the other."
               Deep blushes came and went as Emma gazed on the picture, which seemed all of a
                  golden haze.
               
               "Darling!" whispered the lover, suddenly raising her hand to his lips, "shall not
                  the picture I formed when I first stood here be made reality? I called those
                  figures you and I!"
               In another moment that lovely head was nestled on his bosom, while his arm gently
                  stole around her waist; and then as her face turned up to his, that first
                  lingering kiss was given through which two yearning hearts pour the sweet current
                  of their souls.
               An hour flew by, and the mother entered the room. The lovers were sitting side by
                  side; their faces, covered with gentle confusion, told the tale. She smiled with a
                  happiness which only the mother can experience who realizes that her daughter is
                  beloved by a man she can herself love and trust as a son.
               Prescott came forward, and said,—
               "Mother, will you not give me a pledge that will insure my right to call you
                  'mother' for all time?"
               Mrs. Paige led the young soldier to her daughter, and placed his hand in hers.
               "My dear children," she said, "I bless you! It is the blessing of a happy mother's
                  heart. And," she uttered, raising her eyes above, while she held their hands
                  clasped in hers, "there is one that has gone before us, whose blessing I believe
                  is joined with mine."
               Tears filled Emma's eyes, and she felt Prescott's hand press hers, as if he said,
                  "In memory of that dear parent, I consecrate my soul to your happiness!"
               Then she thought of another.
               "Ah!" she uttered to herself. "My happiness would be complete if he
                  were here."
               The wishes of her heart were unexpectedly answered; for scarcely had she uttered
                  them when the Veteran was ushered into their presence.
               In the countenances of the happy group before him he read all that had taken
                  place.
               "They await your blessing," said Mrs. Paige.
               The Veteran advanced, and placing a hand on either head, he uttered a benediction
                  so fervent and impressive that the tears trembled on Emma's lids, and Prescott's
                  eyes glistened with sympathetic feeling.
               There was that in the appearance of the grand and 
                     mamajestic
                     majestic
                   warrior which added solemnity to this touching scene. The pallor of his
                  countenance had increased, and there was a look in his eye that seemed to come
                  from depths, which, when observed in any person, convey an impression that the
                  spirit is already gazing into that land where it is to find its eternal home. To
                  Emma, who had from the first ever associated the Veteran with her father in a
                  manner she could scarcely explain, this appearance was especially affecting. At
                  the same time that she felt as if the benediction insured the kindly care of
                  Heaven for the years of wedded life that might be hers, there was also an
                  impression as though he who gave it was about being separated from them by the
                  space that divides the visible from the invisible world.
               But the object of these thoughts soon restored cheerfulness to the hearts of all;
                  and Alice, having now joined them, the two sisters entertained the company with
                  duets which were enchanting to the soul of the happy Prescott, and to which the
                  Veteran seemed to listen with an inward ear as he gave attention with an air of
                  deep meditation.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLVII.
               THIS story, Comrade Roberts, sounds like the creation of a novelist's brain. And
                  has it really occurred right around us here in New York?"
               "All right here among us."
               "Allen Paige's family have certainly given it a tone of reality I'll confess.
                  Their donations to the Grand Army surpass anything I have yet heard of."
               "Yes indeed! In these donations you see the expressions of benevolence and
                  gratitude combined. It is a remarkable shifting of the scenes in this every-day
                  life of ours. It seems scarcely yesterday since I enjoined it on Comrade Marland
                  to notify us if this family should need aid; and now here we are almost staggering
                  under the load of contributions sent in by them."
               "'T is a marvellous change, truly. You know I have followed them in one way with
                  unusual interest."
               "Through the breastpin?"
               "Yes. I shall not soon forget my feelings when I went into old Meinshon's
                  pawn-shop and saw that pin with the likeness of our brave Colonel, and heard the
                  Jew's story about his daughter coming in that stormy day and pawning it."
               Robert smiled.
               "I can understand much better now," he said to his companion, in whom the reader
                  will recognize the comrade he had spoken of to Prescott on the cars as the one who
                  gave him the quaint but touching story told by the kindhearted pawnbroker, and
                  with whom he was now returning ing from a Post meeting,—"I can understand much
                  better now, Comrade Walker, why the Lieutenant was so deeply affected when he saw
                  Allen Paige's family entered on my relief-list, and heard the story of the
                  breastpin." He thereupon gave Walker an account of his first meeting with Prescott
                  on the New Jersey Central train.
               "That must have been hard," returned the latter. "But he is well repaid now, for
                  of all beautiful girls I have had the good fortune to meet, I think she is the
                  most beautiful."
               "There is soul there, as well as a handsome face."
               "That is the secret. She has the true beauty; and I observe that while every one
                  gazes at her with admiration, she wins all by her goodness. Comrade Marland is a
                  lucky fellow."
               "He deserves to be a lucky fellow."
               "That's so. There's not a soldier but is ready to congratulate him. He has a grand
                  start in life as partner in that store."
               "Yes. But the benefits will not be on one side, let me tell you. The Lieutenant
                  goes in to take charge of the Paige interest, and he'll double it in a short time,
                  or I'm no judge of men."
               "He'll be sure to succeed, or I'm no judge of women."
               "What do you mean by that," asked Roberts, laughingly.
               "I mean that, with such a wife as he is to have, he cannot fail. I have remarked
                  that good wives are a strong guaranty of a man's success in life."
               "I agree to that."
               "My friend the pawnbroker has an exalted opinion of Miss Paige. It was only the
                  day after she had been to redeem the pin in person, that I called to learn if it
                  was still there. He gave me an account in his graphic broken English lish of this second visit of hers. She
                  must have appreciated his goodness of heart, for he being a pretty deep student of
                  human nature, besides entertaining a sincere admiration for her, was desirous of
                  engaging her in conversation; and she indulged him with a courtesy and good sense
                  which so delighted him that he lost a customer, who came, waited, and went, in his
                  enthusiasm to recount to me his interview with her."
               "Have you heard how Comrade Marland first met her?"
               "I have not."
               Roberts narrated the circumstances as Prescott himself had related them to
                  him.
               "That diabolical old woman ought to have been hung!" exclaimed Walker when his
                  companion had finished.
               "You hit nearer than you suppose. It was this old hag that Garvin hired to put
                  Thorbolt out of the way. She it was that set those assassins on him."
               "Who found that out?"
               "The General himself. You see, when he was struck with the slung-shot by one of
                  the scoundrels, the other thought he was done for, and he was so full of
                  exultation that when he sprang at him with his knife he was fool enough to cry
                  out, 'One for the Lancet and Mammy Roone!' This, together with the identification
                  of the scamp, who was called Doctor,—whose skull, you will
                  recollect, was broken in by a front cut of Thorbolt's cane,—put the police on the
                  track. But she was too wary for them, and made off with the fellow who they say
                  fired the pistol,—Dick Smasher they call him,—and neither of them are likely to be
                  seen in these parts for one while. It is a bit of consolation to know, however,
                  that if this precious beldam and her hireling haven't got their deserts, the
                  little Irishwoman who warned General Hammond mond of Mammy Roone's plot against
                  Miss Paige has; for the family employ her continually, and give her enough to keep
                  her from want for a score of years."
               "Good! That's what I call gratitude to the humble!" exclaimed Walker. "So Billings
                  was in that adventure," he added. "I'm slightly acquainted with him. He's
                  book-keeper at Cringar's, and seems to be a pretty smart fellow."
               "That he is," returned Roberts. "He has been of great service in the Paige and
                  Garvin affairs; and Marland tells me he will eventually enter the concern. And
                  from what the Lieutenant has dropped, I judge that he is going to take his chances
                  and wait for Emma Paige's younger sister, Alice, a girl who promises in a few
                  years to be as charming a young woman as her elder sister, and who seems to have a
                  high opinion of him."
               "Marland must have looked as though he had just broke a Rebel prison when you met
                  him the night he escaped from the mad-house," said Walker after a moment's
                  silence.
               "He did, indeed! He saw my surprise, and promised at a future time to tell me
                  about what had happened, which he did. 'T was a thrilling story, as you can
                  imagine. It was a marvellous piece of business,—that inventor's picking their way
                  out."
               "I should say so. But the best part of that story is the raid on the Doctor's
                  private office.
               "I agree with you there, Comrade," replied Roberts, laughing. "And what is still
                  better, Prescott captured enough to break up the den, and drive the Doctor and his
                  whole pack from the city. I shall not soon forget the way he told me that his
                  cell-mate, the mad Corporal, had got into comfortable quarters. You would have
                  thought he was talking about a comrade that had gone all through the war with
                  him."
               
               "Comrade Marland has a warm heart."
               "Yes, as warm as it is bold. I like him. I've yet to see the man that doesn't. I
                  venture to say he'll not soon forget the inventor."
               "No, I guess not! Judging from his knowledge of curious inventions, I'm inclined
                  to think they've seen much of each other since their escape."
               "Well, I must leave you here," said Walker, parting from his comrade. After
                  proceeding a few paces, he turned quickly and said,—
               "Comrade Roberts, write that tale out and read it to the Post."
            
            
               CHAPTER XLVIII.
               MAY had departed. June had come, with its fresh, green verdure, its wild-flowers,
                  its feathered songsters, and its balmy days.
               In a chamber overlooking the placid Hudson lay one whose great strength would have
                  seemed sufficient to hold back for years to come that mighty Conqueror of all that
                  is earthly in mortal man.
               It was the Veteran. He was repaying with his life the efforts it had been his
                  privilege to make in behalf of a comrade's wronged and outraged family. Those
                  premonitory signs which had filled with sadness the hearts of this family were
                  being realized as prophetic. In his anxiety for them he rose too soon from a
                  sick-bed, which, with the arduous mental as well as the physical labor he at once
                  engaged in, had completed the work a life of exposure and numerous wounds had done
                  much to accelerate.
               His iron will had sustained him till all was done for which he had labored; then a
                  fatal relapse set in, and the final breaking up came with that suddenness which
                  often marks the end of powerful men; and now at the close of a June day that had
                  been unusually calm and tranquil, he lay serenely awaiting the orders from
                  Head-quarters to join that great army on whose banners are inscribed celestial
                  mottoes.
               The windows were open, and the joyous songs of birds filled the air, harmonizing
                  with the divine beauty of this scene, in which Death was clothed in bright
                  garments, making ready to give the final summons with beatific smiles.
               The dying Veteran had fallen into a brief sleep. When he awoke he turned to the
                  nurse who was attending him in this his last illness, and asked in a voice which,
                  though weak, indicated its former depth and richness, "Have they not come?"
               At this moment sounds of an approaching carriage were heard, and presently Mrs.
                  Paige, Prescott, Emma, and Albert entered the room.
               The Veteran greeted them cheerfully, and took each by the hand.
               "You are not all here," he said, after Albert had come to the bedside.
               Mrs. Paige looked at Emma. "You need not fear," said the Veteran with a smile; "I
                  want you all around me. You know the sick are whimsical at times."
               Emma went out, and returned with Alice and Little Dorrit. As the latter was led to
                  him she exclaimed,—
               "O Uncle Thorbolt, I'm sorry you are sick! You are so good, I know God will get
                  you well!"
               He again smiled, and reaching forth his hand, which his strength still permitted, he placed it gently
                  on her head, saying,—
               "My littte pet, God has been very kind to Uncle Thorbolt, and he will take him
                  soon where he cannot be sick again."
               The child evidently understood these words; for tears came into her eyes, and
                  hiding her face in the folds of her mother's dress, she gave vent to her childish
                  grief.
               The dying soldier followed her with his eye, and then turned an imploring glance
                  on Mrs. Paige.
               "I pray you," he said, "teach this little one to look on Death as an angel of
                  brightness; not the enemy, but the friend of mankind. Teach her so that she shall
                  visit the tomb without dread, without sorrow. He who is called to a distant land
                  to enjoy extraordinary good fortune is not mourned; neither is the family which
                  bids him a temporary farewell bereaved beyond the first pangs of parting. Rather
                  are they rejoiced at the good fortune of the one they love. So is it with what we
                  term death. Those who are called above go to a land in which is insured a
                  happiness surpassing our conception. Were it not that this last chill to my mortal
                  frame is on me, I fear my self-control would not avail against the manifestations
                  of my joy, as I think of that world for which I shall so soon depart."
               The little group about him listened with a kind of awe to words like these, spoken
                  by one who felt himself passing away from this life. Mrs. Paige, especially, who
                  in her Samaritan labors had witnessed many death scenes in the course of her
                  experience, never before beheld one so impressive as this. Here indeed was the
                  type of a Christian soldier; one who, before that stage was reached when the dying
                  so often gaze with ecstasy into the world which they are about to enter, lay
                  calmly on his pillow, and with a clear knowledge of his approaching end,
                  discoursed with the faith and clearness of a Christian philosopher. And how
                  beautiful his views of death! As she listened, Mrs. Paige vowed silently to Heaven
                  that her little girl should never know, if her efforts could avail, the fear which
                  makes a dread visitant of that Presence which is truly a seraphic angel come to
                  welcome home the Heaven-bound spirit.
               The Veteran continued.
               "The 'City of the Dead' is calm and peaceful. And forgive an old comrade," he
                  added, turning his gaze with a smile upon Prescott, "for presuming to preach to
                  you; but I would say, so live that this 'City' shall ever be pleasant to you. Not
                  simply a place of curious epitaphs, or tasty works of art, but a spot in which the
                  very mounds shall speak to you of Heaven, and hold you in elevating meditation;
                  making your heart pure, and inspiring you with higher resolutions to perform the
                  duty which God has assigned you as your share of work before he takes you hence.
                  Prescott, it is a state of mind to be thankful for, when one can say, 'This is a
                  beautiful world, and I continually experience a happiness I cannot express; but
                  nevertheless I blissfully contemplate that moment when the Lord shall say, "Thy
                  work is done. Come up hither."'"
               Prescott, whose eyes had filled when the Veteran commenced addressing him, now
                  bowed his head; and taking his dying comrade's hand in his, he inwardly prayed
                  that sentiments like these might actuate his life, and that in death the Lord
                  might find him so well prepared as he who thus addressed him.
               The Veteran now lay silent for a while, a slight compression of his mouth
                  indicating temporary pain.
               When Emma saw this, she was obliged to turn away to conceal her emotion.
               
               "Are they not coming also?" he said at length, raising his eyes.
               "Who?" asked Prescott.
               "Mr. Cringar, and his book-keeper,—or rather his and your book-keeper," he added,
                  smilingly correcting himself in a manner which, recalling as it did the labors he
                  had undergone for their sakes, touched them all to the heart.
               "They will be here soon," answered the young Lieutenant.
               "Jonas Cringar has suffered deeply," continued the Veteran as if to himself.
                  "Think you," he said, again looking up, "that he could have been happy in the
                  'City of the Dead,' when he was so sorely oppressed with his guilt?"
               Prescott shook his head.
               Albert now went to the window, and looking out, exclaimed,—
               "They are coming, General Hammond,—Mr. Cringar and Mr. Billings."
               "Thank you, my dear boy," returned the Veteran in a gracious way that reminded
                  those about him of the times that had passed. "You would make me a good aid, were
                  I in the service just now."
               Albert, who was an impressible lad, drew back and silently wept.
               The merchant and book-keeper entered the room directly after, and were received by
                  their dying friend in the same cheerful way he had greeted the others. His
                  reception of the former was accompanied by a look which caused this man, so
                  recently broken and wretched, to join his left hand with his right; and he thus
                  stood for several moments clasping in both of his the hand that had greeted him,
                  and gazing with an expression of veneration and gratitude on the face of the
                  magnanimous Thorbolt.
               "My friend," he said at length; but his voice faltered, and he could not go
                  on.
               The Veteran regarded him from his pillow with so kind an air that he exclaimed
                  from an irresistible impulse,—
               "Dear General! If the Lord would but take my life for yours, I would gladly give
                  it!"
               "Ah, no," responded the Veteran, "you are to be of great service to them all." And
                  he looked around affectionately on those who stood witnessing this scene.
               "Ever thinking of others!" murmured the book-keeper, whose countenance was
                  expressive of deep reverence.
               The merchant unclasped his hands, and forgetting for the moment all else around
                  him, raised them imploringly to Heaven.
               "O God!" he exclaimed, "take me,—a poor, shattered, broken-down man,—and restore
                  him who has done so much good!"
               All were deeply affected; and so earnest was the prayer, it seemed for an instant
                  as though it must be answered; as if he, so shattered by his past sufferings,
                  would be taken as the offering for him who was lately so strong and efficient a
                  worker among his fellow-men.
               Jonas Cringar continued his upward gaze, while his hands folded themselves as they
                  slowly fell, like one awaiting a response to his soul-uttered petition.
               The tranquil object of this prayer remained silent until the suppliant lowered his
                  tearful eyes. Then he said,—
               "To you, my friend, is reserved a noble work. In that great city which has
                  recently witnessed so much that is eventful to you, destitution and misery hold
                  multitudes of victims. Relieve them as you shall have the means to do so. No
                  happier life is passed than in constant works of benevolence. No happier death is
                  there than that which is attended by
                  the blessings of those whom he that is passing away has aided in life."
               "Such shall be my work!" uttered the merchant in a fervent voice. "God has been
                  very kind to me who was so guilty, and I will repay it by acts of kindness to his
                  suffering children. May my death-bed be like this!"
               "Ah! you can make it far happier in that respect," said the Veteran, with a sad
                  smile. "I have done little. You can do much; for keep to your good resolutions,
                  and Heaven will prosper you."
               Jonas Cringar bowed his head in silence.
               The soldier now cast his eyes toward the open window through which he could gaze
                  off to the southwest. As he did so his face lit up with a gleam of pleasure, and
                  he exclaimed in a stronger voice than he had yet used,—
               "How grandly those rugged clouds are piled one upon the other! They catch the
                  beams of the setting sun! How warm, how radiant are the last rays of day!—My
                  friends, so may it be with the last hours of human life. They should be the
                  happiest and most glorious of all."
               He gazed awhile in silence with an expression of solemn admiration. "They marshal
                  for the thunder," he continued. "How obediently do they array themselves at the
                  beck of Heaven! They make ready to hurl their fear-inspiring bolts; but as we
                  behold their Great Commander with the eye of childish faith, directing them with
                  an all-wise hand, they teach humility; for with their towering grandeur, their
                  threatening fronts, and their dread artillery, they yield unquestioning obedience
                  to his orders. Oh! how strong is man, when with humble heart he listens to the
                  word of God, and believing all things well, fights the good fight in the panoply
                  of Heaven! He then surpasses these cloudy Titans with their thunderbolts, as the
                  spirit, made in the image of its Creator, surpasses all inanimate matter!"
               The listening group which had gathered in sorrow around his death-bed gazed on
                  this departing warrior with amazement and awe. The term "comfort the dying" was
                  reversed. He was their comforter; and in these last moments their impressive
                  teacher also.
               He now closed his eyes, and his breathing indicated that he had sunk into a gentle
                  sleep.
               Presently the rumbling of distant thunder broke the pervading stillness. The
                  sleeper moved, but did not awake. Another distant peal rolled over the earth. As
                  its reverberations entered the chamber, the Veteran partly raised his closed lids,
                  and said,—
               "Well, boys, the ball's opened! What regiment has the advance to-day?"
               Then suddenly he looked up.
               "What!" he said smilingly as his glance fell on Prescott, "is old Thorbolt
                  sleeping on his post?"
               At that moment the deepening thunder again re-echoed through the sky. The
                  soldier's eye gleamed for an instant, lit by the old martial fire, and then he
                  spoke:—
               "Prescott, I would have given much to see that charge of Zagonyi's Body-Guard in
                  Missouri, when the four Philadelphia brothers went in together for the Union."
               "The brothers Newhall?" returned the young Lieutenant, desirous of preventing pain
                  to the Veteran's mind by a silence which would imply grief.
               "Yes, the brothers Newhall. It must have been a noble picture! The East and West
                  were joined hand in hand in that charge."
               "Yes," responded Prescott, "and through the war too, General."
               "Ah, yes! to the end. They were hand in hand to the end. The Army of the Potomac
                  grasped the Rebellion by the throat,
                  and the Army of the Cumberland crushed in its trunk. May they ever work together.
                  God be praised that erelong there will be no sectional North and South! The
                  dividing line is vanishing, and soon fraternal feelings will extend to the Gulf;
                  and then will there be the great East and West to behold the rising and setting of
                  the sun."
               The heavy rumbling of the distant thunder continued, and while listening to its
                  reverberations the Veteran's eye again revealed the old fire.
               Presently he said, as if speaking to himself:—
               "The Union-loving States! sisters, bound by common bonds of pride and grief,—pride
                  that each like a Spartan mother had sent out its myriads of children to fight for
                  liberty,—grief when thousands were laid low amid the thunders of war which vied
                  with these that echo through the sky,—and pride again that each fallen son had
                  found a patriot's grave! Every State sent forth its heroes, whose record enriches
                  its archives." Then suddenly turning his gaze on the young Lieutenant he exclaimed
                  with unwonted energy: "The dead shall not be forgotten! The States shall not
                  forget them! Neither shall the Republic! Their memory shall be held even more
                  sacred in the next generation than in this! Neither shall the living whom the dead
                  have left pass from the minds of this nation!—Prescott, I feel that the moment is
                  not far distant when my tongue is to fail me. I would therefore adjure you as a
                  Comrade to ever hold high the standard of that Order which, like this voice of
                  Heaven that succeeds the thunder-clap, shall sustain the tones with which Liberty
                  made the whole earth tremble!"
               Prescott bent his head, while his face, reflecting the solemn inspiration of the
                  dying Thorbolt, glowed with the soul's deep and holy resolve. The heavens seemed
                  cognizant zant of this scene; for at that moment the lightning darted for the
                  first time from the clouds upon which the Veteran had gazed, and was followed by a
                  peal much nearer than those that had preceded it, which thundered over the now
                  darkening world with a sound that impressed the silent group as if the Eternal
                  Voice were speaking to them.
               Soon these clouds were lit up by almost incessant flashes; and as the twilight
                  pervading the room was illuminated by the lurid glare, those who still listened in
                  awed silence to the nearing thunder gazed steadfastly on the upturned face. As the
                  mighty concussions shook the earth beneath them, that face, so grand in health,
                  now assumed an aspect of sublimity. It seemed to partake of the character of those
                  white, rugged cloud-tops, which so often present colossal semblances of men, with
                  marked features and swelling muscles, the effect increased by the infinite sky
                  beyond, against which they stand out in surpassing relief. The spirit was
                  evidently moved by scenes of war, which the thunder-storm with its vivid flashes
                  called up before the great cavalry leader's fading sight; while immediately
                  beyond, the eternal heaven appeared to enhance the power of this last
                  manifestation of enkindled mortality.
               Erelong this expression gave way to a look of ineffable tranquillity, which the
                  resounding heavens served but to increase. It was a look that gave those who gazed
                  a realization of the tranquillity to come, when with the mortal body laid off, the
                  spirit may labor on, if such be the will of God, rendered infinitely more
                  efficient by the heavenly peace, which even on the earth so signally adds to the
                  powers of him who is blessed with its divine presence.
               Silence still pervaded the room, except that occasionally an awed whisper might have been heard, as the eye
                  was directed toward the Veteran, who lay as if contemplating scenes beyond their
                  power to conceive. In the midst of this silence the door was gently opened, and a
                  slight form stood trembling at the threshold. It was William Garvin.
               As he thus stands hesitating to come forward, one is reminded of the time he stood
                  by the door of Allen Paige's chamber, when that patriot was passing to the higher
                  life; except that now he is much thinner even than he was then, and there are
                  plainly perceptible the marks of wearing anguish.
               The Veteran seemed at once to realize the presence of this new-comer. Looking
                  toward him he smiled, and beckoned him to his bedside.
               The young artist, his face quivering with emotion, hastened to obey, and falling
                  on his knees, clasped the Veteran's hand. Breaking into loud sobs, he covered it
                  with his tears.
               "O my friend!" he uttered between his sobs,—"my friend!—my friend! Do not leave me
                  now! Ah! if I too could die!"
               "William," said the Veteran, gently, while a slight dampness suffused those eyes
                  whose fountains were now gradually drying up, "your turn will come in due time. If
                  I am your friend, what do you think He can be, who in his providence is taking me
                  home?" He stopped a moment, for he could not sustain his speech as he had
                  previously, and then continued in a voice in which was mingled deep solemnity and
                  touching pathos: "Look, William, to that dear Father who, as I lie here awaiting
                  the final call, I tell you is kinder than you can ever realize in your present
                  existence. And you have a Guide, who has made known this Father. Learn of Him,
                  follow His counsels, and tell me when you shall join me in Heaven if happiness has
                  not been yours."
               William, with a renewed outburst of grief, kissed the Veteran's warm hand, and
                  sobbed,—
               "I'll try! yes! yes! I'll stay and try!—Alone! alone! I shall be indeed
                  alone!"
               "HE will ever be near you."
               "Ever near me," repeated the desolate youth. Rising then to his feet, he leaned
                  over the bed with an irresistible impulse and kissed the broad, pale forehead,
                  exclaiming, "Farewell, my best of friends! farewell!" Then turning, he approached
                  Emma and Prescott, and convulsively seizing the hand of each, he placed one in the
                  other. He tried to speak; but his voice failed him, and with one silent, pleading
                  look for forgiveness which Emma returned with tearful eyes, he hastened from the
                  room to spend his brief remaining life in travelling over the world, and doing
                  good with the money the broker had left, deriving from his acts of benevolence and
                  a prayerful spirit the comfort the dying warrior had promised him.
               
               It was nigh unto midnight. The storm had passed, and the thunder had hushed its
                  voice. Hushed, too, was the voice of the Veteran, for he had slept his last sleep.
                  He commenced sinking rapidly immediately after the storm had ceased, as if the
                  grand commotion of the elements had lent the spirit strength to stay for a space
                  the progress of dissolution. For several hours he had in his unconscious intervals
                  re-enacted, as did the patriot merchant, the scenes of battle through which he had
                  passed, and now the windows of that mortal casement were needed no more, for the
                  soul had left the mortal to put on immortality.
            
            
               
               CONCLUSION.
               IT is the 30th of May, 1868. The bells toll throughout the land, the booming
                  minute-gun mingles its tones with their brazen notes, and columns of marching men,
                  with votive garlands in their hands, move to the graves of their fallen comrades
                  to the measure of the solemn dirge.
               It is MEMORIAL DAY,—the day instituted by the Grand Army of the Republic for
                  decorating the graves of the Union dead.
               It is a day ordained for the expression of a nation's grateful heart. The bells,
                  the guns, the dirge, the solemn tread, the draped flag,—all speak the nation's
                  sorrow. But the garlands,—they speak the love which ennobles and sanctifies all
                  grief. As the angels look down upon our land this day, they see these floral
                  offerings wet with many tears.
               Nothing connected with the history of the Rebellion will command the respect of
                  future generations in a more marked degree than this national memorial service. It
                  derives no part of its impressiveness from ambition, love of strife, or taste for
                  adventure; but as a bereaved family gather around the last resting-places of their
                  dear ones, and strew the graves with flowers, and consecrate them with prayer and
                  affection's silent tear, so on this day does a grateful nation gather about the
                  mounds where sleep the patriot dead, with floral offerings to their memory.
               As the future reader of history shall look back on this sublime observance, he
                  will exclaim, "The nation had a living soul!"
               It has been objected to this service that it will serve to perpetuate ill-feeling
                  between the two sections of the country. Such fears are groundless. No complete
                  harmony is possible without sincere contrition on the part of those who took up
                  arms against their country; and no sincere contrition is possible, unless they
                  perceive their wrong, and stand ready to thank those who saved them from
                  accomplishing their own ruin. When they once stand in this position, they will
                  express in stronger terms their gratitude to the memory of their country's
                  defenders than it is possible for them to do who took no part in the fratricidal
                  strife.
               Those who are continually uttering their fears, as one form of permanent memorial
                  to the Union dead follows another, that all these things will keep alive the
                  bitterness of the South, represent no spirit of magnanimity, but rather that
                  disposition which in private life is forever expressing apprehensions of ceaseless
                  troubles between one party and another, thereby aggravating difficulties which but
                  for their folly would be speedily adjusted. Reconciliation is not secured by timid
                  fears, but by boldness in doing what is right.
               We turn and gaze upon the lineaments of a martyred soldier, a general of the Union
                  armies who loved his country, who fought for it in the highest spirit of
                  patriotism, and died a sacrifice on its holy altar. Shall his countrymen, who
                  revere his memory, abstain from a public expression of their sentiments for fear
                  of injuring the feelings of those who slew him while fighting to uphold the Stars
                  and Stripes? If he could speak to us, would he not say that they who advocate a
                  course so pernicious are but inviting a future repetition of the great crime of
                  the recent Rebellion? If all the patriot dead could rise and speak to us from the
                  spirit which actuated their going forth to offer up their lives for freedom, would
                  they not tell us that these baneful
                  utterances should serve to make all loyal men the more strenuous in their
                  determination to perpetuate those memories that make the love of country and its
                  liberty to be prized and held in the highest honor? For such unwise deference to
                  the feelings of pardoned Rebels offers a premium to their crime; and future
                  generations will look back to see nothing but a duel in that which was the most
                  momentous war that the world had witnessed,—a duel where the opposing parties met
                  to fight, and then shake hands, with a tacit understanding that when their honor
                  is again wounded they will fight it out, and again shake hands.
               Let us not be in haste. So deep a wound as this country has just received cannot
                  be healed in a day; and the future welfare of the whole body politic must not be
                  endangered through anxiety to secure so factitious a result. Let the healing
                  process go on through the healthy co-operation of natural laws, and then it will
                  be lasting. And among the manifestations of these laws is the country's
                  testimonial to the memory of its defenders.
               On this first Memorial Day a group were gathered about two grassy mounds rising
                  side by side, and strewn with garlands of flowers. Of those who composed the group
                  there was one who could not fail to attract attention by the loveliness of her
                  inspired countenance. Taking in each hand a wreath, she advanced between these
                  graves, and lifting her eyes to heaven she for a moment moved her lips in silence,
                  and then kneeling, kissed the wreaths and placed them on the mounds. Then a young
                  man went gently forward and raised her.
               "Prescott," she said, "their comrades have strewn their graves with these precious
                  garlands, and your dear hand was with them. O, bless you all! I weep, dear
                  husband, but I am not unhappy." And she whom we have known as Emma Paige leaned
                  her head on the bosom of Prescott Marland, her husband, while tears she could not
                  restrain flowed like a silent river down her cheeks.
               The graves, on which she had placed her heart's offering with such holy affection,
                  were the last resting-places of all that was mortal of Allen Paige and the
                  Veteran.
               The relatives of the latter, who was unmarried, notwithstanding a pleasant jest
                  uttered to the young Lieutenant which the reader may possibly remember, had, on
                  learning the circumstances, cheerfully consented that he should be thus buried
                  beside that comrade whose widowed wife and fatherless children had found in him so
                  noble a benefactor.
               The mother, Alice, Albert, and Little Dorrit also, all were there; and with them
                  were the merchant, and he who, formerly a book-keeper, is now a partner.
               Mrs. Paige, whose own memorial offerings had been given, approached those two whom
                  wedlock had made her own, and looking upon the mounds with eyes that bore the
                  signs of recent weeping she said with ineffable tenderness,—
               "Our hearts are indeed made both sad and happy this day. Sadness we feel; but ah!
                  it is a blessed privilege to have them here, side by side, to receive these tokens
                  of our love and gratitude. And O, how happy the assurance, that by the hands of
                  those who call them comrades these precious mounds shall in the years to come be
                  strewn with love's garlands, like these sweet flowers they have placed here to-day
                  with such fraternal tenderness!" For a moment she gazed upon the graves in
                  silence; then she said, "It was indeed a Heaven-inspired thought, to bind the army
                  here remaining with that army gone before with these memorials of the heart's deep
                  affection."
               When she ceased, a faint strain of music floated through the air from a distant cemetery. As it reached the
                  widow's ears she looked above, and with the eye of faith beheld the myriads of
                  transfigured comrades gathered together, and chanting to the Lord God, while in
                  sacred accompaniment the pealing notes of the celestial organ rose with their
                  swelling voices through the archways of Eternal Heaven. And she saw hosts of
                  angels bearing in their hands immortal wreaths, with which to crown each comrade
                  as he shall pass from earth to join in responsive anthems to the annual utterance
                  of a nation's prayer,—till the last surviving Soldier of the Union shall have
                  performed the sacred office of Memorial Day, and then ascended to receive upon his
                  brow the final wreath, and answer to the heavenly roll-call, "HERE!"
            
            THE END.
