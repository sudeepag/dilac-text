               PROLOGUE.
               TREAD lightly, dear reader—breathe not too loudly! The Angel of Death has come to carry back to God the freed spirit of one of earth's sorrowing children, and we would lead you to the spot where the dissolution goes on.
               Here is the place, in this chamber. Through the crevices in yonder darkened window creeps the chill blast of winter; around the crackled, time-worn walls the biting frost has touched its glistening pencillings of white, and that rattling that strikes upon the ear is the flapping of the loosened shingles as the searching wind makes its way beneath them. That low cot in the corner—that heap of straw upon the floor, and those two chairs, together with yon rickety table, are all the articles of furniture that you need look for—you will find no more!
               That man, whose wasted form lays stretched upon the cot, is dying! That care-worn woman, who weeps such scalding tears, is one of the most devoted of wives; and those two little ones—the girl and the prattling boy—are the children of a marriage that has long been o'ershadowed by the lowering clouds of an undeserved misfortune.
               Hark!
               'Oh! and must you die, dear Frederic?'
               'Die? Yes, yes,—I am dying, now. Oh! 'tis a sweet thing to die—to pass from this cold earth to the warm climate of the spirit's father land. Would that you could lie down and die with me, Aurelia,—we should be so happy, wandering hand in hand through the starlit path that leads to the home of the FATHER!'
               'And our children?'
               'God bless them when I am gone, and may He bless you, too, my wife. Oh! why did I ever urge you to—'
               'Hush, hush, Frederic,—no more of that. Let me brush back the hair from your brow, and bathe your heated temples.'
               'Heated, did you say? No—they are cold, cold. Kiss me, Aurelia.'
               That gentle wife bent forward and pressed her lips upon the wan cheek of her husband, and as the short, quick breath struck upon her ear, she started back in agony.
               'Are you worse, Frederic? Tell me—tell me!'
               Frederic Linwood opened his eyes, but he spoke not. A sweet smile rested upon his features, as though his wife's kiss still dwelt there, and where that smile centered in the bright blue eye an angel might have dipped its pencil to paint Faith's rainbow with. The tears came less freely from the lids of Aurelia, and the invisible presence of the spirit that supported her husband seemed to have found its home in her own heart. She took the cold hand of the dying man within her own, and bending forward, she whispered,—
               'Can you not speak to me, dearest? One word, at least.'
               For a moment Frederic Linwood gazed into the face of his wife, and then while some strange power seemed to temper his words—they were so soft and sweet—he said,—
               'Aurelia, I am going to sleep. All that you have ever seen of Frederic will soon be clasped in the silent slumber of death; but the spirit of your husband—that essence of the soul which has ever loved and cherished you—will slumber no more; but even as it passes out from its cold tenement of clay, it shall hover o'er you and bless you, and while you weep by the side of this wan and wasted form, the soul that gave it life shall watch over you in its happy spirit land. Lucie—George—come to your father. Come, let me bless you.'
               The girl stepped softly to the side of the low cot and laid her cheek upon the bosom of her father; the little boy crept up into its mother's lap, and he, too, stretched forth his tiny hands and clasped his dying parent's neck.
               'God bless you, Lucie!' feebly exclaimed Mr. Linwood, as he laid his hand upon the fair brow of his daughter; then, turning to his son, he opened his arms, and as Lucie raised her head from her father's bosom, the boy sprang forward and was clasped in his parent's last embrace.
               For several moments the boy lay thus upon the breast of his father, but no audible blessing reached his ears. Those once powerful arms, that had so often upheld his steps in infancy, were wound tightly around him, but the spirit that was wont to direct their movements had fled! The soul of Frederic Linwood was a dweller in the fatherland of angels!
               When Aurelia removed the stiffened arms from around the form of her little boy, and saw the sweet smile that rested upon her husband's features, she knew that upon those half-opened lips dwelt the blessing for the son which had not been breathed in words.
            
            
               CHAPTER I.
               THE ORPHAN BOY'S VISION.
               ONE pleasant morning, in the latter part of June, a boy, clad in an almost worn-out suit and carrying a small bundle in his hand, stepped tremblingly upon one of the numerous wharves that make out into the harbor, and approached the place where a large East Indiaman was taking in her cargo. For some fifteen minutes he stood and watched the various movements of the crew, ever and anon running his eyes over the lofty spars and rigging, seeming, the while, to be totally lost to all thought, save the novelty of the scene before him. The hearty 'heave-ye-ho's' of the sturdy seamen, the rattling of the blocks, and the creaking of the running rigging, sounded like sweet music in his ears, and for hours he might have stood thus, had not a loaded truck at length started him from his reverie. As he moved from his position to let the truck pass, the memory of some preconceived purpose came back to his mind, and in a doubting, hesitating tone, he asked of one of the men if he could see the captain of the ship. Said individual was pointed out to him, standing aft, upon the wheel-house, and timidly ascending the plank that led over the gangway, the boy soon reached the spot where stood the man whom he sought.
               'Is this the captain?'
               There was something so modest, and yet so frank, in the manner of the boy as he spoke, and then from his bright countenance, as the cap was respectfully removed from his brow, there shone forth such a light of intellect, blended with trembling expectation, that Capt. Wallet overcame the stern look of command that usually rested upon his features, and with a kind expression, he answered,—
               'Yes, my boy. What is your errand?'
               'Perhaps you are too busy now.'
               'No—speak on.'
               'Well, sir, I came to see if you would be willing to take me on board your ship. I am small, but if you will only try me, you will find me faithful, and willing to learn.'
               'What is your name?'
               'George Brumford, sir.'
               'And how old are you?'
               'I am twelve, sir.'
               'Do your parents consent to your going to sea?'
               'I have no parents, sir.'
               'No father, nor mother?'
               'No, sir; my father died long ago, when I was a little child; and my mother died last—last—
               The tears came thickly into the eyes of the boy, and the heaving sobs choked his utterance; but at length, as he wiped his eyes with the sleeve of his torn jacket, he added,—
               'They buried her last Sunday morning, sir, and now I've no friend on earth to care for me. Do take me with you, sir—oh, do; and you shall never see me do anything that is wrong. Oh, you will, I know you will.'
               The kind, sympathizing look of Capt. Wallet had given the boy an unusual degree of confidence, and as he closed, he dropped upon his knees, and with a supplicating look awaited the captain's answer. Little George had not long to wait, for the ship needed a boy, and Capt. Wallet at once agreed to take him into his service, with the understanding, however, that nothing should turn up to prove any of his statements false. Nothing of the kind occurred, and at the end of a week the good ship Cyclops was standing out from Boston harbor with George Brumford duly installed on board.
               For the first time since his remembrance George felt at home—his spirit of perseverance and industry had entered into an ample field for its development, and he felt that the wide world was all open before him, from any part of which he might draw food for the nourishment of his ambition. Ambition? Yes; young as was George Brumford, with but the suns of twelve summers yet upon his head, he felt an ambition to do, and to be, something worthy of the love and honor of his fellows. He had read of ancient heroes, and of their bold and daring deeds; and he had read, too, of the laurel wreaths with which those beloved and honored were wont to be crowned.
               The ship had crossed the equator, having thus far made a good passage; George had become used to the various peculiarities of shipboard, and by his good conduct and quick comprehension, his willingness and faithfulness, he had won the love of all. It was a pleasant evening—the first watch had been set, and after watching for some half hour the sparkling foam, as it was dashed in billowy wreaths from the bows, George went below and turned into his hammock. To and fro rocked the ship, and to and fro swung the orphan boy's canvass bed.—Gradually and gently crept the power of slumber over his senses, and ere long, as the external frame reposed from its cares, and the internal spirit began to move untrammelled, he was startled by the pressure of a hand laid lightly upon his shoulder. He turned his head and opened his eyes to behold the messenger; they rested upon a radiant form, youthful as the gentle spring, and bright as the full-orbed diadem of night, which smiled upon him from eyes and lips that looked not altogether strange; though when or where he had seen them before he could not divine.
               'George,' spoke the fair messenger, in a tone so silvery and sweet that it seemed the vibration of seraph-harps, 'to you fortune holds forth a rich store of her favors. They are far in the future, but nevertheless, if you tread the path of virtue and duty, they may be yours. Years must roll on into the ocean of eternal time—but far on, beyond the turmoil of a laboring life—beyond the steep and rugged path of hardship and danger, dwells the reward. Win it if you can.'
               As the spirit spoke, she held up in her hand a bright wreath of laurel, and eagerly, yet tremblingly, the sailor boy stretched forth his hand to grasp it. Tightly he clasped his fingers upon the vision, but no substance met his touch The spirit gazed upon him, and still she held up the wreath and smiled a heavenly smile; but the boy could reach nothing with his hand. He would have spoken, but his tongue refused him utterance, and as he strove in vain to ask but a single question, the bright phantom gradually wasted away into the dim rays of the hatchway lantern, and when he started forward and strained his eyes to assure himself that the visitor was gone, they rested upon nothing but the swinging hammocks of his shipmates.
               George Brumford laid his head again upon its resting place, and tried to call back the gentle spirit, but it was all in vain, and with a fervent prayer that his angel's promise might be verified, he was once more rocked to sleep.
               Simple in its foreshadowings, might have been that orphan's boy's vision; but for long years that same phantom seemed to hover o'er him, sometimes appearing to his enraptured gaze like an angel of light, and ever leading his feet along the path of duty.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               THE SHIPWRECK.
               THE Cyclops doubled the Cape of Good Hope with a fair wind, and all looked prosperous for the remainder of the voyage, and for a week after the cape had been cleared the old ship was wafted on by the southern trades towards her destination.
               It was on Sunday evening. The day had been unusually cool, from the fresh breeze that swept up from the Antarctic, but along towards the close of the day the wind gradually lulled, and ere the last dog watch was set an almost perfect calm had settled down over the vast expanse of the blue water, and with it came a warm and somewhat sultry influence upon the atmosphere. Heavy swells still rolled in from the south'ard, but beneath the dead calm in the heavens they wore the appearance of mountains of dark polished glass, and as the good ship was raised and lowered upon their uplifting and receding summits, she rocked to and fro like a drunken man. Her sails flapped against the masts, and the running rigging rattled and shook like the warp and woof of a weaver's loom. Just as the sun's lower disc dipped into the swelling ocean, Capt. Wallet came upon deck and looked anxiously around upon the scene.—There was something in his countenance, as he ascended the horse-block and gazed around upon the fiery horizon, that told of uneasiness. He was not a man to be scared at trifles, and as the men saw the dark cloud upon his countenance, they knew that danger of some sort was at hand. Long and earnestly he gazed upon the southern horizon, and then turning to his mate he said, in a low, tremulous voice, but which, nevertheless, reached every ear in the ship,—
               'Mr. Towne, we shall soon have a change in this weather.'
               'So I begin to fear, sir,' replied the mate, as he stepped upon the block. 'This air feels a little too light for my taste.'
               'Light!' returned the captain, while a perceptible shudder passed over his frame. 'Mr. Towne, the barometer has settled over three inches since four o'clock!'
               'Three inches!' iterated the mate.
               'Over three inches, sir!' said Capt. Wallet, while the corners of his mouth seemed to twitch from an excitement which he fain would have smothered. 'Only once before have I ever seen the mercury sink like that, and then—then—'
               'Well, sir,' uttered the mate, in breathless anxiety, as the captain shuddered and hesitated.
               The men had gathered around the spot, and silently awaited the captain's answer.
               'Then, Mr. Towne, I was a boy, on board the Carthage. It was in this same ocean, but nearly two thousand miles farther north. We had been in the monsoon for a week, but it was about breaking up, and one night it came on a calm like this—the barometer settled fearfully, and under bare poles we awaited the blast which all on board felt was sure to come. It did come, and ere midnight the Carthage was a total wreck, while twenty of her crew had found their graves! I was washed on shore upon one of the southern Maldives, and only one beside myself escaped. Say your prayers, my men, and then stand by to work; for God only knows how many of us shall see the sun again!'
               Just as the captain ceased speaking, the dark, fiery orb of day sank from sight, and a strange sensation of darkness and dread settled down upon the crew. The atmosphere had now become so light and rarified that it was with difficulty that the lungs could perform their natural functions. The men seemed to move in vacuum—the atmosphere which they inhaled seemed more like an invisible smoke than like the pure air of heaven, and as they expanded their lungs to their utmost capacity in hopeless anticipation of a free, invigorating breath, the organs of life seemed literally to collapse beneath the burdensome oppression.
               The sails were all snugly furled with the exception of the fore and main storm stay-sails, which latter were left, in hopes that when the gale did burst the ship might be got before it. The top-gallant and royal yards were sent on deck, the top-gallant masts unstayed and lowered, and the top-masts housed.
               'We may want those topmasts, sir,' suggested the mate, as Capt. Wallet gave the order for their being housed.
               'Wanted? What for?' said the captain.
               'With a heavy sea running we cannot certainly catch any steady wind upon the stay-sails, for the seas will break it,' answered Mr. Towne; 'and if we wish to lay-to we shall certainly need the top-sails.'
               'I wouldn't have a linen frock spread to that gale, when it comes, sir,' returned the captain. 'No, sir, you'll want no canvass for one night, you may depend. The staysails may lay upon the deck all clear for hoisting, but you'll not need them.'
               It was now/dark. Along the line of the western horizon there was still a streak of red, glaring light, but it served only to make the surrounding gloom more terrible. There were a few stars in the heavens, but the dull atmosphere seemed to have no power of receiving their beams, and though not a cloud was to be seen, yet the great ocean was black as ink.
               'A gale were better than this, at any rate,' observed Mr. Towne, as his lungs began to grow weak and fatigued.
               'You'll have it soon enough,' answered Capt. Wallet.
               'Hark!'
               This exclamation came from the man at the wheel, and in an instant all ears were bent to catch the sound that had arrested his attention.
               Far away to the south'rd rumbled and groaned the storm-giant. The loose rigging rattled, and the swinging blocks thumped, but above all was heard the rolling of the giant's chariot-wheels. The ship was luckily heading from it, and in breathless expectation the men waited its coming. Nearer and nearer came the storm, and louder and louder sounded the fearful howl. At length it burst upon the devoted ship!—Like the simultaneous crashing of ten thousand thunderbolts broke the fury of the storm god upon the struggling Cyclops, and for a few moments she plunged her noble bows into the foaming sea as if she would have at once driven down out of the reach of the gale. The men grasped the stout rigging for support, and for the time they feared that their ship would be driven under; but with a fearful struggle the noble bark once more raised her head from the water, and throwing the briny flood from her decks, she was borne along with the gale. Four men were lashed at the wheel, and for the time they managed to keep her before it.
               Capt. Wallet stood by the starboard mainbrace, a bite of which he had passed around his body, while near him, holding on to the lanyard of the main-topmast backstay, stood the mate. The men were all on deck, and as yet remained unharmed, with the exception of a few slight bruises which had been received when the storm first broke. To George Brumford the whole scene presented one grand diorama of magnificent grandeur. There was an awe pervading his soul, and a kind of mystic dread of the Almighty Power that hurled the fearful storm-bolt; but for him the gale—the breaking, dashing, surging seas, and the groaning, creaking timbers, had no dread. Death might be staring him in the face, but its terrors were lost in that higher, nobler feeling of nature's worship. Capt. Wallet possessed not the feelings of that boy. He knew too well the fate that hung over him, and his heart had sunk like a lump of lead in his bosom.
               As the ship was dashed along over the surging, boiling sea, she began to grow more steady in her movements, and so long as she could be kept before the wind there were slight hopes of her holding together. At length, as the ship threw her bows up upon the bosom of a huge sea, Capt. Wallet disengaged himself from the main-brace and gained the cabin ladder, and with a little difficulty he succeeded in gaining the cabin, where his lantern was still burning, though the floor was completely flooded. For about ten minutes he remained below, and when he came upon the deck the gloom upon his countenance wore a deeper shade, and the men at the wheel thought they heard him utter a prayer.
               'Mr. Green,' said he, as he approached the spot where the mate stood, and seized hold of the belaying pins, 'I fear our time has come!'
               'But we may ride it out yet,' returned the mate, seeming to give utterance to a sunken hope, rather than to express any present idea.
               'Yes, if we had the sea in which to ride,' uttered Capt. Wallet, with a renewed shudder.
               'Sea, sir?' gasped the mate, over whose mind a fearful truth was beginning to creep — 'And is there danger of the shore?'
               'I fear there is- This noon we were in latitude 32°, 40', and longitude 51°, 6', distant from Cape St. Henry about six hundred miles. Five hundred miles east-sou'-east of the cape there is a low island, to the westward of which makes out a long reef, and, as near as I can judge, that island is on the line of our present course.'
               'And how far?' asked Mr. Towne.
               'It was not over seventy-five miles this noon, and we cannot have made less than fifty miles since that time.'
               'Then may God have mercy on us,' murmured the mate; 'for no power on earth can aid us now. To think of veering in the gale would be utter madness.'
               'The only hope for us is in clearing that island,' said Capt. Wallet, 'and even that is a mere hair upon which to rest such a hope, for the moment we broach-to in the least we are gone.'
               This conversation had not been heard by the men, for the incessant and deafening roar of the gale, as it whirled and howled in unabating fury, swallowed up the words almost as soon as they were uttered; but still they knew that something more than the storm was at hand, for even through the darkness of the night they could make out the fearful manner of their two officers. Meanwhile George Brumford had gradually worked his way forward, and all fearless of the dashing spray, he climbed up over the heel of the bowsprit, and soon ensconced himself near the bunt of the fore-staysail.—He had not long been thus situated when he was started by the sound of a voice behind him.
               'Come down out o' that, George, or you'll be washed away!'
               The boy turned his head and beheld one of the men standing by the starboard night-head, who was making eager gesticulations for him to come down; but there were two reasons why George did not obey: In the first place he liked the awful grandeur of his present position, and then the task of going back by the way he had come was by no means an easy one; but the man did not call to him a second time, for a sound had struck upon his ear, and a sight had met his gaze, that put all thoughts of the boy from his mind. He turned his head aft, and placing his hands to his mouth, yelled forth that fearful word,—
               'Breakers!'
               Once more he turned his head towards the spot where the angry sea dashed and roared upon the threatening rocks, and then, seizing whatever came in his way for support, he hurried aft. Every ear had caught that fearful cry, and forgetting all else in the one idea of 'breakers ahead,' they leaped upon the rails wherever they could find a stay for support, and strained their gaze in the direction of the rocks. It needed but one look to reveal their doom. Right ahead, towering up through the darkness like night-born spirits of evil, were an array of foam-dashed rocks. All the sails in Christendom, had they been bent with cords of steel and sheeted home with triple-tempered metal, could not have saved that devoted ship. Not a rope was touched—not a sail was thought of; but with clasped hands and firmly set lips they awaited their fate.
               'Aft! aft! Lay aft!' shouted the captain, as the spray from the rocks actually rained upon the deck.
               Home, friends, kindred, father, mother, brother, sister, wife, and children hovered for a moment around the harrowed minds of the doomed seamen.—an earnest prayer went up to God. and then came the fearful stroke of the Death Angel! With a crash like the roaring of heaven's artillery the noble ship struck. High up between the opening jaws of two projecting cliffs was driven the bow of the Cyclops, and in an instant she was broken in sunder, and the next sea that came roaring on in its conscious might caught the stern in its bosom, tore the massive timbers in sunder like reeds, and bore its load of humanity away to a billowy grave!
               Alone sat little George upon the bowsprit Alone? No. By his side stood a bright form—the angel-robed phantom, who whispered, above the roar of the tempest and the dashing of the waves, 'be not afraid, my brother; I am with thee'
               
               Morning broke upon the scene of death and destruction. High up in a large crevice between two rocks reposed the form of the boy A numbness—a sensation of exhaustion, had possession of his frame, but still he was almost uninjured; for the bows of the ship had been fairly wedged into the crevice, and as the stern was almost immediately swept off, they had received but little further damage from the elements. The loosened condition of the fore-staysail had served to break the force of the concussion upon the frame of the boy, and with hardly a bruise upon his body he reposed upon his rough couch. As the sun rose and cast its first bright beams across the broad bosom of the Indian Ocean, George arose from his recumbent position and gazed about him. Far down below him, among the sharp, craggy rocks, lay strewed the fragments of the wreck, and as soon as a little exercise had somewhat loosened the stiffness of his limbs, he set about the work of clambering down among the pieces of the wreck. Oh! what a sight met his gaze! All about him lay the ghastly corpses of his kind shipmates! All, all, were there—and all were dead! The thanksgiving that had welled up from his soul sank back, and his heart beat with agony. He could feel no happiness—no joy—for he was alone—all alone! The friends of his bosom—all that he knew on earth—were gone forever! And as he gazed around upon the bruised and mangled remains of his companions, he almost wished that God had taken him also!
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               THE YOUNG MATE.
               OVER a period of ten years take we now the reader. It is a movement very easily performed by the writer, and one very easily followed by the reader; but what a vast river of life has flowed on and emptied into the ocean of eternity during that period! Ten years ago many a frail bark started forth upon the waters of life, with a fair wind, a smooth sea, and a clear sky; others there were that had been long upon the voyage, and were sailing prosperously on. But ten years have passed, and how many of them have been met by the storms and the winds, and while the looked-for haven was yet far ahead they have sank beneath the raging waves. Some have sailed out the wished-for voyage, entered the haven of eternal rest, furled their worn and tattered sails, and resigned the crumbling timbers of their earthly barks as they stepped upon the firm and unshaken pier of heaven. But, thanks to the Giver of all good, the poor shipwrecked mariner, though he may have met the howling blast in all its fury, and have been swept away into the dark realms of death, has still a chart and a compass by which to steer for the land of eternal spring, and there, where shines in all its glory the great light of the Immortal, may we all finally cast our anchors.
               The old ship Cyclops—peace to her shattered timbers—had almost passed from the memory of man, and the memory of her devoted crew dwelt only in the bosoms of a few George Brumford had been taken from the island by an English East Indiaman, and now, at the age of twenty-two, we find him second in command of one of the handsomest ships that ever spread canvass. The memory of a kind act—an act that saved his life when starvation upon a desolate island stared him in the face, and the uniform kind treatment he had met with at the hands of his new companions, served to warm his soul with love towards his benefactors, and hence it is no wonder that we find him contentedly quartered and rationed beneath the British flag.
               It was a pleasant day in the early part of summer, that the noble ship Lenox was preparing to leave Calcutta. She had on board, besides the crew, Lord Livingston and his wife, their son and daughter, and their servants. The former had been acting as Governor General of the British dominions in the Indies, but finding the duties more arduous, and the responsibilities more complicated, than he was willing to assume, he had resigned the commission, and was about to return to England. In his general manners, he was affable and easy, but nevertheless the consciousness of aristocratic and titled distinction was plainly visible in his slightest movements. His wife was, if anything, more set upon her notions of 'propriety' than her husband, while Richard, the son, seemed to care but little for sounding names so long as he could enjoy the world through the means of his father's wealth and power Jane Livingston, the daughter, was one of those rare exceptions, which are sometimes met with among the lordly families of the old world—who take people for what they are—who would stoop to pick up a pearl from the dirt, but pass in disgust by the rouge and tinsel that only glitters for the eye of fashionable society. She had seen the summers of eighteen happy years, with the bloom of health and good nature upon her countenance, and was the pride of her parents and her brother. That she was beautiful no one could deny—a single glance was sufficient to settle that point; but the deeper traits—the essentials of her character—that deep and pure love which she ever felt for the noble and the good—that spirit of benevolent charity that found a home in her bosom—that quick and bounding impulse which answered in smiles to others' happiness, or in tears to others' woes—and, withal, that queenly pride in virtue and true maidenly modesty—only became manifest to those who read deeper than the mere rounding and graceful turning of her form and features.
               Everything was in readiness and just after dinner Capt. St Clair told George Brumford that he might get the ship underweigh.
               'For,' he added, as he gave the order, 'the lighter which is about to return to the city must take back our reports to the agent, and they are not yet finished; so you may get the ship off as soon as you can, while I fill up the blanks in the returns.'
               'I think I shall go and help,' said Jane Livingston, as she started from her father's side with a light, ringing laugh. You like help, don't you, Mr. Brumford?'
               'Certainly, my lady,' replied George, with a bright smile, as he turned towards the fair speaker; and then taking his trumpet he started to ascend the ladder.
               'Stop, sir, stop,' exclaimed the buoyant hearted girl, as she hastily threw a silken mantle over her shoulders; 'if I am going to help you get your ship off, you must help me up this awkward ladder.'
               George Brumford extended his hand, and as Jane grasped it, he very politely handed her upon the deck. The touch of that fair, warm hand, and the beaming of those large sparkling eyes, would have sent a thrill of pleasure to the heart of a stoic, and it is no wonder that our youthful hero felt a peculiar sensation as he found himself the recipient of so much confidence from one so lovely. The whole voyage might have passed, and George would never have intruded himself, unbidden, upon the society of one whom he considered so far above him in point of rank and wealth; but now that the lady had so frankly offered her companionship, for the present, at least, he felt no hesitation in making himself agreeable, though it is no wonder that he experienced a kind of fluttering sensation at the heart every time he caught the bright rays that shot from the lustrous eyes beside him.
               Merrily sounded the cheerful song of the hardy sailors as they walked around the capstan. They were now heaving up the anchor for home, and the cable was walked in with a will. At length the larboard anchor was up, and the messenger was nippered to the cable of the starboard anchor. Again the song arose upon the passing breeze—around went the capstan, and ere long the anchor was reported to be a-peak.
               'Man the braces, fore and aft,' ordered George, as the bows of the ship were brought directly over the anchor. 'Haul home the larboard fore braces and the starboard braces aft. That's it.—belay. Now lay aloft and loosen the topsails.'
               While the men were engaged in obeying the last order George was called upon to explain to Jane the why's and wherefore's of the various operations.
               'Why do you have your yards turned different ways?' she asked, as she raised her fingers towards the point where the larboard fore and main yard-arms nearly touched each other.
               'Ah, my lady, you would baldly understand me were I to tell you.' replied the young officer, as he gazed with deferential admiration upon the eager features of his inquisitor.
               'Never mind that, Mr Brumford. I should like to have you tell me, nevertheless.'
               'With pleasure,' quickly answered George, who gazed rather longer into the smiling face of his companion than there was any need for. 'You see our ship now lays with her head exactly to the wind, and also that our true course is in the same direction.'
               'Yes.'
               'Well,—as soon as the anchor breaks ground we wish to cast to starboard and—'
               'Oh, fie, Mr Brumford,—do speak so I can understand,' interrupted Jane.
               There was something so free, so happy, in the whole manner of the fair girl, and she spoke with such unconstrained candor, that the young man stood for a moment like one entranced; but he immediately recollected himself, and replied,—
               'When I say, cast to starboard, I mean that we wish the ship's head to turn to the right.'
               'There, that sounds something like'
               'A little plainer, I suppose. Well as soon as the topsails are sheeted home and the yards hoisted, you see that the wind will strike upon the head sails in such a manner as to turn the ship in just the right direction, and then when we fill away we shall be able to make a good leg on the larboard tack.'
               'Oh, dear!—a good leg on the larboard tack! There, I'll give up, uttered the laughing girl, as she vainly endeavored to translate that last sentence.
               The attention of the mate was now called to the ship, and promising his fair companion that he would, when at leisure, explain it all, he turned to the men and proceeded with his orders. The topsails were sheeted home, the yards hoisted, and as the anchor broke from the ground the ship's head gracefully fell off to starboard, the after sails were filled, the gib hoisted and the helm righted.
               'But we don't sail any,' said Jane Livingston, as she watched for several moments the drawing sails.
               'Oh, no,' replied George, with a happy smile. 'You see that fore-topsail is receiving the wind upon its front surface, which tends to drive the ship astern, while the other sails operating in the opposite direction, just balance its tendency; but the moment those head yards are traced around the other way the ship will begin to go ahead. You understand that, don't you?'
               'Oh, yes,' answered the young girl, as she gazed upon the bellying canvass. 'Oh, how I should like to be a sailor.'
               'With no friends to cheer you but the rough sons of the ocean,' added George, while a kind of mournful expression shadowed his countenance.
               For a moment Jane gazed up into the face of her companion with an earnest, inquiring look. It may be that the moisture in her beaming eye gathered into a tear; but at any rate there was a mild, sympathetic expression in her features, and a sweet, meaning music in her tone, as she replied,—
               'I fear you do not set a full value upon the love of those rough sons of the ocean, Mr. Brumford. Ah, there is something deeper there than the mere gaudy trappings of society. I always feel that beneath the rough garb of the true-hearted sailor there sparkles the gem of a true and noble soul, and that a heart so inured to danger in all its forms must needs be one upon which a friend could lean for support in the hour of peril. Oh, I love to gaze upon their cheerful, honest countenances.'
               'You speak truly, lady,' returned George, while his nether lip trembled with a feeling he could not suppress; 'but—but—'
               'But what?' interrupted Jane, with a light, fleeting smile, as she saw her companion hesitate. 'Can you not vindicate yourself?'
               'Yes, lady I can explain what I feel. You speak truly when you say that the hardy son of the ocean has a heart upon which a friend may lean in the hour of peril—that he has a noble and true soul; but you fail to read the feelings that well up in the bosom of the ocean-child when his thoughts look forward into the future Your sex naturally look to the stout arm and true heart of man for support, and I thank God that there be some, like yourself, who can see a sparkling, brilliant, and eternal soul, even though it be vested in the rough habiliments of the sailor. But the true man—he whose aspirations and joys have the least tendency heaven ward, longs for a purer, a holier love than can be found upon the wild ocean. Ah, lady, when storm-tossed and wrecked, when driven about upon my ocean home, I have indeed found true and sympathizing friends; but oh, how my soul has yearned for a softer, a more tender bosom, where I might pillow my aching brow and weep my griefs away in the arms of confiding affection.'
               While George had been speaking Jane had kept her eyes fastened upon his noble features, but as he closed she turned away her head to hide an emotion which she herself did not define, nor would she perhaps, had she tried. The youth felt that the impulse of his feelings might have led him to say more than he ought, but, nevertheless, he had only given utterance to thoughts that ever pressed upon his heart, and in a tone somewhat subdued he added,—
               'I trust, lady, that what I have said may not be construed into ought that is undue.'
               Jane turned her large, beaming orbs full upon her companion, and was upon the point of reply when her father and mother appeared upon the deck. What she would have said remained unsaid, and often, during the next hour, as she turned her eyes towards the young officer, did she wonder why she hesitated to speak that answer while her parents were near.
               The papers were soon ready for the lighter, and as the messenger to whom they were entrusted stepped over the side, the head yards were braced around, the topgallant-sails set, the courses spread, and the Lenox started off upon her course for home.
               Not until the chill dampness of night began to load the atmosphere, did Jane Livingston leave the deck, and as she placed her foot upon the ladder, she cast one more look upon George Brumford, murmuring, as she did so.—
               'Can it be possible that I have seen that countenance before?'
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               THE PIRATE.
               IT is a long and tedious voyage from the Indies to England, and they who have en- tered on shipboard to perform it may set it down as a fixed fact, that the narrow confines of the ship is to be their dwelling place for nearly half the year. In the cabin of the Lenox there were Capt St Clair and his principal officer, Lord and Lady Livingston, Richard and Jane, besides Mr. Forman, a gentleman about fifty years of age, who had formerly been an extensive ship owner, but who, under reduced circumstances and an ill state of health, was now officiating as supercargo. My Lord Livingston loved his ease, and so he and Mr. Forman discussed the East India politics and played at chess. My lady, on the contrary, liked to be looking about, and Capt. St. Clair had to do the honors of her escort. Jane was left to the care of her brother and George Brumford, and thus matters seemed to be cleverly arranged for the voyage.
               George kept his promise with regard to instructing Jane in the various evolutions and technicalities of ship-board, and she proved an apt scholar, for more than once, after they had doubled the Cape of Good Hope, did she take the trumpet and issue the requisite orders for tacking the ship. As the notes of her silvery voice rang out upon the sweeping breeze the men worked with a will, and as the braces were all hauled home and the back-stays set up, she would resign her post with a triumphant look, and smile with a happy expression as she received the approbation of her tutor.
               That was a pleasant task for George Brumford; but ah! he found, ere long, that it was a dangerous one. The gentle being who was so often by his side was weaving a net around his soul that was not to be broken without much pain and anguish.
               The last dog-watch had been set, the sun had just sunk into its watery bed, and the bright moon was beginning to show its face high up in the heavens, where it had been paled by the king of day; but now that the more brilliant orb had gone, she came forth from her rest and let down her light upon the blue Atlantic. For some time George Brumford and Jane had been in conversation, but as the night air began to throw its chilly mantle over the water, the fair girl hade her companion good-night and sought the shelter of the cabin. For several moments after she had gone the young officer sat in deep thought, and just as he was upon the point of rising from the small stool he felt a hand laid upon his shoulder. He rose, and as he turned, his eyes fell upon Richard Livingston.
               'I hope I do not intrude,' said Richard, as he leaned up against the rail.
               'Not at all,' replied George. 'To me your company is always welcome.'
               'Mr. Brumford,' continued Richard, in a more sober and serious tone than he was generally in the habit of using, 'you must not be offended at what I may say. For some time I have desired to speak with you upon a very important subject, and I know of no better opportunity than the present for doing so.'
               'Anything that you may have to say will be taken kindly by me,' returned George, 'for I do not believe that you would utter it in any other manner.'
               'There you are right, sir; and now let us come to it at once. I have not been unmindful of the growing intimacy between yourself and my sister, and—'
               'Sir!'
               'Be patient,' uttered young Livingston, as he saw a cloud flit over the features of his companion. 'I have watched your intercourse, not with the eyes of an eaves-dropper, but with the eyes of a brother, and surely I cannot fail to see the tendency of it. Now I ask you as a man—and I trust you will answer as such—can you lay your hand upon your heart and say that there dwells there no other feeling towards that fair girl than that of mere friendship?'
               George met the gaze of his inquisitor, but for the moment he returned no answer. He could not say yes, and he dared not even acknowledge to himself the inability to say no. At length he said, in a half evasive sort of manner,—
               'What can I be to the daughter of England's proud noble?'
               'That is the very thing I would have asked you,' replied Richard, who had not failed to notice the effect of his question.
               'Mr Livingston,' said George, as he drew his companion farther away from the man at the wheel, 'you can hardly read, or appreciate the feelings of one like myself. From my earliest youth I have been at the mercy of the winds and waves, with no companions save the rough, untutored sailors, no home but the rude ship and with no sources of hope and aspiration save the field of drudging commerce. The smiles of kind parents never warmed my manhood's heart, nor do I remember of one bright hour beneath the roof of my early childhood's home. The love of brother and sister were never mine, and I know not that beneath the arching blue of yonder heavens there dwells a human being that could claim kindred of me. When I first saw your sister, and she spoke kindly to me—when she laughed at my joys and looked sad at the recital of my sorrows—it seemed as though a new and brilliant sun had risen o'er my pathway My heart bounded in her presence, and beneath the happy smile of her soft blue eye I felt a new and delicious joy,—I have basked in the sunlight of her smiles, and dwelt in rapture upon the mellow tones of her voice. In a few short weeks we shall separate, and the poor child of the ocean will once more be alone. Whatever may be the feelings that have grown up in my bosom towards the gentle girl whom God has given you for a sister, they shall never escape from my lips, but deep in my soul let them lie, and in after years I may sometimes call them forth from their hiding place and dwell anew in the joys of their never-fading memory. She is a noble girl, and may God, in his o'ershadowing kindness, ever give her friends as true and as faithful as I could have been had fortune found me in a station where I might aspire to serve her. I can be nothing to her. Jane Livingston will soon forget the companion of her voyage, and if there be sorrow at parting 'twill all fall upon my own heart.'
               A bright tear glistened in the young man's eye as he ceased speaking, and instinctively he turned away to hide it. He did not notice the pearly drop that glided down the cheek of his companion, for he thought only of the picture he had drawn to his own imagination. Richard Livingston had been deeply moved, for he had a good, kind heart, and he knew full well that wealth and power could never make a more noble man than was he who stood beside him. Half a dozen ejaculations came in succession to his lips, but he repressed them, and at length laying his hand upon his companion's arm, he said,—
               'George—'
               The youth started as he was addressed thus familiarly, and turned toward the speaker.
               'I fear you are deceiving yourself.'
               'Deceiving myself?'
               'Yes.'
               'In what respect?'
               'Think you that my sister possesses not a heart as tender and susceptible as your own?'
               'How?—your sister?—' ejaculated George, half vacantly and half wildly, as he gazed into the face of young Livingston. 'Do you mean—No, no,—that cannot be.'
               'What cannot be?'
               'That your sister could ever feel ought towards me than a mere friendship. No, no,—one so highly born could not feel in any other manner towards the friendless orphan.'
               'George Brumford,' returned Richard, in a deep meaning tone, 'the distinction of title and wealth may turn the head, and dazzle the eye, and govern with an iron will the overt acts of men and women, but the heart—the true spirit of the soul—bows not to its power. My father and mother know no other standard of worth but rank and fortune, and they think all others must be like them. To them the idea of their daughter's forming an attachment below her station would be too absurd for consideration; but I have looked deeper into the soul, and I fear that the heart which has stood unmoved before the batteries of fashion and lordly rank has at length opened its portals to the image of one who is as poor and friendless as yourself.'
               'Do I understand you rightly,' almost whispered George, while his heart leaped wildly in his bosom.
               'There is no need of concealing the truth from you,' answered Richard, 'for I think I may trust in your own honor to act as becomes your duty. My sister does love you, for I can read it in her every look and action.'
               George Brumford turned away from his companion to hide the struggle that worked up into his features. With a trembling eye and a throbbing heart he gazed upon the spot where hung in the heavens the round, full moon. For a few moments he stood thus, but during those few moments a new world seemed to open before him, and at length, with a heart once more settled beneath a firm resolve, he turned towards his friend, and laying his hand upon his arm, he said,—
               'I understand what you mean, and you may trust in my honor; but oh! God forbid that the bright vision which has been this night raised to my soul should be forever swept away; and if, in years to come, I can raise myself to a rank equal with your own, in point of wealth and influence. I may then dare to speak what I must now keep in silence.'
               'I trust you may not be disappointed,' frankly said Richard, as he grasped the hand of the young officer. 'I have spoken thus freely that you might know upon what ground you stood, and I trust that during the remainder of our voyage you will be on your guard and not let the feelings of your heart find utterance in words And now,' continued he, as he seated himself upon a stool and motioned for George to do the same, I should like to ask you a question I have no desire to flatter, but still I cannot help wondering much that one who was reared as you have been, should be so thoroughly versed in all the branches of education, and have attained to the highest order of true gentility.'
               'Ah, sir,' returned George, with a smile, 'I have that within me which has ever urged me on, and even when a boy—when I packed up in a small handkerchief all my worldly effects, and started forth alone and friendless upon the wide world,—a spirit of ambition led my eyes to something above the mere drudge of earth.'
               'And that ambition has been your only incentive to action.'
               'Not alone,' returned George. 'You may smile when I tell you that for years a strange vision has seemed to hover o'er me, and that often I have seen it—'
               'In your dreams, I suppose.'
               'No,—I have seen it in moments when my senses were as wakeful as they are at this present time. The first time I saw it was years ago, when it approached my hammock and bade me struggle on, and assured me that fame was mine in the future. The next time I saw it was on that fearful night that saw the poor Cyclops dashed to pieces upon the rocks, when I was the only soul that out-lived the storm. In my desire to behold the grandeur of the storm I had continued to perch myself upon the bowsprit, somewhat secured by the bunt of the fore-staysail, and regardless of all danger, there I sat and received the breaking seas without fear. They called for me to come down, but to my seemingly perilous situation did I owe my safety, for when the ship struck, her bows were wedged in between the jaws of two cliffs, and thus I escaped the death that came upon all the others. On that fearful night, while the ship was being dashed madly towards the rocks, that same angel visitant sat beside me upon the bowsprit, and even now I can hear the words she whispered in my ear—"Be not afraid, my brother, I am with thee" But what ails thee?' exclaimed George, as he saw his companion tremble and start.
               'Nothing, nothing,—go on.'
               'Well, that spirit has had much influence over me, and many a time, when my heart has been bowed down by grief, those mild blue eyes have beamed upon me from the darkness, and I have taken fresh courage, and moved on.'
               'How long ago was it that you were wrecked in the Cyclops?'
               'Just ten years ago the first of the present month.'
               'That is strange—very strange,' murmured Richard Livingston, as he seemed buried in his own thoughts, 'Jane must be right, after all.' Then turning to his companion, he asked,—
               'Do you remember nothing of your parents?'
               'Of my father I remember nothing, excepting a faint scene of death, and even that I think I gathered from my mother's account. Of my mother all I know is, that she died while I was in my twelfth year, and I saw them bury her in the cold ground. She had not a penny in the house when she died, and so I came penniless forth upon the world. But what means your strange conduct? What is there in my short recital that thus moves you?'
               'There is much—much,' returned Richard, as he gazed fixedly into the face of our hero.
               George was upon the point of urging further inquiry upon a subject that had thus become excitingly interesting, when he was startled by the cry of one of the men who was at that moment throwing the log;—
               'Sail ho!'
               The mate started to his feet and sprang aft, and following the figure of the man who had discovered it, he distinctly made out a large brig just crossing the ship's wake. He called for his night-glass and was soon able to get a good view of the stranger. The only thing that puzzled him was, how she could have got so near without being before discovered. The bustle upon deck had started up those from the cabin, and in a few moments the captain came upon deck, followed by Lord Livingston and Jane. St. Clair took the glass from George, and as the latter stepped back, a fearful look flitted across his features. The brig was not more than half a mile distant, and by the aid of the powerful glass, beneath the light of the full moon, she could be very plainly made out. She had already hauled upon the wind, and was fast coming up.
               'Is there danger?' tremblingly asked Lord Livingston, as the captain lowered the glass.
               'If a heavy pirate is dangerous, then I fear there is,' returned the captain.
               'A pirate!' cried Jane, springing instinctively towards George and grasping him by the arm.
               At that instant a bright wreath of flame poured out from the brig's bows, and a heavy shot came whizzing over the ship's deck. Jane was carried half fainting below, and all hands were called to quarters.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               THE CONFLICT.
               AFTER all that has been written and spoken about pirates, very few of those who never experienced the sensation can form any idea of the feelings of the poor seaman who, upon the trackless, open ocean, find a swift-winged, blood-thirsty buccaneer at their heels.
               Some may denounce the practice of writing about pirates at all, but if they will only remember that from the first date of marine architecture up to the present time, the high seas have constantly been the scene of their depredations, they will see that the subject is one which cannot always be passed over in silence. It forms a dark page in the great book of Humanity, and its details are chilling to the soul; but there it is—one of the marring blots that disfigure the history of God's children, and like all things else in the physical world, we must take it as we find it, trusting that in the course of human progress the whole dark sea of crime and degradation shall be swallowed up in the eternal ocean of ultimate perfection.
               'That's an ugly customer,' said Capt. St. Clair to his mate, after all hands had been called.
               'And one which I fear we shall not so easily overcome,' returned George.
               'Her decks are full of men, and I can even see the glitter of their knives and pistols in the bright moonbeams,' continued the captain, as he strained his eyes in the direction of the brig.
               Just as the captain ceased speaking another shot came whizzing over the deck followed all most instantly by the sharp report of a long brass gun. St. Clair started towards the wheel, and then turned again to the quarter.
               'Something must be done, and that, too, immediately,' said he, 'for we cannot stand the pirate's shot.'
               'There is certainly no use in attempting to run,' remarked George, 'for then we should be riddled and slain without the least chance of defence. You have six men servants, I believe, Lord Livingston.'
               'Yes,' replied his lordship.
               'And can they fight?'
               'Five of them have been bred to little else but fighting since they were boys.'
               'Well,' said George, after a moment's thought, 'we have thirty-five men belonging to the ship, besides the captain and myself. Your men will make forty-one, and then we of the cabin will swell the list up to forty-six, and well armed at that. I think we had better heave-to.'
               Another shot came dashing through the starboard quarter boat, and the splinters flew about like hail.
               'That must be stopped,' exclaimed Richard Livingston. 'The cabin may take the next one.'
               The wind was nearly west, and the Lenox had it upon her larboard beam, while the pirate, having crossed the ship's wake to the leeward, was coming up with a good free wind upon the larboard tack.
               'Down with the helm and let her come up,' cried the captain. 'Stand by to lay the maintopsail aback.'
               In a few moments the heavy topsail was laid to the mast, and the ship stopped in her course. The movement had brought the brig directly astern, and in a few minutes she would be alongside. Every man was armed with two heavy boarding pistols and a cutlass, and as our friends looked around upon the crew, who stood calmly awaiting the contest, they began to take hope, for the sides of the ship were high, and the pirates might have some difficulty in boarding. Twenty-four muskets stood by the mainmast ready loaded with double shot and slugs, and, take it all in all, the old Lenox did not present a very easy subject for conquest.
               'She will lay along under the main and mizzen weather rigging,' said George, as he noticed that the brig had luffed two or three points. 'Secure your pistols, my men, and take the muskets. Lay low under the bulwarks and stand by to fire the moment you hear the order. Take good aim, now, and fall back the moment you have discharged your pieces.'
               The men were carefully arranged along under the bulwarks between the main and mizzen rigging with their muskets ready, while the officers, armed to the teeth, and the rest of the crew, were alone visible from the deck.
               The pirate's long jib-boom came sweeping up under the weather quarter, and with her decks crowded with blood-thirsty looking wretches, she presented no very pleasing sight. Her long brass gun amidships shone like burnished gold in the moonbeams, and the smaller guns which graced her sides were of a stern looking character.
               'Ship ahoy!' shouted some one from the low deck of the brig. 'What ship is that?'
               'The Lenox, of Liverpool,' returned Capt. St. Clair.
               All the men, excepting those twenty-four who were laying below the bulwarks, were leaning half negligently over the rail, with their weapons out of sight, so that the pirates naturally supposed they saw all hands thus gazing upon them.
               'If you have no objections we will come on board,' said the pirate, as he gave the order for his helm to be put up.
               'I don't know as we can prevent you from boarding us,' returned St. Clair, 'though we are fully aware of your character and designs; but if you offer us any violence you may rest assured that we shall resist it.'
               A mocking laugh was the only answer to this threat, and in a moment more the brig's side touched the ship. Seventy-five savage looking wretches stood ready to jump as soon as they were laid alongside.
               'Stand by!' uttered George, in a suppressed tone, as the pirates were huddled well together, totally unconscious of the rod that was in store for them — 'Fire!'
               In an instant the musketeers were upon their feet and their pieces levelled. They knew that all depended upon the execution of their first fire, and with a cool, deliberate aim, they discharged their bullets and slugs into the dense mass of living beings that thronged the deck of the brig, and then laying back their now useless muskets, they drew their cutlasses and pistols, and a waited the onset.
               Fiendish and horrible were the oaths and yells of the pirates as they received the death-dealing fire of the Lenox's men, and springing upon the rail of their vessel they seized the ship's rigging, and began to make their way up over the bulwarks. Twenty, at least, of their number, had been either killed or utterly disabled, so that their boarding force was considerably diminished. The first man that showed his head above the mizzen chains was shot down by George Brumford, and for several moments the boarders were successfully repelled, but the pistols were soon all discharged, and then the pirates began to work their way over the bulwarks. They were well used to the work before them, and with their long cutlasses they managed to defend themselves against the English seamen till they gained the ship's deck; but they gained it at their cost, for beneath the well aimed blows of the hardy seamen many of them dropped lifeless upon the deck as soon as they gained it.
               It is doubtful if the pirates would have boarded, had they been aware of the reception that was in store for them, until they had first disabled the ship and crew with their guns; but it was now too late to retreat, and with the desperation of men who had been schooled in deeds of blood, they fought their way. They had, however, a foe to deal with who could fight as well as themselves. The Englishmen's lives were at stake;—thoughts of home, of kindred and friends, flitted through their minds, and with souls nerved for the contest they grasped their weapons with a firmer grip and met the enemy.
               George Brumford was the presiding genius of the conflict. Death followed the sweep of his heavy cutlass as fall the forest trees before the power of the giant whirlwind. A thousand soul seemed swelling in his bosom, while from each his arm appeared to take strength. Jane Livingston was in danger.—should the ship be captured, a fate ten thousand times worse than death must be hers! The bare thought nerved his arm, and with a cool, but resolute purpose, he went sweeping on his way.
               Twelve of the Lenox's men had fallen; but the pirates had lost more than twice that number. At length the pirates retreated to the forecastle, where they formed a solid front, while those in the rear began to load their fire-arms. They even now outnumbered the ship's crew, and for a moment our hero began to tremble for the result. The fighting had somewhat abated, for the men seemed mutually agreed to take breath. George was just in the act of dropping the point of his reeking cutlass to the deck when he was aroused by a voice from the cabin companion-way, and on turning he beheld the head of Mr. Forman just visible above the combings, whom he had missed some time before from the deck.
               'Mr. Brumford,' said the supercargo in a hurried manner.
               'Sir?'
               'Come nearer.'
               George approached.
               'The muskets are all loaded!'
               'Muskets!—Loaded!' iterated George, as he started forward and gazed down the companion-way.
               'All double-shotted and primed,' returned Mr. Forman.
               George comprehended it all in a moment, and the sight that met his gaze infused a new spirit into his soul. At the foot of the ladder stood Jane Livingston, with the muzzles of a dozen muskets resting upon her arms, while a flush of conscious pride irradiated her features as she stood thus armed for the defence of her fellows.
               'Aft, aft, here! Quick, my men, quick!' exclaimed George, as he motioned to his men with his cutlass. 'Leap into the cabin, Harrold, and you, too, Vandmar, and pass up the muskets. Quick, Mr. Forman.'
               The pirates discovered this movement too late, for ere they could again break up their body and mix with their enemies, the muskets were aimed at their breasts.
               'Steady, my men,' cried George. 'Be sure of your mark. Let each take his opposite man. Fire!'
               At the word the twenty-four muskets again rang out their death-peal. The aim had been sure, and as the smoke cleared away the hearts of the Englishmen leaped with joy. The pirates were clambering over the bulwarks upon the bowsprit of their own vessel! With a shout that rent the air the merchantmen seized their cutlasses and sprang forward. The conquered buccaneers bad many of them already gained the deck of their own vessel, and those who were yet left behind immediately leaped overboard as they saw the men rushing towards them.
               'Cast off the grapplings fore and aft,' shouted George, as the ship's deck was clear of the bloody wretches. 'Man the lee main braces and give the main-topsail to the wind. Up with the helm and let her fall off. Stand by to set the mainsail'
               These orders were soon obeyed, and ere long the noble ship turned her head away from her enemy and started off. The men feared that the pirate might, out of revenge, fire upon the ship; but they seemed to be too busy in attending to their own wounded companions, and in counting their loss. At any rate, the Lenox made the best of her way out of the neighborhood of the pirate, and the latter evinced no disposition to give further trouble.
               The hardy seamen felt thankful for their deliverance, but a dark shadow of gloom rested upon their features as they gazed upon the cold corpses of the twelve brave fellows who had gone! The beams of the moon, which had now nearly reached its ocean bed in the west, fell aslant their pale forms, and with silent sorrow the survivors stood and gazed upon them, while the tears, which no feeling of self could have called forth, now rolled unbidden down their sun-browned cheeks.
               Jane Livingston came trembling upon the deck and fell almost fainting into the arms of her brother. During the conflict her nerves had been strung to their utmost tension, but now that it had passed, the unwonted strength that had supported her left her limbs, and with a wildly beating heart she leaned heavily upon the bosom of Richard.
               'You are safe, Jane,' said the young man, as he saw his sister open her large eyes and look up into his face.
               'And is he safe?' murmured she.
               'Our father has not been harmed.'
               'But Geo— Mr. Brumford?'
               'Safe, safe, my sister,' returned Richard, while a meaning shade passed over his features.
               The young mate heard that question—he marked the tone in which it was put, and he heard the 'thank God,' that trembled upon her lips when she heard her brother's answer. He would have given worlds to have sprang forward and clasped the gentle being to his bosom, but he remembered his promise, and stood silently gazing upon her heavenly, moon-lit features.
               'Mr. Brumford,' exclaimed Lord Livingston, at that moment stepping forward and grasping the young man's hand, 'You have behaved nobly, bravely, and you shall receive something more than mere thanks for it.'
               'I have tried to do my duty, sir,' modestly replied George, 'and if I have been instrumental in saving the lives and happiness of yourself and family, I am doubly rewarded.'
               'But it lays in my power to give you a more tangible reward, and you shall have it, too,' said Lord Livingston, as he continued to shake his young companion by the hand.
               'You, sir?' almost gasped our hero, while a dim vision of some half-defined hope flitted through his mind.
               'Yes,—me,' returned the old lord. 'I have as much influence with the Admiralty as any man in England, and you shall have a commission that shall do you honor.'
               At any other moment than this George's heart would have leaped with joy at such an offer, but something had whispered into his soul a hope even higher; but in an instant he saw how foolish had been the feeling, and crushing it at once, he expressed his warmest thanks for the kind offer.
               The ship was now once more upon her course, and the decks were cleared up, while the pirate was just distinguishable in the distance standing to the eastward before the wind. The bodies of the unfortunate men who had fallen were washed and sewed within their hammocks, and with uncovered heads the men had gathered around the weather gangway to pay their last tribute of respect to the dead. A dozen boards were laid across the rail, upon which were placed the shrouded bodies, and as soon as all was prepared Capt. St. Clair stepped forward to perform the funeral service.
               The eastern horizon was glowing with the warm tints of approaching day as the prayer was read, and at the instant when the cold remnants of mortality slid forth to their watery grave, the first golden beams of the sun came dancing o'er the ocean and kissed the cold shroud ere it disappeared forever!
               The seamen beheld the scene, and as they silently departed from the gangway, they felt that the freed spirits of their fellows were imaged in that golden sunbeam that hung o'er their burial place!
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               THE CONFESSION.
               WITHOUT anything further to mar the evenness of the voyage the Lenox arrived safely in Liverpool. Lord Livingston and his family had taken up their quarters for the time being at one of the hotels, and were soon to leave for London. One evening, about a week after the arrival of the Indiaman, George 
                     Brumfoad
                     Brumford
                   wended his way towards Lord Livingston's hotel, and upon his arrival desired of the servant to see his lordship, at the same time tendering his card. In a few moments the servant returned and desired George to follow him. At the door of a sumptuous apartment the waiter stopped and ushered the young man in. The only inmate was Jane Livingston.
               'Good evening, Mr. Brumford, said the fair girl, as our hero entered.
               'Ah, good evening. Is your father in?'
               'No, sir; both he and my mother have gone out; but I expect them back ere long.'
               'Then I may as well wait,' remarked George, with a light smile, as he took a chair near the lounge upon which the young lady had reposed herself.
               When our hero first entered the apartment he had expected that he should at least succeed in making himself agreeable; but alas, he found that the companionship of Jane Livingston on board his own ship was a far different affair from the same companionship under the present circumstances, and for some time he remained in silence. That silence, however, was not the result of an inability to converse, nor yet of any natural diffidence; but as the young man sat there, in the presence of one whom he so deeply loved, and to whom he had not yet breathed a word of his passion,—one who was so far above him in rank and wealth that it seemed almost a sin against his own heart to love her—he could not but feel embarrassed. During the few moments that that silence continued a thousand thoughts rushed through the young man's mind. The conversation that he had held with Richard was uppermost, and each word that the brother of her who now sat beside him had uttered, seemed to sound in his ears as though the vibration from the lips that uttered them had not yet ceased.
               But the silence was becoming oppressive, and turning to his fair companion he remarked,—
               'Really, my lady, you must think my company very agreeable and entertaining; but if I may appear too reserved you will not, I am sure, attribute it to aught but the right cause.'
               'And what might that cause be?' asked Jane, while a twinkling smile played over her features at the ambiguous remark of her companion.
               George saw that he was not sufficiently schooled in fashionable twaddle to talk anything but the feelings which sprang from the heart, and so he very wisely resolved to be honest and straight-forward.
               'I will tell you,' he replied to his fair inquisitor,—'our acquaintance was formed under circumstances where the result was unavoidable. Confined by the narrow limits of ship-board intimacies are cultivated from the very demands of the social nature. The heart must have a companion, and the soul must have an ear for its outpourings of wonder, and its admiration of the sublime and beautiful; but when the circumstances under which they were formed have passed away, it may be that the seeming equality, which gave the friendship its charm, goes with them. The Lady Jane Livingston in the aristocratic and titled circles of English society is not the Jane Livingston of the long and tedious sea voyage.'
               There might have been a smile upon the ruby lips of the young girl as George ceased speaking, but it instantly passed away, and while a slight quivering of the muscles around the corners of the mouth were perceptible, she replied.—
               'Jane Livingston is Jane Livingston, and neither the society of the metropolis nor the circumstances of a sea voyage can make a friend for her—they come from the hands of God, already fashioned after the standard of Him who drew his first breath amid the beasts of the stall, and breathed his last upon the cross; and circumstances can neither make nor unmake them.'
               'So speaks the heart,' uttered George, hardly aware of what he said, so busy was he with the rich melody that still floated o'er his soul.
               'Aye,' replied Jane, 'it is the heart that speaks. Ah, Mr. Brumford, did we oftener follow the dictates of that faithful monitor, how much brighter would be the path of life. God grant that my heart never be crushed beneath the lumbering weight of the o'er-ballanced head.'
               'There is one fact that seems to escape your notice,' said George. 'Those who form the great social world, so far as the movements of that society are concerned, seem to recognize no such thing as a heart. Custom, fashion, and the emblazonry of titles and lordly honors, take the reins, while the heart—the sensitive, shrinking heart, that dares not meet the jeers of a cold, senseless world, must perforce lay quietly in its narrow prison house,—or, if it beat at all, it does so only to give itself additional pain. And, lady, this state of things is not confined here,—or, at least, its influence is not. The weary pilgrim upon the sun-scorched desert will not repose upon the oasis, whose verdure may be as brilliant to the eye as that which blooms upon your own native hills and vales, if the water which flows from them offers nothing but poison to his parched lips.'
               'What you say of our society is too true,' replied Jane, who seemed to be growing rather more serious. ''Tis true that the great heart of Christianity beats not within our social circles; but there are hearts within those circles as free from the contamination as be those that beat around the hearth of the lowliest peasant.'
               'I believe you, lady,' uttered George.
               The young man had intended to have said more, but the words were too heavy—too bold, for immediate utterance, and so he waited to consider them longer. The pledge he had given to Richard Livingston had been fulfilled,—the voyage had been performed, and he had not spoken to the gentle being one word of the fire that burned within his soul; but now he was free to speak, and ere the present opportunity should pass he desired to know his fate. At length he drew his chair nearer to his companion, and while a deep flush suffused his face he tremblingly said,—
               'You must pardon me, lady, for the liberty I am about to take, and if I should chance to offend, let the assurance that the offence shall never be repeated be a full reparation.'
               'George Brumford must be wonderfully changed by contact with the land, if he should take a liberty which could offend his friends,' said Jane, as she gazed up half smilingly into the young man's face.
               'Perhaps the overflowing heart might utter forth words that the wisdom of the head would have kept silent, lady.'
               'Then let the heart speak,' said Jane, as her eyes fell to the floor.
               For a few moments George gazed in silence upon the fair form before him, and then, with a voice tremulous from the deep emotions of the soul, he poured forth his thoughts;—
               'Lady, there is no need that I should recount the events of the past six months, for you must well remember them; but upon my heart they are impressed in characters deep and lasting. From youth to manhood I knew nothing of life but the cold, rough battle with the storms and tempests, and, save the ambition that dwelt within my soul—the hope that sometimes held its lamp before my darkened way, I knew no actual joys. Most men, when enveloped in clouds and surrounded by storms, can look back upon the past and dwell in joy upon the memory of a happiness that was once their own,—they can dwell once more amid the friends of youth—amid the happy scenes of childhood. But such joys were never mine. The past afforded me no pleasant scenes—upon the picture of my memory there were no bright and soul-cheering lights; but to the future alone could I look for rational joy. Hope—sometimes bright, and sometimes burning dimly in its socket—led me on. At length a bright sun arose upon my path, and with a heart leaping with joy I basked in its warm beams. You, lady, were the first to warm into life the pure and holy feelings that had long lain latent in my heart. In vain was it that reason forbade the feeling—in vain was it that I tried to overcome the passion that might be only a consuming fire to the soul that gave it a home. But my heart knew no reason but that one deep feeling of passionate love, and uncontrolled I let it wander on in its flowery path. From the first hour of our acquaintance, lady, I have loved you as none but a pure, unoccupied heart can love, and now, that we are about to separate, I would fain know if the gentle hope that has fluttered before me is to be crushed forever.'
               'About to separate,' exclaimed Jane, as she brushed away a starting tear and gazed inquisitively into the face of her companion.
               'Yes, lady.'
               'But I thought you accompanied us to London.'
               'No. Your father has already obtained me a commission as a lieutenant in the British Navy, and I am to proceed at once to Portsmouth.'
               'But you will visit us. You will not surely—'
               Jane did not finish the sentence, for under the impulse of feeling she was upon the point of saying more than she had intended. George marked the starting tear and the heaving bosom of the fair girl, and gently taking her hand within his own, he said,—
               'Tell me, lady,—has my heart loved in vain?'
               Jane Livingston gazed for a moment up into the face of her companion, and then, while her eyes beamed with a pure and holy light, she murmured,—
               'I cannot deceive myself, and neither will I attempt to deceive you. I do love you, and I feel no shame in owning it.'
               'Oh, thank God for this, 'ejaculated the enraptured youth, as he raised the fair hand which be held to his lips, 'and may He grant that my highest hopes for earth shall end in fruition.'
               'Let not what I have said inspire you with too much hope,' said Jane, as she struggled to keep down the emotion that was rising in her bosom. 'To that society which you have pictured I owe nothing, but to my parents I owe everything, and I need not tell you what will most assuredly be the decision of my father.'
               'I know what you would say,' interrupted George, 'and I know full well the obstacles that lay in my path; but Hope, bright and beautiful Hope—shall light me on, and while my arm retains its strength, and my heart its integrity, I will not despair.'
               At that moment the sound of footsteps was heard upon the stairs, and in a moment more Lord and Lady Livingston entered the apartment. George arose and greeted them cordially, and from the old gentleman he received a warm welcome in return.
               'I am sorry that I disappointed you,' remarked Lord Livingston, as he took a chair, 'but I trust you have not been impatient.'
               'Oh, not in the least,' replied George.
               'Business called me out,' continued Livingston, 'but I am rather pleased, than otherwise, that it did, for I have obtained a grand chance for you. You have been appointed to the second lieutenantcy of a noble frigate now lying at Spithead, and in three days the sloop-of-war now in the harbor will take you on board.'
               George expressed his gratitude in the warmest terms, and shortly after he arose to take his leave.
               'Whenever you have opportunity,' said Lord Livingston, as George was about to go, 'I desire you to remember that my house is always open to you.'
               With a heart in which the emotions of hope and fear each strived for the mastery, George Brumford stepped forth upon the pavement The words of Jane rang in his ear with a sweet sound, but the iron will of Lord Livingston rose like a dark cloud over the future.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               THE STRANGER.
               ON the third day from that on which George received his commission, he had every thing prepared for going on board the sloop-of-war. It was with a heavy heart that he took leave of his old shipmates, for they were firm and true friends, as had been proved by years of toil and danger passed together. Those were stern and stout hearts that were gathered around the quarter-deck of the old Lenox on the afternoon that George took his leave, but they beat with a keen pain as their young mate bade them his final farewell, and the eyes that followed him over the gangway were wet with tears. He had left behind him a circle of true and faithful souls, and each one of those hardy seamen would have shed the last drop of his blood in defence of the brave youth. He cast one last, lingering look over his shoulder at the noble ship that had so long been his home—he saw the men gazing tearfully after him—then turning quickly away to hide the tears that were gathering in his own eyes, he strode up into the town.
               Poor George! His soul indeed felt sad; but he knew not then how soon he might need those true hearts and stout arms he had left behind.
               It was near nightfall when George entered his hotel, and hardly had he laid aside his coat and hat when one of the servants handed him a note. It bore the seal of Lord Livingston, and hastily breaking it open, he read as follows:—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "GEORGE BRUMFORD:—When you receive this we shall be on our way to London, and ere many hours afterwards you will have entered on your new field of duty. For your many acts of kindness, and your uniform gentlemanly conduct you have my warmest thanks. The Navy affords an ample field for the development of your talent, and also offers to your ambition a station of rank and power; and the opportunity which is thus afforded you may be a small mark of my esteem. When I last saw you, I offered you a welcome to my house at any time you might make it convenient; but I trust you will not blame me if I now inform you that circumstances have since come to my knowledge which render it absolutely necessary that I should retract that invitation. Your own knowledge of what has transpired between yourself and the Lady Jane, will forestall the necessity of further explanation.
                           'With the best wishes for your prosperity,
                           
                              'I remain yours,
                              'LIVINGSTON.'
                              
                                 To Lieutenant Geo. Brumford,
                                 H. B. M. Naval Service.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               'And thus end all my hopes!' murmured the stricken youth, as he read for the second time Lord Livingston's epistle. 'Thus is the bright vision of the future faded away into utter darkness! Oh, why did I ever see her?—why did my blind heart receive the image of one so far above me? But she has loved me—she has told me so. Ah! so much the worse, for she must suffer with me.'
               Thus spoke George Brumford to himself as he walked to and fro across the apartment.—The blow he had received came not like a thunderbolt upon him; but it more nearly resembled the sting of the fatal asp—a 
                     numbess
                     numbness
                  , an utter unconsciousness of everything around, and an utter prostration of heart and soul. The narrow confines of the apartment seemed too hot and oppressive, and putting on his hat and coat he sought the cool air of the street.
               In a state of mind not easily described, the youth wandered on towards the docks. Since that night on which he had learned from Richard Livingston that Jane loved him, he had learned to live in the sunlight of the bright hope, that arose like a luring angel before him, and when he had that assurance from her own lips, the hope grew brighter, and his whole future had been given up in trust to the bright vision thus created. But what a death blow had come upon him! The gentle being who had been the first and only one to warm his heart into a deep, devoted love, could never be his. He felt it—he knew it. The proud noble would never consent to such a union, and his own proud soul would never wrench from the parents the allegiance of their daughter, nor would he harbor the thought of persuading the idol of his heart to do aught that might alienate the affections of those to whom she owed her birthright.
               George had walked on for some time without knowing or caring whither he was going. The air was somewhat cool and bracing, but yet not uncomfortably so, and as the gentle moon, in its first quarter, shed a softening, mellow light around, the youth seemed to revive somewhat from his first paroxysms. Reason began to force itself upon his cooler reflections, and he saw how hopeless was his aspiration. Yet Jane Livingston had given him encouragement, and she had even seemed to entertain a kind of assurance that her own hopes were well founded. Then came the recollection of the mysterious manner, on several occasions, of both Jane and her brother, when they seemed to call back some strange coincidence connected with his own appearance and history. The incidents of that night when Richard was so startled at the account of the shipwreck—when he so mysteriously alluded to a suspicion of his sister's, hung upon the mind of our hero with a strange weight.
               The more George Brumford thought of the circumstances of his past life, and brought their developments into a kind of connected chain, the more was he enveloped in a cloud of strange doubt.
               While thus thinking over the past, and vainly endeavoring to get some clue to the future, he had approached the vicinity of the Queen's Dock, and just as he was upon the point of turning the angle of a large store-house that formed the corner of the street, he was startled by feeling a heavy hand laid upon his shoulder. He turned quickly around and beheld the individual who had thus interrupted him. Right above his head was suspended a bright street light, and by its rays George was enabled distinctly to make out the appearance of the man who confronted him. He was a powerfully built fellow, with a broad, heavy chest that seemed a vast repository of sinew and muscle. His features were mostly covered by a dense mass of black hair, here and there intermingled with gray, but still the sharp, twinkling eyes, set beneath a half lowering and half open brow, told somewhat of the character of the man,—one who might be a friend or an enemy, just as circumstances happened to be,—one who might do an evil act or a noble deed, just as inducements offered; but, at all events, one who was not to be despised in either case.
               'Do you seek me?' asked George, as he glanced hastily over the massive form before him.
               'Well, perhaps yes, and perhaps no,' returned the stranger, as he unceremoniously laid his hand upon the young man's shoulder and turned his face to the light.
               'Don't be alarmed,' he coolly continued, as he noticed an indication on the part of George to resent such liberties. 'I think you are just the man I'm after.'
               'Then you would accommodate me by coming at your business at once,' said the youth, as shook the heavy hand from his shoulder.
               'Are you the young man who has just received a commission in the navy?' asked the stranger.
               'I have a commission.'
               'Then your name is George Brumford.'
               'Well, suppose it is—what then?' returned George, meeting the earnest look of his companion with an unflinching gaze.
               'Why, if it is, then you are the man I wish to see, that's all.'
               'I suppose the business must be very urgent that causes you to seek me thus, and therefore you may rest assured that my name is George Brumford.'
               'I may? ha, ha, ha! However, that's a good name enough, and I've no doubt it suits you as well as any other.'
               At first George felt angry at this cool affrontery; but thinking that the man must be mistaken in some particular, he answered,—
               'I am inclined to think, sir, that you are laboring under some mistake. If you seek me as one whom you have ever known, or who can have possibly had any dealings with you or yours, then you may rest assured that your expectations are groundless.'
               'There you are wrong,' coolly returned the stranger. 'I do seek you as one whom I have known, and what is more, I seek you for your own good.'
               'Then let me hear your business at once,' said the youth, who was beginning to feel somewhat interested in the results of the adventure.
               'You go by the name of George Brumford.'
               'That is my name.'
               'Well, no matter for that. The woman who brought you up almost from infancy, died when you were about twelve years of age.'
               'My mother, sir,' replied George, starting from his leaning position, and gazing into the unmoved features of his companion.
               'Well, never mind that.'
               'But I do mind it,' sir,' quickly responded the youth, who was not a little moved by the mysterious manner of the stranger.
               'Upon the death of this woman, you shipped on board the Cyclops, under Capt John Wallet,' interrogatively continued the stranger, seeming to take no notice of the young man's interruption.
               'Yes, yes,' tremblingly answered George.
               'And afterwards you accompanied Wallet to the house where this woman died, where he interrogated the occupants, with regard to the truth of your statements.'
               'True, true, sir,' gasped forth George, as he stood like one entranced before the man who possessed such strange, and yet perfect knowledge of his early history.
               'And there is no one living of the Cyclops' crew who can vouch for your identity.'
               'No. no,—they are gone—all gone. Yes, there is Capt. St. Clair. He picked me up from the island, and he certainly knows that I must have been wrecked in the Cyclops,' exclaimed George, as he laid his hand upon the arm of his companion. 'Now tell me what all this means.'
               'Not here,' returned the stranger, 'but if you will follow me a short distance I may produce proofs of something that will be to your advantage.'
               'You can at least tell me the substance of your communication here, urged the youth, not exactly liking the turn affairs were taking, and yet too anxious for the result to allow the fear of harm to turn him from his purpose.
               'I will tell you what I have to tell, if you will follow me, but nothing here.'
               'Very well, then lead on,' said our hero, as he prepared to follow, 'but let me tell you, sir, that I am well armed, and can resist violence.'
               'If that consideration influences you,' returned the smuggler, while a curious smile played around his mouth,' 'then you had better not go; for I tell you plainly that if I meditated force against you, no power of yours could overcome it.'
               'Very well,' said George, 'I accept the compliment, and will return it should opportunity offer. In the meantime I am ready to follow.'
               'Then come on.'
               'Hold a moment. Tell me your name, at least, ere I trust you too far.'
               'What can that matter?'
               'It may matter much. You know mine, and I would know yours.'
               'Well, men call me by an hundred different names. Perhaps Tom,—perhaps Dick, and perhaps Jack; but, as I have no fears from you, you may call me Watt Wallingford.'
               'Watt Wallingford!' exclaimed George, starting back as though he had touched a coiled serpent. 'And are you the notorious wrecking smuggler of the Ken?'
               
               'I am a wrecker when there are wrecks to pick, and the cellars of half the inhabitants of Cumberland, Westmoreland and Lancashire will tell you whether I smuggle or not.'
               George Brumford hesitated a moment ere he started to follow the man who would guide him. Within that rough pea jacket stood one for whose apprehension ten thousand pounds would be paid within the week of his safe delivery to justice. No man ever swept the western coast of England with a bolder mein, and outraged the revenue laws with more perfect impunity, than had Watt Wallingford. Cargo after cargo of the choicest wines and brandies had found their way into the counties bordering on St George's Channel and the Irish sea, and yet the king's cutters cruised and cruised to no effect.
               'Does the name sound 
                     familar
                     familiar
                  ?' asked the stranger, while a dark smile passed over his features.
               'In the annals of crime, I have seen it often,' replied the young man, 'and I doubt much if there be a seaman in England who has not heard the name; but from a true son of the ocean I have nothing to fear,—so lead on.'
               A kind smile irradiated the features of Watt Wallingford at this last remark, and he put forth his hand. George grasped it firmly, and as he felt the warm embrace of that rough hand, smuggler and wrecker though it might be, he felt assured that a warm heart directed its movement.
               Watt Wallingford drew the collar of his rough jacket over his chin, and started on. George Brumford hesitated not, but with a firm step he followed the smuggler.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               A STRANGE DEVELOPMENT.
               GEORGE Brumford felt that there was soon to be a new and strange development in his career. He felt that the grand turn-point of his life time was at hand, and whether the coming events should be for good or evil—for his weal or woe—yet remained hidden in the womb of time. The strange language of Watt Wallingford added another link to the chain that had already been stretched forth to shackle the dim past with the unrevealed future, and the more he thought of the circumstances thus called to mind by the interrogative assertions of the smuggler, the more was he wrought up to an undefinable anxiety. Who was he, and what was he? These were questions that continually revolved in his mind as he followed his guide, and the more be tried to solve the mystery the deeper did he become involved in doubt and uncertainty.
               For nearly half an hour did the smuggler continue his course towards the north-western part of the town, and at length he stopped in front of a curiously constructed building which stood slightly separated from its neighbors, facing one of the lower piers of the city, to which were made fast quite a number of small vessels that were extensively engaged in the Irish trade.
               'Here we will enter,' remarked the guide, as he drew a key from his pocket.
               'And how long shall I need to remain?' asked George, as he hesitated a moment upon the pavement.
               'Not long in here,' returned the smuggler, in a tone that seemed to convey more meaning than was openly expressed.
               The key was placed in the door, the bolt thrown back, and as the way was opened Watt Wallingford motioned his companion to enter. George placed his hand upon his breast, where reposed a trusty pistol, and with a keen eye upon the movements of his guide, he passed in. A single oil lamp was suspended from the dingy ceiling of the hall, and by its dim rays, the two men made their way over a somewhat rickety floor towards the back part of the building, where the smuggler opened a small door that led to a well lighted room beyond, which they entered, when Wallingford closed the door behind him. There was a quick, sharp click as the door swang to, which George naturally enough supposed to be the shooting of a spring lock, and his anxiety was by no means allayed when he noticed that the windows were all secured by stout iron bars.
               Upon a table in one corner of the apartment stood two lights, and by their generous rays, our hero had opportunity to observe more clearly the appearance of his companion; but he found it no more easy to read the smuggler's character now than he had by moonlight, only that the rounding of the chest and shoulders was more perceptible, and the muscles of the hands, as they were laid upon his brow to remove the dark hair, worked in such seeming masses, that they betrayed a physical power greater, even, than George had at first given him credit for.
               'Now,' said George, as he finished a cursory survey of the apartment, 'I would know the business you have in view, for I have but little time to spare.'
               'More than you think for perhaps,' quietly returned the smuggler.
               'I know my own time, sir, and I would have you as brief as possible,' said George, as he seated himself in a chair near the table. 'You have told me that to-night which evinces a knowledge on your part of as much, at least, of my early history, as I know myself, and the hopes that you might know more has led me to follow you. I have placed thus much confidence in you without fear and without much questioning, but I am free to confess that I am not to be trifled with, even by a man so feared and dreaded as yourself.'
               'You certainly do me honor,' responded the smuggler, with a quiet smile. 'I take a kind of pride in being thus feared; but,' he continued, while his features assumed a deeper aspect, 'can you tell me who they be that fear me?'
               'Not I, at least,' returned our hero, who could not shake off the idea that the man before him desired to exercise some control over his movements.
               'Well, be that as it may,' said Wallingford, as another smile flitted across his dark features; 'but of one thing you may rest assured,—there is not in Great Britain an honest, laboring man who fears Watt Wallingford. 'Tis only those who would live upon the fear of others that fear me, and I feel proud that it is so.'
               'Perhaps you are right,' replied George, 'and now let me hear what you have to say concerning myself.'
               'I was informed to-day, by a person who had been looking over the naval list in the Times newspaper, that you had been appointed to a vacant office on board a frigate now in actual service, and that you were to leave by the sloop-of-war in the harbor.'
               'Well, what of that?'
               'Why, simply this,—you cannot go!'
               'Cannot go! I do not understand you, sir.'
               'My language, I believe, was plain. I said that you could not go.'
               'And do you mean that I cannot join my ship?'
               'That's it exactly,' coolly replied the smuggler.
               'Then,' exclaimed George, as he arose from his seat and took a step towards the door, 'you will at once explain this strange matter, or I shall leave this house as I entered it.'
               I have little to explain at present,' replied Wallingford, not at all moved by the hasty manner of the young man. 'I told you that you could not go on board the sloop-of-war, and I meant it. I knew that if I told you this in the street you would not listen to me.'
               'And here you think to enforce it,' bitterly added George, with a look of disdain and derision.
               'If you are wise,' quietly replied the smuggler, 'there will be no need of enforcing anything.'
               For a moment the young man was undecided as to what course he should pursue. He saw plainly that if Wallingford had any ulterior designs, he must have made preparations for any emergency that might occur in carrying them out, and in his present situation he felt that cool discretion would avail him more than any resort to force, so moving back to his seat, he said,—
               'I certainly comprehend what you have said thus far, and now I wait for an explanation.'
               'I told you once I had little to explain; but perhaps I can make you comprehend something without broaching a subject which I myself do not fully understand at present. In the first place, I would have you understand that though I am proscribed by all the 
                     maritine
                     maritime
                   laws of England, and a princely price set upon my head, yet I am your friend; why it is so I cannot now explain; but that it is so, you may rest assured. When the name of George Brumford appeared in the Naval list, together with a slight account of his history, and the act that gave him preference for the post to which he had been appointed, there was no little consternation produced in a certain quarter by the announcement, and, innocent as you may deem yourself of any crime, there are those who at this moment are plotting your ruin.'
               'Ruin?—my ruin!' iterated the youth in astonishment.
               'Aye—even so.'
               'And how can my appointment have influenced any one against me?'
               'It is not your appointment,' returned the smuggler, 'but it is your identity that has created the disturbance. The presence of George Brumford among the distinguished officers of the kingdom at this time is rather alarming to certain persons, who would much rather he were at the bottom of the sea, than thus creeping into notice through the medium of naval honors.'
               'This is all a riddle to me, sir,' uttered the young man, before whose mind a host of pictures were starling up and disappearing in quick succession.
               'And so much of it will remain for the present,' replied Watt Wallingford; 'but thus much I will tell you: The woman who brought you up from early childhood, and died when you were twelve years of age, was not your mother.'
               'Not my mother?' gasped George, who already began to feel that the smuggler was telling him the truth.
               'No; nor was she any relation of yours.—Your mother left America when you were about three years of age, and I doubt much if you have any recollection of her.'
               For several seconds—perhaps a minute—the youth sat with his hand pressed hard upon his brow, and then, rather to himself than in answer to his companion, he murmured,—
               'I can see it—that death-bed; I can see the man whom I loved, and towards whom my heart went forth in prayer long after he had gone;—and she who sat beside him the last time I saw him—she who pressed me to her bosom and wept—she was my mother.'
               'So she was, young man.'
               George looked up into the face of his companion with a feeling of strange bewilderment, but soon collecting his thoughts, he arose from his seat, and approaching the smuggler, he laid his hand upon the broad, heavy shoulder, and asked,—
               'Did you know my mother?'
               'Yes.'
               'And is she now living?'
               'That is more than I can tell; but if she is, her days on earth are numbered, for disease has long held battle against her.'
               'And this danger to myself—what is it?'
               'That I cannot tell thee.'
               'Watt Wallingford, said George, in a calm but earnest tone, 'something tells me that what you have said is true. In my own soul there dwells a picture that has been brought back to life by your tale, and back, far back of my defined remembrance, I can catch glimmers of scenes that accord well with your assertion. I will trust you—trust you even to the life,—now tell me that you will not deceive me.'
               Had George Brumford seen the dark shadow that passed over the face of the smuggler at that moment, he would have hesitated ere he trusted him further. Watt Wallingford turned away his head to hide the emotion, and it was some moments ere he ventured a reply; but when he did so his face once more wore the open, frank look that naturally belonged to it. George saw nothing—mistrusted nothing—but anxiously awaited his companion's answer.
               'If you trust to me you shall know all that you can wish to know,' at length said the smuggler, as he started at a slight noise that sounded from without.
               'And I shall see my mother?'
               'For that purpose I brought thee hither.'
               'Here? here?' exclaimed the youth, starting and looking about him. 'Is she here?'
               'No, no—she's in Westmoreland. But hark! What noise is that?'
               At this moment a tramping of feet were heard upon what seemed to be a staircase near at hand, and in a moment more a door, which our hero had not before noticed, was opened, and half-a-dozen rough looking men, dressed in the garb of seamen, unceremoniously entered the apartment.
               'How now, Pettrell?' exclaimed Wallingford, starting forward.
               'The officers are after us, sir,' hastily replied the man who had been thus addressed.
               'How near?'
               'At the door, sir. D'ye hear that?'
               Just as Pettrell spoke, a loud thumping was heard at the front door, and turning to one of the men who stood back, Wallingford asked,—
               'Blankworth, is the brig ready?'
               'Tops'ls loosed an' anchor a-peak, sir,' replied the man.
               'And how's the wind?'
               'Fresh from the east'rd, sir.'
               'Pettrell,' said the smuggler captain, turning to his first officer, 'there's treachery somewhere, or those officers would never have smelt us here. However, we must be on the move.'
               As he spoke he approached one of the high windows and withdrew what appeared to have been once an old staple for fastening down the sash. As soon as this was done, the whole piece of panelling, between the window sill and the floor, fell back from its place, and revealed the head of a flight of stone steps.
               'Down, down, my men—quick!' exclaimed Wallingford; and as the men began to pass through he turned to George, and remarked,—
               'You see we are prepared for emergencies. I will follow you.'
               'No, no,' uttered George, as he took a step back from the place, 'I will go out as I entered.'
               'But I desire that you accompany me. So in you go. Quick! quick! they are upon us.'
               The young man was perfectly bewildered.—He knew not what to do or which way to move; but Wallingford soon settled the matter for him by lifting him from the floor and safely depositing him upon the steps within the aperture; then seizing one of the lamps, and extinguishing the other, he entered the passage himself and carefully closed the panel after him.
               George knew that remonstrance or argument would be now alike in vain, and so, without a word, he followed on after the smugglers. The passage into which they had thus entered was protected beneath the house by several secret doors, so that even had the entrance been found, all search might have ended in what appeared to be a cellar belonging-to the house; but after passing through the third door, which was undistinguishable from the walls around it, the passage became quite narrow and unobstructed and with hasty steps the smugglers pushed their way along. At the end of about ten minutes George felt a current of cool air strike upon his brow, and in a few moments more he found himself up to the knees in water. A boat was close at hand, and instinctively following the movements of the others, he entered it.
               'Of course you will set me on shore,' said the youth.
               '—sh! Not a word here,' whispered the smuggler, bending upon George a stern, forbidding look.
               George Brumford regarded the strange features of his companion, as they worked beneath the playing moonbeams, but he made no further remark. The events of the evening were so strangely mysterious that he felt impelled, by some unseen power, to follow out the path into which fate had thrown him, and pressing his hand hard upon his brow, he leaned back in the stern-sheets and gave himself up to thought!
               Think on, George! You may revel in the past; but through the deep veil that Omniscience has drawn over the future no power of yours can penetrate! Beyond it lay scenes that you little dream of now.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IX.
               THE CHASE.
               IT was near midnight when the smugglers emerged from the subterranean passage, and as soon as all hands were seated in the boat the oars were got out, and they made their way as swiftly as possible towards the mouth of the river The moon was not yet down, and, aided by the countless myriads of stars that twinkled in the blue vault, she threw considerable light over the water, so that surrounding objects could be distinctly made out.
               George Brumford sat in a perfect maze of doubt and anxiety. The information he had received from the smuggler was certainly none of the clearest in detail, but still it came upon him with an overwhelming force of truth, and though a certain undefinable fear rested in his mind, yet he felt confident that the truth or falsity of the smuggler's statement had nothing to do with it.
               The human heart seems sometimes to possess a peculiar power of looking forward into the future, and oftentimes it will be bowed down by fear and dread when it is not able to communicate to the understanding the vision that has been opened to it. The electric spark of a sympathy with coming events seems to play around and about it, sometimes kindling the fire of hope, and at others dashing out whatever glimmer of joy the soul might have retained.
               Thus it was with our hero, and though the belief that his mother still lived, and that he should again meet her on earth, was strong within him, still he was not happy.
               'Hallo, what does all that mean?' exclaimed Pettrell, who was steering the boat.
               'What?' asked Wallingford, as he ran his eyes over the water.
               'Look at that sloop-of-war.'
               'Lay on your oars a moment, my men,' said the smuggler.
               In a moment the oars rested clear of the water, and the sounds from the corvette which had arrested the attention of Pettrell were now distinctly heard.
               'Heaving up her anchors, by Jove!' 
                     exclamed
                     exclaimed
                   Wallingford, as he bent his ears close to the water. 'Hark.'
               The wind was from the north'rd and east'rd, and the sloop-of war, which lay near the southern shore, was consequently to the leeward of the boat, and as the breeze was somewhat fresh, the sounds were not at first so plainly distinguishable.
               'She's getting under weigh, as sure as fate,' said Wallingford, still keeping his ear as near the water as possible.
               'There go her men aloft,' exclaimed Pettrell. 'See them?'
               The men-of-warsmen were plainly seen, as they laid out upon the yards, and ere long the heavy topsails were loosed from their gaskets.
               'Now let fall your oars, my men, and pull with a will,' shouted Wallingford, 'for that craft isn't getting off for nothing.'
               'But they can't certainly have their eye on our brig,' remarked Pettrell.
               'The officers had their eyes on us,' returned Wallingford, 'and surely it would be no wonder that they should also have them on our brig. There's been a spy lurking somewhere, and the same scamp that blew our place on shore has probably given information of the brig'
               'But do you think she means to give you chase?' asked George, while feelings anything but pleasant crowded upon his mind.
               'Certainly she will, if she has had information respecting us,' answered the smuggler.
               'But I thought she was ordered to Portsmouth'
               'So she was; but that is an order very easily countermanded, especially if she is wanted to capture Watt Wallingford'
               'Then I fear you will stand a hard chance,' said George, while a shudder ran through his frame, 'for the Scarborough is one of the swiftest sailors in the royal navy'
               'Perhaps you fear for yourself, as well as for me,' said Wallingford.
               'I do not wish to be overhauled on board your vessel, at all events,' replied George.
               'Neither shall you be, young man. Yonder sloop-of-war will poke her nose into danger if she follows me'
               'Danger?' iterated the youth, in surprise.
               'Certainly.'
               'But you would not surely fight her.'
               'Oh, no; I know a trick worth two of that'
               As Wallingford spoke, the boat shot under the stern of a large brig which lay at single anchor about five miles below the city, and in a few moments the cars were taken inboard and the boat hauled up alongside.
               The brig's anchor was nearly apeak, her sails hung loosely in the buntlines, and every thing was in readiness for making immediate sail.
               'Jump to the windlass, boys, quick,' shouted Wallingford, the moment that his foot touched the deck. Let that cable come in with a will.'
               The tide was on the ebb, and set out quite swiftly, so that the brig headed towards the harbor with the wind nearly on the larboard beam The moment the anchor was apeak, the topsails were hoisted and sheeted home, and when it at length broke ground the jib was run up, and as the helm was put up the brig began gracefully to wear around.
               'Round in on the larboard braces,' cried Wallingford, as he took the heavy glass which hung by a couple of beckets in the companionway, and prepared to keep his eye upon the sloop-of-war.
               The brig was soon brought around upon the starboard tack, and with all sail set she began to plough through the water.
               'There she comes,' exclaimed the smuggler captain, just as his own braces had been belayed. 'Get that anchor out of the water as soon as possible. The sloop is after us.'
               All doubt with respect to the intentions of the man-of-war was now at an end, for she had made sail and was standing directly after the brig. This was more than our hero had bargained for, and for the first time he began to fear that the smuggler had some ulterior design, other than he had confessed, in having got him on board the vessel; but, as matters now stood, be could not help wishing that the brig might escape, for the idea of being found by the officers of the ship in company with a notorious band of smugglers, was far from agreeable, and he therefore began to feel a kind of sympathy with the personal interests of his present company.
               'Does the sloop-of-war gain on us?' asked George, as he turned towards the spot where the captain stood looking through his glass.
               'A very little,' replied Wallingford.
               'And how do you intend to run?'
               'I mean to hug the coast if the wind will let me.'
               'The sloop is not over two miles astern now,' said George.
               'No—not over a mile and a half,' returned Wallingford, 'but that will do her no good. If I can pass the mouth of the Ribble clear of her guns we may whistle.'
               The log was thrown and the reel ran off nine and a half knots.
               'That's good,' said Wallingford, as he heard the report. 'She can't be going over ten and a half.'
               'And will overhaul us in an hour and a half,' uttered George, as he instinctively cast his eyes aloft to see if everything drew.
               'Before that time we shall have everything our own way,' returned the smuggler. 'Let me get to the north'rd of the Ribble and I'll find sailing ground that won't exactly suit yonder fellow.'
               'Hallo—that looks as though she meant something,' exclaimed the youth, as a bright flame issued from the sloop's weather bow, and in a moment more the heavy report of a gun came booming over the water.
               'She's in earnest, sure enough,' calmly re-returned Wallingford, not at all disconcerted by the sloop's salute.
               Half an hour slipped by, during which time the man-of-war had gained but very little; but she had fired several shots which had all fallen short of their mark.
               'She don't sail ten and a half knots,' said George, as he looked away astern where the white sails of the ship were visible.
               'No,' returned Wallingford, 'she has'nt gained over a quarter of a mile on us yet.'
               Another half hour passed, and still the brig kept on unharmed. The sloop-of-war had gained some, but not enough to level her guns with any degree of certainty, for all the shot thus far seemed almost to have been fired at random. The smuggler had hauled upon the wind, and was heading about north, while all along upon the weather beam the land had been visible; but now the shore began to grow dim and indistinct, and ere long it disappeared altogether, while the breeze came sweeping down fresher and stronger.
               'Here we are, just off the mouth of the Ribble,' exclaimed Wallingford as the bold headland faded away in the distance. 'In an hour longer we shall be safe.'
               'And how long shall I have to remain ere we seek the place where you told me I should find my mother?' asked George, as he drew the captain one side.
               'Perhaps to-morrow,' returned Wallingford.
               'To-morrow?—but I thought this chase might disconcert your plans.'
               'Not at all, Mr. Brumford. I shall easily avoid the ship, and if the wind don't fail me I shall anchor my brig in the Ken to-morrow.'
               As the captain spoke he swept his glass along where the sea ran up to the Ribble, and after a few moments' survey he lowered his instrument and stepped back to the binnacle. There was a quiet smile upon his features as he cast his eyes aloft after he had looked at the compass, and those who saw it felt assured that all was safe.
               'Ready about!' shouted Wallingford, as he took another look at the chaser.
               'I thought you intended to pass the mouth of the river,' said George, who was not a little surprised at this order.
               'So I do.'
               'I do not comprehend you.'
               'I suppose not,' returned Wallingford, with a smile. And then passing his glass over to the young man, he continued,—
               'Just look up the river and tell me what you see.'
               George did as requested, and at the expiration of about a minute he said—
               'I see nothing but a brig at anchor.
               'Did you notice her sails?'
               'Yes—they were merely clewed up.'
               'Well, that brig is only waiting there for the flood tide, and I think I can play the sloop-of-war a trick.'
               To bring the brig about upon the larboard tack was the work of but a few moments, and in less than ten minutes the chaser was hidden from sight by the high headland.
               'Lay aloft and take in the top-gallant sails,' ordered the captain, and as soon as they were in he again tacked and stood across towards the northern headland which rose in a frowning cliff high above the water, and just as the smuggler reached the deep shade which the cliff threw over the objects below it, the sloop-of-war came sweeping around the southern point, and going about, she stood boldly up towards the river.
               'They'll never see us here,' said Wallingford, and so it proved, for the ship still kept on, and in the course of half an hour the brig slipped out once more into the open sea, and by nine o'clock the next morning she was safely anchored in a small, well sheltered harbor at the head of Morecambe Bay, near the mouth of the river Ken.
               A dozen boats came off from the shore as soon as the brig's sails were furled, and our new English lieutenant had the satisfaction of seeing eighty-seven pipes of French brandy smuggled into the king's dominions before noon.
               'Rather a heavy operation, that, Mr. Brumford,' said Watt Wallingford, as the last pipe was lowered over the side of the vessel into a boat.
               'Yes, and rather a dangerous one too,' returned the young man.
               'And perhaps you would say, wicked.'
               'No, not exactly wicked,' continued George; 'but that it is illegal and subvertive of the aims of government, I think you will not deny.'
               'It is certainly illegal, and it may also be subvertive of what are now the aims of the British government,' returned Wallingford; 'but so long as government sees fit to impose such exorbitant and unreasonable duties on articles of general consumption, just so long will they be smuggled. Legislation may enact a thousand penalties for the smuggler, but it cannot take away from man the appetite for the articles, nor will it put money enough in the pockets, of the poorer classes to enable them to purchase when the enormous per centage of duties is added to the original price. Aside from the revenue officers, there is hardly a man in all 
                     Lancanshire
                     Lancashire
                   who would not help the smugglers in cases of emergency. Let me tell you, sir, the people of England like to get their tea, and coffee, and tobacco, and 
                     baandy
                     brandy
                  , as cheap as possible, and they have a peculiar regard for that man who affords them this privilege.'
               'I will not deny that in most cases the revenue duties are odious, but at the same time I can conceive of but little pleasure to be obtained in a life devoted almost wholly to the violation of law and consequent liability to punishment.'
               'Punishment is an extraneous idea with us, Mr. Brumford, and as for the pleasure of such a life, I am bound to say that to me no other phase of the sailor's career offers such stores of real happiness. To be a smuggler does not require an evil heart nor a wicked disposition. It is, in fact, but the more equal distribution of the good things of life which God has given for His children.
               George was just upon the point of replying when one of the men who belonged to the shore boat came aft and interrupted the conversation by saying—
               'We shall want some of your men, Capt. Wallingford, to go with us as far as the southern pass, for report says that the revenue officers are about, and that they've got wind of this cargo.'
               'Have they been seen?' asked Wallingford, as he started from his leaning position against the binnacle.
               'None of our folks have seen 'em,' returned he of the shore boat, 'but they're about, for the men at the Lancaster landing saw 'em two days ago.'
               'When will you be ready to start?'
               'Not'll about noon.'
               'Well, I will be with you, and will take a dozen men.'
               As the man turned towards the gangway, Watt Wallingford remarked to his young companion,—
               'This will be on our road, and so we can accompany the party to the pass without any trouble.'
               'And so I suppose I must help escort your contraband cargo perforce of necessity, said George, trying to smile, but nevertheless looking anything but pleased.
               'Oh, you need not feel under any apprehensions on that score, for you may keep as far ahead or as far behind as you please.'
               'Well,' returned George, 'I have gone thus far upon my errand, and I suppose I may as well follow it out; but remember, I follow you willingly, and I trust you as one honest man feels that he can trust another.'
               'What I have told you is true,' returned the smuggler, 'and you have but to follow my directions in order to work out your future happiness and prosperity.'
               'And yet,' ventured the youth, while he gazed fixedly in the face of the smuggler, 'I am at a loss to comprehend why you should feel so much interest in my affairs. You are surely no relation to me.'
               'Nevertheless I have a deep interest in your welfare—an interest which can cease only with life. There, ask no more, for the secret that rests there cannot now be unfolded.'
               George saw that the smuggler was not to be questioned on that point, and so he asked no more, but following the bidding of his mysterious conductor, he set about preparing for going on shore.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER X.
               THE HIGHWAY BATTLE.
               THE sun had disappeared behind the forest-crowned headland of Morecambe Bay, but as it lacked some half-hour yet of its final rest for the night, its disappearance had only served to cast a deep shade across the interval of the Ken. Along on the eastern bank of the river runs the high road from Lancaster to Kendal, and for several miles after the road strikes off from the bay the right is flanked by a dense forest, broken here and there by passes which lead across to the Loyne.
               At the time we have mentioned—just as the sun sank behind the tall trees—a number of heavy wagons, to all appearances loaded with hay, emerged from an opening on the left and struck into the high road. There were eight in number, and each wagon was accompanied by two men habited in the rough garb of the York-shire peasantry, while scattered along upon the road, and threading the edge of the forest, were some twenty or thirty more individuals,—those who kept the road being habited like the wagoners, but the few who kept along in the edge of the woods were evidently seamen.
               The reader will of course at once recognize the smuggling party. Every precaution for the safe transfer of the contraband goods that ingenuity could suggest had been adopted by the smugglers, and should they fail to gain their destination without coming in contact with the officers, they were well prepared for resistance.
               'Do you often carry such heavy loads as this through the country?' asked George of the smuggler captain, as they followed along by the way of a narrow beaten track within the wood.
               'Oh, yes, there is seldom any danger.'
               'No danger!' iterated George. 'Why, of course the officers of the revenue are attending to their duties along the coast.'
               'Perhaps so.'
               'Perhaps so? You speak as though the duty was neglected.'
               'And can you wonder that it should be?'
               'Certainly,' replied George. The revenue and excise officers are appointed and paid for—'
               'Trying to enforce a statute that is odious to the people,' interrupted the smuggler with a bitter laugh.
               'So are all statutes odious to some one,' returned George. 'The thief, the robber, the pirate, the murderer, and the counterfeiter find laws that are opposed to their sinful desires.'
               'Well, what of that?'
               'What of it! Why, much. It proves that no man, or class of men, have a right to pass judgment against a law merely because it conflicts with their peculiar sentiments and desires.
               The very enactment of a law is proof that there will be some who will desire to break it, were there none such, then there would be no need of the law.'
               'You talk very well, Mr. Brumford, for a person who has spent his lifetime upon the sea, but there is one thing that seems entirely to escape your notice. There is a vast difference between the law that protects the lives and property of the people, and the law that places a heavy tax upon their honest labor for no other purpose but to support a dissipated aristocracy, and pay the debts of British wars. I should think the old dotard, George, and his ministry, might have learned a lesson from the Colonies in America ere this. England might have held peaceable sway over what are now the United States, if she had been content to let the people there enjoy the fruits of their labor. But no, she must needs try to force upon the colonists her odious taxes, and she lost the whole domain.'
               This reference to the United States carried the mind of George back to his earliest home, and for several moments he dwelt upon the dim visions of the past; but, seeming to recollect that he had got no definite answer to his former question, he said,—
               'Then you would say that the king's officers do not perform their duties.'
               'No, I would'nt say that,—though in most cases they manage to get over those duties as easily as possible. The people throughout the country are with us, and so those officers, even, who would do their duty are often led off from the track; but in this case there may he some trouble.'
               'How so?' asked the young man.
               'There has been a heavy squad of officers for the last two weeks among the hills of Yorkshire, and a day or two since they went down to Lancaster, and report says they have come up this way.'
               The sun had now set, and the grey veil of twilight was beginning to deepen into darker shades. The path through the woods became more difficult to follow, and more than once George came near being thrown upon the ground by coming in contact with the shrubs that grew in the way. In half an hour after the darkness had fairly settled down over the way the gentle moon peeped up over the trees, throwing a soft light along the road.
               'Stop a minute!' exclaimed Watt Wallingford, as he laid his hand upon George's shoulder, and listened for the repetition of some sound which he seemed to have heard.
               'What is it?' asked George.
               'Stay here a moment, while I go and see,' returned Wallingford, as he darted towards the road.
               In less than three minutes the smuggler returned.
               'Is there anything the matter?' hastily asked the young man, upon whose mind the idea of coming in forcible contact with the king's officers had no very pleasing effect.
               'Stay here if you choose,' quickly returned Wallingford, without seeming to notice whether his companion had asked a question or not.—'We are discovered, and the head wagon has already been stopped. If the officers search beneath the hay then we shall have to fight our way. You can keep under cover of the wood till the affair is settled, for I have no desire to drag you into the results of my doings.'
               As he ceased speaking, the smuggler darted back into the road, and already George could hear the confusion of tongues as various questions were asked and answered.
               'Shall I stay here like a coward, and skulk about under the cover of darkness like a thief?' said the youth to himself, as the din of confusion grew louder. 'No—I have done nothing, and I fear nothing.'
               With these words George stepped forth form the woods, and soon gained the road. The wagons had all passed the spot where he stood, and had come to a halt about twenty rods in advance, while around them were gathered a score of soldiers, upon whose sword belts and bright hilts the beams of the moon were glistening. He did not stop long to consider what he should do, but started at once for the wagons; he had not gone far, however, before he stopped and thought again of seeking the cover of the woods. Amid the din and confusion, he could just make out that the brandy had been discovered, and he plainly heard the chief officer of the party demand it in the king's name.
               The noise increased amid oaths and execrations, and in a moment more came the quick, sharp clash of steel.
               While our hero thus stood, undecided what to do, he was startled by the approach of some one from behind, and turning quickly about, he beheld one of the revenue officers accompanied by a soldier.
               'Hold, there, stranger!' shouted the officer, as he approached the spot where the young man stood. 'Who are you?'
               'You addressed me rightly,' returned George. 'I am a stranger to you.'
               'But not to the smugglers,—oh, no, you're no stranger to them, I'll warrant. Take him, Spencer, and bring him along.'
               The latter remark was addressed to the soldier, and in accordance with his superior's orders he advanced towards the young man.
               'Stand back, fellow!' shouted George, as the soldier came near; and then turning to the officer, he said,—
               'Tell me, sir, by what authority you thus trouble a man upon the king's highway.'
               'Well, that's cool; come, I like that,' returned the officer with a contemptuous leer, 'just tell me, sir, did n't you come up from the bay with those smugglers?'
               
               'I do not feel obliged to stand here and answer impertinent questions,' 
                     quicky
                     quickly
                   answered George, 'but if you have business with me I am ready to satisfy you.'
               'Business?' iterated the officer. ''T'll be business enough for you before you get through with it, I guess. I s'pose you didn't come up to help protect that brandy.'
               'Does my present position indicate that I am engaged in any such purpose?'
               'Well, as for that matter,' returned the officer, who began to get angry, 'I could'nt exactly tell; but I think it's most likely that as soon as the first signal of danger was given your cowardly legs ran away with you.'
               There are times when impudence and insolence reach to such a height that the perpetrator sinks beneath all honorable notice—when all passion becomes merged into deep disgust; and so was it with George brumford. Had the officer said less, George might have even struck him to the ground, but as it was he only loathed the extreme littleness of soul, and merely said:
               'There, go about your business, fellow.'
               'I'll soon let you see into my business,' replied the officer, while his lips grew white and trembled with rage. 'I arrest you, in the king's name, as a smuggler. Now do your duty, Spencer.'
               George had never travelled through England, nor had he ever before came in contact with government officers, consequently the sound of that simple sentence—'in the king's name'—did not strike him with that peculiar dread which is experienced by most of the people under like circumstances.
               Again the soldier approached to obey the orders of his superior. George thought not of disobeying law, but he only thought as he often thought before, when danger threatened him, of self-defence, and with one blow of his clenched fist he laid the soldier at his feet.
               'Now, by the holy saints,' cried the officer, in a foaming rage, 'you shall suffer. Offer another motion of resistance, and I'll run you through.'
               George was not unarmed, for a long walk through the forest was sufficient cause at any time for being prepared for emergencies, and as the officer started forward the youth drew his cutlass from its sheath, saying, as he did so,—
               'Don't touch me, sir; for if you do, your danger be upon your own head. You understand me.'
               'Then you resist the law!' cried the infuriated officer, as he scanned the noble proportions before him.
               'No, I only resist those who trouble me without cause.'
               'Once more,—will you surrender?'
               'No!'
               'Then I'll make you.'
               As the officer spoke he advanced upon George and drew his sword, but he found that the young man meant just what he had said, for with perfect coolness he not only stood his ground, but offered some very dangerous passes
               'Drop your sword,' shouted the officer.
               'Never, returned George
               As the former spoke he pressed hard upon his young antagonist, and became thoroughly heated with passion, while George, acting for the present only on the defensive, was as calm as the moon that rolled above him; but he soon discovered that he had got a more serious game to play, for the soldier had risen from the ground, and, under the smart of the blow he had received, he was coming up to the rescue.
               To seek safety in flight was a thought that never entered the youth's mind, and consequently there were but two courses of action, from which to choose,—he must either resign himself as a prisoner, or else fight his way clear. He would gladly be clear of the scrape, but it was too late now.
               The first course he could not pursue, for he did not relish the idea of being brought into public notoriety as a smuggler, nor did he wish to be 
                     urned
                     turned
                   from the purpose which he was pursuing, and so he determined at once to fight his way.
               As the soldier came up he drew his short cutlasstaa lunge. George and made spug quickly on one side and avoided the well aimed blow, but from that instant he was a different man.—There was a lion in his soul, and it had roused up beneath the attack. His eyes flashed and sparkled for an instant as the first burst of the lion sent the thrill of awakening power along his nerves, and then they settled down into the same calm state as before; but his teeth were set firmly together and his weapon was clenched with a firmer grip.
               The soldier made another lunge, but it was his last! As George's cutlass came up it caught the officer's 
                     decending
                     descending
                   blow, and then with a slight sweep he brought it down upon the head of the soldier. The cloth cap offered no resistance, and when our hero withdrew his weapon the quivering fragments of the poor fellow's brain dropped from its blade!
               The revenue officer gazed for an instant upon his fallen companion, and the blood of the foiled hyena seemed to boil in his veins, and as he again darted forward the foam actually stood upon his lips.
               'Back, back,' shouted George, as he caught his antagonist's blade, 'I would not have another man's blood upon my shoulders. I wish you no harm; only let me alone.'
               'Look to yourself, sirrah,' was all that the officer said in words.
               Such a conflict could not last long, nor did it. Three successive passes were made by the officer, each of which George parried with difficulty; but he soon found that he could no longer act on the defensive alone, for he saw that his antagonist was bent upon his life. Once, and only once again did the officer leave his guard in the heat of attack. George dropped upon his right knee, and as the sword passed over his left shoulder he sprang again to his feet and drove the point of his cutlass against his adversary's breast.
               There was a low, grating sound, like the dull scraping of a bone; and as the keen blade was withdrawn the wounded man clasped his hands in agony upon his breast—uttered one groon, and then fell over upon the dry turf!
               'Hallo, Brumford, where are you' exclaimed Watt Wallingford, coming up at that moment.
               George took no notice of the approach, nor of the remark of the smuggler, but dropping his reeking point upon the ground he gazed in silence upon his melancholy work.
               'What!' exclaimed the startled smuggler, as his eyes for the first time rested upon the forms of the two fallen men, 'is this your work?'
               The youth raised his eyes to the powerful form of the man beside him, and answered,—
               'I could not help it.'
               'Help it,—poh, nonsense; why should you have helped it? You have settled one of the blackest villains that ever infested the country. Only a month ago he dragged a fair maiden from her home—one of the purest creatures in Yorkshire—and turned her forth upon the cold world a ruined, wretched maniac! Would that mine had been the hand to have put him out of the way. But come, our way is clear, and we have nothing to do but trudge along in safety.'
               'Are there others killed?' asked George with a shudder.
               'Only a few,—the fellows ran as soon as they found out our strength.'
               'I am afraid this will be sorry business.'
               'Only for those who have suffered already,' returned the smuggler. The people hereabouts like not these fellows.'
               Watt Wallingford turned to go, but ere George followed he cast a look at the forms of those he had slain. The pale moon lent a still more deathly hue to their rigid features, and the dark blood lay in thick pools about them.
               'Would to God that some other hand had done this!' and with this ejaculation George turned sadly away and followed the smuggler.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               THE FOUND AND LOST.
               UNTIL near midnight the wagons kept on the Lancaster road without further molestation of any kind, but at that time they reached a well protected pass which led off across the River Loyne into the hills of Yorkshire, and with a few directions from Wallingford, the heavy teams were turned off into the pass. The regular shore party kept on with the wagons, while the seamen, with the exception of George and Wallingford, turned back towards the bay. The two latter kept on towards Kendal.
               The air was cold and bracing, and the dry leaves ever and anon whirled up in huge columns as an eddy of wind caught them in its supertine movement, sometimes causing our travellers to stop for a moment in their way, as the miniature whirl-wind swept past with its load.
               'We must push on,' said Wallingford, as a gust of wind came sweeping across the road, 'for we have four leagues yet before us.'
               'I thought we stopped at Kendal,' returned George.
               'So we do, but it is two leagues beyond the town, 'nevertheless.'
               Without further remark the travellers kept on until they approached the town, and as they entered the streets all was quiet and still, save where the vigilant watchmen were performing their duty. The quaint old gables looked like dim spectres as they raised their grey proportions on either hand, while here and there the beams from some night-lamp struggled through the curtained windows, giving a peculiar cast to the sombre scene. The moon was sailing low in the western heavens, sometimes half obscured by fleecy clouds, and again peeping forth upon the world below.
               For a long time the two had walked in silence. George was too busy with the thought that possessed his soul to say much, while his companion seemed equally engaged in personal reflections. To the mind of the youth the events of the past forty-eight hours seemed more like a dream than aught else. He could hardly comprehend his own situation, and more than once he had pressed his hand upon his brow as if to assure himself that he was perfectly awake. That he was soon to see his mother appeared rather like a phantom hope of which he was in vain pursuit, than like a reality of life. MOTHER! What a host of feelings crowded upon his mind as that word rested upon his lips. From a firm, reasonable belief that his parents were both dead—while the pale corpse of his mother was still before his memory's retentive eye,—while he could look back upon the green hillock that rose above her mortal remains,—he had learned that she still lived—that she who had died was not his mother.
               Then came other thoughts and other feelings. Why had he been left in infancy to the care of strangers? Why had she who gave him birth thus deserted him when he most needed a kind parent's care and influence? Upon this point he could get no information from the smuggler. Watt Wallingford either was ignorant on the subject, or else he was unwilling to tell what he knew. He professed to know that the woman whom he sought was in truth young Brumford's parent, and he also hinted at much more. Had this information come from any source without confirmation, George would have rejected it, or at least, have hesitated long ere he gave himself up to any hope; but the smuggler had given undeniable proof that he was thoroughly acquainted with the circumstances of which he spoke,—and then the whole tone and bearing of Wallingford bore unmistakeable marks of truth. There was no deception in his manner, and when he spoke there was such an openness, such candor, that the young man could not doubt his words, and with the firm belief that all would ere long be satisfactorily explained, he pushed on his way, perfectly regardless of the cold air and the sweeping gust.
               'Now, my young friend,' said Wallingford, some hour and a half after they had passed through the village, 'we are nearly at our journey's end, and the promise which I made your mother is nearly fulfilled.'
               'A promise,' iterated George, gazing inquisitively into the face of his companion.
               'Yes,—a promise made long since.'
               'Then you have known her long.'
               'Did I not tell thee that I knew her when you were an infant?'
               'Aye, you did,' returned George, 'but still you said nothing of any promise.'
               'No,—I thought it not necessary.'
               'But what is it you have promised?'
               'Years ago, Mr. Brumford, I promised your mother that if I ever came across you, in any part of the world, I would lead you to her; and furthermore, that I would use all possible exertions to find you out. She gave me a clue to your home in Boston, and to the woman in whose charge you were left; but when I reached there the woman was dead and you had shipped on board the Cyclops. From that time I lost all knowledge of you until by the merest accident I learned that you had received an appointment in the navy. I should not have acted so hastily as I did had not I learned that there was danger in your path.'
               'And still,' said George, 'you will not tell me what that danger is."
               'I cannot do so now,' returned the smuggler, 'you must rest satisfied with the fact that for the present, you are safe from its influence.'
               'Do you see that house in the distance?' continued the smuggler, after a short interval of silence, as he pointed to a building which was just perceptible through the gloom.
               'Yes, I see the outlines of something that resembles a house.'
               'There dwells your mother.'
               'There!'
               'Yes'
               The warm blood went leaping through the young man's frame, and as the house grew more and more distinct, a feverish excitement possessed his brain.
               The grey tints of morning were just beginning to shoot up into the eastern heavens as the two stopped in front of the dwelling which had been pointed out. It was quite an old building, of the time of William III., with a quaintly ornamented gable fronting on the road, and two more on the wings, or ells, which made out on either side Below the front gable was a large porch, which formed the main entrance to the house, and to its heavy oaken door the smuggler at once proceeded, where he gave a loud rapping. Ere long a female head was protruded from one of the upper windows, and quite a pleasant voice inquired —
               'Who's that?'
               'It's Wallingford. Come, fly around, Mary, and let me in.'
               'In a moment,' returned the girl, as she drew in her head and shut the window.
               The travellers had not to wait long, for the simple peasant's dress of the maid was easily donned, and in less than three minutes her light footfall was heard descending the stairs.
               'You are along early this morning,' said Mary, as she opened the heavy door.
               'Aye,—or late, as you please to call it, returned the smuggler. 'Myself and friend have been on the road all night.'
               'Friend,' iterated the girl, for the first time noticing the new face, 'ah, I see,—you have company. But come in, and you shall have a warm fire, and something to warm the stomach withal; but tread lightly, for my lady has been worse during the night.'
               'Worse!' gasped George, turning inquiringly towards Wallingford. 'Is it she!—my—'
               '—sh,—I told you she was well on the journey of death, but you will see her soon.'
               The girl led the way through the main portion of the building to what seemed originally to have been the dining room, but which was now used for both eating and cooking. A few embers still burned upon the hearth, and with a little exertion a blazing fire was soon kindled.
               'Now tell me, Mary,' said Wallingford, as the fire began to blaze up, 'how is your mistress?'
               'She's worse, sir. The doctor has been with her all night, and he says she can't live long. It will be a sad thing for us, sir, for with all her—'
               'Never mind, Mary,' interrupted Wallingford, seeming anxious to break off the thread of her remarks; 'I know you will miss your mistress, but we've all got to go, you know. Now just run up and tell her that I wish to see her.'
               The girl immediately left the room, and as the door closed behind her, the smuggler turned to his companion and remarked —
               'I am fearful that what the girl says is correct, and if it is you will have but a short intercourse with your mother.'
               'Thank God, at least, that I shall see her, murmured George.
               'Aye,' returned Wallingford, 'and that you may yet have opportunity to avenge her wrongs.'
               'Wrongs,' repeated the young man, as he raised his eyes from the dancing flames and gazed into the face of his companion.
               'Yes,—wrongs,' returned Wallingford; and then drawing his chair nearer to the fire, he continued —
               'Since your mother is so weak, and, from all accounts, so near her end, it is perhaps better that I should communicate to you some things which I had left for her.'
               George instinctively drew his chair nearer to the smuggler and awaited the communication.
               'Before you see your mother,' said Wallingford, 'you shall understand the circumstances under which she is placed. When she married some twenty-eight years ago, she did so against the express wish of her father, and after the birth of the first child, which was a daughter, she was not only disinherited, but she was forbidden ever to enter her father's doors again. Her husband was poor, and on the birth of the second child, which was yourself—'
               'Myself?' interrupted George. 'Do you mean to say that I was born in England?'
               'Certainly,' answered the smuggler, as he placed another stick of wood upon the fire and poked the coals up together; 'but when you were about six months old your father had an excellent offer to go to America, and taking his wife and two children he took passage. For a year after he arrived in that country, he did moderately well as a clerk, but not by any means so well as had been held out to him, and at the end of that time, having laid up nothing from his pay, he was taken sick, and after lingering along for over a month, he died.'
               'Well,—and my mother?'
               'Dont interrupt me. In three months after her husband's death your mother received news from England that her father was dead, and that in his will he had made ample provision for her future sustenance, provided, however, that she should present her claims within one year from the date of the execution of the will. Having but very scanty means for providing herself for the voyage back to England, she at length resolved to leave you in charge of a woman by the name of Brumford, intending to send for you as soon as the business was settled.'
               'Your mother and sister arrived safely in England, and without difficulty the living was obtained, but when she sent back for you, the woman had moved, and no intelligence could be gained of her whereabouts. Years passed away before you were heard from again. When Mrs. Brumford was upon her death bed, she informed some of the officers of the circumstances under which she had taken the child, and as fortune would have it the circumstance reached your mother's ears, and she sent me for you at once; but when I arrived in Boston you had shipped on board the Cyclops and when the news of that ship's loss reached England you were given up as lost. Two years ago I learned from a man, who had just left the ship Lenox, that a boy had been taken from the wreck of the Cyclops, bearing your name, and also that you were then on board of her. This I immediately communicated to your mother, and she then exacted a solemn promise from me that I would seek you, and, if possible, bring you to her. How I found you I have already told you; but the most important part is yet to come.
               'To the will which your mother's father left, there was a codicil attached by which his daughter's eldest son should succeed to some very important affairs, the nature of which I cannot explain; but exertions are being made to crush that portion of the execution, and but for some collateral evidence which your mother possessed in the shape of documents, both from her father and from his justice, her children might yet be turned penniless away.'
               'And do they tread upon her thus even while she is at the door of death?' asked George, as his eyes flashed, and the muscles of his face worked with deep feeling.
               'Tread upon her?—yes,' returned Wallingford, 'and they even—but never mind.'
               'Tell me all, sir, I pray,' urged George, as he saw his companion hesitate.
               'I have nothing more to add, excepting that with the papers which your mother possesses you will have no difficulty in establishing your claim to quite an independence.'
               'I care not for myself,' said George, lowering his voice as he heard the sound of footsteps upon the stairs, 'but justice shall be done even though the worst come upon me.'
               'Than you will follow up your rights?'
               'Yes—if they be rights—so long as life remains in my body.'
               'Then you shall have my assistance,' said the smuggler, with much warmth, at the same time extending his hand which the youth eagerly grasped.
               At this moment Mary re-entered the apartment and bade Wallingford to follow her.
               As George was left alone he seemed all bewildered by the strange things he had heard, as well as by the peculiarity of his situation, As he watched the curling smoke that rose in fantastic wreaths from the burning logs, he felt his soul imagined in their eddying circles and swaying columns. Through every channel of his senses ran the thought of his mother, but still he could not comprehend the truth, —he could not realize the circumstances that surrounded him. Of course he felt all the love and veneration for his parent, which one under the same circumstances could feel, and he experienced a deep and heart-felt sorrow at the approaching calamity; but yet there was a feeling far deeper than any of these,—there was a mystery still around and about him, and no reasoning nor sophistry could break through its veil. The smuggler's explanation had been clear enough, but for all that there was much that he could by no means account for, and when Watt Wallingford at length returned, George Brumford had actually forgotten for the moment the immediate circumstances of his situation, but the entrance of the smuggler aroused him from his reverie.
               'Quick, quick!' uttered Wallingford, as he laid his hand upon the youth's shoulders. If you would see your mother, you must hasten.'
               'Do you mean that she is dying?' asked George, as he arose from his chair.
               'Even so. Tread lightly now, but quickly for the angel of death is waiting for his prey.'
               With quick, nervous steps the young man followed his guide up the wide stairway into a long passage that led towards the front part of he building. At length Wallingford stopped in front of a door that opened to the left and turning to George he placed his finger upon his lips, then noiselessly raised the latch and passed through into the room beyond. The heart of our hero beat wildly within his bosom as he followed his conductor, and when he entered the room he at first found it difficult to distinguish objects about him. Upon a small sideboard burned a dim lamp, while the closely drawn curtains, shutting out the fresh tints of early morn, left no other source of light within the apartment, and beneath its almost sickly rays a high bed in the further corner was made visible, rising like a giant spectre out of the gloom.
               A short, heavy breathing struck upon the youth's ears as the soft carpet swallowed up the sound of his footfall, and for several moments he awaited in breathless anxiety for some tangible direction to his senses.
               'Has he come?' feebly murmured a voice from the bed, while the rustling of the clothes plainly indicated an endeavor on the part of its occupant to raise herself from her recumbent position.
               'He is here,' returned Wallingford, at the same time turning towards the youth.
               'My son! my son!'
               George waited to hear no more. Whatever feelings of doubt, of anxiety, of fear, or of hope, might have dwelt in his bosom, they were all swept away by that simple sentence, and like the gentle whisperings of heaven's celestial hosts it rolled over his soul, awakening to a bright glow the fire of filial love. With a quick bound he reached the bedside, and as he bent over the prostrate form two weakening arms encircled his neck.
               'Oh! my son, my son! Heaven be praised that my arms can once more encircle thy loved form, and that my soul is once more permitted to beat in thy presence on earth.'
               George would have spoken, but he could not. The wild 
                     trobbings
                     throbbings
                   of his heart choked his utterance, and he could only weep tears of mingled joy and anguish.
               'Oh! George,' again murmured the feeble woman, 'is it possible that I once more press thee to my bosom! Raise the curtains,—do raise them, and let the sun shine upon me ere I die.'
               'You are not dying,' cried George. 'Oh, no, say not so. Live, live to bless your son.'
               The smuggler moved noiselessly to the eastern windows and raised the curtains.
               The first beams of the morning floated softly through the high windows and bathed the bed in its mellow light.
               'My time on earth is near its close, and but a few short moments are left,' replied the dying woman, as she gazed fixedly into the face of the youth,—'I feel it—I know it. Death has long hovered o'er, but God has kindly preserved me to this moment; and now—now that I have seen my boy, I can die in peace.'
               'God's will be done, my mother,' ejaculated George, as he pressed his lips upon the pale brow before him, 'but I trust He may yet preserve you.'
               'No, no, there is no hope,' returned the invalid, as she turned upon her side; and then, while some half forgotten idea seemed to come to her memory, she continued.—
               'But ere I go you shall have the means to obtain those rights which have been forced away from your mother. My enemies know not the proofs I possess. Here, here, George,—take this key,—go to that casket—open it,—quick! quick!—the papers are—are,—papers,—all, all there.'
               Upon a table near the head of the bed stood a small, brass-bound box, and quickly taking the proffered key George tremblingly placed it in the lock and threw back the cover. The interior presented a blank, unbroken space, and, save the presence of a few insignificant trinkets, it was perfectly empty!
               'There is nothing here, mother,' exclaimed George, as he strained his eyes as if to peer into the very wood of the empty casket.
               'Nothing! gone! All—all gone!' shrieked the dying woman, as she frantically raised herself upon her elbow. 'Is there nothing—nothing there?'
               George carried the casket to the bedside, and as she gazed into its empty depths, the poor woman sunk back upon her pillow and murmured.
               'Gone! gone! oh, great God of heaven, save my boy from—save—'
               She struggled hard to finish the sentence, but a low, dull rattle arose instead.
               George dropped the casket upon the carpet and sprang to her side. He placed his arm beneath her neck and raised her from the pillow.
               'Mother, mother,—speak to me! Oh, speak but one word.—tell me who has done this. Tell me what I shall do! oh! speak—speak!'
               'Gone! gone?' murmured the dying woman, and that was all!
               She strained her weaking lids, and gazed for a moment upon the features of him who held her. Then her eyes rolled wildly in their sockets,—a spasmodic shudder ran through her frame—the dull rattle again sounded in her throat, and the half-raised arms fell powerless by her side. The wildness of the bright eye was gone, and they sunk into a dull, leaden quiet. She was dead!
               The heart of George Brumford sank within his bosom, as if by its own beatings it would not disturb the stillness of that scene. For a minute he held the heavy weight upon his arm, and gazed into the pale face of her who would have blessed her son, and while the simple words she had uttered—'my son, my son'—rang still sweetly in his ears, he laid her gently back upon the pillow, and turning away from the scene he buried his face in his bands.
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               THE SPY.
               FOR a long time after George released the cold form of death from his embrace did he remain with his face covered by his hands. The tears gushed out from between the fingers, and as they rolled down upon his bosom they seemed to give ease to the overburdened heart.
               Watt Wallingford sat by the eastern window seemingly engaged in deep meditation, and as ever and anon some dark cloud would flit across his face, accompanied by a contraction of the muscles and a slight grinding of the teeth, it was evident that some deep thoughts and resolves were being digested in his mind.
               The sun was well up, and as his bright beams entered the chamber they fell upon the form of the dead. The gentle breeze of morning had taken the place of the midnight gust, and it whispered a solemn requiem as it rustled about the dwelling.
               Mary, the true-hearted, faithful girl, knelt by the side of the cold form of her mistress and poured forth her tears of grief. She had lost a kind patron, a firm friend, and a truly sympathizing companion, and she seemed not to think of the presence of others in the expression of her sorrow.
               At length the smuggler turned from the window and approached the spot where sat our hero by the side of the couch, and laying his hand upon the young man's shoulder he said, in a tone made tremulous by some unwonted excitement,—
               'George, you have no time for useless mourning. There is work to be done here, and upon you it devolves to perform it. Those papers are the sole evidences of your birthright, and they must be found.'
               'But how?—Where?' asked George, as he raised his head and gazed into the face of his companion.
               'That remains to be ascertained,' replied the smuggler. 'Of one thing, however, I am assured—they cannot be far off.' Then turning to the weeping girl, he continued,—
               'Mary, when did you last see your mistress open this casket?'
               The girl raised her head from the bed, and wiped the streaming tears from her eyes, but she seemed not to comprehend the question that had been put
               'When did you last see your mistress open this casket?' repeated the smuggler.
               'To day is Sunday —' half interrogatively said the girl to herself.
               'Yes.'
               'It was Thursday that she last opened it. Then she arranged the papers herself, and after locking it up she bade me place it on the table.'
               'And did she keep the key?'
               'Yes sir,—ever since the old justice brought her the papers she has kept it in her own possession.'
               'Who has visited this chamber since Thursday?'
               'No one but the physician has been here alone. All others have been accompanied by me.'
               'Who is this physician?'
               'Mr. Bellinger.'
               'Gabriel Bellinger?' asked Wallingford, while a bright spark flashed from either eye.
               'Yes, sir.'
               'Then he is the villain,' exclaimed the 
                     smugler
                     smuggler
                  , as he started from the seat he had taken by the side of George and commenced pacing up and down the apartment. 'Bellinger is a bosom friend of young Linwood, and—'
               'Linwood?' interrupted George. 'Did you say Linwood?'
               'Yes,—that was your mother's name, and it is also the name of the young heir who is striving to wrest away the property that falls to you.'
               'Linwood—Linwood—' murmured George to himself, as he gazed vacantly into the face of the smuggler. 'I certainly remember that name.'
               'Not with much distinctness, I guess,' returned Wallingford.
               'Nevertheless the name awakens memories that respond to its sound.'
               'Perhaps so.'
               'And is it my own name?' asked George, with a slight tremulousness in his voice.
               'You had better keep the name you have learned to live under,—at least for the present,' replied Wallingford. 'If it needs be that you must change it, it will be time enough when you regain the proofs of your rights under another.'
               'And those proofs have been stolen?'
               'Most assuredly they have; but yet they may be found.'
               Wallingford was about to speak further when he was interrupted by the sound of footsteps be low, and turning to Mary, he said,—
               'Run down and see who that is, and if pos- sible send out after some of the neighbors to assist in preparing the body of our lady.'
               The girl obeyed the request, and in the course of fifteen minutes several of the female friends of the deceased willingly offered their services. Wallingford and George immediately left the room and sought the open air. As they emerged from the door their eyes fell upon the form of a man seated upon an old stone horse-block. He was habited in the garb of a peasant, and appeared to be some forty or fifty years of age. From an old clay pipe he was puffing forth volumes of tobacco smoke, which, as it curled up in graceful wreaths above his head, seemed to engross the whole of his attention, for the opening of the door failed to arouse him from his reverie, and it was not until the two men had approached quite near that he became aware of their presence.
               'Ah, good morrow, my masters,' uttered the peasant, as he removed the pipe from his mouth and arose from his seat.
               'The same to you, sir,' returned Wallingford, 'you seem to be taking your ease.'
               'Perhaps so,' returned the peasant, as he cast an inquisitive glance up at the smuggler. 'I always takes my ease when there's nothin' else to do, 'specially when I'm on the watch for somethin'.'
               'Were you watching for anything here?'
               'Maybe yes, and maybe no,' laconically returned the peasant, as he took another long whiff at his pipe. 'That's just as matters turn out. There's somebody in this section as I should like to see.'
               For a moment the smuggler regarded the stranger with a quiet smile, and then, while a beam of intelligence passed over his features, he said,—
               'Perhaps you seek me?'
               'Maybe so,' answered the peasant, still keeping his eyes fixed upon Wallingford.
               The smuggler cast a furtive glance about the premises, as if to assure himself that there were no other strangers near, and then taking a step nearer to the stranger, he said,—
               'Do you seek Watt Wallingford?'
               'Yes.'
               'Then your search may end here.'
               'So I thought.'
               'Now what is your business?'
               'You were attacked by the revenue officers last night on the Lancaster road.'
               'Well.'
               'Six men were killed, and among them was the lieutenant.'
               'You don't seem to need information on that point,' remarked Wallingford, as he bent a keen glance upon his interlocutor.
               'No,' returned the peasant, 'but you may need a little.'
               ''Out with it, then.'
               The stranger cast an inquiring look at George.
               'Don't fear to speak before my companion.'
               'Very well, then; but you see we don't always know who to trust, an' so I was a little fearful,' said the peasant, as he knocked the ashes from his pipe and placed it in his pocket, when he continued,—
               ''Twasn't only about half o' the sneakers that overhauled you last night. The rest of 'em was further on towards Kendal, but they've got news of what was done, an' there's a party of 'em comin' down here after you.'
               'After me?' exclaimed the smuggler. 'How could they know my whereabouts?'
               'Two of those that ran away from you last night tracked you through the town, an' tried to, get the authorities to help 'em, but they would'nt, an' so they've gone back after more of their own men.'
               'And how gained you this intelligence?'
               'It came from a man who does not wish to be known,' replied the peasant, 'as his place in the town might be in danger; but you may depend upon its truth.'
               'Did you learn whether I am the only object of their search?' asked Wallingford.
               'There's two of you, for certain,' replied the messenger, 'an' if I'm not mistaken your young companion here is the other one. At any rate, he answers very well to the description, and the chaps that followed you to the town said it was the young one that killed the lieutenant.'
               'Then we shall have to haul our wind out of this,' said Wallingford, as he turned to his young companion.
               'And leave the remains of my mother uncared for?' uttered George.
               'There are plenty of neighbors who will attend to that;—but at any rate we can't stop here. These officers will be down here by noon.'
               'Before that time, sir,' interrupted the peasant. 'Their men are only a short distance below the falls, an' they'll come back in a hurry.'
               'Then let them come,' exclaimed George, with considerable bitterness in his tone. 'I have no occasion to flee from officers of justice, and neither do I wish to be hunted down by a pack of soldiers. You can look out for yourself, but I shall remain here.'
               'And be taken,' added the smuggler.
               'No, I am no smuggler, and consequently they will have nothing about which to trouble me.'
               'You forget the lieutenant and his man.'
               'Ah, but that was in self-defence,' urged George.
               'Perhaps you can make the revenue officers believe it,' returned Wallingford, 'but, nevertheless, I think you would much more easily elude them altogether. Resisting a king's officer, even unto death, is no slight offence, and if you know when you are well off you will not tempt the law.'
               This was no very pleasing reflection for George. He saw at once that it would be no easy matter to clear himself from the punishment due to an offence like his, though he felt in his heart that he had done nothing that he could well have avoided. He had slain a man in self-defence—so he said to himself; but the law would tell him that he had killed an officer while in the performance of his duty. Such an offence was punishable with transportation, at least, and after a few moments' thought the young man very wisely resolved to follow the advice of Wallingford, and turning to the individual he said,—
               'I will accompany you, for since I have so unwittingly got into the scrape, I suppose I must work out of it the best way I can; but when can we prosecute the search after the missing papers?'
               'As soon as we get clear of this scrape,' returned the smuggler; and then lowering his voice he continued,—
               'Be careful how you speak of such matters, for we know not the man that hears us.'
               At that moment the peasant placed his hand in his bosom to withdraw his handkerchief, with which he wiped his face, and as he returned it he said,—
               'That was sorry work, young man, and I fear you will have to flee at once. You killed them both I believe.'
               George was upon the point of making an affirmative answer, which he intended to qualify by an explanation, when Wallingford laid his hand heavily upon his shoulder. George felt that hand tremble, and he cast a quick, anxious glance into the smuggler's face. One less skilled in reading the thoughts and feelings of the impetuous, open-hearted sons of the ocean might have failed to catch the meaning of the look that beamed from the dark face of Watt Wallingford, but George saw it in an instant,—he read there the simple, but still magic word, 'Silence!' and ere he had opportunity to reflect upon the strange manner, his companion said, in a free and unconcerned tone, addressing him by a false name,—
               'Mr. Vansey, will you step into the house and tell Mary to see that the remains of Mrs. Linwood are cared for, and tell her also that we shall be back before the funeral takes place; and while you are gone I will inquire further of our good friend here about the number and intentions of our pursuers.'
               As the smuggler closed the last remark he lowered his voice to a whisper, and speaking in a tone and manner unheard and unobserved by the peasant, he gasped,—
               'The cutlasses and the pistols—quick!'
               George was startled by the fierce fire that shot forth from Wallingford's eye as he spoke, but he saw in an instant that there was something imminent in the wind, and he failed not to compre- hend the full meaning of those whispered words, though he could not 
                     devine
                     divine
                   the nature nor the location of the danger.
               In less than two minutes George returned, and the moment he appeared upon the spot, Wallingford sprang like a tiger upon the peasant, seizing him by the throat with the right hand, while with the left he stopped the fellow's mouth. It was but the work of an instant for the powerful smuggler to bear his victim to the earth, where he easily held him with the left hand over the mouth, and turning to the amazed youth, he exclaimed,—
               'Hand me a pistol, quick!'
               Wallingford received the weapon, cocked it, and than aiming it at the head of the prostrate man, he said,—
               'If you utter one word other than in straightforward answer to my questions, a brace of bullets shall whistle through your brains on the instant! Now how many men have you with you, and where are they?'
               As Wallingford spoke he released his hold upon the mouth of the pretended peasant, and for the first time George saw the cause of his companion's first signal of danger. In the struggle the rough frock had been torn open, and beneath was revealed the uniform of a revenue officer. When the seeming countryman pulled his handkerchief from his breast the smuggler caught a glimpse of his concealed dress, and for the first time he suspected the truth. Until that moment the idea that the stranger was a spy had not entered his mind, but fortunately he had the presence of mind to conceal his emotion, and the result has been seen.
               'Let me up—let me up, and I will tell you all,' exclaimed the revealed officer, as he ineffectually struggled beneath the smuggler's knee.
               'Then up you get,' said Wallingford, as he removed his knee from the man's breast; 'but if I served you as you deserve I should shoot you at once,—under the mask of friendship thus to make us witnesses against ourselves. Now tell me where your men are.'
               'You've nearly broken my breast,' groaned the officer, as he placed his hand in seeming agony upon the afflicted part, while he bent over with pain.
               'Served you right,' returned Wallingford. 'Now answer my question, or I'll blow your brains to the four winds.'
               For once the smuggler was taken off his guard. The officer's pretended pain had completely deceived him, and hardly had the last threat escaped his lips when the spy whipped a pistol from his breast, and with a movement so quick that Wallingford could not prevent it he knocked the weapon that was pointed at his own head on one side, and levelled his in return.
               'If you raise your pistol, or move a step, you die!' exclaimed the officer in an exulting tone.
               For a moment Watt Wallingford came near losing his presence of mind, but 'twas only for that moment, for on the next he cooly laid his plan of operation. He knew that the officer must be a desperate fellow, for his conduct thus far had plainly evinced it, and moreover he must have been aware of the desperate character with which he had to deal in the person of the outlaw. It would not answer for George to offer resistance, for on the instant the aimed pistol would be discharged. The smuggler saw every point of his position in an instant, and he saw his only vantage.
               The party stood directly beneath the northern gable of the house, while the smuggler's back was towards it. Within six inches of Wallingford's heels lay a large stone which formed the first step to the door. He knew its exact location, and dropping the muzzle of his pistol still lower he exclaimed,—
               'Tell me your purpose, sir.'
               As he spoke he moved back a step, and stumbling carelessly against the stone, fell over backwards. The officer's pistol lowered as the accident happened, and for the instant he was thrown off his guard. George intuitively saw the object of the smuggler's fall, and quick as lightning he sprang upon the spy and wrenched the pistol from his grasp. Wallingford leaped to his feet, determined now that the contest should end, and without more ado he seized the fellow by the throat and by his own main strength dragged him into the house, where he secured him with strong cords about the ancles and wrists.
               'Now, sir,' said Wallingford, as he raised his prisoner to a chair, 'tell me where your party are.'
               'I have none,' sullenly answered the spy.
               'Do you mean to tell me that you came from the town unattended?'
               'Yes.'
               'Then you lie!' uttered the smuggler. 'But I'll make you tell the truth, or by all the saints in Christendom I'll tear your body limb from limb. If you know Watt Wallingford, you will know that he means just what he says.'
               At this instant Mary came running down from the chamber, and in breathless haste exclaimed,—
               'There's a party of soldiers coming up the road.'
               'From which way did they come?' asked the smuggler.
               'From the castle bridge.'
               Watt Wallingford started back for a moment, and gazed at his prisoner, then turning to Mary, he said,—
               'See that your business is attended to with the dead, and if yonder party visit the house tell them that I have fled. If a man dares to offer either insolence or violence, mark him well, and there shall be another death to answer for. George, secure your arms and follow me.'
               As Wallingford spoke he seized the bound man by the waist, and throwing him across his broad shoulders, he started out through the back passage. George Brumford cast one look towards the chamber where reposed the dead, and then followed his mysterious monitor.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               THE BELDAM.
               BACK from the house, towards the dense forest that reached to the Loyne river, led a narrow beaten track, and into its intricate windings Watt Wallingford darted with his prisoner, followed closely by George. After a distance of some twenty rods the party came to a small opening, through which ran a shallow brook that delivered up its waters into the Ken. Here Wallingford halted and shook the revenue officer from his shoulder, saying, as he did so,—
               'You were somewhat heated by passion a short time since, but I think here is a good opportunity for you to cool off a little, and so if you have no objections I will land you here.'
               As Wallingford spoke he dropped his load into the middle of the stream, and as the poor fellow flounced and sputtered in the ice-cold element, he made out to articulate,—
               'You shall suffer for this, you miserable cut-throat. You are a spotted man, and even though you escape now, you shall not run long at liberty.'
               'Very well,' returned the smuggler, with a light laugh, as he turned away from the spot, 'I am always ready for your people whenever they wish for my company, and in the meantime I wish you much joy of your bath.'
               Wallingford beckoned for George to follow him, and together the two struck off to the eastward. The narrow path became more and more intricate, until at length it presented to our hero no distinguishing features from the labyrinths 
                     beween
                     between
                   the low shrubbery that seemed to lead out on either hand, but the smuggler appeared well acquainted with the way, and he passed along through the bushes with a speed that George found it difficult to keep up with.
               'How much further shall we travel in this manner?' asked George, some fifteen minutes after they had left the revenue officer.
               'We shall keep on through the forest,' returned Wallingford, 'and perhaps cross the Loyne.'
               'But when shall we be able to return?'
               'Either to-night or to-morrow morning. On the banks of the river there is a party of gipseys, and if I mistake not we may get some assistance from them in the work we have before us.'
               'To what work do you allude,' asked George.
               'That of finding the papers which were stolen from your mother.'
               'And what can they know about them?'
               'They may know much. Young Linwood has often sought the assistance of these same gipseys in his evil works, and perhaps he has done so in this case. You know not, young man, through how many different means these forest wanderers operate. I think I should not hit very wide of the mark if I were to say that Gabriel Bellinger belonged to their tribe.'
               'The physician who attended my mother?' asked George, in surprise.
               'Yes.'
               'But from the way in which you spoke of him this morning I supposed that he was well known in the town as a physician.'
               'Not in the town,' returned the smuggler; 'but in the outskirts, around the thinly populated edges of the forest, he is quite noted for his medical knowledge, and he is, in truth, an excellent doctor, in consequence of which he finds plenty to do in the following of his avocation. This gives him an excellent opportunity to become acquainted with the affairs of the people, and he turns his knowledge to account in more ways than one.'
               'And do you think he had aught to do with the lost documents?'
               'I am confident of it.'
               'Then let us hunt him up,' said George; and then, as a new idea seemed to strike him, he continued,—
               'But suppose those papers have been destroyed.'
               'Then we must have the evidence of him who obtained them,' replied Wallingford. 'At all events we will make the trial. The arrival of the soldiers has disconcerted my plans but very little, for I had intended to seek the gipseys. They frequently assist us in getting our contraband goods across the country, and many of them are ready at any moment to do my bidding.'
               George made no immediate reply to the smuggler's remarks, but followed on in silence. The position in which he was now acting was a peculiar one. He felt that he had no definite plan of his own—no clear object of which he was in search, but he was merely following at the beck of another, and a train of circumstances and events over which he seemed to have no control had placed him where he could hardly be called the master of his own movements.
               That he was for the present bound to the smuggler's fortunes there was no denying, for not only was there a strange mystery in the keeping of that man which he desired to have solved, but by his unfortunate combat on the king's highway, the circumstances of which were known to the authorities, as had been shown by the remarks of the pretended peasant, he had laid himself liable to arrest, and he knew of no surer method, for the present, at least, of keeping clear of the officers than in remaining with the smuggler.
               An hour had passed since the two started from the small stream where they left the floundering spy, and the river Loyne was near at hand. George began to feel weak and exhausted from long fatigue and loss of sleep, and it was with difficulty that he could keep up with his guide who seemed to experience-but little, if any, inconvenience from the toils of the preceding night. Wallingford noticed his companion's difficulty, and just as the gentle rolling of the Loyne struck upon their ears, he remarked,—
               'We have but little further to go, so cheer up your spirits, and when we reach the camp you shall have opportunity to rest. Of one thing I wish to warn you—be on your guard, and not let a word slip from your tongue concerning the circumstances of your mother's death, or the loss of the papers, for it is necessary that your existence, even, should not be known in the gipsey camp.'
               'But what is the need of this secresy?' asked George.
               'Simply that young Albert Linwood may by no means ascertain that his rival heir is in this part of the kingdom, for, should he learn that fact, all our exertions might prove fruitless.'
               'Very well,' returned the young man, in a peculiar tone, 'I will follow your directions; but nevertheless—'
               'Well—what?' said Wallingford, as George hesitated in his remark.
               The smuggler turned as he spoke and fast- ened an inquiring look upon his follower — George caught the beaming expression of the dark, piercing eyes, but he could not fathom their meaning, and in a somewhat hesitating manner he said—
               'I was going to add that your conduct appears somewhat strange and incomprehensible.'
               'How so?' asked Wallingford, still keeping his eyes fastened upon the varying countenance of the youth.
               'Why, it all seems strange. Whatever information you have to communicate comes to me in detached fragments, and at various times, even though it be all a continuous tale. At one time you refuse to give me information, and perhaps in an hour afterwards you tell me all about it. Then your movements are curious to say the least.'
               'Perhaps you would say suspicious,' interrupted the smuggler.
               'They certainly would be, had I anything to suspect,' returned George, without hesitation; 'but I do not believe that you are deceiving me.'
               'Then rest assured that you shall be satisfied with the result of my endeavors.'
               As the smuggler spoke, he turned his gaze from his companion, and ere long they reached the western bank of the river. Wallingford had not mistaken his course, for within two rods of the spot where he emerged from the forest lay a small raft of withed logs, while upon the opposite side of the stream, within a few rods of the shore, arose the smoke of the gipsey camp.
               It was but the work of a few moments to pole the raft across the river, and ere long our hero, for the first time, found himself within the limits of a gipsey encampment. There were some fifty persons, all told, occupying a dozen tents, while near the outskirts had been erected two or three huts of brushwood. In the centre of the camp was arranged the apparatus for culinary purposes, and a few of the women were just beginning to make arrangements for dinner as our two acquaintances arrived.
               The leaders among the gipseys at once recognized Watt Wallingford, and so he was allowed to move among the tents without opposition, until he reached one farthest from the river, into which he entered, followed by George. The tent was occupied by an old man who was busily engaged in perusing the contents of a well-worn newspaper, and as the smuggler pushed aside the drapery that covered the entrance, the reader looked up from his paper, and was upon the point of giving utterance to an expression of anger, when he recognized his visitor.
               'Ah, Wallingford, is that you?' said the gipsey.
               'Yes, Harrold, you are right. You didn't expect me at this time, did you?'
               'Well, I thought you might seek us in your flight,' returned the gipsey, while a half concealed smile played around his features.
               'Flight?' repeated Wallingford, in surprise.
               'Ah, yes; I heard of your trouble,' said Harrold; 'or at least, I heard that the officers had traced you to the edge of Walling Moor. Ah,' he continued, as his eye fell upon the form of our hero, 'this is the man that settled the accounts of Jack Spencer and his lieutenant. I heard of it. Some of our folks came up from the town this morning.'
               'Such news flies rapidly, I know,' remarked the smuggler; 'but I have not exactly sought your camp for safety, for had that been my only desire, I should have turned my steps in a different direction. No, I came on business.'
               'With me?'
               'Perhaps so,' returned Wallingford. 'At any rate you shall know what I seek; but in the meantime let my companion have some sort of a couch upon which to repose himself, and we will take a stroll out of ear-shot from your busy people.'
               'Certainly,' said the gipsey, as he arose from his recumbent position. 'The young man shall have as good a resting place as my tent affords for he surely bears tokens of fatigue.'
               As Harrold spoke, he moved to the further extremity of the tent, where, from beneath a heap of goat skins he drew forth a large sack filled with fern, which he spread out upon the ground, and after having spread the goat skins upon it, he turned to George and remarked,—
               'There, Mr. Brumford, that may not be the softest kind of a bed, but if I'm not mistaken, you'll find it a vast deal pleasanter than none.'
               George was somewhat startled as the gipsey pronounced his name, but as the party whom he had accompanied up from Morecambe Bay knew it, it was not so wonderful after all, and so he very kindly thanked his host for his hospitality.
               Harrold and the smuggler soon left the tent, and as they got out of sight George laid himself down upon the rough bed. For several moments after the youth reposed his toil-worn frame upon the couch the events of the past went rushing through his mind in wild confusion, and 'twas some time ere he could collect his scattered senses upon any defined point, but when at length his mind became sufficiently composed it settled down upon the death-bed of his mother, but it dwelt not long upon the scene, for the power of fatigue gradually crept over his senses, and he would have dropped off into a deep sleep had he not felt a hand laid lightly upon his shoulder. With a powerful effort he shook off the grasp of the drowsy god, and raised himself upon his elbow.
               Kneeling by the side of his couch he saw the bright spirit phantom of his youthful vision — The same heavenly features beamed on him that smiled by his side on that fearful night when the Cyclops was dashed in pieces; the same bright effulgence glowed in her mild blue eyes, and though the youth knew 'twas but a phantom, yet he also knew that there was a startling reality in its presence, and he felt, too, that the omen was good to himself.
               'George,' whispered the presence, in a voice so sweet that its intonations sounded like the low murmurings of Eden, 'your goal is not yet won. Once, and only once again shall you see me ere your toilsome journey be completed.—Rest now in peace, and when you awake, remember my visit, and let it give new strength to your frame.'
               The youth had no power to speak, but with strained eyes he gazed upon the beautiful phantom until it gradually wasted away into the surrounding atmosphere, and then, while a soothing influence crept over his troubled mind he sank back upon his rough couch and was soon buried in a deep sleep.
               When George Brumford awoke from his sleep the sun was riding in the western heavens, and he knew by the long shadows that fell across the entrance of the tent that he had slept long. He arose to a sitting posture, and was upon the point of springing to his feet, when he was startled by what appeared at first to be a creation of his own overwrought imagination. but a moment's examination proved it to be an old woman who was sitting quietly upon a low stool at the foot of the couch. She was habited in a coarse brown mantle, the ample folds of which reached to her feet, while her hair, which was uncovered and unconfined, hung in matted masses of white and grey, about her neck. Her hands were shrivelled and embrowned by exposure, and as they rested upon the stout oaken staff which she carried for support, they looked not unlike the talons of the mountain eagle.
               'You have slept long, young sir,' remarked the singular being, as George sat gazing upon her in wonder.
               'Yes,' returned the youth, 'and I have slept well, too.'
               'So I should judge. The sun has told five hours since you slept, and three of them I have spent here in watching you.'
               'In watching me?' iterated George, as he arose to his feet and regarded his strange companion with an inquisitive look.
               'Aye,' returned the beldam, 'in watching you.'
               'And for what?'
               'That I might speak with thee.'
               'Very well,' returned George, who could not but feel a kind of awe in her presence, 'any thing that you may have to say will be listened to very attentively.'
               'Then take this stool and sit by my side.'
               Mechanically the young man obeyed the old woman's mandate, and having seated himself as requested, he waited with no little anxiety, for further developments.
               'Perhaps you don't believe that the power has ever been given to us of the human family to read the language of the unseen,' said the woman, as her young companion awaited her saying.
               'I believe anything of which I have evidence,' replied George.
               'But for that evidence you depend upon your senses.'
               'Certainly,' answered the youth, 'I depend upon my own senses for the evidence of all things.'
               'Then what evidence have you of the existence of God?'
               'I have the evidence of the highest and noblest of all my senses,—that innate monitor that points my soul to a Power above my own—a Power that could plan and create my moving, living, working, and thinking system.'
               'But that is the mere teaching of religion.'
               'Nay,—it is the language of the soul. If you would seek the man who sees evidence on of Deity, you must look for him among those who have too much teaching in the religion of this world. The soul untutored in the labyrinths of worldly wisdom stops not in its flight till it reaches the throne of the Infinite. The veriest savage that treads the footstool has conceived of a God—not that religion teaches him this, but because there is a principle in the bosom of every human being that cannot rest till it finds a Supreme power upon which to hang its hopes.'
               'Then you are prepared to believe some things of which you have no evidence save the approving voice of unbiassed reason,' said the old woman, as she drew her stool nearer to that of her companion, and gazed intently into his face.
               'Yes,' returned George, 'I am prepared to believe many things that would present to the casual observer no tangible evidence of their support.'
               For several moments the beldam sat in silence. She gazed with a fixed look into the face of George, and at times she seemed almost to be reading his very soul, so intently did she mark his every feature. At length she reached forth her skeleton fingers and clasped his hand with her own. He did not resist the movement but suffered her to open the palm, and for some minutes she eagerly traced the lines that ran to and fro across the surface of the skin.
               'Well,—and what do you see?' asked George, who began to lose the peculiar feeling of awe that the old woman's presence had at first created, as she began thus to operate in the pretended mysteries of her tribe.
               'I can see but little by your hand,' replied the gipsey woman, seeming to take no notice of the young man's tone. 'From this palm I can only read the past.'
               'And that I know better than you do.'
               'As well, perhaps; but I much doubt me if you know it better, young man.'
               'There is one thing, at least,' said George; 'I shall need no history of the past from you.'
               'No,' returned the old woman, with a look that might have been meant for a smile, 'Watt Wallingford has told thee all that.'
               'And did he tell me the truth?' exclaimed George, forgetting for the moment that he had just intimated that he desired no information from her on that point.
               For several moments the beldam made no answer. She had dropped the young man's hand, and sat intently regarding his features.—There was something in the expression of her sun-browned countenance that told of a deeper feeling than that of mere love of 'fortune telling,' and the youth began to feel more awestruck by her manner.
               'Did he tell me the truth?' repeated George, with increased anxiety, as he watched the old woman's changing features.
               'I will not unsay what he has said,' answered the gipsey, as she placed her hand upon the youth's brow and pushed back the wavy hair, 'but he spoke only from actual observation—of what he knew from the evidences of his seeing and hearing, while I can tell thee of the future.'
               
               George was not weak minded, nor was he prone to superstition; but the memory of his angel phantom, and the influence that it had exercised over his mind, led him to regard the pretended power of his present companion with more favor than he might otherwise have done. There was, to be sure, a kind of ominous darkness in the peculiar calling of the woman, but then everything connected with his own affairs wore the shade of an equally ominous mystery, and so he felt considerable interest in her assertions, and in a tone of much anxiety he said,—
               'If you can tell me of the future I am willing and ready to hear it.'
               'I can read your fate in your countenance,' uttered the old woman. 'The most important event of your life will ere long transpire. Good and evil are equally blended; though, truth to say, an angel form of peace and joy stands even now in your presence.'
               George started from his seat and gazed anxiously around the tent in expectation of seeing his angel visitant, but nothing save the meagre appurtenances of the gipsey habitation met his eyes, and he sat back upon his stool.
               'There is danger in your path,' continued the beldam, without seeming to notice her companion's manner; 'and secret enemies are lurking round your way. 'Tis necessary that the business that brought you to the gipsey camp should be quickly performed.'
               'Business?' repeated George.
               'Aye, young man—business. The papers that were stolen from your mother.'
               'Wallingford is—'
               George hesitated ere he spoke farther, for he knew not how much might depend upon the secresy of the smuggler's object, though all that Wallingford had bade him keep secret was already known to the fortune-teller. She noticed the hesitation, and while a kind of sarcastic smile dwelt upon her features, she said—
               'I know full well the object of your visit, and I know, too, that Wallingford is seeking even now for the lost papers; but without my assistance he never can find them.'
               'And do you know where they are?' breathlessly asked the young man, as he placed his hand upon the old woman's arm.
               'Yes,' replied the gipsey.
               'Are they safe?'
               'Yes.'
               'And can I obtain them?'
               'On certain conditions.'
               'Name them, — name them,' exclaimed George.
               'They are simply these: You shall deliver them up to Wallingford, who will at once place them in the hands of a justice; but you shall not tell him from whence you obtained them till you have seen me again. You must return with him to the Walling Moor, and as soon as the funeral of your mother is over you shall accompany the smuggler to Bristol. Will you promise this?'
               George hesitated.
               'They are the only conditions upon which you can obtain the papers.'
               'I will promise,' uttered the young man.
               As he spoke the old woman took from a leathern pouch that hung within the folds of her robe a small package of papers and placed them in the hands of George. He was upon the point of examining them when a heavy footfall was heard without, and at a sign from the old woman he placed them quickly within his bosom. On the next instant Watt Wallingford entered the tent.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               THE MYSTERIOUS CYPHER.
               IT was dark when Wallingford and George reached the house from whence they started in the morning, and everything in the neighborhood seemed quiet and peaceable. From Mary they learned that the officers had been there, but they had offered no violence, and upon learning that the smuggler and his young accomplice had escaped, they had marched off towards the forest, seeming to strike a path that led to the southward and eastward.
               The smuggler was overjoyed when he learned that George had the papers, and he had too much good sense to urge the point as to the source from whence they were obtained, though, from all appearances, he was able to judge pretty nearly the truth. On the following day the mortal remains of Mrs. Linwood were deposited in their last resting place, and George shed his tears freely over the mound that rose above the grave. As he turned from the spot, the feelings that welled up in his bosom were nearly overpowering; but yet the horizon of his future looked brighter than before, for he had obtained the evidences of his heirship,—or, at least, he had every reason to believe so. The documents he had received from the gipsey were sealed, but even though he had not seen their contents, still he knew they contained the evidence of his rights.
               On the afternoon of the day of the funeral George accompanied the smuggler to the 
                     justce's
                     justice's
                  , in whose hands the papers were to be placed, and after waiting a few minutes in the hall they were admitted to the office.
               'Mr. Walton, I believe,' said Wallingford, as he entered.
               'At your service,' replied the old attorney.
               'Then here are the papers belonging to the late Mrs. Linwood, and to your care we entrust them for execution.'
               'Have the seals been broken?' asked Walton, as he took the package.
               'Not to my knowledge,' returned the smuggler.
               'In your presence, then, I will open them.'
               As the justice spoke he broke the seal of the first paper and ran his eyes over the contents.—Then laying it aside he broke open the next, and so on until he reached the fourth. As he was upon the point of laying this one aside, a cypher at the bottom caught his eye, and for several moments he studied its meaning.
               'Here is something I cannot translate,' said he, as for the seventh time he studied the strange hieroglyphics.
               'Let me look at it,' said Wallingford, as he stepped towards the desk.
               The smuggler took the paper and for the space of a minute he gazed steadily upon the characters. Gradually a dark frown gathered upon his brow and a tremor shook his frame which increased as he proceeded.
               'Can you make them out?' asked Mr. Walton, as the paper was returned to him.
               'No, sir,' answered Wallingford.
               'But they seem to affect you.'
               ''Twas not the figures there that affected me, sir,' returned the smuggler without hesitation. 'I was thinking of the time when these papers were drawn up, and of her who has since died.'
               'Then you can make nothing of them.'
               'No.'
               'It cannot be that they were put upon the paper at the same time when the other statements were drawn up,' said the attorney, as he examined the hieroglyphics again, and compared them with the rest of the writing, 'for they are written with altogether different ink, and also bear unmistakable marks of having been executed quite recently.'
               'Well,' said Wallingford, 'be that as it may, you can examine the papers and prepare for their execution, for I wot that none will dare to dispute them.'
               Mr. Walton promised to attend faithfully to the trust, and also that he would keep the affair strictly private until he received further orders.
               After the two men left the attorney's office they walked some way in silence,—George reflecting upon the startling events that had been crowded so plentifully into the few past days, and Wallingford murmuring to himself in broken, disjointed ejaculations, the purport of which his companion could not comprehend.
               At length Wallingford turned to the youth, and said,—
               'Brumford, your received those papers from old Maud.'
               'Maud? Who is she?'
               'The gipsey woman with whom I found you conversing.'
               'Well,' George replied, 'if you know, there is no need of my implicating myself.'
               'Certainly not,—but I know they have been in her possession.'
               'How so?'
               'Simply because that cypher was hers.'
               'Do you mean that the old woman made those mysterious characters upon the paper?'
               
               'Yes.'
               'It is curious, surely,' said George to himself, 'that she should have placed them there, for no one will be able to make them out.'
               'Make them out,' repeated Wallingford, as he gazed into the face of his 
                     compaion
                     companion
                  , 'why, they were addressed to me.'
               'But you could not read them.'
               'Not in the presence of Mr. Walton.'
               'And could you read them at all?'
               'As plainly as you could have read what was above them.'
               'But why should she have written to you upon the margin of that paper, when she evidently desired that you should not know that she had had possession of it?'
               'She did not mean that I should have seen it until my return from Bristol,' replied Wallingford, 'for she pretends to explain a matter that she speaks of as having happened during the trip.'
               'Then it does not concern me,' uttered George, in a tone that plainly indicated 
                     considable
                     considerable
                   uneasiness.
               'More than it does me.'
               'If it concerns me, then I wish you would explain,' said George, over whose mind the events of his interview with the gipsey women came with more force than ever.
               'That is the trouble,' answered the smuggler, in a kind of thoughtful mood. 'I cannot explain it to myself, even though the language is plain and simple, for, as I have told you, it is in excuse, or rather in explanation, of something which has not yet happened, but which is to happen to you.'
               'But you must have gathered some information from it,' urged George.
               'No,—nothing that I can comprehend.'
               The smuggler spoke decidedly, but still the youth could see that he knew more than he chose to impart,—or, at least, that he suspected a great deal more than he admitted, but he soon found that farther questioning would avail him nothing, so he said nothing more about it.
               That night Wallingford and George started for the Morecambe. The sky was clear and star-spangled, the weather comfortable, and long ere morning they were once more upon the deck of the smuggler brig.
               Hardly had the sun peeped up over the forest trees to the eastward when the anchors were hove up, the sails set, and with a fresh nor'-westerly breeze sweeping down through the Irish channel, the brig started from the bay, and as soon as the courses were set and the topgallant sails hoisted she ran off ten and a half knots. Before noon the Isle of Man bore N. N. W., and two reefs more taken in the topsails and the topgallant sails set over them. At dark, Holyhead light was left upon the larboard quarter, and the smuggler entered St. George's Channel with the wind nearly astern.
               On the next morning the wind had gradually hauled round to the westward, and, as the sun rose, it lulled into a perfect calm, while a few dark clouds began to pile up away to the south'rd and east'rd.
               'There's a gale in those fellows,' said George, as he and Wallingford stood upon the quarter-deck, at the same time pointing towards the rising clouds.
               'Aye, and a smart one, too,' returned Wallingford. 'We shall catch it with the tide.'
               'A regular sou'-wester, that'll be,' said Blankworth, who had the wheel.
               For several moments the smuggler captain kept his eye fastened upon the clouds, and then turning to the men, he ordered the topgallant sails to be taken in. The topsails still had two reefs in them, but as soon as the topgallant sails were furled, the yards were sent on deck, and the third reef taken in the topsails.
               A light spitting gust occasionally swept across the channel from the Irish coast, but there was no wind in the sails.
               The clouds which had started up from the horizon began to roll up higher and higher, piling their black dimensions like threatening giants against the heavens, until at length they cast their gloomy shadow far o'er the sea. A thick, chilling haze gradually overspread the blue vault, and almost before the seamen were aware of the fact the sun was shut out from sight.
               The occasional gust from the westward still continued to spit their wreath over the water, but their force was diminishing, and at length they ceased altogether.
               The clouds had piled themselves up till they reached the zenith, and they now began to spread their blackness away to the northward and eastward, while a low murmuring, the source of which was not perceptible, arose like a whispering monitor over the ink-black water.
               'It's coming,' said Wallingford, as he cast his eyes around upon the rigging. 'Stand by to take the courses, clewlines and buntlines.—Let go the tacks and sheets and clew up. Lay aloft and furl all snug. Be lively, now, or the storm'll overhaul you.'
               Hardly were the courses furled and the yards pointed in the direction of the coming gale, when the sea to the south'rd and west'rd began to turn its waves over into white, foamy caps, and ere long a few flashing gusts came sweeping over the channel. The clouds had lost their jet-black-hue, and had assumed instead a kind of lurid glare, which lent a still deeper horror to the scene.
               Life-lines were rove fore and aft, from the taffrail to the night-heads, and also from rail to rail.
               The brig was now off the Welsh coast of Pembrokeshire, the land not being over fifteen miles distant. Several sweeping squalls had bounded along over the water, as if to herald the coming of the storm, and ere long the mighty giant came roaring and crashing in his unrestrained fury.
               The brig careened like a frightened bird as the gale burst upon her, and for several minutes her decks were literally buried in the white foam; but she had been built for the channel trade, and she was not unacquainted with the storm.
               'We must give her a full,' said Wallingford, as his vessel came bounding up from the first concussion.
               'Will she stand it?' asked George.
               'She must stand it. The tide is setting up the channel, and if we lay-to we shall most assuredly go ashore. An hour's run will put us beyond all harm, and we shall have the full scope of the Bristol Channel.'
               'Let her fall off three points! Round in the weather braces!'
               The men trembled as they heard this order, but they knew that their captain meant what he said, and they obeyed it.
               'Stand by to set the stay-sails fore and aft!' thundered the smuggler captain.
               The sea had not yet risen sufficiently to take the wind out of the lower sails, and the moment the staysail sheets were hauled aft the brig began to fly through the water like a feather upon the bosom of the hill-side blast. The lee-rail dipped beneath the surging flood, and it seemed at every moment as though the brig was going over, but still Watt Wallingford kept the sail on until the rising sea had rendered the staysails utterly useless, when he had them taken in.
               Three-quarters of an hour had elapsed, and still the flying vessel took the gale nearly abeam. It was a fearful experiment, but it was the only alternative. At the end of that time, just as the hearts of the men were beginning to sink with overwhelming dread, Wallingford sprang to the wheel and in a voice that arose above the gale, he shouted,—
               'Jump to the lee braces! Lay aft fore-top-men and stand by to take in the fore-topsail!'
               Ere long the brig was laying-to under a close-reefed maintopsail, and all hands felt that, for the present, at least, they were out of danger; but though the rock-bound coast of Pembrokeshire was cleared, still they knew that there was a long and dangerous lee shore between them and safety.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               THE GALE.
               FOR three hours the smuggler brig lay to in safety, but at the end of that time Wallingford began to entertain fears that she would not be able to stand it much longer. The gale had increased, and the seas, which swept in from the broad Atlantic, broke in unrelenting fury over the struggling vessel. The brig was upon the starboard tack, heading about south-east, while the Welsh coast was only about twenty miles to the leeward, and the vessel was every moment drifting towards it.
               'If I thought we could make the mouth of the Towy I'd put her before it,' said Wallingford.
               'How does the river bear?' asked George.
               'As near as I can judge it must be dead to leeward of us.'
               'Then I should advise you to do it, for the brig will certainly be swamped if she lays up to this sea much longer.'
               'She cannot lay up to it,' returned Wallingford, as a huge sea came tumbling over the deck. 'I must put her before it and run the risk of making the river.'
               'How many knots will the brig run off under bare poles?'
               'That's hard to tell,' replied Wallingford. 'This wind is strong enough to set us through the water eight or nine knots, and then we have a strong current setting to the eastward up the Bristol Channel. Three hours, at least, will bring us up.'
               As the captain spoke he let go of the main brace upon which he had been holding and went to the binnacle. His situation was perplexing in the extreme, for he saw that his vessel could not weather the gale as she now lay, as she was already under the water half the time, and then to scud, which was the only alternative, seemed almost hopeless, for if, by any chance, he should miss the entrance to the Towy utter destruction was certain. The coast of Caermarthenshire was by no means a desirable landing place in such a gale.
               'I must try it,' said Wallingford, as he stepped back.
               'It's rather dangerous business,' returned George with a shudder.
               'I know it, but it must be done.'
               Hardly had the words fallen from the smuggler captain's lips when a sea, more powerful than any of its predecessors, came rolling down, and as it struck the brig it completely buried her within its surging bosom. For several moments the stricken bark groaned and trembled beneath the shock, and when she at length struggled up from the sea her main topsail sheets were carried away, and in a moment more the sail was blown into ribbons.
               'Up with the helm!' shouted Wallingford, as soon as the briny flood had cleared the deck. 'Up with it quick. Jump to the braces and lay the yards square.'
               In a short time the brig was fairly before the gale, and she rode much easier. The log was thrown, and she was found to be going nine knots, while the tide current was setting to the eastward not less than three.
               'Two hours and a half will tell us our fate,' said Wallingford, as he heard the report from the man who threw the log.
               'God grant that it may be a safe one, at all events,' uttered George.
               'There's a chance for your prayers, sir,' seriously remarked Pettrell, who stood near the wheel, conning the vessel.
               'Aye,' returned the young man, 'and there's also a chance for your seamanship, for if you let her get off into the trough of this sea you've seen the last of your brig.'
               There was no difficulty, however, in keeping the vessel before the wind, for she went through the water with a velocity that rendered her steerage-way safe and easy. Two look-outs were stationed at the fore-topmast crosstrees, and two more at the bows, while the anchors were cleared, and the cables got ready for running.
               An hour passed away, and still the brig flew on over the heaving sea. The decisive moment was drawing nigh, and men who had faced the king's officers a thousand times trembled and turned pale at the thoughts of the invisible foe!
               Fifteen minutes more were told, and just as the last sand dropped through the glass, one of the look-outs at the fore-topmast head shouted,—
               'Land ho!'
               The wind howled in its might, and the sea roared in its dashing fury, but high above the crash of the contending elements—more distinct than the thunder claps of heaven, came that voice from the mast-head!
               Wallingford seized his trumpet. Every nerve in his herculean frame was strung to its utmost, and the muscles worked like the laboring sinews of the iron horse.
               'Mast-head, there!'
               'Hallo.'
               'How does that land bear?'
               'It's right ahead, sir.'
               'Take your glass and run it along on the starboard bow,' exclaimed Wallingford, as he started further forward. 'Watch for the rise.—Now's your chance!'
               As the captain gave utterance to his last words in a tone of startling energy, the brig rose upon the summit of a towering sea and all around, as far as the eye could reach, the breaking mountain-crests were seen rising like Nubian giants against the fiery horizon.
               For a full minute the brig maintained her elevated position, and as she again sank into the deep trough, the captain hailed the look-out, but in a tone that carried fear in its very utterance,—
               'What did you make out?'
               'There's a break in the shore about a point and a half on the starboard bow.'
               'Did you see on the other side?'
               'Yes,—the land breaks about the same on the larboard bow.'
               'Great God be praised!' ejaculated Watt Wallingford, as he actually dropped his trumpet from the sudden relaxation of his overstrained muscles. 'Mr. Brumford, we are safe!'
               'Safe!' iterated George, hardly believing that he had heard aright.
               'Yes,—SAFE! We have the Towy upon our starboard bow, and the Cathy on our larboard. She'll stand a close reefed fore-topsail easy enough before the gale, and under that we can run into the river. I know every inch of the way.'
               Wallingford picked up his trumpet and turned aft. Hope beamed from his countenance, and his men caught the feeling, and under its influence they were prepared to work with a will.
               'Lay aloft and loose the fore-topsail,' shouted the captain. 'See that the sheets are clear.'
               The gasket was soon cast off, and the sail fluttered and snapped in the gale.
               'Ease off the buntlines, and the starboard clueline. Man the starboard sheet. Haul home with a will.'
               The men strained every muscle to the task, and the starboard clue came safely and snugly down to the fore-yard-arm. The larboard sheet was then hauled home, and the yard hoisted clear of the cap.
               Watt Wallingford took his station forward and stood by to con the vessel, while George stood by at the gangway to pass the orders to the helmsman.
               Ere long the high headland began to loom up over the seas, and the brig was put off two points to the eastward. On dashed the storm-driven bark, and nearer and nearer came the foam-riven coast.
               'Port!' shouted Wallingford.
               'Port,' repeated George; and Pettrell gave her a couple of spokes of lee helm.
               'Steady.'
               'Steady it is.'
               'Starboard—quick!'
               'Starboard it is.'
               A projecting cliff towered up on the starboard bow, and as the brig flew by, it almost grazed her yard-arms, but she weathered it in safety, and in a moment more the helm was put a-port, and the vessel was fairly within the river. The sea rolled less heavily, the gale roared less fiercely, and the smuggler's crew felt that the danger was passed!
               'Stand by to take in the fore-topsail,' shouted Wallingford, as he sprang aft. 'Clear everything from the cables. Ease off the sheets and clue up.'
               The moment the topsail was taken off the brig was checked, for the land broke the force of the wind upon her hull, and when the starboard anchor was let go, she swang easily head-to. The larboard anchor soon followed, and the smuggler was safe!
               On the next morning the storm had abated, and the sun rose clear and bright from its eastern home. Wallingford had been in deep thought since he arose from his night's rest, and just after breakfast he lowered his boat and pulled on shore. It was ten o'clock when he returned, and taking George into the cabin, he said,—
               'George, I believe I shall go to Bristol by land.'
               'How? By land?' iterated the young man, in astonishment.
               'Yes,—by land.'
               'And for what reason?'
               'For two reasons. There is a cargo of tea and coffee a few miles up Cathy which must be carried back to Lancashire, and if I take the brig to Bristol I shall lose the chance; and then there's a frigate and a sloop-of-war in the channel, neither of which I am particularly desirous of meeting. From here to Landaff is only fifty miles, and from thence a packet will take us directly across.'
               'Perhaps it will do for you,' said George, in a kind of hesitating manner, 'but with me it may be somewhat different.'
               'How so, pray? You can apprehend no danger.'
               'No, not danger exactly.'
               'Well, what then?'
               'Why, to tell you the truth, my pockets are getting to be rather light.'
               'So, so,—and is that all?' returned the smuggler with a smile.
               'And is it not enough? My money is all at the bank in Liverpool.'
               'Hold on a moment,' said Wallingford, while a peculiar twinkle played merrily in his eye.
               As he spoke he took a small key from his pocket and opened a locker which was built in at the head of his bunk, and when he returned he placed a roll in the youth's hand, saying, as he did so,—
               'There, that you shall have without interest, and if you are ever able to pay me I will receive it back.'
               George opened the roll and found it to contain three fifty pound notes and twenty golden sovereigns. He knew too much of the character of his companion to object to the loan, and so he thankfully said,—
               'I shall certainly accept of your offer, and now I am as ready to go by land as you can wish, provided however, that there is good conveyance.'
               'There is the best of conveyance between Caermarthen and Landaff. We can take the coach early to-morrow morning, and take our night's rest on board the Bristol packet.
               That night all was prepared for the departure. At sundown the brig dropped down with the tide and put to sea, while George and Wallingford took up their quarters in the town, and in forty-eight hours from that time they were safely landed in Bristol.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               A FEARFUL REVELATION.
               ON the third morning after our hero left Caermarthen, one of the servants at the hotel where he stopped beckoned to him as he came from his room, plainly evincing a desire to speak with him in private.
               'Is this Mr. Brumford?' asked the servant as George followed him to a distant part of the hall.
               'Yes,' replied George.
               'Is it George Brumford?'
               'Yes.'
               'And you were mate of the ship Lenox,' interrogatively continued the servant.
               George was a little surprised at the fellow's inquisitiveness, but he nevertheless gave an affirmative answer, and then added,—
               'Now perhaps you will tell me what your business is.'
               'I was directed to give you this letter,' replied the servant, as he handed over a sealed note.
               'And why need you have asked so many questions when your errand was so simple?' asked George in a tone that plainly implied a chagrin which he had no desire to conceal.
               'Because, sir, I had orders not to deliver the letter till I was sure you were the person for whom it was intended.'
               'Very well,' returned the young man, forgetting his momentary anger in an eager desire to see the inside of the note.
               As he spoke he turned back to his room, and breaking the seal, he read as follows:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              'BRISTOL, —
                           
                           'MR BRUMFORD —By the merest accident I learned, just as I had prepared to depart, that you were in this city, but it was too late for me to call on you. Our family is in Bath, and I shall have joined them ere you receive this. We shall remain there a week, and perhaps longer. Come to us as soon as possible. A strange tale has reached my ears since I saw you last, and I long to learn its truth. My father will of course treat you coolly, for he knows of your affection for Jane, but under my care you shall be safe from harm.
                           
                              'Yours,
                              RICHARD LIVINGSTON.'
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Again and again did George peruse this strange epistle, but he was at a loss to comprehend its true meaning. The only idea that he could fasten in his mind as at all reasonable was, that Richard had by some means learned of his adventure with the smugglers, and that he was suspected of having participated with them in their unlawful traffic. Such an idea was by no means agreeable, but as it appeared the most plausible he was forced to give it the preference. Then the assurance that he should be safe from harm under the care of Richard Livingston, seemed to imply that there was harm to be anticipated from some quarter, and the supposition at issue was the only one on which he could found such a result.
               But be this as it might, he was determined that he would go to Bath, once more to see her whom he loved better than life itself, and, if needs be, to exculpate himself from the imputation which he thought might have been cast upon his character. But he could not go under two or three days, at least, for Wallingford had gone off into the country towards Tiverton after information respecting the business of his mother's estates, and he had promised to remain in Bristol until his return; so he resolved that he would remain till the smuggler's return, and then go to Bath.
               Towards the close of the third day after George received the note from Richard Livingston Watt Wallingford returned from his journey. He had travelled hard, and gave evident signs of fatigue, and George thought he discovered a kind of gloom in his manner that was altogether unusual to him. He had seen the smuggler under the most trying circumstances, when danger threatened him on every hand, but he had never before seen him dejected as at present. His own fate seemed in a measure to be united with that of the outlaw, and hence he felt that if Wallingford had failed in his undertaking his own happiness might be at stake.
               Of the nature of the smuggler's mission George had no clear idea. He knew that it concerned the mysterious affair that had become wrapped like a dense cloud about himself, but he could no more see through it than he could penetrate the remotest corner of the heavens with his naked eye. He knew that there was something in the future for him,—Hope told him 'twas Good; Fear told him 'twas Evil, and he felt sure that Watt Wallinglord had something to do with it. The smuggler had wept when his mother died—he had been urgent in securing her rights, and for all his life of crime, he knew that few hearts were capable of more kindly or noble feeling than was that of the Wrecking Smuggler of the Ken.
               George Brumford followed Wallingford to his room as soon as the latter had taken a little refreshment, and anxiously awaited to hear the result of his mission.
               'George,' said the smuggler, as soon as the door was closed behind them, 'we have been deceived.'
               'Deceived?'
               'Aye,—deceived.'
               'But how? In what?'
               'In everything that pertains to our visit to this place, and in my tramp to Bridgewater.'
               'Who has deceived us?'
               'Old Maud has led us off from the chase.'
               'But what chase? How has she deceived us?' asked George with considerable anxiety. 'You seen to forget that I have as yet known nothing of the purpose of this chase.'
               'True, true,' uttered Wallingford, as he sank back into a chair, 'and I knew nothing clearly; but we've been sent down here for nothing,—aye,' continued the smuggler, with startling energy, as he rose from the seat he had just taken, and commenced pacing the room, 'we've come for a worse than useless tramp. There are no papers here—nothing in the world that has the least bearing upon the matter.'
               'But what can have been the old woman's object in doing this?'
               'What? Why, that Albert Linwood might step in and take the estates.'
               There was something so fierce—so strangely startling in the manner and tone of the smuggler that George began to fear the worst, and laying his hand upon the trembling arm of his companion, he uttered,—
               'Tell me, Wallingford,—tell me,—do you know more?'
               'Would you hear all?
               'Yes,—only tell me the truth, straight-forward and plainly.'
               'Then read that,' said the smuggler, as he handed a letter, post-marked at Kendal, to the trembling youth.
               George took the letter, and read the following,—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              'KENDAL, —
                           
                           'WALLINGFORD,—Mr. Albert Linwood has presented powers from the Crown, and taken the papers relating to the Linwood estate, and by a special grant from the Attorney General he has taken full possession; consequently the business relating to your claim is at an end. Further particulars I will explain when I see you.
                           
                              'Yours,
                              T. WALTON.'
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               For some time after George finished this note he sat like one entranced. All the visions of the future were swept away except that one dark image towards which Fear had pointed. But could it be possible that there was anything else still to come upon him. The extreme agitation of Watt Wallingford was surely founded upon something more serious than the mere loss of the estates—perhaps he, too, had an interest in them.
               'Well, what do you think of that?' asked the smuggler, as George returned the letter.
               'It seems that the property is gone,' replied George, in an abstracted manner.
               'Aye, and past recovery,' added Wallingford.
               'Well,—I never knew what it was to possess it, and consequently I shall suffer nothing by the loss.'
               George said this partly because he felt it, and partly to bring out the full truth from his companion, which he thought might be more quickly arrived at if he affected a kind of indifference than if he should appear anxious about the matter,—though in truth he did feel the most intense anxiety.
               The smuggler paced up and down the apartment like a chafed lion. The veins about his neck and temples were swollen almost to blackness, while his hands and teeth were clenched like the grip of a vice. At length he stopped in front of George, and while he seemed struggling to keep down his emotions, he said,—
               'Boy, you know not what you have lost by this unholy act!'
               'Lost!—Me!—Lost!'—ejaculated George, springing from his seat and grasping Watt Wallingford by the arm, while a horrible suspicion—a suspicion that struck like an ice-bolt to his heart—shot through his brain.
               'YES!' almost thundered the smuggler, as he endeavored to shake off the grasp of his young companion. 'LOST! And I, too, have lost!'
               Watt Wallingford was powerful, but he could not shake off the grip that was now laid upon him. The youth had iron nerves, and now that they were tempered by the fearful vision that rose like a demon before him, he might have proved a dangerous enemy even to the dreaded champion of the Ken.
               'I know we have lost the estates,' said George, 'and I suppose they are past redemption, but we can have lost no more.'
               'George Brumford,' uttered Wallingford, suddenly changing his tone to one of deep and heartfelt solemnity, 'in this blow I have received a shock such as the storm-dashed rocks of Caermarthenshire might never have given,—and you—you—have lost more!'
               'In Heaven's name, sir, I conjure you to tell me what you mean.'
               'And can you not see it?'
               'Indeed I cannot.'
               'Not when the son fails to inherit the estates of the mother?'
               'No, no,—unless—'
               George hesitated ere he spoke further, for the thought that had come up for utterance he dared not trust to the air of heaven.
               'Shall I tell you all?' asked the smuggler, as he fastened his flashing eyes upon his companion,
               'Yes, yes,' gasped the youth.
               'Then, sir, the BASTARD cannot succeed to this property!'
               The young man's hand dropped powerless from its grasp, and he sank back into a chair. No groan, no sigh, no word escaped his lips; but with eyes all tearless he gazed up into the face of the smuggler. What a wreck was there! His frail bark of earthly good had been dashed upon the rock, and not the fragment of a hope was left! Suddenly a spark lit up his eye, and, like one who sees a floating fragment sweeping past when the ocean grave is already yawning beneath him, he sprang forward and laid his hand upon his companion's arm, asking, as he did so,—
               'Wallingford, is this thing true?'
               'I do not believe it. As there is a God in heaven I believe it is false—false as hell!'
               'And you—you,' urged the youth—'tell me how you are connected with this matter.'
               'George, your mother was my sister.'
               'Sister?'
               'Yes.'
               'Why have you not told me of this before?'
               'Because I did not wish to have you know that you were so nearly related to the notorious wrecking smuggler.'
               'And to save my own feelings you have kept this thing from me.'
               'Certainly.'
               'Well, I can appreciate your kindness, but still I believe that a heart like yours chose not the smuggler's profession without strong provocation.'
               'Provocation!' repeated Wallingford, seeming to forget the blow of the present in the recollection of wrongs that came back from the past. 'I did have provocation, boy,—such provocation as would have made some men renounce their country. But the tale is too long to tell thee now,—at some time you shall have it.'
               For several moments George remained silent, but at length, murmuring to himself rather than speaking to the smuggler, he said,—
               'Oh! could I but prove that the horrible imputation were false,—that my mother was indeed pure from such damning stain, I would let them take the estates in welcome. They may take all, even to my family name, if they will but leave me my own and my mother's honor!'
               'Courage, courage,' answered Wallingford, who had fairly conquered the first bursts of his heated indignation and passion; 'we may yet find the proofs, for if they exist upon the face of the earth I will drag them forth to light.'
               'And still,' uttered George, 'the courts have decided the matter, and whatever proofs we may bring, the law,—aye, and the world, will look upon me as the offspring of shame.'
               'Perhaps it is so.'
               'It must be so!' Oh, would to God that I had never seen the light of day!'
               'But what care you for the world?' exclaimed the smuggler. 'If you can feel in your heart that your soul is pure, why should you care for the opinions of others?'
               'Ah, Wallingford, you have not the same young, ambitious heart that beats within my bosom. To one like you, who have set at bold defiance the world, its opinions can be of but little avail; but to me the world is everything. Towards its honors and its virtues I have looked with longing eyes, but now, alas! the bright vision has faded forever away. A mark has been set for the finger of scorn, and I may not turn it aside. No, no,—you cannot console me thus.'
               The bold and reckless smuggler felt the truth of his companion's remarks, and he could not but honor the sentiments which prompted them, and so he remarked,—
               'Perhaps you are right. I would not lead you to the hazardous profession that I follow, but, at all events, we will return to Kendal immediately and see what can be done.'
               'Immediately?'
               'Yes. Why not?'
               George hesitated.
               'You have no other engagement.'
               'Not an engagement, but I have been requested to go to Bath to meet some old friends. It will take but a day or two, and then we will return.'
               'But a day or two may make a vast deal of difference. You can certainly have no other business so pressing as this.'
               While the smuggler spoke he kept his keen eyes fastened upon the varying countenance of his young companion, and after a moment's pause he added,—
               'You were going up there to see the Livingston's.'
               'How did you know?'
               'Because I heard that they were there.'
               'Well, and why should I not go?'
               'You may go,' returned Wallingford, in a tone half bitter and half sad. 'I know the fatal worm that gnaws at your heart, and I know, too, how fondly you have cherished it there; but what beacon do you steer by now? You know full well that, had you even gained your mother's estates, you might never have wedded with the lordly lady of Livingston, but now—now that—'
               'Stop! stop!' exclaimed George, as he clasped his hands over his eyes, as if to shut out the fearful vision that the smuggler's half uttered sentence had called up. 'I will not go.'
               Watt Wallingford gazed for a moment into the tear-wet face of the now weeping youth, and then, brushing back a tear that started to his own eye, he said,—
               'I will go and secure a passage, and in the meantime be not too despondent, for if the worst should come, you have yet a wider world than England in which to live. America has open arms for the honest man, and to her hospitable shores you need not carry the imputation of a shame that was no fault of yours.'
               'Oh, God!' murmured the stricken youth, as the door closed behind the form of the departing smuggler, 'what a blow is this! The world! What is the world to me without the hope of obtaining her towards whom my heart goes forth in its only earthly love! Gone! gone!—alas! all that made life worth laboring for has departed, and my soul sinks in the sea of utter darkness. No, Jane, I will not see thee,—I will not again dwell within the influence of that heavenly smile which can only sink the shaft still deeper into my bleeding heart. Farewell! Farewell forever!'
               George Brumford leaned his aching brow upon his hand, and the hot tears flowed freely forth. This was the darkest moment that had ever shed its influence over the horizon of his future, and not a single ray of light could struggle through the gloom.
               Five minutes, perhaps, had he sat thus, when a soft breath seemed to fan his heated temples, and a gentle whisper reached his ear:
               'Once again, George,—once again! There is a God in Heaven, and God is Love!'
               George Brumford started from his half recumbent position and gazed upon the Phantom that had so often appeared to him in times of darkness and danger. The form was radiant and lovely, but it appeared not so brilliant as formerly, and even while the youth gazed upon it, the vision faded from his sight, but ere the bright emanation had entirely gone the same gentle voice whispered still,—
               'Once again,—once again. There is light in Heaven,—let it shine on earth.'
               George started up and eagerly listened, but he heard no more. All was still and quiet, save the boundings of his own heart, which had shaken off the heavy load that oppressed it, and now leaped once more in its narrow prison.
               Was there a hope in his bosom? Perhaps there was; but yet the gaunt spectre of stern reality stood boldly forward, and beyond its som- bre shade hope could make but little headway.
               Strange, strange indeed were the circumstances that surrounded him, and deep and inexplicable was the mystery that hung like a pall about him. Back as far as his memory could reach ran the thread of a riddle which he had not yet solved, and which, perhaps, might never be solved. Time—the only key to the Future—alone could do it.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               THE ARREST.
               AT one of the piers which make out into the Avon, nearly a mile below the city of Bristol, lay a small packet bound for Holy-head, and on board this craft Watt Wallingford had secured berths for himself and George. The tide turned on the ebb at nine o'clock in the evening, and at that time the packet was to drop down.
               It was quite dark when our two friends left the hotel, and for a long way on their walk neither of them broke the silence, but at length, as they left the more thickly populated part of the city behind them, George remarked to his companion, in a tone somewhat pointed with grief,—
               'Again we are on the move, and I doubt much if there be anything come of it but disappointment.'
               'We can try, at all events,' returned Wallingford.
               'And in what direction do you intend to aim your researches?'
               'First I shall seek the attorney, and then, if there be need, I shall hunt up Maud, for I am confident that she knows something of your mother's affairs.'
               'Ah,' uttered George, as the mention of the old gipsey woman's name brought the subject to his mind, 'now you can tell me the purport of that mysterious cypher that she placed upon the margin of the deed.'
               'Yes, I can tell you what she wrote; but she has deceived me.'
               'But it was something concerning me that she wrote.'
               'Yes.'
               'Then what was it?'
               'You of course understand that your mother had, and probably it is so even now, relations of her husband.'
               'Yes,—you have told me of this.'
               'Well, to them I intended to look for aid in substantiating her marriage with Mr. Linwood, and the writing of Maud directed me to find them in Bridgewater, and she also said that I must not be surprised at anything that might happen to you, for there were circumstances connected with your life of which I had not the remotest idea.'
               'But what could she mean by that?'
               'Mean? Why, she meant to blind my eyes—get me off down here on a fruitless search while Albert Linwood stepped into the estate.'
               'But she directed me to give you the papers,' suggested George, 'and surely she would not have done that had she desired to do as you suspect.'
               'There you're wrong. Giving up the papers in the way she did was the only way in which she could have worked it.'
               'I certainly don't see how.'
               'Why, she knew very well that as long as the papers were missing I should remain in the vicinity of the Walling Moor to hunt them up, but by disposing of them so that they might quietly fall into my hands she knew that I should be lulled into a fancied security, and thus sent the more easily out of the way. I tell thee,' continued the smuggler, as he brought his hand up and clenched his massive fist, 'that business was all done while she had the papers, and the villain Walton was accessory to it.'
               'But what could she have meant by the remark she threw out about circumstances in my life of which you were ignorant?'
               'Nothing at all.'
               'But she must have meant something.'
               'No. It was merely additional chaff thrown into my eyes. There is nothing with regard to your past history that can affect you now one way or the other, and the old hag knows it.'
               Watt Wallingford spoke earnestly and confidently, but still George doubted the correctness of his opinions. Maud did mean something, and he was confident that that something was of moment to him. Perhaps if he had visited Richard Livingston he might have learned something important. Richard had on more than one occasion hinted at some strange mystery, and so had Jane.
               George felt sorry that he had not gone to Bath as he intended. He knew that Richard would not deceive him—he should be safe under his care, and he might learn something that would throw light upon the night that surrounded him.
               'Wallingford,' said George, stopping suddenly in the street, and gazing into his companion's face, 'I cannot go back to Kendal now.'
               'Cannot go back to Kendal!' iterated the smuggler, in amazement.
               'No,—not now.'
               'And why not, pray?'
               'I must go to Bath.
               'Do you know what you mean?' asked the smuggler with a half suppressed sneer.
               'Yes, Wallingford, I do know what I mean. The old gipsey woman means more in her scroll than you can decypher, and I know that there is something yet to be learned in this part of England. Richard Livingston perhaps has some key to the mystery, and for that reason he wished to see me.'
               'Then you will not go on board the packet?'
               'I cannot.'
               'Well,' returned Wallingford in a tone which betrayed more sorrow than anger, 'you are your own master, and if you choose not to follow me, well and good. But I tell thee there is no secret to be learned excepting the honor of the dead. I have a sister's fame at stake,—you a mother's.'
               'There is something—something, yet unknown to you,' urged the young man in a half earnest and half supplicating tone, 'and in this part of the kingdom is it to be found. You can stay—one week, at least.'
               Wallingford was about to reply, when the noise of carriage wheels broke in upon him, and soon a heavy vehicle was distinguished through the darkness approaching them from the same direction they had just come. Our two acquaintances stepped aside towards the river to let the team pass, but as it came nearly opposite to where they stood it stopped, and the man who occupied the seat in the box by the side of the driver hailed them:
               'Hallo, there!'
               'What's wanted?' returned Wallingford.
               'Can you tell me where the brig Ajax is to be found?'
               'No,' said the smuggler, 'I know nothing about any of the vessels in the river.'
               'Does your companion know anything about them?'
               'No, I'm a stranger in Bristol,' returned George.
               As the youth made this answer the two were about to pass on, and had already turned their backs towards the carriage, when they were suddenly seized from behind by some half-dozen individuals who had noiselessly left the vehicle, and ere they could understand the nature of the attack they were completely overpowered.
               Watt Wallingford struggled in his mighty strength, but the power of the lion had been overcome by the ingenuity of the subtle fox. His arms were pinioned firmly behind him ere he could strike a blow for liberty. George was equally as easily overcome, and a few useless struggles were the sum and substance of his opposition.
               'What means this, villains?' exclaimed Wallingford, from between his clenched teeth, as he was brought face to face with his captors.
               'Do you not know?'
               'No.'
               'Can you not guess?'
               'I am in no mood for jesting, sirs,' fiercely answered the smuggler, with an expression of countenance that would have betokened danger to some one, had he been at liberty. 'I would know why I am thus waylaid.'
               'Perhaps if I should tell you your name, you would understand it all,' said the leader of the party, while a quiet smile played around his features.
               'My name?—and what can that be to you?'
               'The name of WATT WALLINGFORD is much, not only to me, but to the whole of England.'
               'Ha! and have I been betrayed?' exclaimed Wallingford with a sudden start.
               'You are known to us, at least, and so you will see that we have reason for your arrest.'
               During this colloquy George had remained silent, but when he thus learned the object of his captors he asked,—
               'By what authority do you arrest me?'
               'Oh, don't go to playing innocent, my young man,' returned the officer (for such he appeared to be,) 'your doings are pretty well known.'
               'Aye, sir,' George quickly said, 'my deeds are known, and I fear not to have them, published to the world. Unless you have some charge to bring against me I would have you unbind me. I am no criminal.'
               'Suppose I were to tell you that you are both arrested by the direct order of the King.'
               'The King!' uttered the youth in astonishment.
               'Aye—the King.'
               'Do you mean to say that King George has ordered our arrest?' asked Watt Wallingford, while a perceptible tremor shook his frame.
               'Yes,' returned the officer. 'The king himself has ordered the arrest and safe keeping of Watt Wallingford and a young man known as George Brumford, who lately received a commission in the Navy.'
               'And whither do you intend to carry us?' asked the smuggler, who thought no more of immediate resistance.
               'You will go now to Bath.'
               Wallingford cast a look full of deep meaning upon his companion in bonds, and in a low tone remarked,—
               'This is the work of your anxious friend, George. Richard Livingston has done this.'
               'No, no,—Richard would never have been guilty of such baseness. Lord Livingston may have done it, but his son could not.'
               'We shall see,' muttered Wallingford.
               The two prisoners entered the carriage without resistance, and as soon as they were seated the horses were turned back and driven off at a furious rate. There were five men inside beside themselves, but during a ride of two hours not a question was asked. Wallingford was moody and indifferent, while George seemed buried in his own reflections.
               When the carriage at length stopped the door was opened from the outside, and the prisoners were requested to alight. They obeyed the summons without hesitation, and as they stood upon the ground they found themselves in front of a large stone building, but there was not light enough to enable them to observe its exact character nor locality. Leading up to a large double door was a flight of stone steps, while beneath these steps to the left was a smaller door which seemed to afford entrance to the basement of the building. Towards this latter door the prisoners were led, and one of their captors having unlocked it they were ushered through into the darkness beyond, where they remained till one of the officers procured a light.
               'This way,' said the leader, as he took the small horn lantern, which shed just light enough to reveal a long, narrow arched passage, the end of which was lost in the gloom. 'You will soon take up your lodgings for the night.'
               At a distance of some twenty yards from the entrance the guide came to a small grated iron door which was secured upon the outside by three ponderous bolts, and having thrown these back the door slowly swang outward, opening to a moderate sized cell, into which our two friends were ushered.
               The cords were taken from the arms of George, and as the officer set him at liberty he remarked, while a peculiar smile rested upon his countenance,—
               'You can set your companion free as soon as you please, and in the meantime I will leave you to yourselves. You will find a comfortable bed, and in the morning you shall be properly attended to.'
               As he ceased speaking he set the lantern upon a small table in the corner, and then left the cell. As George heard the dull grating of the bolts that made him a close prisoner, he sank back upon the low bed, and for several moments remained partially overcome by the strange emotions of mingled fear and wonder. Not so however with Watt Wallingford, for with his natural presence of mind in all sorts of emergencies he at once began to examine the nature of the place in which he found himself.
               The cell was about twelve feet square, receiving the light from only one window which was on the opposite side from the door, and about six feet from the floor. This window was secured by perpendicular iron bars, about six inches apart, bedded in the stone outside of the sash. A small table, two chairs, and quite a wide bed, were all the articles of furniture in the apartment.
               'Come, come,' said Wallingford, as he finished a cursory survey of the premises, 'don't set there moping, but get these infernal cords off from my arms. They are far from agreeable, I assure you.'
               George started up from the edge of the bed, and taking his knife from his pocket, prepared to set his companion at liberty.
               'Don't cut them, don't cut them,' exclaimed the smuggler. 'Cast them off carefully, for they may be of some service.'
               In compliance with this request the young man untied the cords, and as the last turn was cast off he uttered,—
               'Can you tell me, Wallingford, the meaning of all this?'
               'Certainly I can,' unhesitatingly replied the smuggler, as he shook himself from his bonds. 'Somebody has betrayed us.'
               'But how?'
               'How? Why, by telling the officers of the customs where we were. That affair on the Lancaster road has become known throughout the kingdom, and the officers have been for some time on the alert.'
               'Then I am ruined—inevitably ruined!' exclaimed George, sinking back once more upon the couch.
               'Never say ruin till it comes,' returned the smuggler.
               'It has come now.'
               'It has not come.'
               'How? Not come? What hope is there left?'
               'The hope that every determined man can feel—escape!'
               For several moments George made no answer, but at length he raised his head, and while a tear glistened in either eye he said,—
               'Ah, Wallingford, escape were worse for me than to remain here, for such a course would not only make stronger the appearance of guilt, but 'twould be attended with danger.'
               'You have no occasion to fear the proof of your guilt,' returned Wallingford, 'for if we can but get clear of this we will both leave the country. If the stain cannot be removed from the memory of my sister, we have certainly nothing to hope for in England.'
               'No, no,' uttered George, 'I will not leave England yet. I am guiltless of all crime, and at an impartial trial I can prove it. There are ties that still bind me to the country, and for the present I will remain. You can do as you please.'
               'Very well. I will not urge you against your will; but in the first place perhaps it would be as well to see what can be done.'
               As Wallingford spoke he went to the window and examined its character. The sash was merely hooked upon the inside, and by unhooking it it was easily slid back, leaving nothing but the iron bars between them and liberty. The cords with which the smuggler had been bound, when tied together formed a line some twelve feet long, and taking one of his pistols from his bosom he tied it on to the end of the line and then dropped it out at the window. The result was all that Wallingford could have wished, for the pavement without proved to be but about four feet lower than the floor of the cell, while from the cursory observation he had taken of the building as he entered it, he was pretty confident that no very high walls surrounded it.
               'If we can but remove two of those bars 
                     libberty
                     liberty
                   is mine, and yours if you wish it,' exclaimed the smuggler, as he finished his examination.
               'Those bars look to me as though they were made to resist force,' replied George.
               'Of course they were,' Wallingford said, as he took hold of two of them and tried their strength; 'but that iron was never yet wrought that could not by some means be broken.'
               'You certainly have not power to do it,' returned George, as he arose from the cot and approached the window. 'It will take more power than we can raise to remove them.'
               'No man knows how much power he can raise till he tries,' said Wallingford, as he turned from the window. 'Let us see what this bed is made of.'
               So saying the smuggler threw the clothes back from the bed, the frame of which he found to consist of two stout oaken beams secured by cross pieces at the head and foot, while the bedding rested upon slats which were merely laid across from beam to beam. Wallingford's eyes sparkled as he beheld the material of which the bed frame was constructed, and quicker than thought he had thrown the bedding upon the floor and commenced taking the wood work in pieces. The job was not a long one, for the frame had evidently been made with an eye to its easy removal from one place to another, and ere many minutes he had obtained one of the side beams free from all incumbrance.
               George had watched the efforts of his companion with no little interest, and now that he had the means of escape so nearly within his power he began to feel some little desire to profit by them. There was a kind of novelty, a kind of excitement in the affair that set in motion the pulse of enterprise and daring, and George Brumford had actually began to grow excited in the cause of freedom. It is hard work for any man to succumb to imprisonment when the means of liberty are within his power, and it cannot be expected that our youthful hero should be different from others.
               The stout oaken beam was placed between two of the iron bars and most willingly did George lend his strength to the lever. Those were two powerful men that bore down upon the bar, and the stout iron bent like a reed. Stronger and more powerfully pressed the two men upon their oaken beam, till at length the lower end of the iron bar was drawn out from its socket. Another bar was as easily withdrawn, and the stout heart of the smuggler beat lightly in his bosom as he saw the way thus opened for his escape.
               'Now's our time,' exclaimed Wallingford, as he placed the table against the wall below the window. 'Follow me as soon as possible. Be quick, now, and careful, for one mischance might cost us our liberty.'
               As Wallingford spoke he leaped upon the table, and in a moment he had commenced working his body through the aperture.
               'Quick! quick!' cried the smuggler, in a suppressed tone, as he hung out from the window, holding on to the bars only by his hands. 'I hear voices entering by the front way. Follow me instantly if you would be safe.'
               As Wallingford spoke he dropped upon the pavement, and just as George was upon the point of following he heard the bolts of the iron door drawn back, and in a moment afterwards the door was opened and a man, closely enveloped in a Spanish cloak, interrupted him in his proceedings. The stranger started as he saw the state of affairs, but without any remark he stepped quietly forward and laid his hand upon the youth's shoulder. The long cloak fell back from his face and neck, and as George Brumford gazed into the features thus revealed an exclamation of surprise and astonishment broke from his lips.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               REVELATIONS.
               GEORGE BRUMFORD,' slowly pronounced the person who had so unceremoniously entered the cell.
               'Richard Livingston!' exclaimed George, as soon as he could command his power of utterance.
               For some minutes neither of the two spoke further. Richard was evidently engaged in contemplating the havoc that had been made with the bedding, &c., while George's mind was crowded with a thousand images and 'variously conflicting emotions. Richard Livingston stood before him, but he knew not whether he beheld a friend or a foe; still, as he gazed into those well-remembered features he could not believe that ought of enmity could dwell within the bosom whose feelings were shadowed forth there; but yet things looked dark about him, and the expressed suspicions of the smuggler still rang in his ears.
               'Your companion has gone,' at length said Richard, who appeared to utter the remark more for the sake of breaking the silence than for any other purpose.
               'So it seems,' returned George, with a spice of bitterness in his manner.
               'And you would probably have followed him ere this had I not interrupted you.'
               'Very likely.'
               'I'm glad I arrived in season to prevent it.'
               'That is very likely, too,' returned George,—and then with a tone of bitterness which he made no effort to conceal he added,—'Especially when you have taken so much trouble to entrap me.'
               'It did cost me some trouble, I must confess,' said Richard, while a peculiar twinkle played in his eye.
               For a moment the bosom of George Brumford swelled with anger, but 'twas only for a moment,—on the next the quick feeling was swept away, and while the memory of scenes long passed came rolling o'er his soul, a sense of sadness possessed him, and a bright tear-drop glistened in either eye.
               'Richard,' said he, in a calm, sad tone, 'I had not expected this of you. Had I ever done you wrong, or had I even breathed a thought against you, you might have had provocation, but as it is I see not why you should have raised your hand against me. Remember, Richard, when the bloody, life-seeking pirate threatened you and yours upon the broad Atlantic,—I shrank not from your side, I quailed not in the face of danger, but with a heart full of love towards you I struck down the foe who opposed us. The memory of that day, at least, might have warmed your heart into better deeds than this.'
               For a full minute after George ceased speaking Richard Livingston gazed into his face in silence. There was a twitching of the muscles about his mouth, and a beaming light in his eye that told of some deep feeling, and when he at length spoke his tones bore a kindness that could never have done friendship a wrong:
               'George, you have misunderstood me.'
               'Misunderstood you?' iterated George, not yet feeling exactly reconciled to what had passed.
               'Yes,—misunderstood me.'
               'There is one thing, at least, which I have not misunderstood: You have had me taken as a prisoner.'
               'But why did you not come when I wrote to you?'
               George hesitated in his reply. Richard continued,—
               'You allowed Watt Wallingford to influence you against me. Was it not so?'
               'Partly that, and partly my own choice,' returned George.
               'So I thought,' Richard said, 'and so I resorted to a little stratagem, the result of which you plainly see.'
               'I see that I am a prisoner.'
               'Come, come, George,—no more of that. You know that Richard Livingston would never do you an injury. I feared that the peculiar circumstances under which you were placed would influence you against coming to Bath, and consequently I resorted to the expedient of sending for you in the manner I did. The authorities of Bristol held a warrant from the king for your arrest together with that of Watt Wallingford, and after considerable trouble I obtained possession of the writs and became responsible for the bodies of the offenders. Thus for the present you are under my full control, nor can you be molested. I wrote you that I had heard a strange tale, and that I wished to ascertain its truth. That tale is one fraught with the deepest interest to yourself, nor is it wholly uninteresting to me.'
               'To what does that tale refer?' asked George, as a shade of doubt and anxiety passed over his features.
               'I cannot explain it here, but ere long you shall know it all.'
               'Still the same mystery hangs over me, let me turn which way I will,' murmured the youth. 'No one is willing to tell me the secrets which they set up before me, and when I at length find them out they prove, alas! more terrible than the worst suspense. Oh, sir, if you know ought concerning that which interests me most keep it not from me.'
               'I will keep nothing from thee that I know,' returned Richard. 'I required your presence in order to ascertain some things which I do not know.'
               'Is it of my mother you would learn?' asked George, while a fearful trembling shook his frame.
               'Yes.'
               For a few moments George Brumford gazed in silence upon the man before him. His bosom heaved, his lips trembled, and his fingers worked about his breast as though he would have pressed down the beating. throbbing heart.
               At length he stepped forward and laid his hand nervously upon Richard Livingston's shoulder, and in a tone full of fearful hesitation he whispered,—
               'Do you know—can you—tell if my mother's name is free from all stain?'
               'From stain!' repeated Richard in astonishment.
               'Aye—from stain! Was mine an honorable birth?'
               As George spoke he withdrew his hand from the shoulder of his companion and stepped back a pace, as if he would not hear the answer too harshly.
               'Has any one dared to cast the stain of reproach upon the character of the lady Linwood?' asked young Livingston with a flashing eye.
               'Dared!' repeated George with a kind of vacant stare, seeming to be lost in a sort of bewilderment 'No, no—not dared;—but circumstances have transpired which tend to cast a shade over my birth.'
               'How? What circumstances?' uttered Richard, seeming in turn to have become nervously excited.
               'Why, the estates of my mother have been passed to Albert Linwood,—and why should they pass to the nephew when the honestly born son is living?'
               The troubled expression passed away from the features of Richard Livingston, and a gentle smile appeared there instead.
               'Is that all that troubles you?' he asked.
               'And is it not enough?
               'No. The estates in Kendal belong by right to Albert Linwood. The estates which you claim from your mother lay in Devonshire.'
               'In Devonshire? But I surely saw the papers of my mother, and the only property alluded to was that of the Walling Moor. Besides, Watt Wallingford assured me that such was the case.'
               'Then Wallingford was mistaken. But,' continued Richard, while a peculiar anxiety flitted across his countenance, 'who is this Watt Wallingford, that he should know so much of this affair?'
               'Do you not know?'
               'No.'
               'Perhaps I ought not to tell.'
               'If you know,' said Richard in an earnest tone, 'you may trust the secret with me, for I will never reveal my knowledge to the injury of any one.'
               'Well,' returned George, 'he was the brother of my mother.'
               'The brother of your mother!' repeated Richard. 'Then he is none other than Sir William Linwood, a baronet whom England has most wrongfully disgraced. But come,' continued he, 'let us leave this place; we shall find better quarters above.'
               'And Wallingford,—what will become of him?'
               'Oh, he is safe enough I happened to pass by just as the bar was wrenched from the window, and I easily managed to lay some one in wait for him.'
               As Richard spoke he took up the lantern and led the way out, continuing along further through the narrow passage until he reached a flight of stone steps up which he proceeded, followed closely by George. Ere long our hero found that instead of having been confined in a prison he had merely had quarters in the basement of a superb private dwelling, and his heart beat not a little when he found that he was under the same roof with Jane Livingston.
               Richard led the way to a sumptuously furnished chamber, and having had his protege enter and make himself comfortable for the remainder of the night, at the same time assuring him that all would yet be well, he bade him good-night and withdrew.
               For some time after Richard had gone George paced up and down the apartment in deep communion with himself.
               Was the mystery growing lighter, or was it still deepening? The cloud of darkness that had enveloped him had, to be sure, been broken in some places, and through the break the dim beams of Hope managed to struggle. Strange, strange indeed, were the movements of those who had interested themselves in his behalf,—they seemed to deal in half fledged ideas and gross uncertainties.
               At length he sought his bed, and as the power of slumber gradually crept over his senses, his mind began to wander amid the visions of the Past. That bright Phantom, with her beaming smile and soft, radiant eye, came first. Again he sat upon the bow of the tempest riven ship, and she sat beside him and whispered hope into his ear. Then came the dark form of the Smuggler, wearing upon his breast the badge of nobility, and bearing in his hand the king's pardon.
               Finally these fleeting visions passed away, and a form, made up of Heaven's rarest gifts, settled down upon the youth's dreamy canvass. 'Twas the form of Jane Livingston. She smiled and opened her arms, and with his head pillowed upon her snowy bosom George Brumford gradually sank into a sleep, too deep for memory to conjure up her phantasies longer.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               THE CLOUDS STILL DARKEN.
               THE sun was already up when George arose from his bed, and as he proceeded to perform his toilet a variety of emotions possessed his soul. His heart felt lighter than it had done for some time, but yet there was a certain undefinable sensation of fear—a dread of impending evil—which he could not shake off. He tried to make it appear that all was safe, that the assurance of Richard Livingston was well founded, and that he was near the end of his troubles. Perhaps he did believe this, but still the spirit of evil threatened him.
               He had nearly finished dressing when he heard a light footfall upon the stairs, and in a moment more there came a rap upon his door.
               'Come in,' said George, who was just in the act of tying his cravat.
               The door was slowly opened, and a young man not over twenty-one or twenty-two years of age, entered. To our hero he was a perfect stranger, but as he was himself in a strange place, that circumstance was nothing wonderful.
               'Do I speak with George Brumford?' asked the stranger after the compliments of the morning had been passed.
               'That is my name, sir.'
               'If I mistake not you came hither last night.'
               'You are right, sir.'
               'So I supposed,' returned the stranger, as he stepped nearer to the table by which George stood. 'Probably Mr. Livingston made you acquainted with the object of your visit, or at least, with the object he had in view in calling you hither.'
               'He made me acquainted with a part of the business,' returned George, regarding his interlocutor with a slight degree of interest.
               'He told you, probably, that I should call upon you this morning.'
               'Indeed he did not,' George answered, 'nor did he mention the name of any stranger to me.'
               'That is curious,' said the new comer, in a meditative manner, at the same time biting his finger-nails in a kind of vexatious way. 'Cu- rious that Richard should not have spoken to you of it.'
               'May I ask to what you allude?'
               'Oh, certainly. Richard told me yesterday that you were to be here last night, and requested me, as he should have to be away this morning, to accompany you to the hotel where his attorney resides, as he desires that this matter may be settled at once.'
               'Very well,' returned George, to whom the speedy settlement of the impending affair was deeply interesting, 'there can be no harm done by the oversight, for I can accompany you as well without, as with, his instructions.'
               'Oh, yes,' the stranger said, as a peculiar smile of gratification passed over his features, 'you can do it just as well, though perhaps you might have had a little more confidence in my authority had you been properly informed.'
               The smile that had played upon the features of the young stranger appeared to have been checked rather sooner than there was any need for, but still George suspected no treachery, and without hesitation he said,—
               'It makes no difference, sir. Though I know not even your name, yet if you come from Richard Livingston I will follow you.'
               'Then the sooner you go the better. You can breakfast with the attorney at the hotel; but ere we start you shall most assuredly know with whom you are going, and to that end,' added he, with a most easy and winning grace, 'allow me to introduce you to Mr. Walter Livingston.'
               'A relative of Richard's, perhaps,' suggested George, as he shook the young man's hand.
               'Only a cousin,—but that's near enough for considerable familiarity, you know.'
               'Oh, yes,—cousins are better than no relatives,' added George with a smile, 'and sometimes a little better than nearer ones.'
               'Cousins are very handy, at all events,' said Walter Livingston; 'vide the present affair; for Richard dared not to trust that with any one but me. But come, let's to the hotel at once, and by the time we have swallowed our breakfast Richard will undoubtedly be there.'
               'How far from hence is the hotel?'
               'Only around in St. James' Parish.'
               'I am as ignorant now as I was before,' George said with a smile.
               'Then you were never in Bath before.'
               'No.'
               Mr. Walter Livingston allowed another of those peculiar smiles to pass over his features, but this time he took good care to hide it from George, and as he opened the door that led out from the chamber he remarked,—
               'It is only about half a mile that we have to go,—just a pleasant walk.'
               Together the two started forth into the street without having met any one in the house, and at the end of the first square they turned down towards the river. Walter Livingston seemed somewhat nervous, and on more than one occasion he gave unmistakeable signs of a strange pertubation. As they neared the river's side these signs increased, and for the first time George began to fear some treachery, as he noticed the manner of his companion, and hesitating a moment he asked,—
               'Are we not taking a curious route for our destination?'
               'We are walking a little farther than is necessary,' replied Walter Livingston, 'but I thought you might like the river walk.'
               'I always like a pleasant walk when business does not interfere,' George said, as he watched the countenance of his companion with a scrutinizing glance, 'but at the present time I should prefer to arrive at the attorney's as soon as possible.'
               Mr. Walter Livingston cast a nervous look about him, and then endeavoring to throw off his appearance of uneasiness he said,—
               'As you please, sir;—at the next square we will turn up into the town again.'
               George walked on a few moments longer, but his apprehensions increased to such an extent that he began to feel that there was really some danger ahead of him. He called to mind the words of the Smuggler on the first occasion of their meeting—that there were secret enemies lurking about him; and the old gipsey woman had given utterance to the same warning.
               
               With a vivid idea that some such danger might be even now near at hand he stopped short upon the walk, and turning to his companion, said,—
               'Sir, you are deceiving me!'
               'How?' exclaimed the other, while a slight tremulousness was perceptible in his manner.
               'I say, you are deceiving me!'
               For a moment Walter Livingston made no answer to this charge, but at length, with a forced calmness, he uttered,—
               'You might at least wait until we arrive at the end of our walk before you accuse me of such baseness.'
               'And where is the end of that walk? I like not this out-of-the-way travelling, and unless you turn up into the town at once I shall leave you.'
               George spoke with energy, and he meant just what he said. His guide made no reply, but casting a furtive glance around him he took so me dozen steps further on.
               The two were now within a rod of the river, while all along were moored a row of boats of various sizes and shapes. Only a few people were in sight, and even they were laboring men busily engaged in their avocations. While George yet stood, undecided what course he should pursue, he observed his companion quickly start from his position and beckon to some one with his hand, and in a moment afterwards four men came running swiftly up from one of the larger boats. Their movements were quick and decided, and ere George could comprehend what was going on they came up to him and seized him roughly by the arms.
               'Unhand me, villains!' shouted our hero, as he found himself thus unceremoniously beset. 'Unhand me, or by heavens, I'll put a pistol ball through your heads.'
               'Not quite so easy as you imagine, young man,' said one of the ruffians, with a coarse laugh,—'we'll take care of that.'
               George struggled with all his might, but against four stout men he could make no effective resistance, and he was forced to allow himself to be dragged towards the river. The man who had decoyed him into this scrape stood apart and regarded the transaction with evident satisfaction.
               'Tell me why you are doing this,' uttered George, as for the moment he ceased from his useless struggling.
               'We're only obeyin' orders, sir,' returned the man who had before spoken. 'If you want to know more you must inquire of Mr. Linwood, there.'
               'Linwood!' uttered George, while a glimpse of the truth flashed across his mind.
               'Aye, sweet cousin,' said the man who had brought him hither, while a wicked smile played around the corners of his mouth. 'Perhaps you have heard my name before. You thought cousins might sometimes be better than nearer relations, and, at all events, better than none; but, to tell you the truth, even though you be my cousin—in a kind of left-handed way—I find your presence at this time particularly troublesome.'
               'Oh, you double-dyed scoundrel,' uttered George between his clenched teeth, while his eyes flashed fire, 'and so this is your work. To you I am indebted for this.'
               'Yes,' quietly remarked the more successful heir of the Linwood estates, 'you are indebted to me for this, and you may rest assured that the opportunity for troubling me more is beyond your power.
               Like all villains who depend upon the presence of powerful emissaries to back up their demonstrations, Albert Linwood (the reader has of course discovered the real character of the individual,) was wonderfully brave, and with a flourish that would have done credit to Napoleon himself he ordered the four men to hurry George on board the boat.
               George Brumford might have raved—he might have struggled with his base-born captors—he might have hissed words of scathing indignation at his villainous cousin; but his better judgment came to his aid, and with apparent resignation he suffered himself to be placed on board the boat.
               It might have seemed strange that such a transaction could have been carried through in open day, even while uninterested men were about on every hand; but when it is remembered that press-gangs were common—that seamen were kidnapped indiscriminately for the king's service, and that these gangs were protected by the Crown, it will not remain a wonder that the laboring men around the river offered no assistance to the unfortunate youth. They looked on with evident interest, and seemed to feel a degree of sympathy for the supposed victim of the press-gang, but they dared not offer resistance.
               Albert Linwood had studied this matter,—he had foreseen that his base designs could be easily accomplished if he could but get his victim once near the river, and to make his plot more sure he had secured the services of men who were known to have been engaged at various times in pressing men into the king's service at Bristol.
               As George was safely placed on board the boat he turned towards Albert Linwood, who stood upon the landing, and, while his fingers worked like storm-driven reeds beneath the influence of his feelings, he said,—
               'You may have succeeded in this, but as sure as there is a God in heaven you shall yet be overcome.'
               'Oho, my sweet coz,' tauntingly returned the young villain, while the re-composure of his nerves, now that he was beyond the reach of his victim, gave him additional courage, 'a sail across the Atlantic will wonderfully cool your ambition, to say nothing of your power of revenge.'
               'Across the Atlantic!' repeated George with shuddering emphasis, while the vision of a fearful reality rose like a threatening demon before him. 'Do you mean to say that I am destined for a passage to the States?'
               'If you get there in safety,' returned Albert Linwood; 'but at all events you are to start on the cruise, and henceforward you will trouble me no more. The illegitimate offspring of a recreant woman shall no longer stand between me and my rights.'
               George Brumford raised himself from the thwart upon which he sat, as these latter words escaped from the lips of the villain, but the deep feeling that they stirred up could find no language for utterance. The boat had been pushed off from the shore and had now dropped several fathoms from the landing, but had it not been for this our hero would have reached the base traducer of his mother, even though his own life's blood had been spilled in the attempt.
               No words escaped from the prisoner's lips, but with a countenance upon which was reflected the lion heart that beat wildly within his bosom, he regarded the man who had thus betrayed him into captivity. Albert Linwood could not but tremble as he met the glance of those flashing eyes, but his coward heart quailed not, for he was physically safe from all harm. The man he had injured was beyond the reach of his person, and simply waving his hand as a token for the boat to put forward, he turned back towards the Parish of St. Peter's.
               What a strange fatality seemed to attend every step of the devoted youth. By nature a nobleman of the truest stamp—endowed with physical powers that found scarcely an equal, and tuned with a most rigid morality, he could not overcome the fate that opposed him. Evil seemed to triumph in all its undertakings, and no power of his own could overcome what seemed to be the decision of an almost omnipotent Fate.
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               THE SMUGGLER IS AWAKE.
               THE tide was on the ebb, and by the assistance of long sweeps the boat in which our hero was confined was propelled rapidly down the river. The wind was favorable, and as soon as the town was passed the heavy mainsail and jib were hoisted and the fresh breeze wafted them on towards Bristol.
               George had been compelled to give up his arms, and as he sat in the stern-sheets, by the side of the steersman, he had not the least opportunity to resist the power that was carrying him into bondage. He asked numerous questions of his rough guardians, but the only an- swer he could get was, that he was to be put on board a brig bound to America, which brig was then laying just out in the channel.
               That was all that the boatmen would tell him in words, but by their looks they spoke much more. There was a peculiar kind of reserve—a sort of mysterious intimation in their very silence that sent such a thrill of horror to the heart of our hero. For what could he be thus doomed unless it was to place him out of the way of Albert Linwood's usurped right to the contested estates; and if such was the case, what else but his own death could place the villainous cousin in safety?
               These questions brought to George's mind a most horrible fear, and the taunting remark of Linwood—'If you get there in safety'—lent conviction to that fear. His enemy most assuredly aimed at his death!
               In an hour and a half the boat arrived at Bristol, and as George saw the buildings, the piers, and the shipping of the city fast being left in the distance, he could not help feeling that he was equally as fast leaving his very life behind him. On flew the boat down the ebbing river, and at the expiration of half an hour after leaving Bristol she shot out into the channel, and kept on towards the coast of Monmouthshire where laid a large sized brig, swinging to the tide by a single anchor, with her topsails hanging in the buntlines and cluelines.
               In some fifteen minutes after the boat entered the channel she luffed up under the gangway of the brig, and George was very politely requested to step on board. He obeyed the request without hesitation, and in a moment more he was followed by the man who seemed to hold command of the gang that had captured him.
               'This is the man as Mr. Linwood secured a passage for, Capt. Lothrop,' remarked the boatswain, as he doffed his hat to the commander of the brig.
               The captain, a short, dumpy, ugly looking fellow, merely gave a sort of grunt in assent, and then commenced an examination of his newly arrived passenger.
               'So you're goin' to sea with me,' he said at length, in a tone half way between a grunt and a growl. 'It's a pity to spill so good a lookin' feller for a passenger.'
               George was too much disgusted with the fellow's coarse impudence to make any reply, so he only looked at him in silent contempt; but his better judgment soon told him that he had better make friends than enemies, and conquering his disgust as much as he was able, he said,—
               'It does appear that by some means I am destined for a passage in your vessel, but I assure you it is none of my seeking.'
               'No, I suppose not,' returned the captain with a meaning nod. 'We don't always know what's going to happen to us till it comes.'
               As Captain Lothrop said this he turned towards the boatman and walking aft the two held some sort of a private consultation. In the meantime George began to grow a little more calm in his feelings, and his mind naturally turned upon the means of escape. While he stood thus by the main-mast, deeply buried in his own reflections he heard his name pronounced by some one behind him, and on turning around his eyes were greeted by the sight of a well remembered countenance, said countenance belonging to Bill Phillips, a true-hearted sailor who had for several years sailed on board the Lenox in his company.
               'Keep quiet, Mr. Brumford,' whispered Bill, as soon as he saw that George had recognized him. 'Don't let on that you know me. There, don't look at me, but just turn your head the other way while I fuss about the runnin' riggin' here. If you are careful there'll be no danger, for I've been on the look-out for you this long time.'
               'But tell me, Bill,' uttered George in a suppressed tone, keeping his eyes the while fastened on the captain, 'how is it that you happen to be here?'
               'Oh, I shipped on board, sir, just to serve you,—that's all. You see this brig has been on the wait for you ever since you first got your commission in the navy, and by luck I found out the move. She laid in Liverpool when you were there and somebody—a young man, I be- lieve—chartered her on purpose to take you out of the way, but on the very night that the gang went after you you strangely hauled your wind out of the city, and not a word could they learn of you. A week ago we had orders to come 'round here and wait for you. I don't know what it's all about, only that you are to be taken out towards America, and from what I can learn you are likely to be dumped into Davy Jones' locker before you get across, but if you're careful you can yet save yourself. The men don't all like Captain Lothrop, and there's three of them, at any rate, that will help us through.'
               During this delivery Bill Phillips had been most assiduously engaged in overhauling and clearing the running rigging that belayed at the main fife-rail, while the heart of George Brumford leaped wildly with sudden joy and hope.
               In fifteen minutes after George was conveyed on board the brig the boat put off for the shore, and Capt. Lothrop gave the necessary orders for heaving up the anchor and getting under way. Our hero stood apart and watched the movements of the captain and the men, but aside from the probable result of their labors he took no interest in the various evolutions. At any other time he would have felt a thrill of pride in seeing the yards hoisted, the sails spread, and the dark water rolling off from the prow as the vessel began to gather headway, but now other feelings than those possessed his bosom. The brig was to convey him away from all that made life desirable—all that could light up the spark of hope in his bosom, and from all who could give him any assurance of joy and peace in the future. Still there was a chance for escape. The revelation of Bill Phillips had infused a new courage into his soul, and he could not but feel that Bill's efforts would be crowned with success.
               The brig was soon under full sail, and with a fair wind she stood down the channel. Shortly after everything was sheeted home and the braces well belayed, Capt. Lothrop touched George upon the shoulder and motioned him aft.
               Mr. Brumford,—that is your name I believe,' said the captain as he reached the starboard quarter-rail.
               'You are right, sir,' returned George.
               For a moment or two Capt. Lothrop gazed upon the young man before him with a kind of half shut eye, somewhat in the same manner and with the same cast of countenance that a jockey would assume while studying the various qualities of a horse, and at length, with a species of brutish leer, he said,—
               'I don't know, young man, as you are acquainted with what's likely to become of you, or where I intend to carry you.'
               George's first impulse was to knock the impudent villain down, or else to throw defiance in his teeth, but he saw at once that such a course would most inevitably destroy all chances of escape, and so he kept back the burst of his indignation and replied,—
               'I know that I have been entrapped by a villain to whom my presence is dangerous, and that he has negotiated with you for my removal, but my exact destination I do not know.'
               'Neither do I,' returned the captain, while a villainous smile passed over his features. 'That is,' he continued, seeing that the young man started at his laconic expression, 'I do not know exactly, for much may depend on your own conduct.'
               'On my own conduct?' repeated George.
               'Yes.'
               'Methinks my conduct can have but little influence in the matter.'
               'Oh yes it may, though,' the captain said. 'If you are anyways orderly and mind your own business, you shall have a free range of the brig while you are on board; but if you go to cutting up any capers, or breeding any trouble, you'll find yourself dumped into irons—that's all.'
               George had no desire to contest that point, but merely assured Lothrop that while there were no hopes of escape he should do nothing to create disturbance.
               Had not the young man's mind been fixed upon escape he might have been more particular with regard to the disposal that was to be made of him, but as it was he allowed the captain to turn away without any further questioning.
               
               The brig had been on the wing an hour, and a smooth but fresh breeze was sweeping her rapidly down the channel. The captain stood by the wheel watching the compass, while the men were lounging about the deck engaged in conversation of various kinds.
               'Captain Lothrop,' said one of the men, named Duncan, who stood by the lee quarter rail, 'what is that boat that's just come out o' the river?'
               'Where?' asked the captain, as he stepped over to the lee side.
               'There she is, sir, just rounded the headland,' returned Duncan, as he pointed to the spot thus designated.
               'May I be — if she ain't coming after us,' uttered Lothrop, as he got a sight of the boat.
               'So I thought,' Duncan added.
               George started over to leeward and looked at the boat. It was a long, sharp yacht-built pleasure boat, schooner-rigged, with two gaff-topsails set, and at the rate she was now cutting through the water it would not take over half an hour or her to come up, if such was her desire.
               The moment George saw her a new hope sprang up in his bosom. Why it was he could not tell, but it seemed to be an emanation from one of those mysterious presentiments that sometimes speak to the soul in tones as truthful as subsequent facts can make them. There was nothing in the appearance of the boat different from that of many boats he had seen, but still he felt that something was about to turn up for his good.
               'The boat is surely giving us chase,' said the captain. 'Duncan, go to the cabin and get my glass.'
               As soon as Lothrop got his glass, he levelled it upon the approaching yacht, and for several moments he continued to gaze upon her. When he at length lowered the instrument he cast a lowering look upon his prisoner, and muttered,—
               'Mr. Brumford, if that fellow's after you he'll find himself most confoundedly mistaken in his calculations.'
               'After me, sir?' repeated George, not able to conceal the hope that burned within him, 'Who is there that would come after me?'
               'I don't know, I'm sure,' Lothrop answered, while a ferocious, hyena-like look overspread his countenance; 'but this much I can tell you,—you need have no hope of escaping, for, by all the saints in Christendom, I wouldn't give you up to the king himself.'
               Our hero felt perfectly satisfied that Lothrop would endeavor to be as good as his word, but still he trusted that fortune would befriend him. The immediate suspicion of the captain had served greatly to strengthen his own hope as to the character and purpose of the boat, and with a bounding heart he awaited her nearer approach.
               Half an hour passed away, and the bows of the yacht ploughed through the brig's wake not over two cables' lengths astern, while some eight or ten men were seen leaning over the rail.
               'Brig ahoy!' shouted some one from the boat.
               'Aye, aye, what's wanted?' returned Lothrop, in a tone far from pleasant.
               'I want to come alongside. Will you back your main-topsail?'
               'No!' thundered the captain.
               'You will not?'
               'No!'
               'Then I'll come up under your lee without.'
               At that moment the yacht shot under the brig's stern and putting her helm down, she came gracefully up under the lee main chains, and in a moment more her grapplings were fast. Capt. Lothrop was somewhat taken aback by this summary proceeding, but nevertheless he sprang to the main rigging with the intention of confronting the occupants of the boat. Before he could accomplish anything, however, the giant form of Watt Wallingford gained the brig's deck, followed in quick succession by some half dozen others.
               'What means this?' uttered Lothrop through his clenched teeth, as he made a motion as if to arrest the further progress of the smuggler. 'Who are you, sir?'
               'Did you ever hear the name of Watt Wallingford?' asked the new comer, as he bent a meaning look upon the captain.
               'Is that your name?' asked Lothrop, almost confounded at the mention of that notorious wrecking smuggler.
               'Aye, and I have come to rescue yonder man from your clutches,' said Wallingford, taking a step at the same time towards the spot where George stood.
               'Then you may go back by the same way you come, for you can't have him.'
               'But I will have him,' returned the smuggler, as he drew his heavy cutlass, 'and I swear by the eternal heavens that the first man who dares to step before me shall not live another minute!'
               As Wallingford spoke he strode aft and grasped George Brumford by the hand. The youth would have sprang forward when the smuggler first boarded, but fearing that too much haste might cause a needless collision, he had desisted; now, however, he returned the smuggler's warm grasp, and as he felt the pressure of that powerful hand he knew himself to be safe.
               'Lay aft, here, men,' cried Lothrop, while the white foam began to gather upon his colorless lips. 'Arm yourselves with whatever you can find,—seize the hand-spikes.' Then turning to Wallingford, he continued,—
               'I'll give you just three minutes to leave my vessel in, and if you don't do it I'll tumble you overboard with a cracked skull.'
               Watt Wallingford let go the hand of his young friend and gazed for a moment into the face of the enraged captain, and then, with a movement so quick that its aim could not be avoided, he brought the side of the blade of his ponderous cutlass down upon the head of Lothrop with such a force that the villain fell to the deck like a dead ox. There was a movement on the part of the crew to step forward to their captain's assistance, but the towering form of Watt Wallingford awed them back,—his very name, too, was a tower of strength in itself, and against him and his posse they had no desire to cope.
               George called to Bill Phillips and asked him if he wished to return to Bristol in the boat, but the honest sailor chose to remain where he was, as he had a great desire to go to America, and so quietly slipping a well filled purse into Bill's hand our hero followed Wallingford over the gangway, and by the time Capt. Lothrop came to his senses the yacht was just filling away. The enraged villain swore a volley of fearful oaths as he saw his prey thus escaping him, but it was too late to help the matter now, so smothering his rage as much as possible he turned towards the crew and commenced damning them for allowing the young man to escape, and while he was engaged in this occupation the yacht left the brig far to leeward.
               'Tell me, my dear Wallingford,' said George, as soon as they had got out of hearing of Lothrop's raving, 'how in heaven's name did you learn where I was?'
               'Last night when I had got out of the cell window,' returned Wallingford, 'I waited a moment for you, when I heard some one enter the apartment. At first I thought of flight, but on reflection I determined to remain where I was and see if I could glean anything from your conversation.'
               'And did you hear it?'
               'Yes,—or, that is, all but the latter part of it, and as soon as Richard Livingston and yourself left the cell I determined to seek you both by entering the house at the front door, and I had just started for that purpose when I was met by four men, who demanded of me that I should follow them, and upon learning that they would conduct me to the inside of the building I at once complied with their request. After you had retired for the night I had an interview with young Livingston, during which I learned much of which I was before ignorant, and also became convinced that the young man is a friend to both of us. This morning when I turned out young Livingston called upon me and wished me to accompany him to an attorney's to examine some papers relating to Linwood estates, and when we returned you were missing. I immediately suspected foul play, because I had learned at the attorney's that Albert Linwood was in the place, and because, too, I knew that he had long been hovering around your track. It was he who first ascertained at Liverpool that you were in the country, by finding your name in the Times Newspaper, and even then he had some plan on foot for your ruin, but at that time I circumvented him, and I was determined to do it again. I knew that if he had contrived to get you out of the city he had done so by the way of the river, and consequently down to the river I hastened, where I was fortunate enough to learn that a young man, answering to your description, had been kidnapped by a press gang about an hour before. I at once procured the fastest yacht I could find, hired ten stout fellows, and put off after you. Just below Bristol I met the boat that had taken you down, and by the way of a little twistification I learned of the cockswain of the boat where you had been carried. The rest you know.'
               'Yes, I do know,' returned George, in 
                     a a
                     a
                   warm and thankful tone, 'and God grant that I may some day be able to repay you for your kindness.'
               'Don't fear on that score, George; for all I ask is, to see you once settled in the full possession of your rights. That will be happiness enough for me.'
               There was an affectionate, tender look in the countenance of Watt Wallingford as he spoke, and when, instinctively, he grasped the hand of his young companion, his eyes were gemmed with tears.
               George gazed up in astonishment at the working features of his preserver, and he knew from what he could read there that some important secret had found its way into the smuggler's bosom, but there were too many listeners around for the recital of private affairs, and so George asked no questions, but leaning his elbow upon the rail and resting his brow upon his hand, he allowed his mind to become lost in the dark and intricate mazes of the mystery that dwelt around and about him.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               THE SMUGGLER'S STORY.
               IT was dark, when the yacht reached Bath, and having settled with the man who assisted him, Watt Wallingford led the way up into the town. The evening was pleasant, but still the streets were quiet, and, save here and there a pedestrian, they were nearly deserted. Our hero walked thoughtfully up from the river, and as he found himself once more in safety upon terra firma he could not but feel a degree of happiness that had been for a long time a stranger to his bosom. The events of the last five hours seemed a sort of presage to some more happy termination, and the clouds that had been so long gathering darker and darker o'er his path appeared to be rolling away, while gentle Hope was trimming her lamp in the distance.
               At the end of twenty minutes our two friends arrived at the same dwelling to which they had once been carried as prisoners. A servant ushered them into the hall, and in a moment more Richard Livingston met them. A bright smile of joy irradiated his features as he stepped quickly forward, and grasping his young friend by the hand he exclaimed,—
               'Thank God, my dear George, that you are safe.'
               Then turning to the Smuggler, he continued—
               'And you, Wallingford, may be thanked for the part you have done. Was it not as we expected?'
               'Yes, sir,' returned the Smuggler. ''Twas that young villain of a Linwood who had contrived to betray him away.'
               Then Wallingford went on and explained to Richard what had transpired, and as he closed young Livingston remarked,—
               'Never mind, George, it's over now. Albert Linwood has overshot himself, and from him you have nothing more to fear, unless, indeed, you should choose to call him out.'
               'Call him out?' interrogatively repeated George.
               'Yes,—I say unless you call him out, you need have nothing more to fear from him.'
               'Do you allude to a duel?'
               'Certainly.'
               'But do you suppose I would descend so low as that?'
               'Perhaps not.'
               'No, Richard,' replied George, while his handsome features beamed with a conscious pride, 'I would never be willing to sink the intellect which God has given me beneath the mere principle of brute force. Except in a case of actual self-defence, or on the spur of the most aggravated insult, would I ever attempt an injury to any one; the more especially when my enemy's own base and wicked heart must be a punishment both sure and strong.'
               'George,' exclaimed Richard, as he grasped his young friend's hand, 'I must say that I honor your sentiments, for I know full well that a braver heart than yours never beat in human bosom. But come, let us seek some place more befitting than this for a friendly conversation.'
               As Richard spoke he led the way to the upper part of the building and ushered George into one of the front drawing rooms, Wallingford, in the meantime, seeking another apartment.
               'Where is Wallingford?' asked George, as he noticed for the first time that the smuggler 
                     hsd
                     had
                   not followed them.
               'He chose another direction, for he knew that I would see you alone.'
               George made no reply to this, but taking a seat upon one of the sumptuous lounges that were ranged around the room he awaited the will of his companion.
               'George,' said Richard Livingston, as soon as he had also seated himself, 'I desire that you will be frank with me in your answers to whatever I may ask of you.'
               'I believe you can trust me on that score.'
               'To your honesty I would trust my life,' returned Richard, 'but there may be some things in the bosom of every man which he would desire to keep secret.'
               'From you, my best of friends,' George said, 'I know not that I have a thought, even, that I should hesitate to conceal.'
               A quick flush of gratification passed over Richard Livingston's features as his companion made this answer, and drawing up nearer he said.—
               'Would the possession of your estates render you satisfied and contented?'
               'I know not that I comprehend your meaning,' said George, as he looked inquisitively into the face of his companion.
               'I mean to ask if you could be contented were you to be put in full and undisturbed possession of the large property which belongs to you, without seeking further enjoyment from the possession of anything else.'
               A slight tremor passed through the frame of the young man, for he began to see the force of his companion's question, and in a kind of hesitating manner, he replied,—
               'The mere possession of wealth can give no man happiness. I would rather pass my days in the peasant's humble estate than to dwell within the gilded palace of the noble, if by the latter I must sacrifice my honor, or lose the society of those I love.'
               'The society of those you love,' repeated Richard, with a peculiar emphasis. 'Then that would satisfy you.'
               'Are you speaking plainly?' asked our hero, while he regarded his interlocutor with a half reproving look. 'If you would have me answer you fairly and honestly, methinks your questions should bear the same stamp.'
               For a moment or two Richard sat in silence; but at length, while a peculiar shade passed over his countenance, he said,—
               'George, I will speak plainly. Do you still cherish the same affection for my sister that you once confessed to her?'
               'Then she told you of it.'
               'Certainly.'
               For a minute, perhaps, George Brumford might have gazed into the face of Richard Livingston without speaking. But though his look was bent earnestly and fixedly, still his mind was not there. The image of Jane Livingston alone occupied his thoughts, and the half fledged wings of hope that had been gradually gaining strength closed beneath the intimation of the curious questions he had heard. What else could be meant than that he must rest satisfied with the restoration of his estates? What else than that this restoration must be a kind of compensation for the relinquishment of the lady Jane's love?'
               
               'Richard Livingston,' George at length said, 'if you suppose that I could ever forget the love which has burned with a pure and holy flame within my bosom, you can know but little of the human heart. Years may roll on into the ocean of eternity and carry me to the shores of white and frost-seared age—Jane may become another's and crush forever the hope of my future, but never, never can I forget that I have loved her, and never can I tear that love from out its resting-place. Go on, sir, go on,' he continued, with a kind of forced, unnatural energy; 'tell me all that you may have to say.'
               'George,' said his companion, 'I feared that you had still continued to cherish the love which you once confessed to Jane, still I knew not but the letter which my father sent you while you were in Liverpool might have led you to change your mind.'
               'No, Richard—the mind has nothing to do with love. Reason—a reason that might sway the sceptre over a world, cannot conquer that potent god—LOVE. Hope, too, has led me on. Perhaps I had no reason for that hope, but still I could not entirely crush it. It has darkened at times, but its lamp has never burned lower than at the present moment.'
               'Were I to have my own way,' Richard said, while a kind look overspread his features, 'I would not hesitate a moment, but you know my father has different notions from myself. Jane has received an offer of marriage from the Earl of Tiverton, and the alliance is too opportune for my father to pass over. He will most assuredly insist upon its consummation.'
               'And Jane,' uttered George, almost in a whisper—'does she—'
               He hesitated ere he spoke further; but Richard continued,—
               'The Earl is young and handsome, and is of excellent habits. He has been much in the society of my sister, and you cannot wonder that she should feel a warm friendship towards him, at least.'
               'Then she has accepted him.'
               'No.'
               'Has not?'
               'No.'
               'She has not rejected him.'
               'No.'
               George sank bank. Jane had not rejected the young earl,—then she might accept him! and then—then all would be darkness in his own soul.
               For several moments neither of the two spoke a word. The deep heaving of George's chest told plainly of the struggle that was going on in his bosom, while Richard appeared to be equally affected, though in a different manner. At length the latter leaned forward and took his companion's hand,—
               'George,' said he, 'I believe you are the only man who could make Jane truly happy.'
               George started and gazed earnestly into his companion's face.
               'I know,' Richard continued, 'that Jane loves you, truly and devotedly, and if you still cherish the same feelings towards her I may yet be able to influence our father in your favor; but hope not too strongly.'
               'Oh, God!' uttered George as he looked imploringly upward, 'grant that this may be. Grant that this cup be dashed not from my lips.'
               He would have spoken more, but Richard arose and walked towards the other end of the room. Several times he paced to and fro across the apartment, murmuring some half uttered thoughts to himself, as though he was hesitating whether to give them full speech. At length he stopped in front of the lounge upon which George sat and said, in a sort of hesitating manner,—
               'I must leave you for a few moments, but I shall return ere long. You can pass your time easily till I get back.'
               'One word before you go,' exclaimed George, as he started up.
               'No, not now.'
               'Only one word.'
               'To-morrow you may ask a thousand questions if you like, but not now.'
               As Richard spoke he left the room. There was a most curious expression upon his countenance as he turned to take a last look at George, and once he seemed upon the point of turning back, but the hesitation passed away on the instant, and without remark he left the apartment.
               Seldom is it that a man finds himself in so peculiar a situation as that in which our hero was now placed. The web about him was drawn closer than ever before, and in no way could he stretch his mind beyond its intricate meshes.—But for all that net was so close, still there was a bright illumination beyond it—a sort of celestial halo that made the way light before him. Doubt was there, and so was anxiety, but above all there seemed to hover a Spiritual Essence, a Presence that spoke of Hope and Joy.
               Some ten minutes had George sat thus alone when the door was opened, and Watt Wallingford came in.
               'George,' said he, as he took a seat upon the same lounge with the young man, 'did you tell Richard Livingston who I was?'
               'Tell him who you were?' repeated George, in some little surprise; but in a moment more the recollection of his conversation with Richard in the cell came back to his mind, and while a blush of something akin to shame overspread his features he continued,—
               'Yes, I did tell him that you were my mother's brother, but I surely—'
               'Oh, it's no harm,' interrupted the Smuggler, as he noticed the confusion of his companion,—'only I wished to know how he found out the secret.'
               'But I thought you heard our conversation in the cell,' said George.
               'So I did, but that must have been asked and answered just as you turned to go.'
               'It was just as we thought of going.'
               'And so Richard told you who I was in reality, did he not?'
               'He told me that you—'
               'Why do you hesitate?'
               'Because I am repeating a private conversation,' replied George, as he gazed up into the face of his companion.
               'It can make no difference now,' returned the Smuggler, 'for I knew that young Livingston must have known my true name from some words which he let fall this morning when we were conversing about yourself, and I furthermore knew that you must have given him a clue to it; and now I would know if he told you who I was.'
               'Well,' George said, after a moment's thought, 'he did tell me that you were Sir William Linwood, and also that you had been wronged by the government.'
               'Aye, and he told you the truth,' uttered the Smuggler, while a darker shade passed over his features.
               'And what is this wrong that has thus driven you from the society of your equals?'
               'I will tell thee,' Wallingford said, as he somewhat composed his feelings, 'and I would have told you when you asked me once before if in so doing I should not have been obliged to reveal my true name, which I then had no desire to do.'
               George drew up nearer to his companion, and listened anxiously for his recital.
               'There were in our family,' commenced the Smuggler, 'two brothers and one sister, of whom I was the eldest child. Over the fate of my younger brother there still hangs a mystery which I cannot fathom, though I am confident that Richard Livingston can solve it. There is a most peculiar chain of circumstances connect ed with the fates of my brother and sister, though of the latter I know more than of the former. But let that pass—though I must say in addition that I am in hopes ere long to have the mystery cleared up.'
               'Oh, mystery, mystery,' uttered George, as Wallingford made a brake in his narrative, 'what a cloud it is to hang over one's life. Like the storm-tossed mariner without chart or compass and enveloped in the clouds of darkness, such an one gropes along his way.'
               'Of myself,' continued the Smuggler,' without seeming to notice the remark of his companion, 'when quite young I was placed by my father in the Royal Navy, and just as the war with the American Colonies broke out I had been rated to the command of a brig of fourteen guns. During the troubles in Boston, while General Howe held that city, I had a transport brig and a storeship placed under my charge as convoy, with directions to see them safely into Boston harbor. The transport was accidentally blown up at sea, and the storeship was most adroitly stolen from me by an American privateer. It was a bold and daring feat, and I almost forgave the Yankee for the act. Well, on my arrival in Boston General Howe was so exasperated that he persuaded Admiral Shuldham to send me home in disgrace. They asserted that I—that I, had contrived the whole plot,—that I had secretly caused the transport to be blown up, and had connived with the privateer for the capture of the storeship.'
               For a moment the smuggler stopped in his story and pressed his hand hard against his brow. The memory of that libellous stain came back upon his stern soul with a scorching effect, and he seemed to live through the disgrace anew.
               'But never mind,—it's past now, and I have had my revenge,' he continued, as he once more regained his composure. 'When I returned to England I was brought before the Admiralty and court-marshalled. I was disgraced from the service and my name given through the public prints. From that moment I vowed to be revenged on the government that had thus defrauded me of my honest name and fame, and most exactingly have I kept my pledge. In one year I have taken from her revenue one million pounds sterling. You start, but it is nevertheless true. Ah, the name of Watt Wallingford has been a terror to the treasury department.'
               'I do not wonder that you sought revenge,' George said, as his companion closed. 'That must have been a fearful blow to one like you.'
               'Fearful,—ah, 'twas a soul-searing stroke, but if the government will cry quits and square our accounts, I will leave them henceforth in peace.'
               'Never fear but that it shall be done,' said Richard Livingston, who at that moment entered the room, and had heard the last remark of the Smuggler. 'But come, Wallingford,' he continued, 'I would speak with you a few moments.' Then turning to George, he added,—
               'In yonder room you will find your apartment for the night. You can seek it as soon as you please, and in the morning I shall have news for you.'
               George returned no answer, for at that moment Richard and the Smuggler left the place, and once more he was alone.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXII.
               THE IDEAL HAS BECOME THE REAL.
               GRADUALLY the footfalls of the departing men died away until at length all was quiet and still. The heavy lamp that hung from the richly carved ceiling had grown somewhat dim, and the extremity of the room, which was formed of deep alcoves hung with heavy drapery, began to lose its distinctness of outline. The quaint marble lion and unicorn that stood, one on each side of the fire-place, seemed about to leap over the golden crown that was supported above them, while the heavy escutcheon that hung above the mantle caught upon its burnished surface what little light there was remaining and threw it back into the room.
               The bell of St. James struck the hour of ten, and as its heavy, sonorous tones died away upon the air a strange feeling of soft, soothing spiritualism came over the young man's mind. At that moment a slight rustling came from the drapery of the centre alcove, and as George raised his eyes towards the extremity of the apartment he started with an agitation that sent the warm tide of life dancing like electric sparks along his veins.
               There, just distinguishable amid the heavy drapery, stood the Phantom of his heavenly visions. Its dazzling whiteness had lost none of its purity, but still it looked not so brilliant as formerly. George moved not—he spoke not, but with an enraptured gaze he strained his eyes towards the place where stood the Phantom.
               Slowly the Presence moved towards the centre of the room until it stood within the rays of the hanging lamp.
               What is that change! What means that low sob—that heaving of the snowy bosom! It is still the same form—the same heavenly features, but yet how changed!
               Slowly George rose to his feet, as if fearful that he should dispel the vision. Why George opened his arms he knew not, but as he half unconsciously made the movement the form sprang forward, and in a moment more he felt a warm head pillowed upon his bosom.
               'Oh! my brother, my brother,' fell from the angel's lips, and then raising her head from its heaving pillow she gazed up into the youth's face.
               As George met that gaze the mountain was rolled from his soul. Up, up rose the tide of memory until it flowed in one unbroken stream, from the Past to the Present. Now he knew that Form—now his angel Phantom was realized,—the Ideal had become Real, and he saw before him his own, his loved, his loving, his earthly sister! Long did he thus gaze in silence upon those beaming features, until at length the deep fountains of his soul burst forth, and blinded by the joy-sent flood his heart went forth in thanksgiving to its God.
               
               'Tell me, tell me, my sister, if you can, what this all means.'
               'Then you remember your sister Lucie.'
               'It may be a phantasy of the brain,' replied George, as he repeated that simple sound in his mind, 'but still that name sounds familiar to my ears,—it calls up from my soul a sense of recollection—something which tells me that even though it may have been hidden behind the veil of forgetfulness for years, still the name has dwelt there. But tell me, Lucie, how you knew me.'
               Lucie raised her eyes to her brother's face, and wiping the tears from her cheeks, she said,—
               'To the world, George, a tale like this might seem strange,—aye, even foolish, but nevertheless it is true, though it be wonderful. I am older than yourself, and consequently can easily remember an event which must be very dimly reflected upon the mirror of your own memory. I allude to the death of our father.'
               'I have pictured such a scene to myself,' George said, 'but I think it has little of reality about it. I probably took the impression from the relation of the woman whom until lately I had supposed to have been my mother.'
               'It must have been so,' replied Lucie, as she gazed with a more confident affection into the features of her brother, 'for you were too young to have had the scene fixed upon your memory, and even I have forgotten many scenes subsequent to that. Of my voyage across the Atlantic I can remember but little, excepting that I used to weep and cry for my brother, and from that time your image has been fixed in my mind. Perhaps that was the cause of what followed. Nine years after we reached this country, one evening in early autumn—I think it must have been between nine and ten o'clock—as I sat alone in the large parlor of our dwelling I gradually fell into a quiet slumber. I felt no drowsiness, but it rather seemed as though some superhuman agency induced the state. The candle which burned upon the mantel changed into a thousand twinkling stars, and I found myself upon the deck of a ship in the midst of the trackless ocean. At that moment I seemed to comprehend the past, the present, and the future. I knew that you had sought your swinging bed, and I descended to the place of your repose. You had just fallen asleep. I knew that I had the power of making myself visible to you, and therefore I laid my hand gently upon your shoulder, which at once awoke you from your sleep. I knew you at once,—your every feature seemed as familiar as though you had been my constant companion, and I spoke to you words of cheer and comfort, promising you peace and joy in the future, at the same time holding out to you a wreath of laurel. At that moment you stretched forth your hand and some irresistible power drew me away.'
               'Strange, strange,' murmured George, as he scanned again and again the features of his sister. 'Oh, how distinctly every item in that vision is impressed upon the tablet of my memory. Ah, my sister, you know not how often the words of that heaven-sent presence have saved my feet from error. In the dark hours of danger they have strengthened me, and in the still darker hours of temptation they have lighted me on in the path of duty. Then again you visited me in the same ship.'
               'Aye,' returned Lucie, while a shudder passed over her frame,—'that was a fearful scene. I was asleep in my bed, when suddenly I seemed to be awakened by a terrific roar, which sounded as though all the artillery of heaven had broken above my head. I was upon the same ship. The men were rushing towards the stern of the storm-riven bark, but you were not with them. In an instant I saw you upon the bows, and I flew to your side. I whispered—'Be not afraid, my brother; I am with thee.' I knew you were safe, and I left you.'
               For several moments George sat in deep thought, then raising his eyes to his sister's face he asked,—
               'Did you tell this to Richard Livingston?'
               'Yes.'
               'Before he went out to the Indies?'
               'Yes.'
               'Then I can account for his strange conduct when I related to him the same circumstance one evening on our passage home. But what could he have meant by saying that his sister's conjectures must be right? I surely never spoke to her of this.'
               Lucie looked for a moment into her brother's face. There was a kind of laughter-loving twinkle in her eyes, and half smilingly she said—
               'The lady Jane and myself have been intimate from 
                     girldhood
                     girlhood
                  .'
               'Well.'
               'And she knew my countenance—every feature of it.'
               George gazed into his sister's face, utterly unable to comprehend what she was coming at. She noticed his inquiring look, and with the same twinkle still sparkling in her eyes she continued,—
               'Methinks, from what I have heard, that Jane has studied your own countenance not a little. There, don't blush,—I will tell you the secret. I think that if you and I were to look in the mirror, side by side, you would acknowledge that one who had seen the sister could not fail of noticing the brother.'
               'I believe you are right.'
               'I know I am, and in the remarkable similarity of our countenances lies the whole secret of her emotions on beholding you.'
               'Then you think, sister mine, that had I not resembled you Jane would have taken no notice of me.'
               George said this in a sportive mood, but at the same time the smile which had just started over his features quickly passed away, and a slight flush took its place.
               'Oh, no,' Lucie quickly answered,—'I meant not that. I merely alluded to the strange surprise she manifested, which surprise Jane turned into a suspicion, and then related that suspicion to her brother. Ah, I much fear me that Jane's first impressions were deeper than mere surprise,—aye, and more lasting, too.'
               George felt thankful for that remark, and he expressed his thankfulness by his looks.
               'Then you have known Richard Livingston long,' said George at length. 'Perhaps, my sister,'—and here George lowered his voice to a quiet, meaning tone—'you may ere long know him better yet.'
               Now Lucie blushed, but that blush was tempered with a happy smile, and extending her hand to her brother, she frankly said,—
               'I know what you mean, and I freely admit that while you have loved the sister I have loved the brother, and my only prayer is, that we may both be happy in our choice.'
               'Ah, Lucie, I know not that I shall ever possess my choice.'
               'But you can hope,' Lucie said, while she gazed up into her brother's face with a most peculiar expression.'
               'Yes,' uttered the young man, in a fervent tone, 'and when that hope is gone God grant that it may be lost in fruition.'
               For several moments that brother and sister sat in silence. Their conversation had been free and unconstrained, for they felt like old as- sociates. The strange and mysterious chain that had connected their destinies had bound their hearts together;—the very features of each had been ever present in the mind of the other, and when they met, all reserve, excepting such as true dignity imposes, was a stranger to their bosoms. Those were two hearts made for the abode of sympathy and affection,—by the hand of God they had been fashioned after the image of His own Love, and hence were they fitted for that mysterious spiritual intercourse that had formed such startling episodes in their lives.*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *The author here begs leave to observe that in his introduction of the 'Phantom,' or the spiritual visitation of Lucie to her brother, he has not gone one whit beyond the evidence of substantiated facts. In hundreds of instances have people been forewarned by the voice of friends who were at the time many miles distant, and subsequent events have proved those forewarnings true. The most remarkable case that I can call to mind at the present time is that of Andreas Schottus, a learned German, who was born at Antwerp, and one of the most voluminous writers of his time. After being (in 1580) created Greek Professor at Toledo, he moved to Rome, where he became a professor of rhetoric. One night, about three years after he had settled in Rome, while sitting alone in his study, he was startled by the sudden appearance of a female cousin who informed him that his only sister was the victim of a mortal disease, and that she earnestly desired to see her brother ere she died. The language of the visitant was plain and decided, and as soon as she had delivered the message she vanished. Schottus was perfectly awake, for at the moment of the strange appearance he was engaged in writing, and he determined to obey the mysterious mandate. When he arrived in Antwerp he found everything as had been stated, and on the next day his sister died. When he and his companion compared notes it was found that at the very time when he had received the message she had fallen asleep at his sister's bedside and dreamed of performing the mission.
               
               Gradually a saddened expression crept over the features of George, and raising his eyes to those of his sister, he murmured,—
               'Oh, that our mother had lived to see this happy moment.'
               'Our mother!' repeated Lucie.
               She seemed upon the point of saying more, but struggling to keep back the feelings that rose in her bosom, she gazed in silence upon the trembling features of her brother. There was a strange expression in her mild blue eyes as she thus gazed—an expression made up of sadness, and yet illumined by varying rays of hope. When she spoke, it was in a voice so tender and sweet that George felt its tones roll over his soul with a soothing influence:—
               'In God may we trust all things, and to the decrees of His providence let His children bow in meek submission. What He doeth is the result of an all-seeing wisdom, and His children's highest good is His only aim. Ah, my brother, let us not mourn without the sight of our faith. In the zenith of our pure and holy religion still shines, in all its heavenly effulgence, the star of Hope. Towards that star let us turn our gaze, and when we feel our spirits begin to droop, remember that we have one Parent, at least, who can never be lost to us. But the hour grows late, and we must separate for the night. Let your hopes, your fears, and your joys rest until the morrow.'
               As Lucie spoke she arose from her seat, and George followed her example. The fair girl was clasped once more in her brother's embrace, and a sweet, pure kiss, through which the heart sent forth its load of holy love, spoke the only farewell that was uttered. Words would have been useless after that sweet expression from the silent language of the heart.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               CONCLUSION.
               ON the next morning after George's interview with his sister, he was up and dressed betimes. Hardly had he performed his toilet when Richard Livingston entered the apartment. Upon the countenance of the latter beamed a joy and pleasure which no art could conceal, and as he grasped the hand of George he fairly trembled with the excitement that was raging within.
               'Come, come, George,' Richard said, as he drew his friend towards the door, 'ere we eat our breakfast the last sand in your glass of doubts and fears shall have dropped through forever.'
               'So soon,' uttered George, not realizing what he said, and utterly unable to comprehend the full meaning of his companion's manner.
               'Yes, yes. Come—everything is in waiting.'
               
               As Richard spoke he led the bewildered youth from the chamber and descended to the lower hall, from whence they entered the main room of the building, where were collected some ten or twelve persons, but the first countenance that started George from his confused entrancement was that of Capt. St. Clair, the commander of the Lenox, and springing quickly forward he 
                     gaasped
                     grasped
                   the old man by the hand, exclaiming as he did so,—
               'Ah, this is a pleasure, indeed, captain.'
               'Aye, and so it is to me,' returned St. Clair, while a beam of intense satisfaction glistened in either eye.
               George said no more, for Richard led him away towards the centre of the room, where stood the lord and lady Livingston, together with three attorneys and the smuggler. As soon as cordial greetings had been extended and returned, one of the attorneys demanded silence. One, who was a Judge of the King's Bench, then called upon Capt. St. Clair, and taking from a table by his side a roll of papers he asked,—
               'Captain St. Clair, is this the person whom you took from the wreck of the American ship Cyclops between ten and eleven years ago?'
               'It is, your honor.'
               'To that you swear.'
               'I do.'
               'Depositions have already been taken from you concerning the youth's account of himself at that time, and this signature attached to them you acknowledge as your own.'
               The judge opened a paper as he spoke which he handed to St. Clair, and the latter immediately answered,—
               'That is my signature, your honor.'
               The judge turned to George, and with a bland smile remarked,—
               'The proceedings in your favor have been closed over twenty-four hours, but as an additional weight we only required the recognition of Capt. St. Clair to make more sure what in the eyes of the law was already sufficient.—These papers are yours, and our prayer is, that England may have occasion to be proud of your accession.'
               As the old judge concluded he placed a roll of papers and parchment in the young man's hand, and ere George could recover from the bewilderment all had left the room save Lord and lady Livingston, Watt Wallingford, Richard and himself. For several moments no one spoke, but all, save George, seemed full of desire so to do. There was a strange expression upon their countenances, and each looked at the other as though the time for explanation had come.
               Lord Livingston motioned the company to be seated, and then turning to our hero he said,—
               'George, to me has been deputed the duty of explaining the various circumstances which have conspired to thus far make up the measure of your destiny.'
               George looked around half sadly, for two whom he expected to have seen were not there, Lucie and Jane gladdened not his soul with their presence; but in a moment he turned his eyes again upon the old noble, who continued,—
               'When your mother was yet almost a girl she had the fortune, or misfortune, as you please to term it, to fall in love with a young baronet from the North of England, named Frederic Linwood.'
               'How!' exclaimed the smuggler, starting up from his seat. 'His mother!—my brother!'—my brother did you say?'
               'Be quiet,' urged lord Livingston, as he motioned the smuggler back to his seat, 'and 
                     yov
                     you
                   shall soon understand it. It is as I have said, Sir William, your brother, Frederic, was this young man's father.' Then turning to George, he continued,—
               'Your mother's father objected to the match, and when at length the young couple were clandestinely married his rage knew no bounds.—Aurelia—that was your mother's name—being an only child, had supposed that her parent would forgive her when he found that the marriage had been consummated, but in this she was mistaken, for he not only discarded her, but forbade her ever to enter his doors again. Sir Frederic owned a small property in Westmoreland, and thither he took his young wife where dwelt his only sister, named Lucie. Now this sister had married a man of Welsh descent, whose name was also Linwood.'
               'Then my father, and Wat Wal—, or rather Sir William Linwood, and this Lucie Linwood were of the same family,' said George, in a tone of nervous anxiety.
               'Exactly,' returned Livingston. 'But when these marriages took place Sir William had been most wrongfully 
                     digraced
                     disgraced
                   from the navy, and had disappeared from the country, or, at least, so it was supposed; for no one suspected that he and the Wrecking Smuggler of the Ken were the same. Well, after your sister Lucie, who was named after your aunt, and yourself were born, your father suffered so much from the persecutions of his old father-in-law that he was obliged to flee the country, and consequently he sought refuge in America. Your aunt, whose death you witnessed at Kendal, suffered so much mortification from the disgrace of her brother, that she at length consented to accompany her husband on the same route, and they, too, went to America, but while there they saw nothing of your parents. When you were two years old your father sank under his many misfortunes and died in the midst of most abject poverty, and shortly after your mother received a letter from her parent, in which he freely forgave her all past offences, and promising her that if she would return to his arms, to bless his old age, she and her children should share his vast estates. Aurelia resolved to return, but, alas, she had not the means to procure passage for both her children, so she left one in the care of a widow—a Mrs. Brumford—promising to send for you immediately on her arrival in England. She found it hard work to make this choice, for she loved both her children alike, but though Lucie was the eldest, yet she was the most delicate flower, and hence her preference.
               'By one of those peculiar chances, which sometimes turn up in human affairs, Lucie Linwood, your aunt, had also lost her husband, and had taken passage in the same ship. Lucie had no children, and upon their arrival in England, Aurelia, who did not wish the world to know how poverty-stricken she had ot her sister-in-law to claim you as her own son, and under that guise to send for you herself. Under the circumstances Lucie readily agreed to the arrangement, and shortly after she fell in with Watt Wallingford, whom she at once recognized as her long missing brother William. To him she confided the task of seeking you, and believing that he would work more zealously if he believed that it was her own child who was wanted, she did not let him into the secret of your true birth. On his first visit to America after you Mrs. Brumford had moved, and so he could not find you, but he learned that the child whom he sought had once a sister, and when he returned, he asked Lucie the meaning of it.—She knew not how far she might implicate herself by denying the rumor, and so she confessed that she had had another child, but that it was dead. Thus Wallingford kept up the search, believing all the while that he was searching after his sister's child, instead of his brother Frederic's.'
               'There is one thing — and one only—for which I can blame my sister,' said Sir William. who was much excited by the tale he had heard, 'and that is, that she should have let me believe that her father had discarded her. To be sure I picked up the rumor in connection with my search after George, but she should at least have contradicted that.'
               'Never mind, Sir William,' said the old lord, 'let that pass now.' And turning again to George he continued,—
               'Of the circumstances of the smuggler's search you are well acquainted; but if one thing more I would tell you. Within a year after your mother's return to her early home her father died, but ere that event took place he was made acquainted with the secret of your existence, and he had a private will drawn up, under the king's own seal, bequeathing to his nearest male heir his title and his estates thereunto appertaining, with the proviso that said heir should take the family name,—which will was lodged with the Chief Justice of Bath with instructions that it should not be opened till his daughter gave her consent. Hence she was more than ever desirous to keep her secret, for fear that some of the male relations of her family, did they know of your existence, might seek you out

                     and
                   destroy you. But it seems that you were open to the same danger on the other hand, for that hot-headed young Welshman, Albert Linwood, believing you to be the son of his uncle felt the same danger with regard to his own estates. There was one person more who knew your mother's secret—an old Gipsey woman, named Maud, whose life your mother once saved, and to her fox-like cunning do we owe much in the settlement of the Linwood estates in Westmoreland.
               'But,' continued Lord Livingston, as he arose and grasped George's hand, 'all is now past, and your father's estates, and his rank in the kingdom, are yours.'
               'And who was my father?' tremblingly asked George, while his heart seemed pressing hard against his throat with its load of suspense.
               'Your father was Lord Thomas Lyndall, Earl of Tiverton.'
               'And I—'
               'You are Lord George Lyndall, Earl of Tiverton.'
               'Great God of Heaven, can—'
               George uttered no more, for at that moment his eye caught a scene that set his heart to beating as though it would have leaped from its narrow prison house. Up from the lower end of the room, just passing through the wide way which had been opened by the throwing back of the large folding-doors, approached Jane Livingston and his sister Lucie, leading between them a noble looking woman just past her prime. For a moment the beauteous trio stopped,—then she who stood in the centre broke from her companions, and uttering one wild cry of delirious joy, she sprang forward and clasped the entranced youth in her strong, love-tempered embrace.
               'Oh, my son!' she uttered, and utterly unable to speak more, she hung upon the neck of her long-lost boy, and sobbed as though her heart would burst beneath its delirium of maternal rapture.
               Fondly, tenderly, did George clasp that form within his powerful arms. One look at the heavenly features, and his soul sent forth its wildest notes—'Mother! Mother!'
               
               Let's raise the curtain which we dropped over that heaven-born, that God-sent scene—the reunion of the Mother and her Son.
               The hearts that beat so wildly have been stilled to a more quiet joy—the tears have been mostly wiped away, and the young Earl has resigned his mother to a seat.
               Then—his mother blamed him not for the act—George turned to the spot where stood Jane Livingston. She turned to her father, and met a kind smile of approval. That was enough.—The next moment she had pillowed her head upon the bosom of the only man she ever loved. The young Earl of Tiverton had sued for the lady Jane's hand, and what is more, he had gained it, and her whole heart with it.
               'Now,' said Richard, as he stepped half tremblingly forward, 'I have a favor to ask of you, George, for to you your mother resigns the affairs of the family.'
               The young Earl cast a side-long glance at his sister Lucie, and in her blushing, downcast look he read the favor that was needed at his hands, and, taking her hand, he led her forward and placed it in that of Richard Livingston, then looking towards his parent, he said,—
               'With your permission, mother.'
               'Yes, George, yes.'
               'There, take her, Richard, and if you make her half so happy as I feel in bestowing her upon you, she will be happy indeed.'
               Happy, happy indeed, were they all. The Smuggler of the Ken, through the intercession of lord Livingston, had been restored once more to the Navy, his crimes forgiven and forgotten in view of the great wrong he had suffered. The rest of our deserving actors we know to be on the topmast pinnacle of joy, while those who have played the villain's part we will leave 
                     to to
                     to
                   the care of Him who doeth all things well, believing that He will see no Virtue go unrewarded, nor any Crime unpunished.
