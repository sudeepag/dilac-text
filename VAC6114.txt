               A STORY OF SEA AND LAND ADVENTURE.
               BY SYLVANUS COBB, JR.
               
                  CHAPTER I.
                  THE LIGHT-KEEPER AND HIS PROTEGE.
                  UPON the northern coast of Devonshire, some seven miles to the west of the
                     confines of Somerset, there makes out into the British Channel an abrupt
                     promontory, known sometimes among seamen as Little Devon Head. From its
                     north-eastern point around to the eastern main, the shore is a smooth beach,
                     while the northern and western bounds are of ragged rocks. To the northeast,
                     and shielding the little beach from the gales that come up from the Atlantic, a
                     huge rock reaches out into the water, forming a small, snug cove, which lays
                     unusually quiet with its still water, while huge waves are lashing the rocks
                     upon the opposite side of the promontory. From this cove a narrow path leads up
                     on to the grass-grown summit of the headland, and there stands a small,
                     one-story stone house, and near it is a beacon. The house and the beacon, at
                     the time of which we write, were the only buildings upon the promontory. Back
                     of the house, to the south, the view was cut off by a sturdy growth of oak, but
                     to the north the scene was grand. Almost the whole surface of the Bristol
                     Channel could be swept with the naked eye, and the Welsh coast of Glamorgan was
                     dimly visible in the distance.
                  It was about the middle of the afternoon of a day in early spring. In the
                     little cove just alluded to, lay a large, sloop-built boat, with high, strong
                     bulwarks, and short, stout spars. Near her bows stood a man who seemed, from
                     his manner, to be the monarch of all about him. He was about forty years of
                     age; he might have been older, and perhaps younger—but a shrewd calculator
                     would have set him at forty, and the variation could not have been of much
                     consequence. He was a strong built man — his limbs all rightly shaped and
                     proportioned, and set with an easy firmness. He wore a rough drab pea jacket, a
                     coarse blue vest, and trowsers of heavy duck, while his head was covered with a
                     wide-rimmed, low, bowl-crowned, painted hat. His brow was broad and heavy, his
                     eyes black and large, his nose slightly Roman and prominent, and his mouth of a
                     medium size. The lips were peculiar—being thinner than seemed to correspond
                     with the other features, and seemed to be constantly quivering—a quivering,
                     however, almost imperceptible, unless he was regarded somewhat particularly.
                     His hair was short, leaving his broad brow and temples entirely bare, and its
                     color was of a jetty black. His beard was of the same color, and it grew just
                     where nature had provided, but it was neatly trimmed at the ends, nevertheless.
                     The moustache swept off in a graceful curve upon either side, leaving the
                     marked lip in sight; and the whole beard was what would have been thought a
                     "celestial possession" by a Persian monarch.
                  Such was Luke Garron, the Light-Keeper of the Devon Head. He stood now with one
                     hand testing on the rail of the boat, and the other folded against his hip. The
                     hand that rested upon the hip drew back the front of the long jacket, and
                     revealed a large pistol that reposed within the belt that supported the
                     trowsers. By the light-keeper's side stood a stout, steel fluked grappling-hook
                     and a heavy axe, implements which bad on more than one occasion helped him in
                     rendering assistance to those who needed it.
                  Luke Garron seemed fitted by nature for some higher sphere than that in which
                     we now find him, but he was, nevertheless, just the man for the place he
                     filled. Fearless and undaunted, strong and persevering, generous and
                     kind-hearted, he had saved many a life from the grave of the Channel.
                  While standing as we have described him, he seemed lost in reflective thought,
                     but are long he was aroused by the appearance of a boy who came running down
                     the path from the house. The boy made his way into the boat and approached the
                     light-keeper. He was a lovely child, with bright, sunny curls, large blue eyes,
                     and a smiling, happy cast of countenance. Not over eight years could have
                     rolled over his head.
                  "Ah, what now, Alfred?" asked the man, as he stretched forth both hands to
                     greet the new comer.
                  "O, I've come to find you. Old Nepsey wont talk with me, and I feel
                     lonesome."
                  Luke Garron stooped down and kissed the boy's white brow.
                  
                  "Nepsey is a good woman, but she doesn't like to talk," he said.
                  "O, yes, she's good," the boy uttered.
                  "Yes, and the lover you, too. I have just been thinking about you, Alfred."
                  "Ah, and what did you think, father? It was something good, I hope."
                  "I was thinking that you would always stay with me, and be my child."
                  "How can I help it? You are my father," the boy returned, as Luke took him up
                     in his stout arms. "You raved my life from the ugly sea when I was almost
                     drowned. You've always been good to me—very good—a great deal better than the
                     other father I had."
                  "I guess you don't remember much about your other father?"
                  "O, yes I do," Alfred said, with considerable animation. "I remember how he
                     used to strike me, and you are always so good. O, I love you."
                  As the boy ceased speaking, he placed his finger upon Luke's cheek and wiped
                     off a large that stood there. For some moments the man was
                      He kissed Alfred again, and then said:
                  "You must study, Alfred. I left you in the house with your book. You should
                     have got your lesson before you came out."
                  "O, I've got it all perfect—every word of it."
                  Luke looked incredulous.
                  "I have, certainty," the boy continued. seeming to comprehend the meaning of
                     his protector's look.
                  "Well, well, I'll hear you recite it when I go in."
                  Luke placed the boy upon his feet, and then turned to haul in a rope that was
                     hanging overboard.
                  "Father, just see those great big black clouds that are rising over the rock. I
                     saw them before I came down here. Suppose we should have one of those dreadful
                     storms?"
                  Luke Garron looked up over his head, and he saw that the toy had spoken the
                     truth Heavy clouds were rolling up into the heavens, and the waters of the
                     channel were changing to a sable hue. Little spits of wand were flying in from
                     the Atlantic, and the waves were gathering tiny crests of white foam. Luke took
                     the boy by the hand, and left the boat. When he reached the summit of the bluff
                     he saw that a real storm was brewing in the west.
                  "I trust all ships may be well clear of the lee shore," murmured the
                     light-keeper.
                  Alfred looked up into his face, and he knew, from the shades he saw there, that
                     danger might be expected. Ere long big raindrops began to fall, and the
                     light-keeper and his protege started towards the house.
                  "Ah," uttered Luke, "who is that going off through the woods!"
                  "O, I forgot," returned Alfred, as he gazed in the direction pointed out by
                     Luke's finger. "It's a man that stopped to get a drunk of water; but I didn't
                     think he would stop all this time. Nepsey was getting the water for him when I
                     came out."
                  "Why does he go away just as it begins to rain?"
                  "Perhaps he's in a hurry."
                  "Maybe," fell from Garron's lips, and he spoke not again till be reached the
                     house.
                  Nepsey was just Beginning to prepare for cooking the supper. She was a woman
                     somewhere about fifty years old, with a look of shrewdness about her face; and
                     though her features were far from comely, yet they were by no means repulsive.
                     She had been a sort of fixture of the house for over twenty years, having lived
                     there with her husband, who had been a former keeper of the place, but whose
                     death had given the berth to the present incumbent.
                  "Who was that man. Nepsey, that called here just now?" asked Luke.
                  "I don't know, sir," returned Nepsey.
                  "He remained some time."
                  "Yes, sir"
                  "To rest, I suppose?"
                  "Ye—e—es, sir," hesitatingly answered the old woman, as she arose from the fire
                     she had just been kindling upon the hearth. "He said he would rest."
                  Nepsey glanced mysteriously at Alfred as she spoke, and then her gaze was fixed
                     earnestly upon her waster. Luke noticed her manner, and a dark shade passed
                     over his face.
                  "What did he say, Nepsey?" he asked.
                  "He asked me about Alfred."
                  "Well, and what did you tell him?"
                  The woman was uneasy, and the evident perturbation of her master increased the
                     difficulty. She hesitated for a moment, and then she said:
                  "I told him more than I ought; but he commenced asking his questions so
                     carelessly, and so common-place like, that I didn't mistrust he had any
                     interest in the matter."
                  "And how do you know that he did have any interest in the matter?" quickly
                     asked Luke, gazing earnestly into the woman's face.
                  "By the way he looked and acted after he found out that Alfred was not your
                     child, but that you took him from the water in the great storm four years
                     ago."
                  "Did you tell him all this?"
                  "Yes."
                  "You ought not to have done it"
                  "I know it."
                  Luke Garron was silent for some moments. Alfred crept to his
                     side and asked him what was the mutter; but Luke gave him no answer.
                  "What sort of a looking man was he?" he at length asked of
                     Nepsey.
                  "Not at ail pleasant or agreeable after he had been here a spell, though he
                     looked well enough when he first called. He looked half-wolf and half
                     snake"
                  At any other time Garron would have smiled at Nepsey's answer, but he felt not
                     like it now.
                  "Had he any feature by which you could mark him?" he asked.
                  "Yes; three great sears on his face—one across his nose, one on his cheek and
                     one across his chin."
                  "What does it all mean, father?" asked the boy, us he got up into Luke's lap
                     and put his arm about the keeper's neck. "What does it all mean?"
                  "Nothing, nothing, my child," said Garron, who seemed nervous and unhappy.
                  "Ah, father, you remember what you heard me read in my Bible yesterday?"
                  Luke gazed into the face of the boy without speaking.
                  "You know," continued Alfred, "we must not deceive each other. I know you have
                     something. Do tell me what it is. Come, I'll be good."
                  "O, Alfred, you must not ask me," bitterly exclaimed Luke. "Nepsey, you should
                     not have told him—you should not have said a word."
                  "But I couldn't—I didn't know. He didn't seem to be anyways concerned about the
                     matter at first, and I'm sure I didn't think of harm. Don't blame me."
                  "I wont blame you, Nepsey," uttered Luke; "but I'm sorry—sorry!"
                  The light-keeper found the boy's gaze fixed earnestly upon him as he spoke.
                     Those large, blue eyes were shining with an earnest, liquid light, and the lips
                     were trembling with fear.
                  "Alfred," Luke said, "do not be alarmed, I will protect you."
                  "But what is the danger! Who was that man?"
                  Garron looked steadily into the boy's face some time without speaking. At
                     length he said:
                  "It must have been he who was wrecked with you"
                  "My father?" cried Alfred, with a look of alarm.
                  "Yes."
                  "O, you will not let me go away with him?" urged the boy,
                     clinging more closely to his protector. "You will keep me with you?"
                  "Yes, yes," returned Luke, folding the boy to his bosom. "Fear not. I know
                        Marrok Pettrell, and he shall not have—"
                  The light keeper hesitated, his face grew darker, and he was more agitated.
                  "Come Alfred, get your book, and I will hear your lesson. Let this fear pass
                     from your mind."
                  The boy thought his protector had banished all his own fear. He was not old
                     enough to read those quivering signs that dwelt still upon Luke's face, and
                     with a look of assured safety he ran for his book. His lesson had indeed been
                     most faithfully committed, and while he was answering his kind teacher's
                     questions, his young face was lighted up by the glow of youthful ardor. He was
                     proud to learn.
                  Luke Garron heard the lesson through, but his task was a hard one. He saw that
                     the boy's fears were in a measure quieted, and he strove hard to prevent any
                     look or word of his own from renewing them.
                  "That's a noble boy," he said, as he returned the book. "Keep on so, and you
                     will be a happy man."
                  Luke Garron may have meant what he said—but it is certain that be shuddered
                     when be thought of the boy's future.
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  THE TEMPEST. THE SIGNAL GUN.
                  IT had grown dark, and Garron had gone to light up the beacon. The rain came
                     down in sweeping torrents, and the wind howled like a mad lion. The sea roared
                     with terror in its deep-toned voice, and the great waves crashed like tumbling
                        mountains as they broke in fury over the rocks of the
                     promontory.
                  "This is a fearful night," uttered the light-keeper, as he entered the house
                     and shook the rain from his long jacket. "God forbid that there be a vessel on
                     our coast!"
                  "How the wind howls," said Nepsey, who was crouched away in the chimney corner.
                     "It's never blown harder than this but once for twenty years; and that was when
                     the sea rolled up over our very dooryard."
                  "So far as that?" said Alfred.
                  "Yes," resumed Nepsey, while she put the corner of her apron to her eye "that
                     was when my husband was lost. It was nearly midnight then, and the light had
                     gone out in the beacon. He was determined to go and relight it. I tried to make
                     him stay with me, but go he would. The sea had been twice over our yard then.
                     He went out—he got to the beacon and fired the lamps, but he never came back
                     again."
                  "But how was he lost?" asked the boy, who had become interested.
                  "He must have been swept away. I looked out of the window and saw him in the
                     beacon after he had fired the great wicks, and then I saw him turn to come
                     down. A few minutes afterwards the windows of this room were broken in with a
                     loud crash, and I heard the great sea as it rolled over. My husband must have
                     gone with it, for I never saw him afterwards."
                  Alfred rose from his seat and went to the side of the woman. She was sobbing
                     beneath the smart of the wound she had opened, and the boy placed his arm about
                     her neck, and tried to soothe her. He was successful, for Nepsey
                        kissed the kind-hearted boy and smiled.
                  At nine o'clock, Alfred sought his bed, but he could not sleep. The wind bowled
                     so about the low walls, and the waves roared so upon the rocky shore, that he
                     could only remember that fearful, dreadful night when he himself had been torn
                     from the breaking ship, and washed up to where the light-keeper had found him.
                     That was four years before, when he was only four years old, but the scene was
                     as fresh and vivid before his mind as though he possessed the mental powers of
                     manhood. He remembered nothing back of the storm save the face and blows of
                     Marrok Pettrell, a man who had professed to be his father; but he could only
                     think of Pettrell with horror. Upon Luke Garron he fastened his childish love.
                     He had been born into the world of enjoyment when he first found shelter
                     beneath the keeper's roof—he was the child of the storm, and Luke often called
                     him his little "STORM CHILD."
                  It is no wonder that Garron loved his Storm Child for the little fellow was all
                     goodness, all kindness, all gratitude and all love. He remembered just enough
                     of the first four years of his life to form a contrast with the present, and
                     that contrast filled him with thanks and gratitude. His mind held a fear
                     engendered by the visit of Pettrell, the preceding afternoon, but his young
                     soul reposed with considerable confidence in the power of Garron. Both Garron
                     and himself had thought Pettrell dead until the present time—they thought he
                     had been lost at the time when Alfred was wrecked; but his appearance—Garron
                     knew from Nepsey's description that it must be he—had dispelled the
                     supposition.
                  It was after ten o'clock when Alfred fell asleep. At midnight he was awakened
                     by the breaking in of his window. He leaped from his bed, and the first thought
                     that flashed across his mind was of the sea's having reached the house; but it
                     was only the wind, after all, that had blown the window in. He soon calmed his
                     worst fears, but he could not think of retiring again. The wind was still
                     howling with all its might, but the rain had nearly ceased falling. Occasional
                     drops, however, came driving down like half-spent pistol-balls.
                  The boy sought the kitchen, and Nepsey was there over the fire. He asked for
                     his father, and he was told that he was in the beacon. The woman tried to
                     persuade Alfred from venturing out, but it was of no avail. He drew on his
                     coat, and having buttoned it closely about him, he put on his cap and left the
                     house. For several moments after he had gained the yard, he was obliged to give
                     way before the tempest. The wind came near taking him upon its bosom and
                     bearing him off, but he at length braced himself and faced it, and after a long
                     and tedious effort he reached the beacon. The door was upon the leeward side of
                     the structure, and he opened it and closed it after him without difficulty. He
                     ascended the narrow stone stairs and found Garron seated near the lamps.
                  "Mercy on me! Why, what brought you here, Alfred?" exclaimed Luke, as the boy
                     approached him.
                  "I came to seek you, father. O, how dreadfully it blows."
                  "But you should not have ventured out, my child."
                  "I could not stay in my room, for the wind has blown one of my windows in. I
                     had rather be here with you."
                  "Your room would have been safer than this place," returned Garron.
                  "Then what makes you stay here?"
                  "To see that the lamps do not go out. They have been out twice now. The wind
                     draws through the crevices in the door, and sometimes it comes up here in
                     gusts."
                  The beacon did vibrate beneath the power of the gale, and Alfred could not but
                     feel a degree of alarm as he first felt the returning shocks, but he soon
                     became used to it, and a sense of novelty overcame his fear.
                  "This is dreadful, and yet how grand it is" uttered the boy, us he crept down
                     by the side of his guardian. "If it wasn't for the danger of life to those poor
                     folks at sea, I could almost wish this would last. It makes me feel like a man
                     to face up against such a storm."
                  Garron gazed upon the upturned face of the boy, and a smile lit up his
                     features. But the smile soon passed away, and with a sober look he laid his
                     band upon Alfred's head.
                  "You feel safe, my child, because I am here with you," he said.
                  The boy silently acknowledged the truth of the remark.
                  "You say you feel like a man," continued Garron, with a tone of deep pathos and
                     meaning. "You feel like a man because you can face this storm and brave all its
                     dangers; but when you grow up to be a man in years, do you think you can then
                     face all the storms you may meet?"
                  Alfred looked inquisitively at his guardian.
                  "You will then have other storms to face. Perhaps in a few years you will be
                     cast upon the world, and be obliged to guide your own bark. Did you know there
                     are such things as sin and wickedness in the would?"
                  "Yes," said the boy, with a shudder.
                  "And did you know that evil men sometimes tempt the unwary into sin' Ah, my
                     child, if you live to be a man, you will find many a storm of life to be faced,
                     and he is a noble man who comes out safely from them all. When you came out
                     from the house to-night, did you not have to stand still a few moments ere you
                     could gain strength to make your way against the storm?"
                  "Yes, and it even took me back a little ways."
                  "Would it not have been very easy for you to have turned about and walked the
                     other way?"
                  "O, yes."
                  "And why did you not do it?"
                  "Why, I should certainly have been lost."
                  "Yes. And why did you face the storm and walk bravely against it?"
                  "Why, because the beacon was this way."
                  "That's it, my child," returned Garron, as he drew the boy closer to him. "Now
                     can you not always bear this simple thing in mind? You wish to be a good man
                     when you grow up, and you wish to have your name honored?"
                  "Yes," said the boy.
                  "Then," resumed Garron, "let that be your beacon, and remember that to reach
                     that beacon is the object of your journey of life. Let the wind be high or low,
                     let it blow a tempest or a gentle breeze, keep your face towards the beacon,
                     and push boldly forward. If the gale be against you, face it without fear. It
                     may at times seem more easy to walk the other way when the tempest now is in
                     your face, but remember that the ocean of danger may swallow you. Face about,
                     brave the storm, and push on for your beacon. Think you can remember this?"
                  The boy arose to his feet, and after gazing for a moment into his protector's
                     face, he threw his arm about the good man's neck, and gently murmured:
                  "I shall never forget it."
                  The tempest howled, and the beacon trembled, but for a while the man and the
                     boy noticed it not. They were busy with other thoughts.
                  "Great God! what was that?" cried the light-keeper, lifting the boy from his
                     knees and springing to his feet.
                  "I heard nothing but the wind," said the boy.
                  "No, no, 'twas not the wind. Ha! Did you hear that, Alfred?"
                  "I heard something. It was the break of a big wave on the rocks."
                  "O, no, it was a gun!"
                  "A gun?" repeated Alfred. "Then there must be some ship on the coast."
                  "Yes. Ah, there goes another. Stay you here, I will go down mid see if I can
                     make out her where abouts, Another—and another. O, this is fearful!"
                  "I must go wish you," said the boy.
                  "You had better stay."
                  "No, let me go. I can face the storm."
                  "Then come."
                  Luke Garron saw that the beacon lamps were all safe, and then he turned to
                     descend the stone stairs. When he reached the ground he passed out, closed the
                     door safely behind him, and then gave his hand to the boy. It was only a few
                     rods to the head of the bluff, and with careful steps the keeper made his way
                     along. The heavens were as black as ink, and the earth was buried in darkness;
                     but the lashing waters of the broad Channel were visible in their
                     phosphorescent glimmering, and the two companions could see the great white
                     heaps of foam that came crashing upon the rocks.
                  They had to grope their way along with the utmost care, for a single false step
                     would be dangerous. Alfred, however, bore bravely up, and Garron found that his
                     help was not necessary to keep the boy up. He still held him by the hand,
                     though, for he did not care to run the risk of danger. Ere long there came a
                     dull boom upon the tempest, and Garron stopped. Another, and another report
                     followed in rapid succession.
                  "Those were guns, certainly," said Luke.
                  "Ah, then I saw a glimmer," said the boy.
                  Hardly were the words out of his mouth before the sound of the distant gun came
                     rolling along. Alfred made his guardian understand the direction in which he
                     had seen the glimmer, and it was soon seen again, and again the report
                     followed.
                  "That is the spot," said the keeper, fastening his eyes upon the point in which
                     he had seen the light.
                  "How far off is she?" asked the boy at the top of his voice.
                  "Not over six or seven miles," returned Garron.
                  "And the wind must he petting her this way," added the boy, bracing himself
                     more firmly against the gale.
                  "Yes, yes," uttered the light-keeper, in a deep, heavy tone. "She is lost,
                     lost!"
                  "If she don't work off," said the boy.
                  "Work off!" echoed Garron "A piece of canvass no bigger than a bat cover
                     wouldn't stand before this gale. Work off! Would to God she could, for Heaven
                     knows I can give her no aid! I can only look up the ill fated crew in the
                     morning."
                  It was now near two o'clock in the morning. The rain had ceased falling
                     altogether, and away off in the western heavens there appeared to he a breaking
                     in the black sky. Still the light-keeper and the boy stood upon the bluff and
                     gazed off to where over and anon appeared the lightning of the ship's guns.
                     Those guns still boomed over the waters, but the tempest mocked at them, and
                     howled down their terror-laden notes.
                  The ill-fated ship had now been driven so near that the report followed closely
                     upon the flash of the gun. It was evident to Garron that she would strike
                     before she could reach the bluff. She seemed driving towards a point about half
                     a mile to the westward of the spot where the watchers stood, and would thus
                     strike the extreme western sweep of the promontory.
                  "The people at Comb Martin may have heard the guns, and some of them may come
                     out," said the boy.
                  "Perhaps so; but that is sixteen miles from here, and no one would be very
                     likely to follow the ship," returned Garron. "O, God knows I cannot ward off
                     the blow! They are in the hands of One who doeth all things well, and he will
                     have called many a soul home to himself ere another sun shall rise. God have
                     mercy on them, and I will do what I can."
                  For a long time the two watchers stood in silence. The ship came nearer and
                     nearer. It was now evi- dent that she
                     would strike, as Garron had anticipated. The break in the western sky had grown
                     larger, and the heavy edges of the black clouds could be seen as they began to
                     break away from the bosom of the Atlantic and roll up into the heavens. The
                     gale seemed to slacken. Perhaps it was because the watchers had become inured
                     to it. Yet its fury was on the wane.
                  "I think I can see her," uttered the boy, pointing with his hand towards the
                     spot where it had been thought the ship would strike.
                  The light-keeper looked, and he could just distinguish a black mass upon the
                     surging waves. His hands were clasped in fearful susspense.
                  "Did you see her?" asked the boy.
                  "Yes, Alfred."
                  "O, how near she is! Look! Look!"
                  "Her last moment is at hand!" murmured Luke Garron, as he bent his head forward
                     and strained his eyes towards the fatal scene.
                  "Hark!" shudderingly uttered the boy.
                  At that moment there came a wild, fearful cry over the lashing surge. Then came
                     a crashing—a rumbling of rending timbers—and again that wild cry broke upon the
                     tempest.
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  THE WRECK, AND THE STORM CHILD.
                  THE first gray streaks of morning were in the east. The tempest had passed over
                     in its fury, but the  wind murmured a mournful requiem, and the great
                     heavy waves rolled sluggishly in from the ocean. Luke Garron armed himself with
                     a short book, and a hatchet, and a coil of light rope, and with Alfred for a
                     companion, he set forth towards the scene of the wreck.
                  As they descended the bluff towards the west they could just distinguish the
                     outlines of the ragged mass of timbers that were fastened among the rocks. When
                     they reached the low shore they found that fragments of the wreck were lodged
                     all along in the crevices of the low breakers, and the sea was breaking over
                     them in wild confusion. At the distance of ton rods from the promontory the two
                     companions suddenly stopped. Upon a small bed of gray sand, where the water
                     washed in between two large rocks, lay the form of a human being. It was a
                     seaman, and his face was turned downward. Luke turned the corse over. The
                     features were stiff and rigid.
                  "This is the beginning," murmured the light-keeper, as he brushed the sand from
                     the cold face.
                  The boy did not speak, but he helped his protector draw the body further up on
                     the shore, and then they passed on
                  Ere long another body was found, and having drawn is up out of the reach of the
                     sea, the companions set forward again; but they were soon stopped by a sight
                     that chilled their blood. Three female forms lay close between two rocks, and
                     they were clasped firmly in each other's embrace. Luke Garron stood for a
                     moment without the power to speak.
                  "O!" uttered the boy, shrinking more closely to his guardian, "this is
                     dreadful. Think they are dead?"
                  "Yes," mournfully returned Luke "They no longer know what it is to suffer. The
                     voice of the storm is hushed to their ears, and they feel not the chill of the
                     cold sea. Death is but death. The angel unlocks the doors of the soul and lets
                     the spirit forth; yet it seems hard to have the spirit torn out thus."
                  Luke could not move the bodies of the women without help, and he moved forward.
                     At length he reached the spot where the ship had struck. Great spars and
                     timbers were strewed about over the beach and among the rocks. For the distance
                     of many rods the sea was flanked with big rocks and sharp crags, while back
                     towards the shore was spread a low beach. Most of the lighter stuff that had
                     broken loose from the wreck was spread upon this beach, but the heavy parts
                     were lodged among the rocks. The ship had struck her bows upon the breakers,
                     and had them been literally knocked to pieces. For a long time, Luke Garron
                     searched for some living witness who might tell to him the story of the ship
                     and her crew, but not one could he find. There were witnesses enough to tell
                     the sad story of the wreck, and of its load of death, but they were all
                     silent—their lips were sealed.
                  Many of those who had thus met their death, Luke knew must have been passengers
                     From the bales and boxes of merchandise which were scattered about him, he knew
                     that the ship had been an Indiaman. For nearly an hour the light-keeper
                     continued his search, but every face he met was stiff and cold.
                  The boy had been walking alone. His soul was filled with awe, and with
                     fearfully beating heart he gazed upon the ghastly emblems of mortality that lay
                     about him. While his companion was hunting among the rocks, Alfred walked back
                     to the spot where the three females were lodged between the rocks. He reached
                     the place, and for a long time he stood still and gazed upon the scene.
                     Perhaps, he was thinking of one who might have been his own mother; one whom he
                     fancied he could remember, but whom he could only see in his young heart's
                     affections, for his memory retained no image of the loved ideal.
                  Suddenly the boy started, for he thought he heard a sound issue from one of the
                     women, and he was sure that he saw a movement of the drapery that hung about
                     the cold forms. He sprang forward and laid his hand upon the brow of her who
                     laid uppermost, but there was no life there. The other two faces he could see,
                     and he was sure that no life animated them. The see broke over the spot, and
                     all drenched with the cold water the boy made his way back to the sand.
                  "It was only the gurgling of the water among the rocks," he said to himself, as
                     he turned his eyes again upon the scene.
                  But again he heard the sound, and he saw the drapery move. Once more he sprang
                     forth upon the rocks and knelt down by the side of the corses. Again he heard
                     the sound that had startled him, and one of the dresses moved beneath his hand.
                     It was surely the voice of a child that he heard!
                  With a strength that might have become a man, Alfred raised the uppermost form.
                     His heart leaped up with a wild thrill as he beheld a little child nestled away
                     in the embrace of the female he had moved. It opened its eyes as the light came
                     in upon it, and a sharp cry broke from its lips. It was a girl, and as the boy
                     raised her in his arms she laid her little head upon his bosom and began to
                     cry.
                  The child's resting-place had been so shielded from the sea, that its force had
                     been lost upon her, and she had not been struck by any of the timbers or rocks.
                     Two of the women seemed to have been clasped together so as to shield the
                     child, while the third clung to her companions from the instinct of safety. Of
                     course, the little thing was wet and cold, but seemed not to have been bodily
                     harmed.
                  With hasty steps the boy made his way back to the beach, and then cried out at
                     the top of his voice for his guardian. Garron heard him, and hastened to the
                     spot.
                  "O, see, see!" cried Alfred; "I've found a living child."
                  "God be thanked" uttered Luke, as he took the child in his arms and gazed into
                     its face. "One life at least, is saved to earth. The little thing is cold. We
                     must hasten to the house with it, and then come back again."
                  "Let me carry her." cried the boy.
                  "You are not strong enough, Alfred. It would take you too long, and she is very
                     cold now."
                  Luke strode on towards his house with the child, and Alfred ran along by his
                     side.
                  "Here, Nepsey," said Garron, as he entered the kitchen, "here is a charge for
                     you. Get something dry for it as soon as possible."
                  "But its mother—where is she?" asked the old woman, as she took the child in
                     her arms, and instinctively kissed it.
                  "I'm afraid this child is the only one saved from the wreck. We can find no
                     more of life."
                  "No more! All gone!" ejaculated Nepsey.
                  "Yes, all gone! But hurry and make the most of this."
                  The woman was for some moments deprived of her reasoning faculties, but at
                     length she gathered her senses together, and kissing the child again, she
                     turned towards the fire.
                  "Another child of the storm," she said, as she fixed a seat for her charge.
                  The light-keeper gazed thoughtfully upon the child, and a kind look—almost a
                     smile—broke over his features.
                  "It is the second of my STORM CHILDREN," he said. "Be careful of her,
                     Nepsey."
                  There was no need of this charge, for the woman was hurrying to fix a warm, dry
                     dress, and the cast of her countenance showed that her heart was enlisted in
                     the work.
                  Luke Garron started to return to the scene of the wreck, and Alfred followed
                     him. When they again reached the spot, they found that a number of men had
                     arrived from Comb Martin, and in less than an hour ever an hundred people had
                     assembled about the place. The bodies were all collected—or at least, such as
                     could be found, and before noon two of the coroners of Devonshire, with other
                     officers, were upon the spot. The ship was found to be the Chesham, but none of
                     her papers could be found. At the request of Garron the bodies of the three
                     females were carried up to his house, and the others were placed in wagons and
                     carried to Comb Martin.
                  The proper officers took charge of the wreck, and their men set about the work
                     of collecting such things as were of value. The deep waters of the bay were
                     settling into quiet once more. They seemed like the fatigued lion who has
                     performed his work of death, and goes crouching away to his rest.
                  It was nearly night when Luke Garron returned to his house. The child was
                     asleep, and he sought his own bed to gain, if possible, a
                     little rest before it would be time to light the beacon.
                     Alfred, too, was tired, and he early sought that sleep of which he had been
                     deprived on the preceding night.
                  The next morning was bright and the little girl who had been saved from the
                     wreck was running about the kitchen calling for her "mama." She was a
                     bright-eyed creature, about four years old, and her hair hung down upon her
                     shoulders in glossy ringlets. Her checks were wet with tears, nor could Nepsey
                     comfort her. The light keeper took her in his arms and carried her to where the
                     bodies of the three females had been laid.
                  "Mama, mama," cried the child, reaching forth her little hands towards the
                     female from whose embrace Alfred had released her.
                  "Is that mama?" asked Garron, laying his hand upon the cold brow of the woman
                     in question.
                  "Yes, my mama—my mama," cried the child, struggling to get away from the man
                     who held her.
                  "I think not," returned Luke. "That women is certainly Scotch, and there is no
                     likeness between her and the child."
                  "But the child must know its own mother," said Nepsey; but she spoke in a
                     doubting mood, for she saw the disparity which Luke had pointed out. The woman
                     was Scotch in dress and feature, and not far from forty years of age.
                  "It may be only a nurse," said Garron. "It certainly cannot be a mother. If she
                     is the nurse who has always had charge of the child, she would naturally call
                     her 'mama.'"
                  The child still cried for its mama, and Garron at length carried her away.
                     Alfred took her, and with the boy she soon became composed. She laughed with
                     him, and before the day was passed she had learned to regard him with manifest
                     affection. She seemed to regard him with more favor than she did the older
                     people, though she still had spells of crying for her "mama." She said her name
                     was Ella Dean.
                  At the end of a week from the time of the wreck, Ella had become quite
                     satisfied with her new home. She laughed and played with Alfred, smiled when
                     Luke took her in his arms, and called Nepsey her "mama." Word had been sent out
                     of the circumstance, but no one came to claim the little girl, and the
                     light-keeper began to look upon her as his own. Her bright presence called new
                     smiles to his face, and with Alfred upon one knee, and Ella upon the other, he
                     loved to sit and laugh and play with his Storm Children.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  A STRANGE TRANSACTION.
                  BACK of the beacon house, beneath the shade of the great oak, Luke Garron made
                     three graves, and within their silent chambers he deposited the remains of the
                     females who had been brought to his house. He could find no clue to their
                     names, and he simply raised a slab upon the spot, which bore upon its surface a
                     simple record of the event that had transpired. He was firm
                     in his conviction that neither of the women could have been the mother of Ella,
                     for the child seemed to recognize only one of them, and all rules of
                     physiognomy set aside the supposition that that one could have been any kin to
                     the girl.
                  Two weeks had passed away, and Ella Dean was happy. She piped forth her joyous
                     notes like a warbling bird, and with Alfred by her side, she was happy.
                     Sometimes she spoke of her "other mama," and tears would start to her eyes, and
                     her little lips would tremble; but a kiss from Alfred would dispel the cloud
                     and light up her face with smiles again.
                  It was just after noon, on a pleasant day, and the two children were at play
                     before the house. Luke Garron had gone down to his boat, and Nepsey was about
                     her work in the building. Suddenly Alfred was startled by the appearance of
                     three men who had come up through the path from the woods. One of them he
                     recognized as the man who had been there two weeks before, and he was sadly
                     frightened.
                  Marrok Pettrell—for he it was—gazed a few moments upon the boy, and then he
                     went up to where he stood.
                  "Your name is Alfred?" said Pettrell.
                  "Yes, sir."
                  "Alfred Pettrell?" continued the man.
                  "No, no—Alfred Harrold," uttered the boy, trembling with fear.
                  "No. Your name is Pettrell. You are my own son. Don't you remember me? Don't
                     you remember when we were cast away together?"
                  "O, no, no! I don't remember you," cried the boy, moving back with terror.
                     "Good Luke Garron is my father."
                  "I declare," said one of Pettrell's companions, with a coarse laugh, "the boy
                     don't know his own father. Well, blow me if that aint a rum go."
                  "It can't be expected, Bronkon," returned Pettrell, "for I haint seen the boy
                     before for four years. But come, my son," be continued, turning towards Alfred,
                     "you will go with me now?"
                  "No, no!" exclaimed the boy. "I wont go with you. I'll go and find my
                     father."
                  Alfred started to run away as he spoke, but the man caught him by the arm.
                  "Stop, stop, my boy. I am your father, and I have come to take you."
                  Alfred cried with terror, and little Ella screamed and started towards the
                     house. Nepsey came out to see what was the matter, and at the same moment Luke
                     Garron came up from his boat.
                  "Father, father!" cried Alfred, breaking away from Pettrell and running to the
                     light-keeper, "you wont let these ugly men take me away?"
                  Luke seemed to recognize Marrok Pettrell at once, for his face turned pale, and
                     he trembled.
                  "Your name is Garron, I take it?" said Pettrell, advancing towards Luke.*

                  
                     *[SEE ENGRAVING]
                  
                  "Yes," returned the light-keeper, laying his hand upon the shoulder of the
                     shrinking boy.
                  "Then I've come to get my son. That's him.
                  "Your son!" repeated Garron.
                  "Yes. That youngster that seems to take such a fancy for you. He's my child—my
                     own blood, and I want him."
                  "Then you cannot have him," firmly returned Luke.
                  Marrok Pettrell laughed.
                  "That is a go," said Bracken.
                  "A queer business," added Pettrell, "for a father to be denied his own
                     child."
                  "He is not your child," said Luke.
                  "No, I'm your child — your own boy!" cried Alfred.
                  "Now you make me out a liar!" said Pettrell. "Was not that boy thrown upon the
                     coast here four years ago this spring?"
                  "Yes," answered Luke, after a moment's hesitation.
                  "Of course he was; and it was my own vessel that was wrecked," resumed
                     Pettrell. "I was washed ashore six miles beyond Porlock on a spare spar. I
                     always thought my boy was lost till about a month ago, and then I heard that
                     you had found him. Of course I knew it was my boy. Now I want him."
                  Luke Garron trembled like an aspen, and he know not what to do. The poor boy
                     clung to him, and bagged for his protection.
                  "You cannot—must not take him," uttered Garron, in despairing accents.
                  "What—not have my own flesh and blood?" exclaimed Pettrell, with much
                     surprise.
                  "I do not believe—"
                  "Blow your belief," impatiently interrupted Pettrell. "I want my boy, and
                     that's enough for an honest man. Hope you don't want me to use force?"
                  The light-keeper doubled up his fists as he heard these words, and the muscles
                     of his arms worked like big cords. The quick flush of anger, however, passed
                     from his face, and he bore a look of the keenest anguish.
                  "Let me keep him," he said. "In God's name I implore you to let me keep him. He
                     has become part of my very life, and I cannot part with him."
                  "I'm really sorry to give you so much pain," coolly replied Pettrell; "but
                     what's mine is mine, and I must have it; so the boy must come along."
                  Garron stood and held the boy, but he had lost his firmness. Dark clouds passed
                     over his features, and once his hand rested upon the pistol he wore in his
                     belt.
                  "Come, Pettrell, take the boy, and let's be off," said Bronkon.
                  Marrok Pettrell moved towards the place where the boy stood.
                  "Keep back!" gasped Luke. "Lay not a band upon him! He is my child!"
                  "Your child!" laughed Pettrell, in derision.
                  "Mine by right of justice," continued Luke. "I saved him from the cold sea, and
                     I have nursed and reared him from a little child. He's mine! mine!"
                  "Not quite—so stop your foolery, and give me my boy."
                  Pettrell caught Alfred by the arm as he spoke, and pulled him away from the
                     light-keeper.
                  "Save me! save me! O, for God's sake, save me!" cried Alfred.
                  Little Ella shrieked and ran into the house.
                  In a moment all Luke's firmness returned to him. The cries of the loved boy
                     overcame all other emotions but those of love for the child, and with one blow
                     of his powerful fist he knocked Marrok Pettrell over upon the greensward, and
                     then seised the child in his arms. He had commenced a contest, however, which
                     he could not carry out, for both the other men sprang upon him, and a blow from
                     the butt of Bronkon's pistol laid him senseless upon the ground.
                  When Luke Garron came to himself, old Nepsey was bending over him, and little
                     Ella was kneeling by his aide.
                  "Where — where — is my boy?" were his first words, as he arose to his
                     elbow.
                  "Gone! They've carried him off!" said the woman.
                  The light-keeper sprang to his feet and gazed wildly about him.
                  At that moment a body of horsemen, at the head of whom was the sheriff of
                     Somerset, came galloping towards the house.
                  "Have there been three men—three strangers—near here?" hastily asked the
                     sheriff, as he pulled up his horse by the side of Luke.
                  "Yes, yes," quickly returned Nepsey, while her master was collecting his
                     senses.
                  "And where are they now?"
                  "Gone off into the woods. Off that way," said the woman, pointing towards the
                     path that led out into the Porlock road.
                  "How long since?"
                  "Not over fifteen minutes."
                  "Hold!" exclaimed Luke, as the sheriff was turning away; "who is it you
                     seek?"
                  "A fellow named Pettrell, and two of his men. They are smugglers."
                  "O, sir, bring me back the boy they have with them. They have stolen him away
                     from me."
                  "The boy I have seen here with you?"
                  "Yes—yes."
                  "Yon shall have him if I can but find the rascals."
                  As the officer spoke he turned his horse's head toward the wood, and his men
                     followed him.
                  Nepsey explained to her master how the men had seized Alfred and borne him off,
                     and how he cried for help. The stout man shook as he heard the story, and he
                     groaned with bitter anguish. Little Ella cried and talked about the "ugly old
                     men" till she had worried herself to sleep in Nepsey's lap.
                  Till long after nightfall did Luke Garron sit upon a rock at the corner of his
                     house and strain his aching eyes off towards the woods, and it was not until
                     the darkness had fairly set in that he thought of the beacon. When he did think
                     of his neglected duty, he moved very slowly to its performance, and heavy sighs
                     escaped from his lips. After he had lighted the lamps in the beacon, he came
                     down and proceeded to the house.
                  "Garron," said Nepsey, after she had regarded the anguish-wrought features of
                     her master for some time in silence, "do you think that man is the father of
                     Alfred?"
                  "No," returned Luke, with a sudden start.
                  "Then what does all this mean?"
                  "Mean?" repeated Luke.
                  "Yes."
                  
                  "You see as well as I do."
                  "Then you have no idea of why that man wishes to take the boy away?"
                  The light-keeper looked up into Nepsey's face, and a shudder ran through his
                     frame.
                  "Don't you think you have as much right to the boy as this Pettrell has?"
                     continued the woman.
                  Luke remained silent
                  "Tell me, Mr. Garron," persisted she, "have you not as much right to Alfred as
                     Pettrell has?"
                  "You know I found the boy, and saved his life," at length returned Luke: "and
                     that surely gives me good claim until another is presented stronger. The ties
                     of blood would outweigh the mere saving of life."
                  "But you don't believe there is any tie of blood between Pettrell and the
                     boy?"
                  "Tie of blood!" uttered the light-keeper, while he trembled more
                     fearfully than before.
                  "Between Pettrell and the boy," added the woman not seeming to notice the
                     effect produced upon her master.
                  "No, no, there can be none—none that I know"
                  "Then make Pettrell prove his right to the boy."
                  "It's too late now."
                  "No. He will come back. I know the officers will overtake these men."
                  "Do you think he will come back?" asked Luke.
                  Nepsey started at the strange tone of Garron's voice—it was so different from
                     its usual strong and open volume. And then his mind, too, seemed to be so
                     wandering, just as though be could not govern his thoughts.
                  "I know he will come back," she answered. "The men cannot turn from the path
                     till they reach the road, and the officers will overtake them before that. I'm
                     sure Alfred will come back."
                  "God send it."
                  "And now it he does come," resumed the woman, "you wont lot him go again! Make
                     Pettrell prove his right first. O, it is dreadful to think of how the poor
                     little follow must suffer. If I had been a man he should never have gone as it
                     was."
                  "If Pettrell is taken and convicted of smuggling, he may be hanged," exclaimed
                     Luke, half starting from his chair.
                  "Perhaps so," said Nepsey.
                  "Then he will never come again for the boy."
                  Nepsey was certainly puzzled by the manner of her master, for she showed it
                     plainly in her looks. She did not have an opportunity to speak, however, for at
                     that moment the sound of a horse's hoofs was heard coming around the house.
                     Luke sprang to his feet and rushed to the door, where he arrived just in season
                     to see his boy sliding down from behind on officer. He caught the lad in his
                     arms and lifted him to his bosom.
                  "Did you catch the men?" he asked of the rider.
                  "No, but the others are after them. We pressed them hotly, and they dropped the
                     boy and look to the woods, so the sheriff sent me buck with him. He's safe and
                     sound, sir."
                  The man rode off, and Luke returned into the house. Alfred was shaking with the
                     effects of his fear, but he soon grew calm; and then he related to his
                     protector how the men had carried him off—how the officers came near overtaking
                     them, and how they dropped him.
                  "O," he uttered, "that man is not my father. I will never live with him. I
                     would run away and come back to you; for I love you."
                  "Bless you, my boy, bless you," ejaculated Garron, as he folded the boy to his
                     bosom. "The officers may take the wicked man, and then he will trouble us no
                     more."
                  "I hope they will take him," said Alfred," for told me when
                     he set me down in the woods,  would have me if he had to die for is.
                     He said I was his child."
                  
                  Luke tried to assure the boy that he was safe, and at length the little fellow
                     sought his bed. Garron remained in the house till nine o'clock, and then he
                     went to see the light.
                  The keeper stopped as he reached the yard in front of his house, and looked
                     about him. The stars were glittering like tiny lamps in the heavens, and the
                     breeze came in cool and refreshing from the broad Atlantic. The sea was capped
                     by long, low swells, that broke mournfully upon the rocks; and after gazing for
                     some time upon the dark bosom of the Channel, Luke Garron moved slowly towards
                     the beacon. His step was heavy, and he seemed sad at heart.
               
               
                  CHAPTER V.
                  A TERRIBLE BLOW.
                  WE must now pass over eight years. In handling the events of the past, such a
                     step is easily taken, and though we fly, Parnassus-like over the gulf, yet we
                     cannot hide the marks of change, nor the indelible foot-prints of old Time.
                     Eight years! How simple the expression: and yet how important may have been the
                     epoch. Kingdoms have been built in eight years, and in the same time great
                     nations have fallen. In eight years what hosts of humanity have been swept away
                     from the earth, and what countless numbers of beings have started fresh and
                     strong in the race of life. Great hopes have ended in fruition, and greater
                     hopes have been crushed. Many a flower has withered and died, and many a
                     blossom has opened its leaves to the warm sun, in all the joyousness of sweet
                     and happy life. Eight years have passed. Some men have grown better—some have
                     grown worse—and some stand, like cold lumps of unimpressible granite, in the
                     same old spot upon the moral road; and there they will stand till a hand more
                     powerful than love of gain, shall snatch them away from a world that shall
                     never miss them.
                  Time has passed—yet the same immutable laws govern God's world of humanity. Sin
                     has the same fitful glare, to dazzle the eyes of the feel, the same deep-laid
                     snares for the unwary, and the same sharp thorns for its victims. Calm Virtue
                     still holds in her hand the same lustrous lamp of holy flame, which no gale nor
                     storm can extinguish; her face still bears the same sweet smile, and her
                     followers are still happy.
                  With Luke Garron time had made but little change. A few gray hairs have set
                     themselves upon his head, and a few wrinkles have been marked upon his
                     countenance; but he still bears the same noble, generous look, and his black
                     eye is undimmed.
                  With the Storm Children the change has been great. Alfred Harrold has grown to
                     be a large boy, for he has just seen his sixteenth birthday. He is tall for his
                     age, and his form has been developed in manly beauty. His hair is still glossy
                     in its hue of light brown, and his eye is still light in its liquid blue. The
                     very thought-marks upon his fair countenance show that he has studied to some
                     purpose, beneath the teaching of his generous protector.
                  And little Ella, now smiling in her twelfth year—O, how beautiful, how lovely,
                     and how happy! Her dark brown hair flouts in glittering ringlets, and from out
                     the depths of her soft, hazel eyes there shines the light of her whole
                     affectionate heart. She walks where Alfred walks; she sits where Alfred sits;
                     she reads in Alfred's books, and Alfred teaches her the same lessons he has
                     been taught. When Alfred smiles upon her, she throws her little white arms
                     about his neck and kisses him; and then they talk of love—such love as hearts
                     feel that know nothing beyond the world of purity and
                     peace.
                  Nepsey's step has grown slower and weaker, but she has help from the children,
                     and she loves to hear them laughing and talking about her.
                  It was towards night on a day of early autumn. Luke and Alfred stood upon the
                     bluff that overlooked the small cove. Ella had just gone into the house, for
                     the evening air was becoming damp and cool.
                  "She's a fine sailer," said Luke. "See how she slips along through the
                     water."
                  The light-keeper alluded to a brig that was coming up the Channel, and at which
                     he and Alfred had been looking.
                  "She is, indeed, a pretty craft," returned the youth. "Let me take the glass a
                     moment."
                  Luke handed him the spy-glass, and he raised it to his eye.
                  "She has no ports, but I think I can see guns upon her deck," he said.
                  "Guns!" uttered Luke. "You must be mistaken. Let me look."
                  Luke took the glass.
                  "No," he resumed, after he had looked a few moments; "those are not guns. They
                     are water-casks."
                  "But what do you make her out to be?" asked Alfred. "She does not look like a
                     government vessel, nor does she look like a trader."
                  "She may be one of those Yankee traders bound up to Bristol," said Luke still
                     looking through his glass.
                  "But she's got no load," suggested the youth.
                  "She may have come from Brest. Ah, what's that? She's luffing, as sure as the
                     world."
                  The wind was southwest, and the brig had been leaving it upon her starboard
                     quarter; but as the old man spoke, she had put her helm down, and was hauling
                     in her lee braces—and her head was consequently coming about towards the
                     promontory.
                  "What can she want here?" Luke continued.
                  "It may be a smuggler, who thinks to land his goods above here," said
                     Alfred.
                  At the mention of that word, Luke Garron trembled. Alfred noticed it, and he
                     looked earnestly into the old man's face.
                  Again Luke levelled his glass; but the deepening shades of evening dimmed the
                     view, and he could see the brig's deck but indistinctly.
                  "She's entirely in the wind now," said Alfred.
                  "Yes; and there goes her anchor."
                  The two watchers could see the brig's sails were being clawed up, and that her
                     yards were braced to the wind. It became too dark to see more, and the light
                     keeper turned towards the house, whither Alfred followed him. Soon afterwards
                     the great lamps were lighted in the beacon, and then Luke repaired to the
                     sitting-room. At eight o'clock Ella went to bed; but a strange fear had seized
                     upon the mind of Alfred, and he could not think of sleep. He did not think of
                     sliding off into the woods, but he tried to quell the rising alarm by
                     endeavoring to persuade himself that all was safe.
                  It was nine o'clock, and Luke had just arisen for the purpose of going to look
                     after the beacon light, when he was startled by the sound of footsteps and
                     voices in front of the house. A moment afterwards there came a knocking upon
                     the door, and Nepsey went to see who was there.
                  Luke Garron sank back into a chair, and Alfred sprang to his side, as Marrok
                     Pettrell entered the room! He was followed by four men, two of whom were the
                     same that attended him eight years ago.
                  "A pleasant evening to you," said the smuggler.
                  Luke did not speak.
                  "Can't ye welcome an old friend?" continued Pettrell.
                  "Do not profane that sacred name," said Garron, clutching his hands in nervous
                     anxiety; "but tell me what you seek?"
                  "I've come to sock what I lost eight years ago," returned Pettrell, casting a
                     peculiar look upon Alfred.
                  "You mean the boy?"
                  "Yes."
                  "Then you can go as you went then."
                  "Without him?"
                  "Yes."
                  "No, no, Mr. Garron; I've come now to some purpose. The boy's grown to be a
                     stout follow and he'll be of service to me. He's my own son; and have him I'm
                     determined to."
                  "Marrok Pettrell—"
                  "Ah," interrupted the smuggler, "how do you know me so well?"
                  Garron changed color; but he soon overcame the emotion, and returned:
                  "I've heard your name from the revenue officers."
                  "Ah! Then you have heard my name used rather lightly. But it's the fate of
                     honest men to be maligned. Come, master Alfred, you must ship under your
                     father's flag for the future."
                  "Not under yours!" resolutely returned the boy.
                  "There's spunk," said Bronkon, with his usual coarse laugh.
                  "Ay, and I shall like him the better for it," added Pettrell.
                  "You cannot have the lad," said Luke Garron, who had assumed a fearless look,
                     and arisen from his chair. "You know that he is not your child, and that you
                     have no earthly right to him."
                  "Avast a hit, Mr. Garron. Where did you get the boy?"
                  "I saved him from the wreck of a vessel years ago."
                  "Yes, and he was my child, and I lost him. Great guns and thunder! do you think
                     yourself the owner of everything you find? I'm really obliged to you for the
                     care you've taken of the youngster, and perhaps I'll pay you sometime; but for
                     the present I think I'll take my property to my own keeping. So come along,
                     master Alfred."
                  "Never!" said the youth.
                  "That's good," contemptuously returned the smuggler; and then, while a darker
                     shade settled upon his features, he added:
                  "But mark ye, my boy—not having had you under my protection, perhaps I might
                     not be so tender of ye as you've been used to. You'll find it pleasant sailing
                     if you keep your sails trimmed right; but if you are going to lay your canvass
                     aback, you'd better look out for squalls. Do you understand that?"
                  Alfred was bold, and his heart was strong in moral right, but he had been
                     tenderly reared, and he shuddered as he met the gaze of Pettrell, and heard his
                     portentous words.
                  "I don't s'pose there's any need of more talk," resumed the smuggler, as he
                     moved towards Alfred. "I have come after my boy, and I don't think 'twill be
                     for your good to make any resistance."
                  Luke Garron gazed upon the smuggler, and then he turned his eyes upon Alfred.
                     His face had turned as pale as death, and he trembled at every joint.
                  "I will not leave you, father," cried the youth, throwing his arms about the
                     old man's neck.
                  Garron started back and drew his pistol. It trembled a moment in his hand, and
                     then he put it back again in his belt.
                  "Do not take him!—O, do not!" he uttered, as he strained the boy to his
                     bosom.
                  "Garron," said the smuggler, while his features softened in their expression,
                     "you ask of me an impossibility: The boy is mine—I want him—and I must have
                     him. Now there's no use in saying another word. You know there's no law on
                     earth that would give you a right above my claim. I've got nothing against you.
                     I forgive you for the blow you struck me eight years ago; but don't raise your
                     land to do such a thing again."
                  "I cannot—will not go!" exclaimed Alfred.
                  "You'll go with your father," said the smuggler coaxingly
                  "Out upon you! you miserable, wretched, vile, mean, disgraceful, wicked
                     vagabond!" cried old Nepsey, springing from her seat. "There isn't a drop of
                     your blood in that boy's veins, you know there isn't!"
                  "What a Tartar," said Bronkon.
                  "Tartar, or not Tartar, I'm an honest woman; and God knows you came villains
                     from your cradles!"
                  Nepsey grasped the back of her chair: but she was old and weak, and she soon
                     settled back into her seat.
                  "Alfred—my boy—my son," whispered Luke Garron, while the smuggler's attention
                     was turned towards Nepsey, "I cannot save you now; you must go with Pettrell.
                     But forget not my counsels—escape from him if you can, and come to me. I do not
                     believe he is your father. O, what a blow is this! I have loved you, but fate
                     is against me! Go, Alfred—go! God bless you now and ever. Do not speak to me;
                     do not let me hear your voice again, for I cannot bear it!"
                  Deep sobs choked the old man's utterance, and he sank powerless into his chair.
                     Big sears rolled down his cheeks, and his head was bowed. Alfred clung to him
                     with frantic energy but he found no language for the emotions of his soul.
                  "Come!"
                  The youth started as he felt the hand of Pettrell laid upon his arm.
                  "Come, my boy"
                  Alfred gazed up, and as he met the look of the smuggler he sank upon his knees.
                     Two strong men lifted him up and bore him away—but Luke saw not the movement.
                     It was well he did not, for he had already more misery heaped upon his heart
                     than he could bear.
                  At length the outer door was closed, and the tramp of feet sank lower in the
                     distance. The old man raised his head. He and Nepsey were alone!
                  "Is he gone?" he whispered.
                  "Yes," returned the woman.
                  Luke groaned, and covered his face with his hands. Shortly afterwards he went
                     out and ascended to the beacon, and there he remained through the long night.
                     Early in the morning Nepsey went to look after her master. She found him
                     stretched across one of the stout oaken braces in the top of the beacon in a
                     deep sleep. It was not yet open daylight, but the great lamps had gone out, and
                     their wicks were stiff and cold!
                  The woman aroused him, and he started to his feet. He rubbed his eyes and gazed
                     about him, and then he sunk back upon the oaken brace, and bowed his head upon
                     his breast. Nepsey took him by the hand to lead him down. He arose, and with
                     trembling steps he followed her.
                  Ella came forth to seek her playmate; but she could not find him. Nepsey told
                     her Alfred had gone.
                  "But he will come back. He will come to see his Ella," the girl cried. And she
                     ran to the old man's side, and asked him if Alfred would not come back.
                  For the sake of that sweet girl, the light-keeper kept back his heavy grief;
                     but he could not wholly deceive her. She feared that Alfred would not come
                     back, and she cried with an aching heart.
                  Pen cannot paint such sorrow as had fallen upon the old man and that
                     bright-eyed child. Only the human heart can bear its impress; and to know it
                     the heart must feel it.
                  When Luke walked out upon the bluff, the brig which had been there the night
                     before had gone. No traces were left of her, save the pangs that dwelt with the
                     memory of her presence, in his own bosom.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  THE SMUGGLER.
                  ALFRED HARROLD (such was the name he had borne since he lived with Luke Garron,
                     and so we will call him) spoke not a word as he was being led down to the
                     water. Once he struggled to free himself from the hold that was upon him; but
                     the movement was in vain, and he tried it not a second time. When his
                     conductors reached the cove, they put him on board a bout that was made fast
                     there, and soon he was moving towards the brig. It was too dark when he passed
                     over the gangway for him to distinguish objects about the deck, and he followed
                     Pettrell down the after hatchway into the cabin. A hanging lamp was burning
                     there, and as the door was closed behind them, Pettrell turned to the
                     youth.
                  "Now," said he, "you are where you by right belong. I am master here, and my
                     will is law. I am your parent, and I shall expect from you a child's obedience.
                     If you choose not to give me that, however, I shall demand subjection of
                     another sort. Can you understand?"
                  Alfred was silent. He gazed into the hard features of Marrok Pettrell, but he
                     know not what to reply.
                  "Will you not answer me?" sternly uttered the smuggler.
                  "I have no answer to make."
                  "I asked it you understood what I had said?"
                  Alfred Harrold had seen many storms—he had passed through many dangers, and
                     more than once on the rough coast had he displayed a fearlessness that might
                     have become a bold man. He had dared the heavy sea when men were in danger, and
                     he had never shrank. His heart was strong now, and, as he gradually arose above
                     the first stunning effects of the blow he had received, he felt a moral power
                     that made him fearless.
                  "I have heard you speak," he said," and I think I know what you mean."
                  "So far, so good," returned Pettrell, showing by his looks that he was a little
                     surprised at the boy's lofty manner. "And now do you think you can obey
                     me?"
                  "I can tell better when I know your commands."
                  "Ah! You are putting your foot on 
                        dangerosu
                        dangerous
                      ground."
                  "I feel that, sir."
                  "Then you had better beware!"
                  "But it was you who brought me to the dangerous ground."
                  "You twist my meaning, youngster. I meant that your tongue was leading you into
                     danger; so look out how you use it."
                  "I shall not be impudent, sir; but it is my right—a right given to me by God
                     himself through Christ my Teacher—to maintain my integrity and my honor"
                  "P-h-e-w!" whistled Pettrell, with a look of contempt, but a close observer
                     could have seen that his contempt was assumed. "You are hold for one of your
                     years. But lot me assure you of one thing: I stand your present talk with easy
                     grace for me, but be careful that you don't show your independence before the
                     men. It will be well for you to remember this. And now what do you know of sea
                     matters?"
                  "Enough to sail a ship from here to Bristol."
                  "Ah. You will be useful, then. Is Luke Garron a seam an?"
                  "Few men know more of the sea."
                  "He has followed the sea, then?"
                  "He must have followed it at some time."
                  "Then I may thank him for learning you seamanship, for such knowledge will be
                     of much service to me. Your morality I advise you to keep for your own
                     use."
                  
                  The youth's eyes flashed, for the diabolical sneer of the man cut him to the
                     soul.
                  "For the present," continued Pettrell, "you will take up your quarters in the
                     cabin. I wont trust you in the forecastle yet. You can come on deck if you
                     wish, but remember what I have said."
                  Pettrell turned and went on deck. For some minutes Alfred stood and gazed at
                     the vacant spot where he had last seen the smuggler, and then his mind reverted
                     to the terrible calamity that had befallen him. He staggered back and sank upon
                     a low stool. It must have been full half an hour that the boy sat in one
                     position and wept. He thought of his kind protector, and his soul was torn with
                     anguish. He thought of Ella, and his heart sank into the burning depths of
                     utter misery. He reflected that be might never again see those bright eyes—that
                     he might never more behold that sweet face—that that beaming, happy smile would
                     never again light his joy—and he groaned aloud. Then his thoughts dwelt upon
                     the present—and then ran into the future, and he shuddered.
                  Then came back to his mind those words that Luke had whispered in his ear.
                  "He is not my father!" he uttered, while his hands were clasped in an agony of
                     hope.
                  A strange expression, perhaps—but that boy did experience, at that moment, an
                        agony of hope! He hoped the wicked man was not his father, and
                     yet the hope was all agony.
                  At length Alfred started to his feet. He brushed the tears from his face, and
                     then he clasped both his hands upon his heart.
                  "Action!" he murmured, as he turned his eyes towards heaven. "If
                     this be God's will, then let it be done. This is a fearful storm indeed; but I
                     will face it while I have strength. Yes, my kind, generous protector. I
                        will not turn from the path that leads to the beacon! God be with me,
                     and guide me! There—I feel stronger now!"
                  A pure, a holy light shone upon the face of the boy as he now stood there in
                     the smuggler's cabin, and he was fixed upon the course he would pursue. The
                     details of that course he could not of course lay out, but he knew the object
                     he had in view, and he only prayed for strength to sustain him in the endeavor.
                     He felt the strength of a man in his soul, and his good muscles were strung for
                     the trial.
                  When Alfred had so far regained his presence of mind as to turn his thoughts
                     upon outward things, he found from the sound upon the deck that the men were
                     heaving up the anchor. The atmosphere of the cabin seemed hot and oppressive to
                     him, and he ascended the ladder. He could see the dusky forms of many men
                     moving about the deck, and he could see that the topsails were sheet home and
                     the yards roast headed.
                  The youth turned his gaze towards the shore; the dark outlines of the bluff
                     were just visible, and beyond he saw the bright light of the beacon. He gazed
                     upon the light for a moment, and then he bent his head and covered his
                     face.
                  "Found the way on deck, eh?"
                  Alfred looked up and found Marrok Pettrell by his side.
                  "A free and jolly life is before you," continued the captain, "so you had
                     better make up your mind to enjoy it."
                  The youth had no answer to return, and Pettrell turned his attention to the
                     working of the brig. The anchor had broken ground, and the vessel was soon put
                     upon the larboard tack and standing towards the coast of Wales. Alfred remained
                     on deck half an hour, when he went back to the cabin. He crawled into the
                     narrow berth that had been pointed out to him, and at length he slept.
                  It was broad daylight when Alfred awoke, and again he passed through an ordeal
                     of soul harrowing thought and reflection; but he knew that repining would never
                     aid him, and uttering forth a simple prayer to God, he arranged his dress and
                     went on deck.
                  The brig he found was a large one; and he found, too, that what he had taken
                     for guns the night before, were, as Luke had said, nothing but water-casks. Yet
                     he thought he could detect upon either side of the deck the marks of carriage
                     wheels, and they ran at right angles with portions of the bulwarks that seemed
                     made for moving in case of need. There were twenty five men besides the captain
                     on board. They were all stout fellows, and looked reckless enough for any
                     calling that might turn up; yet some of them showed passing signs of
                     respectable good nature in their countenances. Reckless they were, but not all
                     so hard-hearted as the captain. There was one countenance, however, that seemed
                     more repulsive than all the rest—and that was Bronkon's. He was a dark
                     featured, powerful man, with a coarse, wicked expression of countenance and he
                     seemed to smile only when he saw misery about him. He was the second in
                     command, and seemed a fit mate for the smuggler captain.
                  The morning was bright and clear; when Alfred reached the deck he found that
                     the brig was just passing between Hartland Point and Lundy Island, with a fresh
                     breeze from the eastward.
                  "Well, my boy, suppose I put you on one of the watches," said Pettrell, after
                     he had allowed the youth sufficient time to look about him. "We don't have
                     idlers here."
                  "You can do as you please," returned Alfred, conquering, with strong effort,
                     his indignation.
                  "Then I shall put you in the starboard watch with myself.
                     Your limbs show a pretty good quantity of muscle, and I think we'll show you
                     how to use 'em. I tell you, Alfred, I think myself lucky in finding you"
                  "More lucky, probably, than I am in being found," returned the youth.
                  "That depends upon circumstances. You can make it lucky enough if you choose.
                     Just let me give you a piece of advice: Learn to take the world just us you
                     find it."
                  "That's the doctrine, youngster," said Bronkon, who stood near. "Take it as you
                     find it, and make the most of it."
                  "I shall endeavor to get along the best way I can," answered Alfred. "My life
                     so far has not been without its storms, and I have weathered them all. Of one
                     thing you may rest assured; there is no fear of common danger hanging about my
                     heart."
                  "Very good for a beginning," said Pettrell. "That's the right kind of spirit,
                     if you only use it in the right way. But we shall see."
                  As the captain turned away, Alfred reflected upon the course before him and he
                     was not long in arriving at the determination to perform a seaman's duty to the
                     best of his ability. He found himself placed in a position where he was not
                     responsible for the business of the voyage, and from whence there was no
                     present escape; so he knew no blame could attach to him so long as he laid not
                     his hand to that which was really evil. He was most emphatically in a position
                     where there were but two choices, and both of them evil. He chose that which
                     offered the least evil.

               WHITEFIELD'S HABITS.
               Whitefield's habits were singularly nice and cleanly, upon the principle that
                  everything about a minister should be "spotless" He was known to say,
                  that he could not die easy if his gloves were out of place. He had
                  the gentlemanly love of order, which required his table to be elegantly spread,
                  oven if only a loaf, or his favorite dish, cow heel, were to be set
                  upon it.
            
            
               THE MILKY WAY.
               The milky way forms the grandest feature of the firmament. It completely encircles
                  the whole fabric of the skies, and sends its light down upon us, according to the
                  best observations, from no less than 18,000,000 of suns. These are planted at
                  various distances, too remote to be more than little understood; but their light,
                  the medium of measurement, requires for its transit to our earth, periods ranging
                  from ten to a thousand years. Such is the sum of the great truths revealed to us
                  by the two Hersehels, who, with a zeal which no obstacle could daunt, have
                  explored every part of the prodigious circle. Sir William Herschel, after
                  accomplishing his famous section, believed that he had gaged the milky way to its
                  lowest depth, affirming that he could follow a cluster of stars with his
                  telescope, constructed expressly for the investigation, as far back as would
                  require 330,000 years for the transit of its light. Bet presumptuous as it may
                  seem, we must be permitted to doubt this assertion, as the same telescope in the
                  same master-hand was not sufficiently powerful to resolve even the nebulæ in
                  Orion. Nor must we forget that light, our only clue to those unsearchable regions,
                  expands and decomposes in its progress, and coming from a point so remote, its
                  radiant waves could be dispersed in space. Thus the reflection is forced upon us,
                  that new clusters and systems, whose beaming light will never reach our earth,
                  still throng beyond, and that, though it is permitted to man to behold the
                  immensity, he shall never see the bounds of creation.—Marvels of
                     Science.
               
            
            
               A TRAVELLING COMPANION.
               From the Rio Colorado we had been constantly followed by a large gray wolf. Every
                  evening as soon as we got into camp, he made his appearance, squatting quietly
                  down at a little distance, and after we had turned in for the night, helping
                  himself to anything laying about. Our first acquaintance commenced on the prairie
                  where I had killed the two antelopes, and the excellent dinner he then made, on
                  the remains of the two carcasses, had evidently attached him to our society. In
                  the morning, as we left the camp, he took possession, and quickly are up the
                  remains of our supper and some little extras I always took care to leave for him.
                  Shortly after he would trot after us, and if we halted for a short time to adjust
                  the mule-packs, or water the animals, he sat down quietly until we resumed our
                  march. But when I killed an antelope, and was in the act of butchering it, he
                  gravely looked on, or loped round and round, licking his jaws, and in a state of
                  evident self-gratulation. I had him twenty times a day within reach of my rifle,
                  but he became such an old friend, that I never dreamed of molesting
                     him.—Adventures in Mexico.
               
            
            
               QUAKERS IN BOSTON.
               The first Quakers who came to Boston arrived in May, 1656. From 1664 to 1808 the
                  Friends held regular meetings in Boston. This sect built the first brick meeting
                  house in the town, somewhere in the neighborhood of Brattle Street Church. In 1708
                  the society sold their house of worship and the town authorities refused
                  permission to erect a new one of wood. A second brick edifice was erected in what
                  was afterwards known as Quaker Lane, now Congress Street. This was destroyed in
                  the great fire of 1760, but was immediately replaced. It stood till April, 1826,
                  when it was sold and removed. It had hardly been occupied for twenty years. A heat
                  stone edifice was erected in Milton Place, which is occasionally used for public
                  worship. How differently the Friends are now regarded from what they were by the
                  Massachusetts colonists in 1675, when a law was enacted subjecting every person
                  found at a Quaker meeting to be committed to jail, "to have the discipline of the
                  house, and to be kept to work with bread and water, or else pay

               PRINCE OF WALES AT THE VATICAN.
               Perhaps no candidate for a royal throne has ever enjoyed greater facilities for a
                  proper training for the high position he is destined to occupy, than the Prince of
                  Wales. His education has been of the highest character, and every polish and
                  advantage which travel and observation could secure, has been lavished upon him.
                  In his earlier years, he visited the most important places on the continent of
                  Europe, penetrated into Asia, visited the Holy Land, and made quite an extensive
                  tour through several of our United States. Here he was received with every honor,
                  and the highest meed of regard was shown to him, not only on his own account, as
                  the probable sovereign of a great and powerful nation, but also because of the
                  high appreciation the American people entertain of Queen Victoria, his mother,
                  whose noble and lovely traits of character are so endurably fixed in the regard of
                  this country. The picture on this page shows him as he appeared some five or six
                  years since during a visit to the Pope of Rome, at the Vatican.

               AT SEA.
               BY LIEUT, JAMES FRANKLIN FILTS.
               
                  There is no solitude so lone as this,
                  So desolately free—
                  
                     Wooing upon the deck the wildwinds' kiss,
                  Alone upon the sea!
               
               
                  One vast blue girdle shuts me from the world,
                  Where mingle wave and cloud;
                  And sea and sky by winds are round me hurled,
                  Like to a pull and shroud!
               
               
                  Winds wild, monotonous, and doubly drear,
                  Wailing across the deep,
                  As on their errant course they turn and ever
                  Tryst with the waves to keep.
               
               
                  I see the sun rise from his watery bed,
                  To light the cheerless waste;
                  And hiding in the western wave his head,
                  Sad night comes on swift-paced,
               
               
                  And bids us wander blindly where we list,
                  Shut in with darkened walls,
                  Holding with her a deeply solemn tryst,
                  In her sepulchral halls.
               
               
                  No voice, no sound save the dull, heavy stroke
                  Of waters, as they glide
                  With luminous glare against our sides of oak,
                  A livid, spectral tide.
               
               
                  No voice, save as the sea-bird circles near,
                  Uttering his doleful cry,
                  Unmusical and sad, devoid of cheer,
                  Yet sounding ever nigh.
               
               
                  Yes, this is loneliness!—no waving wood,
                  No prairie of the West,
                  Affords such weirdly wondrous solitude
                  As dwells on ocean's breast.
               
               
                  See, then, dear absent soul, my hermitage,
                  So desolately tree—
                  Defying on my deck the storm's fierce rage,
                  Alone upon the sea!
               
            
            
               THE DOG AND HIS OWNER.
               In England, some years since, a Mr. Seymore, the owner of a noble-looking,
                  intelligent dog, was law agent and collector of rents for a great lord, who owned
                  several extensive estates. They being situated widely apart, Mr. Seymore was under
                  the frequent necessity of making long journeys through very wild regions of
                  country, over bad roads, and among chains of mountains and dangerous declivities,
                  in order to present himself on the various domains when rent day came around, and
                  the farmers had their money ready for payment. There being, at
                  the time of our story, no stage coach or railroad cars on the roads where he had
                  to travel, Mr. Seymore travelled on horse-back, accompanied by a trusty servant
                  named Darby, by also well mounted, and his large, faithful dog
                  Neptune, his constant companion. His valise, containing the money collected—very
                  often a large sum—he for better security, carried strapped behind his own
                  saddle.
               On one of these excursions, the three people—master, man and dog—started from home
                  fully equipped, as usual, for their journey, and having transacted all the
                  business on hand, set out on their return in high spirits. It so happened,
                  however, that some accident on the road detained them so long that the shades of
                  evening closed in upon them in the midst of a most unpromising looking wilderness.
                  What was to be done? To reach the next town before nightfall was impossible, and
                  to continue on the road with so much money after, extremely
                  dangerous, as those were the days of highway robbers. Mr. Seymore therefore
                  concluded that the wiser plan would be to stop at a retired sort of inn which
                  stood a little off the road at the foot of a mountain. This proposition met the
                  warm approval of Darby, his man, who always liked to take his comfort, and for
                  when a good supper had a great charm.
               Accordingly, at the door of the inn they dismounted, and were greeted by the
                  landlord, a dark, sly-looking fellow, who, with a profusion of scrapes and smiles,
                  ushered them in, at the same time stopping to caress Neptune, who thanked him with
                  a growl, and caught at the bridles of the horses. Mr. Seymore asked to be
                  accommodated for the night, and requested that he might have a very secure room
                  for his valise, which he himself unstrapped from the saddle and carried into the
                  house.
               The landlord eyed the object of so much care, and taking it in his
                     hand with some joking remark about its weight, led Mr. Seymore up a
                  few steps into an apartment which he assured him was the safest room in the house,
                  and kept for the sole accommodation of travellers with valuables. It was situated
                  on the first floor, with windows facing on the road, and altogether a very
                  pleasant room.
               As soon as he had finished his supper, being rather tired, Mr. Seymore retired to
                  his room, accompanied by his faithful Neptune, who kept close to his master,
                  although the host tried to prevent him, for fear, as he said, that he might do
                  some injury to the furniture. But, in spite of his objections,
                  the master and dog could not be separated, and retired
                  together. Darby had been provided with quarters in a distant part of the house.
                  Having fastened the door, and for better security placed some heavy articles of
                  furniture against it, Mr. Seymore began to make preparations for bed. But no
                  sooner did the dog, who, meanwhile had been snuffing about, see his master
                  commencing to disrobe, than he manifested the greatest uneasiness and distress,
                  and tried by every dog effort to prevent him. He would growl at the bed, then look
                  from it to his master, and violently paw him until he almost tore his clothes.
               This strange behaviour in a creature so gentle and docile at first rather alarmed
                  his master, and caused him, much to the satisfaction of Neptune, who followed him
                  around with a volley of short, sharp barks, to make an examination of the
                  apartment. But no; nothing could be discovered amiss; the windows even, although
                  they were unusually high from the ground, were nailed securely down. Having
                  finally concluded his arrangements, all the while quieting and coaxing the poor
                  dog, who never ceased whining and trying to prevent him from lying down, he was
                  just stepping into the bed, when the noble brute, with a long, piteous howl of
                  farewell, leaped upon it, and down it sank into the cellar, where,
                  throwing off its burthen, it sprang up again to its former position.
               Mr. Seymore's sensations of grief and alarm you can imagine better than I can
                  describe; but very little time was afforded him, however, for reflection; for the
                  villains below, when they found themselves cheated of their intended victim,
                  immediately commenced firing up through the floor, intending to despatch him in
                  that way. Impelled by despair, he burst out one of the window sashes, and,
                  balancing himself with difficulty on the sill, shouted loudly, murder! murder! But
                  nothing could seem more hopeless than his situation, for the road was but little
                  frequented and the hour was against him. But here, again, Providence helped
                  him.
               As his cries rang out in the night air, they arrested the attention of a party of
                  gentlemen who, on their return from a hunt, happened to be passing at a little
                  distance, and caused them to halt. This the landlord discovered, and running to
                  the door, assured them that it was only a poor lunatic who had been committed to
                  his charge; on which, deceived by the wily villain, they passed on. Mr. Seymore,
                  who felt that with them his last hope was departing, and that his strength was
                  fast failing him, made a final desperate effort, and had the inexpressible delight
                  to hear them galloping back.
               On drawing near the window where he was crouched, shuddering, and making inquiry
                  of him, the gentlemen were convinced that there was foul play, although, in the
                  confusion, no particulars could be explained. Their first proceeding was to arrest
                  the landlord and his accomplices, who made furious resistance, and to liberate the
                  exhausted prisoner; their next, to despatch two or three of their number to the
                  nearest town for the authorities and a body of military to search the
                  premises.
               On investigation it was found that an extensive traffic in murder and robbery had
                  long been carried on in this fearful den, the most cruel evidence of which was a
                  large number of bodies in various stages of decay, which lay huddled together in a
                  deep vault beneath the house. There they also found poor Neptune, whom in their
                  rage, they had ruthlessly slaughtered. You may think that Mr. Seymore resumed his
                  journey deeply sorrowing for the loss of his faithful friend.
               Now don't you see that poor Neptune was an instrument of Providence—that he was
                  God's agent in saving Mr. Seymore's life? Lord Byron buried his favorite dog in
                  his garden, and raised over him a beautiful monument, with a long epitaph in
                  poetry. We think that Neptune deserved one far better.
            
            
               THE FOOT OF THE FLY.
               And as regards the fly, you need not even quit your study or parlor to have an
                  opportunity of witnessing a strange, and, to the masses, an inexplicable
                  phenomenon connected with the insect, namely, the mode in which it walks upon the
                  ceiling with its feet upward, or progresses upon the smooth vertical pane of glass
                  in your parlor window, setting at defiance a well-known law of gravitation. If you
                  are not able to solve this mystery, ask some friend who possesses a microscope to
                  show you the foot of a fly under the instrument, and you will find that at its
                  extremity it is furnished with a pair of membraneous disks, on which there are
                  disposed countless minute suckers that operate upon the inverted ceiling, or
                  smooth glazed surface over which the fly is marching, in the same manner as did
                  the leather sucker with which as a schoolboy, you were wont to amuse yourself in
                  lifting heavy stones; this is the simple but effective apparatus which enables the
                  little creature to maintain its held with security in any position.—The
                     Earthworm and the Housefly.
               
            
            
               A sailor, a giant of well-known bravery, who was in a boat at the siege of
                  Copenhagen, kept down his head while a shot was flying over the boat. "For shame!
                  hold up your head!" thundered the officer in the stern. "I will, sir, when there's
                  room for it," was the laughing response.
            
            
               THE WATER SPIRIT.
               BY H. M. S.
               
                  Maiden of beauty, peerless and bright,
                  What dost thou here, from thy realm of light?
                  What dost then here, in a world of shade—
                  
                     Here, where the bright are the first to fade?
               
               
                  Birds are asleep in their leafy bowers,
                  Star-gleams are rocking to sleep with the flowers;
                  Moonlight and music of murmuring rills
                  Are weaving a bale o'er meadow and hills;
                  But moonlight will vanish, and blossoms decay,
                  So, maiden of beauty, away, away!
               
               
                  Why dost thou pause, like a glorious dream,
                  Bending above the enamored stream?
                  Why does the fire in thy dark eyes glow?
                  Why throbs the pulse in thy breast of snow?
                  Passion around then enchantment flings,
                  Fettered, alas, are thy golden wings.
                  Lost as thou art in love's maddening bliss,
                  Little thou dreamest of its wretchedness!
                  Better the sea, with its tempest swell,
                  Had crushed thy heart in its wave-washed cell;
                  Better thy willowy limbs, sweet girl,
                  Were laid in death on thy had of pearl;
                  For love—tis a gleam of the setting sun,
                  Through a flood of gold when the day is done;
                  Faint and more faint droops the purple light,
                  
                     Til the heart is alone on a rayless night.
               
               
                  Maiden of beauty, beware, beware!
                  Thy bliss will turn to as wild despair;
                  Rouse thy deep soul from its dream of bliss,
                  Yield never more to love's glowing kiss;
                  Free thy proud heart from the tyrant's sway,
                  Maiden of beauty, away, away!
               
            
            
               A SPANISH BULL-FIGHT.
               ONE day Don Philippe insisted upon taking us to witness a bull-fight which was
                  about to take place, and which it was reported the queen herself was expected to
                  attend. This was a spectacle we had never yet beheld, and our curiosity was
                  aroused to the highest possible pitch of excitement. Visions of blood floated
                  before our fancy, and flashing steel gleamed across our sight. Anxiety stood on
                  tip-toe, and the moments flew slowly by, until the wished-for hour arrived. We
                  left the business of securing seats in the arena to Philippe, who, by early
                  application, succeeded in obtaining for us as eligible positions for witnessing
                  the spectacle as we could reasonably desire.
               The critical moment was now at hand, our hearts almost leaped from our mouths, so
                  deeply were we excited in contemplation of the sanguinary event. At length the
                  trumpet sounded, and forthwith entered, in martial array, the entire body of
                  combatants, gayly dressed, and presenting together a most striking and brilliant
                  effect. Marching to the opposite side of the ring, they respectfully bowed to the
                  appointed authorities, and then took their places, in complete readiness for
                  action.
               At a given signal, a small iron gate was suddenly opened, and in an instant a
                  furious bull bounded frantically into the arena; and then, as if petrified with
                  astonishment at the wonderful scene around him, he stood motionless for a few
                  seconds, staring wildly at the immense assembly, and pawing vehemently the ground
                  beneath his feet. It was a solemn and critical moment, and I can truly say that I
                  never before experienced such an intense degree of curiosity and interest. My
                  feelings were wound up to the highest pitch of excitement, and I can scarcely
                  believe that even that terrible human tragedy, a bloody gladiatorial scene, could
                  have affected me more deeply. The compressed fury of the bull lasted but an
                  instant; suddenly his glaring eye caught the sight of a red flag, which one of the
                     chulas, or foot combatants, had waved before
                  him, and immediately he rushed after his nimble adversary, who evaded his pursuit
                  by jumping skillfully over the lower enclosure of the ring. The herculean animal,
                  thus balked in his rage, next plunged desperately towards one of the picadores, or mounted horsemen, who calmly and
                  fearlessly awaited his approach, and then turned off his attack by the masterly
                  management of his long and steel-capped pike.
               Thwarted once more in his purpose, he became still more frantic than before, while
                  his low and suppressed roar, expressive of the concentrated passion and rage which
                  burned within him, sounded like distant thunder to my cars. Half-closing his eyes,
                  and lowering his formidable horns, he darted again at one of the picadores, and
                  with such tremendous power, that he completely unhorsed him. Then shouts of
                  applause from the spectators filled the arena. "Bravo toro!" "Viva toro!" and
                  other exclamations of encouragement for the bull broke from every mouth. The
                  picadore lost no time in springing to his feet and re-mounting his horse, which,
                  however, could scarcely stand, so weak was the poor creature from the stream of
                  blood issuing from the deep wound in his breast. As soon as the enraged bull,
                  whose attention had been purposely withdrawn by the chulos, beheld his former
                  adversary now crimsoned with gore, he rushed at him with the most terrible fury,
                  and thrusting his horns savagely into the lower part of the tottering animal, he
                  almost raised him from his feet, and so lacerated and tore open his abdomen, that
                  his bowels gushed out upon the ground. Unable any longer to sustain himself, the
                  pitiable animal fell down in the awful agonies of death, and in a few moments
                  expired.
               Two other horses shortly shared the same miserable fate, and their mangled bodies
                  were lying covered with blood, in the centre of the arena. The bull himself was
                  becoming perceptibly exhausted, and his own end was drawing high. For the purpose
                  of stimulating and arousing into momentary action his rapidly waning strength, the
                  assailants on foot attacked him with barbed darts, called banderillos, which they thrust with skill into each side of his
                  brawny neck. Sometimes these little javelins are charged with a prepared powder,
                  which explodes the instant that the sharp steel sinks into the flesh. The torture
                  thus produced drives the wretched animal to the extreme of madness, who bellows
                  and bounds in his agony, as if endued with the energy of a new life.
               On the present occasion, the arrows used were not of an explosive character, yet
                  they served scarcely less effectually to enrage the furious monster. But hark! the
                  last trumpet is sounding the awful death knell of the warrior beast. The ring
                  becomes instantly cleared, and the foaming animal stands motionless and alone,
                  sole monarch of the arena. But the fiat has gone forth, and the gloom of death is
                  impending over him. The matador enters the ring
                  by a secret door, and after bowing to the president, and throwing down his cap in
                  token of respect, slowly and deliberately approaches his terrific adversary, who
                  stands as if enchained to the spot by a consciousness of the fearful destiny that
                  awaits him. The matador, undismayed by the ferocious aspect of the bull,
                  cautiously advances, with his eyes fixed firmly, magnetically upon him; a bright
                  Toledo blade glistens in his right hand, while in his left he carries the muleta, or crimson flag, with which to exasperate the
                  declining spirit of his foe. An intense stillness reigns throughout the vast
                  assemblage, the most critical point of the tragedy is at hand, and every glance is
                  riveted upon the person and movements of the matador. A single fatal thrust may
                  launch him into eternity, yet no expression of fear escapes him; cool and
                  self-possessed, he stands before his victim, studious of every motion, and ready
                  to take advantage of any chance. It is this wonderful display of skill and bravery
                  that fascinates the attention of a Spanish audience and not the shedding of blood
                  or the sufferings of the animal, which are as much lost sight of in the excitement
                  of the moment as the gasping of a fish or the quivering of a worm upon the hook is
                  disregarded by the humane disciple of Izaak Walton. The bull and matador, as
                  motionless as if carved in marble, present a fearfully artistic effect. At length,
                  like an electric flash, the polished steel of the matador flies in the air, and
                  descends with tremendous force into the neck of the doomed animal, burying itself
                  in the flesh, even up to the hilt. The blow is well made, and from the month of
                  the bull a torrent of blood gushes forth in a crimson stream; he staggers, drops
                  on his knees, recovers himself for an instant, and then falls dead at the feet of
                  his conquerer, amid the tumultuous plaudits of the excited throng of
                  spectators.
            
            
               THE PRESENT AND PAST.
               In no particular has the present generation become more
                  fastidious than in what is requisite for the use of ladies in their own
                  dressing-room. Essences, powders, pastes, washes for the hair, washes for the
                  skin, recall the days of one's grandmother, when such appurtenances were thought
                  essential, and were essential; for our great-grandmothers were not nice in points
                  of personal cleanliness; and it is only uncleanliness that requires scents to
                  conceal it, and applications to repair its ravages. Our great-grandmothers wore
                  powder and pomatum, and had their hair dressed three times a week going to bed in
                  the cushioned structure, after suffering torture for some hours lest they should,
                  in the weakness of human infirmity, lean back in their chairs. Our
                  great-grandmothers, too, had their white kid gloves sewn to the bottom of each
                  sleeve, lest they should incur the calamity of a sun-burnt arm. Out
                  great-grandmothers were afraid of cold water, and delicately wiped their faces
                  with the corner of a towel no larger than a pocket handkerchief. There were those
                  amongst them who boasted that they had never washed their faces in their whole
                  span of existence, lest it should spoil their complexions, but had only passed a
                  cambric handkerchief over the delicate brow and cheeks, wetted with elder-flower
                  water or rose water.
            
            
               GREAT FEET.—An exchange speaks of a chap with feet so large that when it rains or
                  when he wants to get into the shade, he lies down on his back and
                     holds up one foot. It fully answers the purpose of an
                  umbrella. This beats the man whose feet ware mistaken for a pair of leather
                  trunks, and who had to go to the fork of a road to pull his boots off.

                  CHAPTER VII.
                  THE BATTLE.
                  ALFRED HARROLD showed himself a good seaman, and though Pettrell seemed pleased
                     with the manner in which he did his duty, yet he treated the youth with
                     anything but kindness. He did not really abuse him, but his manner was
                     unfeeling and coarse, and he was angry when Alfred refused to acknowledge him
                     as a father. Among the men, however, the youth had made many friends. They
                     could not but love one who was so kind and forbearing, though they were
                     incapable of appreciating the moral feelings that gave source to the kindness
                     they loved. Months passed away, and Alfred became somewhat accustomed to his
                     ocean home. The sharper points of his anguish were worn off; but his heart
                     still turned with longing love towards the old light-keeper, and he dreamed
                     sweet dreams, both sleeping and waking, of the bright-eyed Ella.
                  The brig went to Canton and took in part of a load of silks, and then touched
                     at Sumatra and filled up with spices; and in nine months from the time of her
                     leaving the Bristol Channel she was again upon the coast of England and the
                     season was summer. Alfred knew that the brig's cargo was to be all smuggled on
                     shore, and from remarks that he had heard, he know that Pettrell had trusty
                     agents in Lancashire.
                  The brig had entered the Irish Sea, and with a fresh breeze from the north west
                     was heading in towards the mouth of the river Ribble. It was near noon, when
                     one of the men in the foretop reported a sail to the southeast. A consultation
                     was held between Pettrell and Bronkon, and it was decided to stand on. The
                     smuggler was now heading due east, and was not far from fifty miles from the
                     Lancashire coast.
                  "It may only be some trader coming out from Liverpool," said Bronkon.
                  "Very likely," returned the captain. And as he spoke, he levelled his glass
                     upon the object of his consultation.
                  "She's a schooner, I think," said he, as he lowered his glass and turned
                     towards his mate.
                  "If it should be one of those infernal cutters," muttered Bronkon.
                  "She's heading this way," resumed Pettrell, again levelling his glass.
                  "Then she's a revenue hound, as sure as fate," said the mate. "Let me take the
                     glass."
                  Bronkon looked for several minutes, and when he lowered the glass a defiant
                     smile broke over his coarse features.
                  "She's a revenue craft," he said. "I know her well, and I shouldn't wonder if
                     she knew us. We'd better haul our wind and lay up for Morecambe."
                  The captain assented to the proposal, and the brig's head was put up
                     accordingly
                  "We shan't got clear," muttered Pettrell. "She gains on us"
                  "If she must come, then let her come," returned Bronkon.
                  An hour passed, and the schooner was not two miles distant. Her guns could be
                     seen peeping out from her sides, and it could also be seen that she carried a
                     large number of men.
                  "This is going to be an ugly job," said the smuggler captain, pacing the deck
                     with nervous strides.
                  "But we must make the best of it," coolly returned Bronkon.
                  "They wont take on without a blow, at all events," resumed Pettrell. "Waffon,
                     get up the playthings."
                  The men who was thus addressed hurried below, and ere long he had brought
                     pistols and cutlasses enough on deck for all the men, and the crew proceeded at
                     once to arm themselves.
                  During this time Alfred had been a silent spectator of the scene. He saw that a
                     fight with the schooner was inevitable, and his heart sank within him as he
                     reflected upon the unfortunate position in which he was placed. He had hoped to
                     reach the coast in safety, and there he had determined to make good his escape,
                     if possible; but this was a contingency he had not anticipated.
                  "Come, Alfred, arm yourself," said Pettrell. "We shall want your good arm in
                     the coming conflict."
                  
                  Alfred hesitated.
                  "You'd better," fell in low tones from Bronkon's lips.
                  A reply arose to Alfred lips; but he suppressed it and went to the arm-chest.
                     He took a cutlass and buckled its belt about his waist, and took a pair of the
                     heavy pistols
                  "There," said Pettrell, as he saw the youth armed, "now we'll initiate
                     you."
                  Just as the smuggler spoke there come a shot from the schooner, and passed
                     through the mainsail.
                  "Rather a pressing invitation for us to heave to," said Bronkon.
                  "And I think I shall do it," said Pettrell. "There is no use in running any
                     further. That schooner don't carry over forty men. We are twenty
                     six—twenty-seven, with Alfred—and I reckon we can give them a hard pull."
                  Another shot came from the pursuing schooner, and, a few minutes afterwards the
                     brig was hove to.
                  "Now let her come up," said the captain, as he looked around upon his men.
                     "Stand by, now, to take the first advantage, my boys. Remember that the enemy
                     have the trouble of hoarding. Have both pistols out for them. Look out for them
                     the moment they show their faces over the rail."
                  Alfred seemed to be forgotten in the excitement of the occasion. He stood alone
                     near the larboard quarter rail, and he was gazing abstractedly upon the
                     schooner, which was now almost alongside.
                  "Brig ahoy!" came from the revenue cruiser.
                  "What do you want?" returned Pettrell.
                  "I want you to surrender. Isn't that brig the Addor?"
                  "Yes."
                  "Then I'll take you into Liverpool."
                  "Come and try it!"
                  "Do you mean to show fight?"
                  "Come and see!" was Pettrell's laconic reply.
                  The schooner was too near to use her guns, for she sat much lower in the water
                     than did the brig, and she ranged up on the starboard side. Her men were ready
                     for the leap, and the moment she touched they sprang for the smuggler's
                     deck.
                  "Fire!" shouted Pettrell.
                  The smugglers poured in their volley upon the boarders, and the effect was
                     destructive. Eight of the schooner's men fell back upon their own deck, and for
                     a few moments there was a suspension of further action. The schooner bad ranged
                     now fully alongside, and again the revenue officer urged his men forward.
                  "Fire!" shouted Pettrell.
                  Not over six of the boarders were knocked back by this tire, and the rest, to
                     the number of twenty-seven, came rushing over the brig's bulwarks. The
                     smugglers had fired their pistols, and they now had only their cutlasses upon
                     which to depend, for they could not stop to reload. The boarders, on the other
                     hand, had their pistols loaded, and they used them to good effect.
                  "Remember—the gallows if you are taken!" cried Bonkon, as he
                     swung his heavy cutlass over his head and eat down a man who was before him.
                     "At them, boys! Clear the Adder's deck of the hounds!"
                  The smugglers fought desperately, and they had desperate foes to contend with.
                     Pettrell was the commander, but Bronkon was the genius of the battle.
                  Alfred had not yet moved. The clang of the cutlasses rang with a deafening
                     noise in his ears, and the fumes of gunpowder were hanging about
                        him. While he stood thus, a great badly fellow rushed
                     upon him.
                  "Ah, you smuggling son of a gun," yelled the assailant, "take that!"
                  It was a fierce blow that the big revenue man aimed at Alfred's head; but quick
                     as thought the blow was dodged. With an instinctive movement the youth drew his
                     own cutlass. His pistols were yet in his belt, and both of
                     them were charged. Again the assailant swept his cutlass about his head, and
                     his blow was coming down upon the youth. Alfred's brain whirled for a moment
                     with its conflicting emotions; but the hope of life triumphed. That was not a
                     moment to think of causes nor consequences; he caught the eye of the stout man,
                     and slipping quickly upon one side, he sank upon his knee and warded off the
                     blow. The same movement of the cutlass that threw off the man's weapon brought
                     the point up against his bosom, and with one powerful thrust Alfred laid his
                     adversary upon the deck.
                  But he had no time to reflect upon what he had done, for at that moment Bronkon
                     backed up against him with two of the revenue men driving at him. The smuggler
                     mate was wounded upon the left arm, and there was a deep gash across his check,
                     from which the blood was flowing copiously. He looked terrible in his gory
                     features, but he was failing in strength. At the next blow he made, his cutlass
                     was knocked from his grasp, and one of his assailants leaped upon him, and beat
                     him back over the trunk of the cabin companion-way, while the other drove at
                     him with his cutlass.
                  "God have mercy!" ejaculated Bracken, in frantic tones; and as he spoke, his
                     eyes rested upon Alfred.
                  There was a most imploring look in those rolling eyes, and Alfred could not
                     withstand their silent appeal. It would have been fearful to see Bronkon killed
                     as he than lay, and the youth entertained but a single thought as he dwelt upon
                     the scene. His still reeking cutlass came down with a deadly blow upon the head
                     of him who was about to strike, and with a pistol he shot the other through the
                     temple The act was more impulsive than premeditated; it was the silent look of
                     appeal from Bronkon that influenced his soul, and whatever might be the result,
                     he could not resist assistance in the man's hour of desperate need.
                  Bronkon arose to his feet, and gazed upon the face of the youth to whom he so
                     signally owed his life.
                  
                  "Alfred, I owe you one!" he said.
                  At that moment the boarders cried out for quarter, and the conflict stopped.
                     Only twelve of the revenue men were alive to return to their schooner, and the
                     majority of them were wounded. The brig had lost ton men, having sustained not
                     half the loss of the other. Ere long the vessels were clear of each other,
                     Pettrell having first, however, chopped the schooner's masts off near the deck,
                     so that she could not run too soon with the news.
                  The dead were sewed up in hammocks and lowered over the side, the decks washed,
                     and once more the brig turned her head towards the Ribble.
                  "Alfred," said Pettrell, "you behaved nobly."
                  The youth started from the painful reverie into which he had fallen, and gazed
                     up into the face of the smuggler captain.
                  "Death and destruction!" uttered Bracken. "but the youngster's arm served me
                     most truly. I should have been food for sharks before now, but for him. Alfred,
                        I owe you one."
                  "You are worth more than I thought," added Pettrell. "Fore heaven, if you don't
                     come on well."
                  A dark shadow passed over the captain's face as he spoke, and a sort of
                     demoniac triumph rusted upon his features. Alfred Harrold turned away sick at
                     heart. He shuddered at the thought of what he had done but in his own soul he
                     felt guiltless, and he knew that the blame must rest upon other shoulders than
                     his. His earnest prayer was, that he might get clear of his present state of
                     dreadful bondage.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VIII.
                  ESCAPE — A STRANGE ACQUAINTANCE.
                  IT was nearly midnight when the brig's anchor dropped at the mouth of the
                        Ribble, in a small cover near the outskirts of
                        Kirkham, and as soon as her sails were clewed up, a blue
                     light was hoisted at her foretruck, and a red one at her
                     main. It was nearly three o'clock, however, before any notice was taken of
                     these signals, but at that hour three large boats came alongside.
                  "You are a long while getting off," said Pettrell, to one of the men who came
                     up from a boat.
                  "We didn't see the signals till an hour ago, and then we had to collect the
                     men."
                  "How many have you got?"
                  "What—men?"
                  "Yes."
                  "There's eighteen of us."
                  "That will do; but we must hurry. I have only fifteen mon left. We've had a
                     brush with a revenue dog to day, and it thinned us down. Everything is ready
                     ashore, isn't it?"
                  "Yes," returned the man from the shore, who was none other than the smuggler's
                     agent, named John Pollen. The goods can be carried right to town. Three of the
                     excise outriders are with us, so that coast is clear."
                  Most of the men were called up from the boats, a "yard and stay" whip
                     and-runner was rigged, and then all hands turned to at breaking out the cargo,
                     which was hoisted into the boats alongside. The men worked smartly, and in less
                     than five hours the whole cargo was safely landed on shore.
                  Alfred watched in vain for an opportunity to get away from the brig, for as
                     soon as she was clear she got up her anchor and made sail, Pettrell not daring
                     to remain so near the scene of his late conflict. Arrangements were made with
                     the agent, however, to meet the brig at a small rocky bay on the coast of
                     Cumberland, some eight miles north of Whitehaven, and towards that place the
                     smuggler made her way without being disturbed.
                  The wind had hauled around to the westward, and the brig reached her
                     destination early in the evening, and shortly after the sails had been furled
                     Pettrell went on shore; but before he went, however, he gave some whispered
                     orders to his mate.
                  After the deck had been cleared up a quarter watch was set, Bronkon taking care
                     that Alfred was stationed with himself. In each of these watches there were
                     only three men, and they were merely set to keep a lookout for any boats that
                     might come off, and also to look after the security of the moorings.
                  The small bay in which the brig lay was not over a mile wide at the mouth, and
                     where the smuggler was moored the distance from shore to shore was not over
                     half a mile. She lay with her stern in towards the extremity of the bay, which
                     was about a mile distant. On either shore were huge masses of rocks, with only
                     an occasional break of sandy beach, while beyond the country was hilly and well
                     covered with stunted oak. Not far from the head of the inlet, Alfred had
                     noticed, as the brig first entered, a number of small houses, and towards these
                     the captain had gone.
                  Pettrell had taken seven men with him in the boat, so that only nine were left
                     on board, and Bronkon set them in three watches, with two hours to each watch.
                     His own watch came from ten to midnight, and with him were Waffon and Alfred.
                     Only a few remarks passed between Bronkon and the youth during the two hours.
                     The former seemed ill at ease in the presence of the lad who had saved his
                     life, and the latter was busy with his own thoughts.
                  Midnight came, and the watch was relieved. Alfred still bunked in the cabin,
                     and hither he went, Bronkon and Waffon keeping him company. The youth turned
                     into his berth, but it was not to sleep. He lay so that he could see the mate,
                     and he at length became assured that that individual was watching him. He
                     remembered the whisperings of the captain, and he doubted not that he himself
                     had been the object of it, and that Bronkon had been instructed to have an eye
                     to all his movements.
                  Waffon was soon asleep, but the mate still kept his eyes open, and ever and
                     anon Alfred could see their bright balls shining upon him. At first the youth
                     thought it might be the pain of Bronkon's wounds that made him thus wakeful;
                     but then he knew that those wounds had not kept him from his duty, and besides,
                     he showed no signs of suffering. At length Alfred turned over in his bunk, gave
                     a sleepy yawn, and ere long he began to breathe that long, heavy, sonorous
                     breath peculiar to sound sleep. The ruse took, for ere many minutes there was a
                     nestling in the mate's berth, as though his limbs were being composed for
                     rest—and not long afterwards he began to snore.
                  Alfred turned carefully over in his bunk and looked forth. By the dim light of
                     the hanging lamp, one smell wick of which was burning, he could see that Bonkon
                     was asleep. He waited a moment, and then he slipped noiselessly from his berth.
                     With quick, self possessed movements he rolled his heavier clothing into a
                     small bundle, and tied it up in a handkerchief, and then he crept to the cabin
                     windows. They swung upon hinges at the top, and opened outward by means of a
                     lanyard rove through an eye above the frame.
                  The youth unhasped one of the windows and carefully hoisted it. There was a
                     creaking of the hinge, and Bronkon moved in his bunk. Alfred still held the
                     lanyard, and remained quiet, and again the mate settled into his undisturbed
                     slumber.
                  The youth listened for a moment to bear if the watch were moving on deck, and
                     he had the satisfaction of hearing all three of them conversing in one of the
                     gangways. He knew there was not a moment to be lost, and taking his bundle
                     between his teeth, he crept stealthily out through the window, from the sill of
                     which he could just reach the falls of the starboard davit. This had been left
                     hanging when the captain's boat was lowered, and from its lower block the youth
                     could easily drop into the water without noise. Upon the sill he waited a
                     moment, but no one had been aroused; and with a fervent prayer upon his lips he
                     reached forth till he could grasp the falls, and then he let his body swing
                     off. There was a slight creaking of the davit sheaves, but no one was started
                     by the round, and noiselessly he let himself down into the water.
                  For some minutes Alfred worked his way very slowly from the brig; but at length
                     he took courage and struck boldly out for the southern shore of the
                        inlet. It was too dark for those on board the brig to see
                     him now, for Alfred could but distinguish the bare outlines of the vessel, and
                     without more fear of immediate detection, he swain on with
                     all his strength. The distance was not great, and the brave fellow reached the
                     shore in safety, happening luckily to come upon one of the sand bars that made
                     out from between the rocks.
                  When he reached the rising ground he found it somewhat difficult to make his
                     way through the shrubby wood; but having put on his outer clothing and drawing
                     on his boots, he pushed on. He had some idea of the direction of the Whitehaven
                     road, for he knew that it was not over a mile from the head of the bay, so he
                     took a south easterly course, thinking to strike the highway at a safe distance
                     from the houses he had seen near the shore.
                  For two hours Alfred pushed on through the intricate wood, and just as he was
                     beginning to despair of finding the road, he espied an opening ahead. When he
                     reached it, he found himself in the highway he was seeking. In half an hour
                     more he reached the market town of Whitehaven—but he did not stop. None of the
                     people were yet stirring, and he hastened on through the place, thinking that
                     he would find some peasant's cot where he could rest and refresh himself.
                  When Alfred had fairly cleared from the town, the first red streaks of morning
                     were rising in the east, and ere long daylight was dancing over the country.
                     From the top of a small eminence the youth saw another large town before him,
                     which could not have been over five miles from the one he had loft. To the
                     right, just west of the town, he saw the massive ruins of an old castle,
                     lifting its ragged battlements against the sky, the ivy-bound towers of which
                     were catching the first rays of the sun, while ahead he saw the banks of a
                     murmuring river. He knew the town must be Egremont—that the river was Eden, and
                     that the smugglers had secret agents in the place.
                  Through Egremont Alfred determined to make his way without stopping. It was
                     nearly six o'clock when he reached the town, and it was half-past six when he
                     had cleared its southern confines. He felt hungry and fatigued, but he dared
                     not stop within the town. At eight o'clock he came to an inn—a small,
                     out-of-the-way place, and here he stopped. He had some money with him—money
                     which he had been collecting to serve him in case of need—so he had no need of
                     suffering with want.
                  The landlord of the inn was not a type of landlords generally, for he was a
                     thin, sallow-visaged man; but yet he appeared good-natured enough for all
                     necessary business purposes. Alfred made known his wants, and a substantial
                     breakfast was soon prepared for him. Just as he sat down he heard a rattling of
                     wheels at the door, and upon looking out at the window, be saw a post chaise
                     that had driven up.
                  "Young man," said the landlord, opening the door of the room in which our hero
                     was eating, "you'll have to make room for a companion at the table, for a
                     gentleman has just come as wants his breakfast in a great hurry."
                  Without stopping to receive Alfred's answer, the landlord introduced the
                     stranger, and then went for more victuals.
                  The new-comer was a man some sixty years of age, dressed in a garb of fine blue
                     broadcloth, with heavy gold buttons. He wore a cap with a heavy gold band, and
                     a superb sword was hanging from a silken belt about his waist. Alfred knew that
                     the buttons bore the arms of the royal navy, but he was at a loss to make out
                     the rank of the wearer.
                  "Beautiful morning," said the stranger, seeming raised to a communicative mood
                     by the flavor of his coffee, which he sipped with evident relish.
                  "Very," returned Alfred, with composure.
                  The old gentleman ate a piece of buttered toast very slowly for a hungry man,
                     and at intervals he looked inquisitively into Alfred's face.
                  "Are you from the north?" he asked, as he helped himself to a second slice of
                     toast.
                  "Yes," returned Alfred, with some embarrassment.
                  Again the stranger looked into the youth's face more earnestly than before.
                  "Do you belong about here?" he asked.
                  "No, sir."
                  "I thought not. You look more of the southern blood."
                  Alfred returned the earnest gaze of his companion, and he soon made up his mind
                     that he had nothing to fear, for the old gentleman was kind looking, and his
                     voice was smooth and mild.
                  "You mustn't think me impertinent," resumed the stranger, "but really I would
                     like to know from what part of England you come?"
                  "If I were at home, sir, I should be in Devonshire."
                  "Ah, then you were born in Devonshire?"
                  The speaker seemed disappointed.
                  Alfred hesitated. At length a vague idea broke over his mind that the stranger
                     might have discovered some family likeness in his countenance, and a ray of dim
                     hope broke in upon his soul.
                  "I do not know that I was born in Devonshire, sir; but I was brought up in that
                     county."
                  The old man set down his coffee-cup and wiped his mouth, and thou he looked
                     again into Alfred's face.
                  "I'm making myself interested on a short acquaintance," he said, while a faint
                     smile rested upon his features; "hut the truth is, your features put me in mind
                     of one whom I once knew. Will you tell me what you know of your
                     birth-place?"
                  "Nothing, sir," returned Alfred, in an earnest, anxious tone.
                  "What of your parents, then?"
                  "Nothing."
                  "Of your early life, then?"
                  "At four years of age, sir, I was cast away upon Little Devon Head. I was saved
                     from the wreck by the light-keeper there, and with him I lived till about a
                     year ago."
                  "There isn't much light in that," altered the old gentleman. "You don't know
                     whom you were with previous to your being cast away?"
                  "Yes, sir. It was a man who called himself my father. His name was Marrok
                     Pettrell."
                  "Now you talk!" exclaimed the stranger, with a sudden energy. "I'faith, I'm not
                     do wild in my reading features as I had feared. Did you over come across a
                     companion that this Pettrell had, a fellow named Mark Bronkon?"*
                  
                  
                     
                     *[SEE ENGRAVING.]
                  
                  "Yes, yes!"
                  "Can you tell me where those two chaps are now?"
                  For some time Alfred remained silent. He thought over the events of the past,
                     and at length he made up his mind to tell his whole story to the man before
                     him. The recital could in no way endanger himself, and it might benefit him; so
                     he related the principal events of the past year, together with the present
                     whereabouts of the smuggler, and his recent escape from her.
                  The old gentleman thumped upon the table with the handle of his knife for
                     several moments after Alfred had concluded his story.
                  "Now tell me, sir," said the youth, with a trembling voice, "what you know of
                     me or mine?"
                  "That that scamp of a Pettrell is no more your father than I am"
                  "But of my father—my true father—can you tell me?"
                  "Not anything that you would wish at present to know."
                  "Anything—anything would bless me."
                  "You are not so sure of that, my young man," said the old gentleman, as he
                     arose from the table. "I will help you, however, and in the
                     end I think you will find I am the most wise."
                  He touched the table bell as he spoke, and the landlord soon made his
                     appearance.
                  "Let me have pen, ink, and paper," said the stranger.
                  The materials wear soon brought, and the old gentleman sat down to the table
                     and wrote. When the note was finished he folded and directed it.
                  "Here," he said, "take this and make your way to London without delay. Here is
                     my card. Go to my house, hand the note to my secretary, and there you will
                     remain till I return. I am on my way now to Carlisle, and
                     shall be back in two weeks. My chaise is waiting, and I must be off. You
                        can easily reach Ravenglass by noon, and there you will find a coach for Lancaster.
                     When there you will take the mail coach on the great Manchester road, and your
                     route will be direct. Don't fail, now, to do as I have bid. I will look up
                     matters for you when I return. Have you money enough to early you through?"
                  "Yes, sir."
                  "Then take care of yourself. You will find your confidence in me worth more
                     than you think for. Good-by, till I see you again."
                  The old gentleman left the room as he spoke and entered his chaise. The
                     postilion whipped up the flesh horses, and they moved off at a quick pace.
                     Alfred watched the vehicle till it was lost to his sight, and then he bent his
                     eyes to the floor, and remained for a long time in a state of trembling,
                     ambiguous thought.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IX.
                  DAYLIGHT VANISHES AGAIN.
                  ALFRED was at length aroused from his reverie by the voice of the landlord, who
                     wished to know if he had finished his breakfast.
                  "Zounds!" uttered the publican, as he began to clear away the dishes, "you've
                     had an honor. I offered to set the admiral another table, but he said he'd eat
                     with you. He's as kind-hearted a man as there be between here and Land's End.
                     Engaged you in his service, haint he?"
                  "Service," repeated Alfred, looking up into the landlord's face.
                  "Yes. Didn't Sir William speak about your stopping with him?"
                  "Ah, yes. I understand. Yes—yes," returned Alfred, who now saw what the
                     inquisitive landlord was after.
                  "Lucky fellow—zounds! Wish I was in his service. Comes up here every summer to
                     visit his estates in Cumberland. Gives me a guinea, always."
                  As soon as Alfred get clear of the landlord, he examined the card he had
                     received from the old gentleman. In one corner was a seal bearing a coat of
                     arms, and below it was written with a pencil:
                  
                     SIR WILLIAM BRENT—ADMIRAL.
                     13 Hanover Square, London.
                  
                  The note was addressed to "DONALD McIVAR, Secretary," and bore
                     the some direction.
                  Of course, Alfred could only wonder what was to be the end of all this, and of
                     course he resolved to make his way as soon as possible to London. He felt
                     perfectly assured that the old baronet had not and would not deceive him. He
                     settled his bill for breakfast, and asked what time the stage-coach would leave
                     Ravenglass for the south.
                  "Half an hour after noon," returned the landlord. "But you can have a post
                     chaise from here."
                  "That wouldn't help me, for I should have to wait at Ravenglass for the
                     coach."
                  "Certain."
                  "Then I'll go on foot. I shall have a better chance to see the country"
                  "Well, you'll reach there afore the coach, easy enough"
                  Shortly afterwards the youth set forward, and as soon as he had got clear of
                     the inn he quickened his pace. At the distance of two miles he came to a point
                     where the road entered a deep wood, and he could hear the low murmuring of the
                     sea as it broke upon the rocks of the coast to his right. He had been in the
                     wood but a short time when he saw two men seated on a rock by the roadside, at
                     some distance ahead. They were two stout countryman by their looks, and without
                     fear the youth approached them. There was a quick whispering between them as
                     Alfred came near, and when he had reached the place, they slipped down from the
                     rock and joined him.
                  "Good morning," said one of the men.
                  Alfred returned the compliment without stopping, and the two men kept along
                     with him.
                  "How far are you from this morning?"
                  "From Egremont," returned the youth, showing by his manner that he was not
                     desirous of company.
                  "Belong in Egremont?"
                  "No."
                  The two men exchanged significant glances.
                  "D'ye know anything 'bout the Adder?"
                  "Adder! repeated Alfred, with a start.
                  "Yes."
                  "What do you mean?"
                  "Mean the Adder. Don't you know her?"
                  Our hero began to tremble. The men were both strangers to him, and yet he
                     feared they had some clue to his real character. He determined to keep his own
                     counsel, however.
                  "If you will speak more plainly," he returned, "perhaps I shall understand
                     you."
                  He could see that the men exchanged glances again.
                  "S'pose'n we was excisemen, or somethin' n' that sort, couldn't you tell us
                     where the Adder was?"
                  "No! Does that satisfy you?"
                  "Not quite, 'cause I believe you know all about her."
                  Alfred felt like knocking the fellow down, but he restrained his passion.
                  "Look here," said the second man, "don't ye know 'at the Adder is a
                     smuggler?"
                  "Look ye, fellows—what do you mean by your impertinent questions? If you have
                     business this way, I beg you will pass on and leave me to myself."
                  As our hero thus spoke, the two men fell behind, and be hurried forward. He
                     could hear the fellows earnestly talking, and he noticed that they followed
                     him. A short distance further brought him to an abrupt turn in the road, and
                     some fifteen or twenty rods ahead he saw two more men just coming out from the
                     wood from the direction of the sea. They stopped as they noticed the youth, and
                     those behind seemed to be making signals to them.
                  Alfred now began to feel sure that some plan was on foot for his recapture. He
                     had no weapon, and his heart sank within him as he thought of being carried
                     back to the brig. The wood offered him no means of escape, and with a trembling
                     step he kept on. The two men who were ahead came out into
                     the road as he approached, and one of them stepped directly in front of
                     him.
                  "What do you want?" asked Alfred.
                  "Want to ask ye a question. Aint you Alfred Pettrell?"
                  "No!"
                  "Harrold, ye know the captain said he'd call his self," interposed
                     the other. "Aint yer name Harrold?"
                  Alfred gathered all his strength for one trial. With one blow of his fist he
                     knocked the man-down in front of him, and then set off at the top of his
                     speed.
                  "Stop! stop!" yelled the men, as they started in pursuit.
                  Alfred turned his head and saw that the other two had come up, and that the man
                     he had levelled was getting upon his feet.
                  "Stop, or we'll fire into you!" shouted one of the pursuers.
                  The youth did not stop, but rather increased his speed.
                  "Stop, or we'll fire!"
                  No notice was taken of the threat, and in a moment more a pistol ball came
                     whizzing by Alfred's head.
                  Another ball came—and another, but the youth was unharmed. He was satisfied
                     that he could easily outrun his pursuers, and he kept on. Just after the third
                     hall whizzed by him he turned his head and saw that the fourth man had stopped
                     and was levelling his heavy pistol. He heard the report, and on the same
                     instant he felt a twinge in the calf of his leg. He ran a few steps further,
                     but his leg failed him, and he could only limp along, and ere long a heavy hand
                     was laid upon his shoulder.
                  "I guess you wont run much further, my young covey," exclaimed the fellow-who
                     had stopped him.
                  "Sorry we had to shoot yer, but ye ought to 've knowed better than to run."
                  "Tell me what you want of me?" said Alfred. as he found the four men gathered
                     about him.
                  "We want ye to go back to where ye run away from last night. Capt'n Pettrell
                     don't think ye served him a werry pooty trick."
                  "And you are deputised to carry me back to the brig," said Alfred, in a
                     desponding tone.
                  "Sartin. That's what we've come for; so you'll just go along with us to the
                     shore."
                  Alfred saw that his captors were not the kind of men with whom any argument or
                     persuasion would be profitable, and he also saw that his hope of escape was
                     entirely cut off, so he turned slowly about, and was led back. He learned that
                     his escape had been discovered at two o'clock, when the watch was relieved, and
                     that word had been immediately sent on shore to the captain, who at once sent
                     the four men in a sail boat to make their way down the coast to a point south
                     of the mouth of the Eden; and from thence they had directions to go on shore
                     and lay in wait on the road. A fresh and favorable breeze had brought the boat
                     down in good season, and the men had been on the watch over an hour when the
                     youth came along. Other men had been sent in other directions, but the bird had
                     been caught in the very direction Pettrell had anticipated.
                  Alfred's leg pained him exceedingly, and it was with difficulty that he made
                     his way along. At first he refused the assistance that was tendered him, but
                     ere long he was glad to accept of it, and with a stout arm on either side to
                     support him, he found his labor lighter. When the party arrived at the rock
                     where Alfred had met the first two men, they turned into the wood and moved
                     towards the sea-shore.
                  "You mustn't blame us," said one of the men, as soon as they had turned out
                     from the highway. "As sure as heaven we're sorry you be hurt, but we couldn't
                     help it. 'Twould not do for you to run away and blow, yer see."
                  "I had no intention of betraying—"
                  Alfred hesitated, for he remembered what he had told Sir William.
                  "Pettrell was afeared you would," said the man who had before spoken. "But you
                     know we couldn't help what we did. You wouldn't stop."
                  The youth doubted whether the speaker was moved by sympathy, or whether he was
                     only afraid Pettrell would blame him for the wound that had been given to the
                     prisoner. At any rate, the men did not seem to be really evil-disposed—only
                     they were rough and uncouth by nature and education, and their connection with
                     the smugglers rendered them fearful of detection, which Pettrell had given them
                     to understand would follow from Alfred's being at liberty.
                  At length the sea coast was reached, and Alfred was assisted into the boat
                     which lay there. His leg now began to swell, and the pain was intense. The ball
                     seemed to be lodged among the cords, for the least movement rendered the
                     torture excruciating, but he bore it the best way he could. Occasionally, as
                     the boat was on her course, he dipped his hand overboard and bathed the parts
                     about the wound, and that afforded him slight relief.
                  It was an hour after noon when the boat reached the brig, and instead of
                     finding himself on the Lancaster stage, our hero was once more doomed to his
                     prison house on board the smuggler.
                  "Wounded, oh?" uttered Pettrell, as the poor youth was helped over the
                     gangway.
                  "We couldn't help it, sir," said one of the captors. "He run, and we couldn't
                     do anything but wing him."
                  "Good enough for him," said Pettrell.
                  For an instant Alfred forgot his pain in the fire of indignation that burned in
                     his bosom, as he met the cold, demoniac look of the smuggler captain.
                  "It wont be safe for you to try that game again, my boy," continued Pettrell.
                     "The pitcher that goes to the well once too often gets broken! Once more'll be
                     once too often for you to try this game."
                  Alfred made no reply, but be groaned with pain.
                  "I guess the ball's in his leg now," said the fellow, who had fired the pistol
                     that did the mischief.
                  "Here, Waffon, you are surgeon enough for this job," said Pettrell. "Take the
                     youngster below, and fix him up the best way you can. If the bail's there, get
                     it out. You've done worse jobs than that."
                  Waffon acknowledged the dubious compliment, and then followed Alfred down into
                     the cabin.
                  The smuggler was not so bad a surgeon as might have been supposed from the
                     course remark of Pettrell, for he was careful in his handling of the wound, and
                     he displayed much skill in the use of the simple instruments he had at hand.
                     The ball was found lodged among the large tendons just below the back part of
                     the knee joint, and Waffon extracted it with but little cutting. Then the wound
                     was bandaged, and Alfred was helped into his berth.
                  It was three weeks before our hero could walk comfortably, and at the end of
                     that time the brig was got under way for sea. Alfred heard that there had been
                     a disturbance of some kind ashore, in which the smugglers bore a part, and he
                     heard the name of Sir William Brent used; but most of the excisemen in the
                     vicinity were hired to the smugglers' interests, and the affair had passed off
                     without much trouble.
                  The brig had taken in a large stock of provisions, and her complement of men
                     was again made up to its former number. Alfred had learned that the smuggler's
                     destination was again for the Indies, and he saw another inevitable year of
                     galling bondage before him.
               
               
                  CHAPTER X.
                  PIRATES.
                  WHEN the smugglers reached the Indies they commenced a new system of
                     operations. A lucrative opportunity was offered to them for the smuggling of
                     opium into Canton. Their opium was mostly procured in Calcutta, and for two
                     years they followed this business.
                  These were two long years for Alfred Harrold. Not once during that time did he
                     set his foot on shore, nor was there a single opportunity for his escape. He
                     had become sick and weary, and more than once had he almost determined to join
                     fully with his companions; but the memory of his youthful hopes still clung
                     about his soul, and he had conquered the feeling. He had breasted the storm,
                     and his face was still turned towards the beacon of his young aspirations.
                     Pettrell was the same as ever—stern and unfeeling, and seeming to exult in the
                     misery he saw Alfred suffering.
                  Mark Bronkon scarcely over spoke to the young man, except when business
                     required it. He had grown more morose in his manner, and his features were
                     still darker in their shadowing of passion.
                  Alfred himself had seen his nineteenth returning birthday, and he was fast
                     verging towards the sum of life that was to make up his twenty years on earth.
                     He had grown more of the man in form and feature, and there were few on board
                     the brig who could equal him in physical strength. He had almost forgotten the
                     circumstance of having met Sir William Brent, and when he thought of it, it was
                     only as an event of the past which might never have effect in the future.
                  One day, while the brig lay at the outer extremity of Canton Bay, three
                     dark-looking men came on board and went with Pettrell and Bronkon into the
                     cabin, where they remained in close consultation for half an hour. At the end
                     of that time, Waffon was called down, and soon afterwards ten more of the men
                     were sent for. When the meeting was broken up the three strangers departed, and
                     there were strange and mysterious whisperings about the deck. Alfred mistrusted
                     that some new scheme of mischief was on foot, but he could get no clue
                        to its character.
                  At night the brig's anchors were hove up and sail was made, and the next
                     morning she was anchored in a small bay of one of the Larron Islands, some
                     eighty miles south of Canton. Not far from where the smuggler had anchored lay
                     an old dismasted brig, and ere long a boat put off from her side containing the
                     three men who had visited the Adder the previous day.
                  Another consultation was held, and when the strangers left the brig, Bronkon
                     and Waffon went with them. In two hours more Alfred saw that heavy guns were
                     being hoisted out from the wrack, and ere long they were brought alongside of
                     the smuggler. The youth experienced a stunning sensation as the thought first
                     broke upon him that Pettrell was about to turn pirate!
                  Before night, ten guns had been brought on board the brig, and rigged upon
                     their carriages. They were eighteen pounders, and port holes were knocked open
                     to receive them. Large boxes of ammunition were brought from the wrack,
                     together with two large chests of small arms; and, to cap the climax, fourteen
                     strange men were added to the brig's crew!
                  It was late at night when the brig was again got under way, and as soon as she
                     was fairly clear of the island, Pettrell called Alfred into the cabin. Bronkon
                     was there, but no one else besides those three.
                  "Alfred," said the captain, "can you imagine the nature of the business we are
                     going at?"
                  The young man had no fear of Pettrell now; he had raised himself above the fear
                     of one so base, and he replied, calmly:
                  "I have suspected your plans, sir; but I may be wrong."
                  "Perhaps not. Lot's hear what you have suspected?"
                  "I have suspected that you wore about to commence the crime of piracy."
                  Alfred could not repress the cold shudder that crept over him as he pronounced
                     that terrible word, and a wicked smile broke over the features of Marrok
                     Pettrell.
                  "You've hit the nail exactly on the head," returned the latter; "and
                        once that part of the business is disposed off, I'll whisper a few
                     words of counsel in your ear."
                  The captain glanced at Bronkon, and then, while a look of deadly meaning
                     settled upon his hard features, he continued:
                  "I know, my young man, that you aint hardly reconciled yet to the company you
                     keep, and I often see that soft morality of yours making its way into notice.
                     You have been a good sailor, and I have let you have pretty much your own way
                     so far; but you've got to turn over a new leaf now. I want no more of your
                     morality, nor will I hear any more of your whims about sin. It's all stuff! We
                     are now under a free flag, and you've got to be one of us. We've got some new
                     men, too—men who are used to the business, and who mustn's see the white
                        feather in you. Now, Master Alfred, the whole business can be summed
                     up in a few words. You've got to be one of us—fare as the rest do—bear your
                     part of all the duty that may turn up—and never drop a word in the hearing of
                     the men that will sound as though you didn't like our doings."
                  "Have you finished?" calmly asked the young man
                  "Yes."
                  "Then I may speak?"
                  "Certainly; hat you had better exercise care."
                  "I shall speak as freely as you have done," said Alfred, not at all daunted by
                     the threatening look of the captain.
                  "Very well. Go on."
                  "Then, sir, so long as I am forced to remain on board that brig. I shall do my
                     duty as a seaman, but I will never raise my hand as a pirate."
                  "Better be careful!" growled Bronkon.
                  "I shall be very careful that the sin of piracy rests not on my
                     soul."
                  For a few moments, Pettrell and Bronkon regarded each other in silence.
                  "Look ye," said the captain, while his frame trembled with passion; "we have
                     laws on board this vessel, and for him that breaks them the
                     yardarm shall find a hanging place!"
                  "Very well," calmly replied Alfred.
                  "Better he careful!" again growled Bronkon.
                  "I don't believe you'll run the risk of getting your neck stretched," added
                     Pettrell. "But let me assure you that it wouldn't go against my grain at all to
                     do the job for you, if you attempt to breed mutiny."
                  "I have no reason to doubt your word," said Alfred.
                  "Of course you haven't."
                  "Nor do I."
                  "Then you will be wise if you govern yourself accordingly."
                  "It is not always wise to be governed by every wind that blown You wouldn't
                     think of keeping square yards and running off before the over-changing
                     gale."
                  "None of your morality."
                  "I do not give it for your benefit, but only to show you my rule of conduct.
                     Now you can do with your brig as you choose, and I shall do as I choose. I am
                     not here of my own free will, but am forced to my present position. There is a
                     bound, however, beyond which I cannot be forced. I trust you understand
                     me!"
                  "I do understand you; but I don't believe you understand
                        me!"
                  As Pettrell thus spoke, he arose from his seat and laid his hand upon the young
                     man's head. His features were tortured into a fearful expression, and his words
                     were hissed out like the voice of a serpent.
                  "Mark me," he said; "if you dare to show a look of insubordination before the
                     men, you'll hang for it!"
                  Marrok Pettrell turned and went on dock.
                  "Youngster, you'd better be careful!" uttered Bronkon.
                  "Stop, Mark Bronkon," exclaimed the youth, as the dark-looking mate started to
                     leave the cabin. "I once saved your life, and to do it, I took the lives of two
                     men who were doing but their duty. At that moment, when you were bent helpless
                     over the trunk, and the sword was at your breast, I pitied you in your utter
                     helplessness, and saved you. Now will you lend your hand so crush me? I seek
                     the harm of no man. Were I at this moment clear of the brig, no word of mice
                     should betray her character; but I cannot become a pirate. Why should I be
                     forced to this thing? Can you tell me why I am thus trampled upon? why thus
                     abused? What harm have I done? what evil thought or deed have I given!"
                  "I don't know," gruffly returned Bronkon.
                  "Have I given any?".
                  
                  "I couldn't tell you."
                  "Ah, Bronkon, you may sneer at my young hopes—at my soul's expression of its
                     desired rectitude—but if you ever entertained a single youthful aspiration that
                     has been crushed, you should know how to pity me. Perhaps you never did—perhaps
                     your life was always cast in the rough paths you now tread?"
                  "Stuff! Gammon!" growled Bronkon; and yet Alfred thought he saw a tear rolling
                     down the dark man's cheek. But he turned away to hide it.
                  "Can you not tell me—"
                  Bronkon stopped not to hear the youth speak further, but with an uneasy
                     movement he turned away and went on deck.
                  "Can it be possible," uttered Alfred to himself, "that Bronkon has one tender
                     feeling in his bosom? That was certainly a tear I saw upon his cheek—and he
                     surely trembled while I spoke."
                  The young man arose from his seat and began to pace the cabin. The full
                     realization of his situation had come upon him, and be trembled as he thought
                     of the terrible ordeal through which he had got to pass. But he swerved not
                     from his resolution to keep his hands clear of the fatal work that had been
                     planned. He had not long for his reflections, however, for as soon as the
                     brig's course had been laid out, and the watch set, the captain and one of the
                     strangers came down.
                  "You'd better turn in," said Pettrell, as he cast a wicked glance upon Alfred;
                     "for you'll have to go on deck at midnight. You are still in my watch."
                  Alfred got into his berth, but it was a long time before he fell asleep, and
                     when the drowsy fit did come upon him, he left Pettrell and the new man engaged
                     in consulting the chart of the Indian Ocean. This new comer was a villanous
                     fellow, and his name was Dunham—at least, so Pettrell called him, and he had
                     been an officer of a pirate vessel that had been cast away on the island where
                     the Adder had taken him in.
                  At midnight, Alfred went on deck, and he found that the brig was heading for
                     the Straits of Sunda, and that she was to make the best of her way into the
                     Indian Ocean. Half-a-dozen of the men were at work in the forward bunk-room
                     making cartridges, and some of the hands on deck were set to work lashing up
                     stands of grape-shot.
                  At two o'clock, Alfred took the helm, and shortly afterwards Pettrell came on
                     deck to look at the compass.
                  "Got over your spleen?" said the captain.
                  "Don't try to worry me, sir, when there is no occasion for it," retorted
                     Alfred.
                  "Then don't give me occasion."
                  Just then Dunham came aft, and Pettrell turned away from the binnacle. The
                     youth overheard most of their conversation, and from it he learned that no
                     operations of a decided character were to be commenced till the brig had
                     cleared the China Sea; but that after the Straits of Sunda were passed, it was
                     their intention to throw themselves upon the first merchantman they might fall
                     in with. But that would be two weeks, at least in the future, and our hero was
                     informed by Pettrell, as the latter turned again towards him, that he "would
                     have plenty of time for reflection!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER XI.
                  THE SHIP. THE TRUE HERO.
                  IN three weeks from the time of the taking in of the brig's piratical armament,
                     she had entered the Indian Ocean, and was standing down towards the Cape of
                     Good Hope. The duty had thus far been of a quiet and steady character, and
                     though the reckless crew saw nothing out of the way in the demeanor of Alfred
                     Harrold, yet he had become firmly fixed in his determination to die are he
                     would lay his hand to the consummation of any robbery upon the high seas.
                  One thing seemed to give Marrok Pettrell more occasion for troublous feelings
                     than all else, and that was, the general disposition of the crew towards loving
                     his unwilling protege. The rough seamen could not but love the young man, for
                     he was always mild and kind, and be never failed to offer his assistance where
                     it could benefit a shipmate. Some of them he had taught to read, and to some he
                     had imparted instruction in navigation. Those uneducated children of sin and
                     shame had learned to look upon the youth with respect and esteem, for he never
                     lost sight of his true dignity, and yet he always associated with his shipmates
                     upon terms of social equality. The coarse and profane just he passed unheeded
                     by, while he smiled at the wit and humor of his companions.
                  Few men are so sunken that they will not love that which is to them kind and
                     generous, and which at the same time meets them upon a social equality. There
                     are some, to be sure, in whose bosoms the spark of gratitude cannot exist; but
                     generally it is because the cold hand of some bitter disappointment or dire
                     revenge lay heavily there. At any rate, there were few on board the brig who
                     did not love the pale youth who read to them, and who taught them. They had no
                     appreciation of his peculiar moral qualities, but his social nature was
                     congenial. Pettrell saw it all, and often did his teeth grate like files as he
                     found that Alfred was making so many friends among the crew.
                  Early one morning, after the brig had passed the southern tropic, the crew were
                     aroused by the reporting of a sail. Pettrell sprang up from the cabin with his
                     glass, and he quickly had the sail in view. It proved to be a ship standing to
                     the southward and westward.
                  "A homeward-bound Indiaman," said Dunham
                  "She'll be a rich prize," said Bronkon.
                  "And perhaps a hard one to take," suggested the captain.
                  "Never fear for that," resumed Dunham. "We are forty—yes, forty-one, all
                     told—and I doubt if the ship has much over half that number. She may have
                     passengers, but they wont be likely to be much."
                  Pettrell was all excitement. He hurried about the deck to see that all was in
                     order for the chase, and then he came aft and used his glass again.
                  The ship had been seen when daylight first fairly broke, and she was not now
                     more than four miles distant. The wind was nearly east. The ship was dead to
                     leeward of the brig, and standing across the line of the latter's course.
                  "Let us have the stun'-sails on, Bronkon," said the captain. "By heavens, that
                     follow sails low!"
                  The studding-sails were set both sides, and the starboard clue of the mainsail
                     set. The brig was now dead before the wind, but ere long she was put three
                     points to the southward, and her starboard studding sails taken in. It was soon
                     evident that she was gaining upon the ship.
                  "There goes her stun'-sails," uttered Bronkon. "She smells danger."
                  "Don't wonder," said Dunham. "Rather guess they know what we mean."
                  "Waffon," said Pettrell, "got up grog enough for all hands. "Let 'em have a
                     strong pull."
                  "That's the talk," added Dunham, with a satisfied chuckle. "Noth'n' like rum to
                     make men tight. It makes 'em savage like."
                  After the expression of this weighty opinion, Dunham took the glass and
                     examined the ship, and ere long the grog-tub was brought upon deck.
                  "Help yourselves, my men," said Pettrell; "only be careful and don't get enough
                     to lay you by the scuppers."
                  Alfred now felt that his hour of trial had come, but he nerved himself for the
                     contest, and he felt strong in his resolution.
                  "Wont you have a dip at the tub!" asked Pettrell.
                  "No," returned our hero.
                  "You'd better," urged the pirate captain, while a demon sparkled in his
                     eye.
                  "I don't wish for it, sir."
                  "It will do you good."
                  "I do not wish for it."
                  "It will make you fight better."
                  "All my fighting can be done without it."
                  "Then you wont fight, oh?"
                  "I cannot tell yet."
                  "But if there is need of it?"
                  "Let the need come, and I shall not be behind."
                  "But look ye, master Alfred, beware that you don't set yourself up as judge of
                     that need. I'll tell you when the need comes."
                  "Better fight," said Bronkon.
                  "Of course he will," added Pettrell. "I don't believe he wants to swing quite
                     yet!"
                  "Alfred, you can fight, and you must," said Bronkon, in a low tone, after the
                     captain had turned away.
                  "You know my resolution," calmly returned our hero.
                  "O, bah! Stuff! Gammon! It's all nonsense to throw your life away. Don't for
                     God's sake, be a fool!"
                  Alfred was startled by the strange manner of Bronkon. He gazed into the dark
                     mate's features, but he could only see the same hard, cold expression that
                     generally rested there.
                  "Don't be a fool!" repeated Bronkon, and with this he turned away.
                  Two hours had passed since the chase began, and the brig was within a quarter
                     of a mile of the ship. Upon the quarter-deck of the latter, quite a body of
                     people were collected, and many of them were passengers—some females.
                  "I don't think there'll be much resistance," said Dunham, as he stopped and
                     watched the movements of Bronkon, who was looking through the glass.
                  "I don't know," returned the latter, still gazing through the instrument "I can
                     see the glitter of arms, and the captain is certainly mustering his passengers.
                     Yes, there are cutlasses and pistols. By the jumping cokey, we shall have work
                     yet."
                  "Never mind, if we get enough to pay us," said Dunham. "Can't expect to always
                     win without losing a cast. Them passengers wont be much."
                  "Fire a gun, Waffon," ordered Pettrell. "We'll see if she'll lay to."
                  The gun was fired, but the ship still stood on.
                  "Give 'em a shot, Waffon, and see if that'll fetch 'em," cried the captain, who
                     was growing more excited, as he saw the rich prize so near to his grasp. "In
                     with a double-header, Waffon, and give it to her among her rigging"
                  The shot was fired, but without effect.
                  "You want practice," said Dunham. "Let me try a hand."
                  A bow gun was levelled—Dunham took sight and fired, and on the next instant a
                     cloud of splinters was seen flying about the ship's quarter-deck.
                  "If that don't stop 'em," uttered Pettrell, "I'll luff and give 'em a
                     broadside."
                  There was no need of the pirate's threat being carried into execution, however,
                     for the ship braced her fore and mizzen yards up, and came to the wind with her
                     maintopsail aback.
                  "They're ready to show fight," exclaimed Bronkon, "Her crew are armed with
                     pikes, and the passengers have cutlasses. The women have gone below."
                  "We're a match for 'cm," returned Pettrell. "Stand by, my men. We'll luff and
                     run afoul of her weather quarter. Let every man have his cutlass in his right
                     hand, and a pistol in his left, and spring for her bulwarks the moment we
                     touch. Catch your cutlasses in your teeth if you want a hand to help you over
                     her side. Here, Alfred, if you are afraid of powder, take the wheel—you can do
                     well there" The youth did not move.
                  "Take the wheel, I say!" cried Pettrell.
                  "Not to help you in reaching that ship," firmly returned Alfred.
                  "What! Do you refuse? Take the wheel, I say."
                  "Never."
                  "By your life, youngster, if you don't take that wheel, you'll rue it."
                  "I shall not take it, air, nor shall I move a finger towards furthering your
                     designs upon that ship."
                  "Alfred," hissed the pirate captain, with fearful emphasis,
                        "if—you—don't—take—that—wheel—YOU—SHALL—SWING!".
                  Alfred trebled, and a pallor stole over his countenance, but he moved not.
                  "Take it!" said Bronkon.
                  "No," resolutely returned the youth; and as he spoke he folded his arms across
                     his breast.
                  Pettrell foamed with rage, and with a demoniac growl he sprang upon the young
                     man and bore him to the deck.
                  "Come, come, Marrok," cried Bronkon, "we've got other fish to fry now. Let the
                     man keep the wheel that's got it. Here we are. Death and destruction! Spring to
                     the braces! in the lee braces quick! Down with it! Come, come, Marrok, be
                     captain if you are going to!"
                  Marrok Pettrell sprang to his feet, and he saw how much need there was of his
                     attention to the affairs of his vessel, for she was already within half a dozen
                     fathoms of the ship. He was still mad with rage, and it was some time before he
                     could command himself; but the necessity for action soon called him to his
                     senses.
                  The brig had luffed so as to fall afoul of the ship, and when she touched, the
                     men poured up the Indiaman's side, with Bronkon and Pettrell at their head.
                     They received the fire of the merchantman's crew with but little damage, and
                     having knocked the pikes aside, they leaped upon the deck.
                  The struggle was of short duration, and in less than ten minutes from the time
                     of the pirates boarding, they were masters of the ship. No violence was offered
                     after the crew had surrendered, save a few revengeful passes among the heated
                     seamen. Four of the ship's men were killed, and quite a number wounded. The
                     pirate lost five men, three having been shot in boarding.
                  Alfred Harrold remained the sole occupant of the brig, and more than once the
                     thought occurred to him of cutting the grapplings and letting the ship drop
                     off, and of then letting the brig run with himself alone on board; but the plan
                     was impracticable, and he dropped it. He saw the conflict, and he saw a tiny
                     stream of blood starting from one of the Indiaman's scuppers; and he thanked
                     God that he was not there. But then came the thought of the pirate chieftain's
                     threat, and with a shudder his eye rested upon the fore-yard-arm.
                  "Let it come," he murmured to himself. "God will not forsake me, even though
                     they kill this poor body. They cannot harm the soul."
                  Alfred heard the ship's crew cry for quarters, and in a few moments more
                     Bronkon and half a dozen men returned to the brig's deck and removed the
                     hatches. Shortly afterwards a whip was rove upon the merchantman's
                     main-yard-arm, and another upon the mainstay, and then the pirates began to
                     hoist out such articles of value as they took a fancy for. Three boxes of money
                     were found beneath the floor of the ship's cabin, and much jewelry was taken
                     from the passengers.
                  In two hours after the ship had surrendered, the pirates returned to their own
                     vessel, and she was allowed to proceed on her way.
                  "That's better than buying a cargo," said Pettrell, as the hatches were cloud
                     over the valuables.
                  "Fact," said Bronkon.
                  "You have bought these things of One who will take a terrible pay!" uttered
                     Alfred Harold.
                  None heard him save Bronkon. The dark man gazed into the youth's face, and a
                     change came over his features.
                  "That's all stuff!" he said, with an effort to look the contempt he spoke, but
                     which was unsuccessful
                  "'Tis fearfully bought!" said Alfred. The mate heard him, and then turned
                     away.
                  Ere long the brig was clear, and with flowing sheets she went dashing off
                     towards the Cape of Good Hope.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XII.
                  THE YARD-ARM!
                  THE afternoon bad passed half away when every thing was arranged for the
                     examination and stowing away of the plunder. Pettrell was walking the
                     quarter-dock with quick, nervous strides, and his fists were clutched together
                     till the finger nails almost penetrated the flesh. The men regarded him in
                     silence, and an ominous stillness reigned throughout the brig.
                  Bronkon was standing by the binnacle, and upon his face the darkness had grown
                     more deep than ever. He raised his eyes ever and anon from the compass, and
                     cast a glance upon the captain; and once he looked upon Alfred. His features
                     looked more terrible than did those of Pettrell.
                  Alfred Harrold stood by the starboard quarter rail, and though he felt assured
                     that he was soon to be brought to an account with Pettrell, yet he was calm and
                     collected, and no one could know from his outward appearance, that he had
                     anything to fear.
                  "Waffon," said the captain, stopping in his walk, and speaking through his
                     clenched teeth, "see that the starboard fore-clew-garnet and buntlines are
                     manned. I want the lee clew of the sail hauled up, sir."
                  Again Pettrell paced the deck, and without a word of answer or comment his
                     order was obeyed.
                  "Dunham," he said, as soon as the lee claw of the foresail was up, "send some
                     of the foretopmen aloft, and have a tail-block made fast to the lee
                     fore-yard-arm. Then have a whip rove, air, with both ends inboard."
                  This order was obeyed in silence, and the men anxiously awaited the further
                     movements of their chieftain.
                  "Make a slip-noose in the outer end of that whip, sir, and rig a snatch-block
                     for the running end, and reeve it."
                  All hands knew well enough the nature of the captain's intentions, and various
                     were the expressions upon the faces of the crew.
                  "Now, sir," uttered Pettrell, as he turned towards Alfred, "your hour has come.
                     I told you you should swing if you refused to do your duty. You had fair
                     warning—you've had warnings enough—and yet you choose to disobey. Now, sir, I
                     will keep my word. If you have prayers to say, say them!"
                  The young man's features grew paler as the pirate captain thus addressed him,
                     and there was a tremor upon his lips. The presence of the death-sentence, and
                     the sight of the apparatus for carrying it into execution, had more effect than
                     our here had thought. There was something terrible in such a death; and then,
                     too, to die among such people, with no sympathy, no love, no regret; to fall
                     where a mourner's tear could never drop to his memory, and where no requiem
                     could sound over his grave save the howl of the storm wind and the tempest. The
                     poor youth had not the fortitude he had counted upon. He could have laid down
                     calmly upon the bed of death had God called him home, but all about him now was
                     so horrible be shrank away in fear.
                  "Come," said Pettrell, "I am waiting for you. This is a death of your own
                     choosing. You have been warned of it times enough."
                  "Warned of it!" exclaimed Alfred, clasping his hands in agony. "How have I been
                     warned of it?"
                  "How! In every way. But a few hours ago I told you you should swing if you did
                     not take that wheel. In the presence of my whole crew you boldly trampled upon
                     my authority. How have I warned you. You know very well how I have warned you.
                     Come, say your prayers, for I suppose one so religious as you must have prayers
                     to say!"
                  "Marrok Pettrell, I do not believe you mean to hang me I cannot believe you
                     will be so heartlessly cruel."
                  A bitter sneer broke over the pirate's face, and he pointed
                     to where the whip was rove at the yard-arm.
                  "That—rope—is—for—you!" he uttered, in distinctly separate and
                     emphasized parts. "All the powers of heaven and earth should not make it
                     otherwise. Now rig yourself for it. All here know it's your
                     own choice."
                  "O. Pettrell, do not add base falsehood to your brutal cruelly!" exclaimed
                     Alfred. "Do not tell these men a lie. You dragged me on board this brig—you
                     robbed me of home, of friends, of happiness, and of peace; and you have tried
                     to rob me of honor. You have trampled upon me in your strength, because I was
                     weak. I would not give you my soul's purest jewel—its sacred virtue—and hence
                     you would murder me. I call on all here to witness that I have ever done my
                     duty, as an honest seaman, well and faithfully. These men know that I have over
                     been—"
                  "Silence!" thundered Pettrell, for he saw that the youth's words were making an
                     impression upon the crew.
                  "No, no, Marrok Pettrell. If I am to die you shall not manacle my tongue. What
                     I have said is true. You have stripped my life of all that made it valuable on
                     earth, and because you could not tear from it all that would be valuable in
                     heaven, you would kill me. I speak the troth in this, and I call on God to bear
                     me witness that you have longed, ay, prayed for a pretext for my murder! Now
                     you have it."
                  "Now you've said enough."
                  "Perhaps I have."
                  "And according to your belief," ironically added Pettrell, "you are much fitter
                     for heaven than for earth—so I shall do you a service."
                  In an instant the expression upon Alfred Harrold's face was changed. The
                     fear-marks passed. away, and all was calm again.
                  "I can commend myself to the care of God without fear," he
                     uttered.
                  "Then come!"
                  Pettrell moved forward as he spoke; and Alfred followed him.
                  "Now, air, your time is up," the pirate captain said.
                  "Very well. But before I die let me—"
                  "Silence! Not another word. Your tongue has wagged enough. Here!"
                  As Pettrell spoke, he took the noose from the breech of one of the guns, and
                     threw it over Alfred's bead.
                  At that moment Mark Bronkon started up from the spot where he had been leaning
                     by the binnacle, and came forward. He trembled from bead to foot, and a strange
                     expression was upon his countenance.
                  "Marrok," he said, "let this thing be stopped I Take that rope from his
                     neck!"
                  
                  "S'death! What do you mean, Mark?" uttered Pettrell, in astonishment.
                  "I mean that the young man shall not die!"
                  "Are you crazy?"
                  "No, I'm in sober earnest."
                  "Then stand back; for, by my salvation, the fellow shall die! Man the whip!
                        Man the whip, I say!"
                  Not a soul moved to obey the order.
                  "Man the whip, and run the mutineer up!" shouted the pirate captain, foaming
                     with rage.
                  "No, no, Marrok Pettrell," said Bronkon, in a deep, calm tone. "Not a man shall
                     touch that rope. The youngster saved my life once, and now I'll save his. What
                     he has said is true."
                  "By heavens, Mark, you had better beware!" uttered Pettrell, turning towards
                     his mate
                  Bronkon smiled.
                  "Don't speak too much," he said, in a deep whisper. "You know me, Marrok, too
                     well for that."
                  "Man the whip!"
                  Not a man moved, and on the next instant Pettrell drew a pistol, but Bronkon
                     knocked it from his hand.
                  The attention of the crew was now turned from the doomed youth to the
                     dark-faced mate. The men trembled as they saw the rage of their chieftain, but
                     a sort of awe stole over them when they saw the stout form of Bronkon towering
                     in its strength. One of them slipped the rope from Alfred's neck, but Pettrell
                     saw it not.
                  "Marrok," said the mate, as he knocked the pistol down, "let this thing stop
                     where it is. I have said that Alfred shall not die. You know me well enough to
                     think no more of the dead."
                  "Mark, that boy is mine!"
                  "—oh! Say no more!"
                  "But he is mine."
                  "Not to kill."
                  "Blood and destruction, Mark, what do you mean? Stand back and let this thing
                     go on. Ha! who took off the rope? Put it on again. Put it on, I say. The first
                     man that disobeys me shall die!"
                  "O, fool!" muttered Bronkon, as he laid his hand upon Pettrell's shoulder.
                     "Come aft a moment, for I would speak a word in your car."
                  The mate half dragged the captain to the quarterdeck, and there they remained
                     in earnest conversation for several minutes. At length Bronkon came
                     forward.
                  "Hark ye, my men," he said. "The captain will abide by your decision. Shall the
                     young man die?"
                  Nearly all the crow spoke as one man, and a thundering "No!" broke upon the
                     air.
                  Mark Bronkon laid his hand upon Alfred's shoulder, and led him towards the
                     quarter-deck.
                  "Alfred," he said, "you've been a fool; but I owed you one, and I
                     have paid it. We are square now. For the future, you must look out for
                     yourself."
                  "O, God will bless you for this!" ejaculated the youth.
                  "Will he?"
                  "Yes, yes. And I will bless you so long as I live."
                  Bronkon turned away without further remark, and shortly afterwards Alfred
                     sought the cabin. He sank upon his knees as soon as he found himself alone, and
                     offered up to God his soul's whole prayer. A foot upon the ladder aroused him.
                     It was Marrok Pettrell.
                  "Alfred," said the captain, as he sank into a seat almost exhausted by the
                     effects of the rage he had held in his bosom, "this has been done to please
                     Mark Bronkon. You saved bin once, and he has now saved you; but, as sure as
                     there is a God in heaven, there shall be no second respite. Cross me but once
                     again, and your death is as sure as though you hung by the neck from the
                     yard-arm."
                  Alfred made no reply. He buried his face in his hands, and for a long time he
                     was lost to everything save the scene just passed.

               CURIOUS RELICS OF OLD EGYPT.
               The one important feature to a stranger is the Museum of Antiquities, recently
                  founded by the Pasha, in a commodious house overlooking the Nile. It has been
                  placed under the curatorship of M. Mariette, who first visited Egypt in the
                  service of Louvre. The largest portion of the collection was purchased at once
                  from M. Huber, the late Consul-General for Austria, who had been long engaged in
                  forming it, with a fastidious taste that admitted into the series none but fine
                  examples. It is consequently a remarkably excellent introduction to the arts
                  practiced by the ancient Egyptians; and to the future studies of such as ascend
                  the river to become familiar with the astounding works of that great people. It
                  may suffice to say, that nothing, from a scarabæus to a granite sarcophagus, is
                  wanting, to carry the student through the various phases fine art assumed three
                  thousand years ago. The great feature of the collection is the recent addition of
                  gold ornaments discovered by accident at Gournou (Thebes), by some boys, in ground
                  unmarked by any tomb; the fine mummies upon which they were placed passed into the
                  hands of the Pasha of Kench, who was induced to part with them to the viceroy's
                  museum. They were unwrapped, and more than twenty-five pounds weight of gold
                  ornaments found upon them. The series of necklaces, with figures of jackals in
                  gold, and the golden bracelets, enriched by enamel colors, are extraordinary works
                  of art, as well as of great intrinsic value; one of them is very remarkable,
                  having the sacred hawk for its central ornament, holding the emblem of eternal
                  life; its surface is brilliantly colored in cloisonne enamels. A batches of gold, with a hunting-scene embossed
                  on the blade; a mirror, with a heavy lotus-shaped handle of gold; and a large
                  variety of minor decorations for the person, crowd this unrivalled case of
                  antiquities. Two small models of funeral boats, with the rowers, all formed of
                  silver, are even more precious in the eyes of the Egyptian student, from their
                  extreme rarity. The room is appropriately decorated, after the style of the tombs
                  at Beni Hassan, and the whole arrangement honorable to the viceroy and his
                  curator; as he is still prosecuting new researches, and has prohibited wanton
                  mischief to monuments, or the exportation of antiquities, it promises a useful
                  guardianship in future over these interesting remains.
            
            
               A GOOD CUP OF TEA.
               Soyer, the famous cook, in his work describes how good tea ought to be made: "I
                  had a large kettle made, holding eight quarts, and put a coffee filter to it. I
                  then placed the rations of tea for about twenty men in the filter, poured in the
                  boiling water, and, to my astonishment, made about one-fourth more tea, perfectly
                  clear, and without the least sediment. Four of these kettles made tea enough for
                  all the hospital; and this at once induced me to order some upon a smaller scale
                  for the various wards, where at night it is often of the greatest importance that
                  tea should be prepared quickly, in large quantities. I cannot too strongly
                  recommend it to large families, institutions, and other establishments, for its
                  economy of time, and a saving of 25 per cent, upon the quantity of tea required. I
                  tried it in Miss Nightingale's room at Scutari, before several persons; and the
                  Rev. Mr. Blackwood, the chaplain, persuaded me to bring them out for the benefit
                  of the poorer classes, as much for its cleanliness as for its economy."

               A country paper, speaking of a person who is lecturing in order to get means to
                  obtain an education, a contemporary says there are other professional lecturers
                  who should devote the proceeds of their lectures to a similar purpose.
               A little four-year old the other day non-plussed its mother ay making the

               At a Friends' Sunday School in New York, a bright-looking little fellow was asked,
                  "What is conscience?" He answered Very properly, "An inward monitor." And, "What
                  is a monitor?" "O, one of the ironclads."
               Make yourself agreeable, as much as possible, to all; for there is no person so

                  enemy.

                  gold dust, upon the hair after drying the same quite to "friz and frowzy." The
                  effect is "sparky," and that is precisely what is wanted.
               A young lady three years old, being told by her mother to pick up her
                  handkerchief, said: "Indeed I wont! just do it yourself!" "Mollie," said her
                  mother, "who are you talking to?" "I was making believe you was Aunty Brown,"
                  replied our little miss.
               It is good to have one's practical sense of the world's nothingness refreshed and
                  stirred up anew by the sight of a deathbed.
               If the farmers who have facilities would save money and make money this spring,
                  they will tap every maple tree, and make all the sugar they can. Common sugar is
                  now worth 12 to 14 cents per pound, and may advance to 20 cents.

               A female correspondent suggests a condition on which she will give us a kiss. We
                  feel in duty bound to say to her, that kissing is a thing that, at every
                  opportunity, we set our face against.
               Delightful Mary Ino says the first time she was kissed, she felt like a vase of
                  roses swimming in honey and eau de cologne. She
                  also felt as if something was running through her nerves on feet of diamonds,
                  escorted by several little cupids in chariots drawn by angels, shaded by
                  honeysuckles, and the whole spread with melted rainbows.
               A gentleman the other evening objected to playing cards with a lady, because, he
                  said, she had such a "winning way" about her.
               A rich merchant named Hogg; once requested a person to bring him a load of corn in
                  a stated time, which he failed to do, and did not take it until the next day after
                  that which he had promised. The merchant, as might be expected, refused it.
                  "Well," replied the wagoner, "you are the first hog I ever knew to
                  refuse corn."

               THE DEAD.
               BY G. H. C.
               
                  The stars that disappear at morn,
                  O, think not they are fled;
                  They are not lost, they are not gone,
                  But, mid the glory shed
                  Around them by the source of light,
                  They shine more sweetly than at night:
                  It is the night that's dead.
               
               
                  And thus the loved who disappear,
                  Pass not, perchance, away;
                  But walk in light so sweet and clear,
                  It blinds us with its ray:
                  On this, to us, benighted clod,
                  The glory of Almighty God
                  Embosoms them in day.
               
               
                  Perchance they follow, fair as dreams,
                  The rosy morning's flight,
                  More immaterial than his beams,
                  And lighter than his light:
                  They sit upon the azure day,
                  They float on twilight's downy gray,
                  And on the clouds at night.
               
               
                  O deep and wondrous heart of man,
                  Strange fount of joy and woe;
                  In this sad life no eye may scan
                  Thy current's ebb and flow:
                  But in the glorious world to come,
                  The voice of discord shall be dumb,
                  And thou thyself shalt know.
               
            
            
               AN AFFAIR OF HONOR.
               BY M. R. B.
               ON a beautiful evening in the autumn of 1842, seven persons, including myself,
                  were gaily conversing in front of the country-house of Senor Arguellas, situated
                  about a mile from Santiago de Cuba, in the eastern part of the island, and
                  formerly its capital, when an incident suddenly occurred which had on our noisy
                  gaiety about the same effect as if a bombshell had burst in our midst. But first
                  let me say a few words about the seven persons and the circumstances which had
                  thus brought them together.
               There were first, three American merchants, gentlemen from the South, who had many
                  business relations with the Antilles, and proposed to set sail the next day, the
                  weather permitting (as the saying is), for Morant Bay, Jamaica, in the ship
                  Neptune, Captain Stearns; a lieutenant of artillery in the Spanish army, nephew of
                  our host; a M. Dupont, a young and rich Creole, born of French and Spanish
                  parents, and the reputed aspirant to the hand of Dona Antonia, the daughter and
                  sole heiress of Senor Arguellas, a charming beauty of eighteen, an age quite
                  matured in that precocious climate; then Captain Stearns of the
                  , an Englishman of about thirty, of a  gentlemanly aspect;
                  lastly myself, at that time quite a young man, and scarcely recovered from a
                  severe illness, which a year before had compelled me to pass over from Jamaica to
                  the more even and temperate climate of Cuba, although there is only a difference
                  of five degrees between the two islands. I likewise was one of Captain Stearns's
                  passengers, as well as Senor Arguellas, who had some business to wind up in
                  Kingston, and intended taking with him Senora Antonia, the young lieutenant, and
                  M. Dupont. The Neptune had brought to Cuba a mixed cargo, of cutlery, cotton
                  clothes, etc. etc., and was to return with a half cargo of various articles. Among
                  the rest was a number of barrels of powder, belonging to the American merchants,
                  which had been found unsaleable in Cuba, and for which they hoped to find a better
                  market in Jamaica. There were excellent cabins on board the Neptune, and as the
                  weather was fine, and we hoped for a passage as short as agreeable, we were all,
                  as I have said, in fine spirits, enjoying the best Havana cigars, conversing on
                  the politics of Cuba, America and Europe, and earnestly arguing about the
                  qualities of French and Spanish wines.
               It was a superb evening, and a gentle breeze which had just sprung up, came to us
                  laden with the perfume of a thousand tropical plants. Nearly all of us had drank
                  deeply, perhaps rather too much. We did not begin to speak French, which every one
                  understood tolerably well, until Senora Arguellas and her daughter withdrew. Senor
                  Arguellas, as I should have before stated, was still detained in the city by some
                  business matters which he wished to complete before embarking for Jamaica.
               "Do not go away, I beg of you, until I have seen you," said Senora Arguellas,
                  rising from her seat, and addressing Captain Stearns. "When you are at leisure.
                  ring the bell and a servant will inform me of it. I want to converse with you
                  about the arrangements of our cabin."
               The captain bowed. Never as it seemed to me had Antonia smiled more graciously
                  than as the Indies left us. I do not exactly remember the cause or circumstance of
                  the change, but after some minutes every one felt that the conversation was taking
                  a disagreeable turn. I thought that M. Dupont was but ill-pleased at the gracious
                  expression of Antonia as she addressed the captain, but the bad temper which shone
                  forth later did not appear to have arisen from that cause. The captain of the
                  Neptune had agreed to transport several free negro families to Jamaica, where
                  laborers who were skilled in the culture of the sugar cane were engaged at higher
                  wages than they could obtain in Cuba.
               The Americans had already found fault with this arrangement, but their
                  disapprobation was expressed in joking the captain about his "black sympathizers,"
                  as they called this very moderate justification of his conduct. This, however,
                  would have passed off without causing any unpleasant scene, had not the captain
                  very imprudently ventured to declare that he formerly served as midshipman in the
                  English squadron fitted out to crush the slave-trade.
               I understood from the confused expressions of M. Dupont that his interests had
                  suffered from the surveillance of this squadron. There arose a conflict of
                  passionate words. The one attacking with bitter scorn the motives of the English
                  for their intervention in the slave trade, and the other replying with more
                  animation than ill humor. In short, in the midst of this dispute in which both
                  heated by wine scarcely knew what they did or said, M. Dupont applied a
                  disgraceful epithet to the queen of England, and the captain threw a glass of wine
                  in his face. Both arose at the same time, having apparently recovered their
                  sang-froid from this unfortunate incident. The captain was the first to speak.
               "I beg your pardon, Monsieur Dupont," said he, with a certain embarrassment; "I
                  was sorry, very sorry to have acted thus, though my conduct is not
                  inexcusable."
               "Pardon! Thousand thunders!" cried, his adversary, trembling with rage, and wiping
                  his face with his handkerchief. "Pardon! Yes—a ball through your head will grant
                  you pardon!"
               And in point of fact, in accordance with the ideas then dominant in Cuban society,
                  a duel was the only possible denouement. Lieutenant Arguellas hastened into the
                  house and brought forth a case of pistols.
               "Let us meet," said he, earnestly, in a low tone, "in the neighboring wood."
               At this moment Mr. Desmond, the eldest of the Americans, advanced toward the
                  captain who had recovered his equanimity, and was standing by the table with
                  folded arms.
               "My dear sir," said he, "I am not quite a stranger to affairs of this sort, and if
                  I can be of any use to you, I—"
               "Thanks, Mr. Desmond," replied the captain; "I have no need of your services.
                  Lieutenant Arguellas, you can remain here. I am no duellist, and I will not light
                  with M. Dupont."
               "What does he say?" cried the lieutenant, looking wildly around him; "not
                  fight!"
               I then perceived the Anglo-Saxon blood at this apparent proof of cowardice in a
                  man of their race, boiling as hotly in the veins of the Americans as in my
                  own.
               "Not fight, Captain Stearns!" said Mr. Desmond, with a grave, impressive air,
                  after a moment's silence; "you, whose name is inscribed in the royal navy of
                  England! You must he joking?"
               "I am perfectly sincere. I am from principle opposed to duelling."
               "A coward from principle!" cried Dupont, in a tone of irony and rage, at the same
                  time shaking his fist at the Englishman.
               This shameful epithet produced the effect of a serpent's sting. The black eyes of
                  the captain blazed forth; he took one step toward Dupont, but of a sudden was
                  again master of himself.
               "Well" said he, "I will even hear that. I was wrong to use violence towards you,
                  although your impertinence certainly merited a lesson. Moreover, I repeat to you
                  that I will not fight with you."
               "But you shall give my friend satisfaction," cried Lieutenant Arguellas who was as
                  much excited as Dupont; "otherwise I swear to you I will denounce you everywhere
                  as a coward, not only throughout this Island but at Jamaica!"
               To this threat, Captain Stearns made no reply, but coolly rang the bell and told
                  the slave to announce to Senora Arguellas that he was on the point of departure,
                  and awaited her orders.
               "This brave Englishman is going to shelter himself under the petticoats of your
                  aunt, Alphonse!" cried Dupont, with most insulting irony.
               "I almost question whether Mr. Stearns is an Englishman," said Mr. Desmond, who,
                  as well as his two friends, began to be greatly excited; "but at any rate, as my
                  father and mother were born and lived in England, if you wish to insinuate
                  that—"
               Senora Arguellas entered at this moment, and the American with difficulty retained
                  his anger. The lady seemed greatly astonished at the altered looks of those whom
                  she had left so recently; however, at the request of the captain, she entered the
                  house and left the other visitors to themselves.
               Ton minutes later, we learned that Captain Stearns had left the house, after
                  having announced to Senora Arguellas that the Nep- tune would get under way the next morning at
                  precisely nine o'clock! At this news words of rage and anger blazed forth anew,
                  and for the time being a duel seemed inevitable between
                  Lieutenant Arguellas and Mr. Desmond, who seemed determined to break some one's
                  head, to sustain the honor of the English name. However, this did not take place,
                  and the company separated in disorder and full of bitter feelings.
               The next day at the appointed hour we were all on board. The captain received us
                  with cold politeness, and I observed that the angry looks of Dupont and the
                  lieutenant did not seem to disturb him in the least. The averted looks and air of
                  disdain of Dona Antonia as she passed to her cabin with Senora
                  Arguellas, the care with which she drew her mantilla still closer about her, as if
                  she feared contamination from contact with a coward, made a marked impression upon
                  him; but his features were not slow to recover their former calmness and serenity.
                  However, we soon found that there was a limit to this patience. Dupont approached
                  him and shouted in a lone loud enough to be heard by several of the sailors:
               "Coward!"
               Then turning on his heel was about to withdraw, when he felt himself held back by
                  a hand of iron.
               "Listen, monsieur," said the captain, "personally I despise anything that you can
                  say; but I am captain, and ruler on this ship, and will allow no one to insult me
                  before my crew and enfeeble my authority. Try this on again, and I will put you at
                  the bottom of the hold, perhaps in irons until we arrive at Jamaica."
               Thus speaking, he thrust his astonished auditor violently from him, and went
                  forward. All the passengers, white and colored, were on board, the anchor was
                  weighed, the sails set, and in a few moments the ship was ploughing the waves.
               A few hours sufficed to show that although the captain might lack courage to fight
                  a duel, he was nevertheless a thorough seaman, and the crew, composed of a dozen
                  resolute tars, were in perfect discipline. Every duty on board the ship, was
                  performed with as much regularity and precision as on a man-of-war, and every one
                  perceived that in case of a storm, or any species of danger, they could rely with
                  entire confidence on the experience and firmness of Captain Stearns. The weather,
                  luckily, continued flue; but the wind was light and changeable, so that several
                  days after the blue mountains of Jamaica were in sight the distance had not been
                  sensibly diminished. At length a strong breeze sprang up from the northwest, and
                  we crept up to Point Morant. We doubled the cape and entered the bay about two
                  o'clock in the morning. The voyage might now be considered as
                     ded, and the passengers looked forward with lively
                  satisfaction to the pleasure of disembarking and escaping the monotony of life
                  aboard ship. There was an extremely disagreeable constraint about every man's
                  deportment. The captain presided at table with freezing politeness, and the
                  conversation, if it merited that name, was in monosyllables. All, therefore, were
                  delighted to take their last dinner on board the Neptune.
               When we doubled Point Morant, all the passengers were in bed except myself and
                  Captain Stearns, who had gone below to his cabin, and was busy examining his
                  papers. As for me, I was too much agitated to think of sleeping, and so continued
                  to walk the deck with Hawkins, the first lieutenant, whose watch it was, eagerly
                  watching the lights on the well known shore which I had left a year before, with
                  very slight hope of over seeing again. As I looked, suddenly a brilliant flash lit
                  up the surrounding darkness, and quickly turning round I perceived a jot of flame
                  issuing from the main hatchway, which for some reason or other had been left
                  partially open. In the weak state I was still in, the fright caused by the flame
                  (for I instantly thought of the barrels of powder), almost paralyzed me for the
                  moment, and I should have fallen to the deck, had I not instinctively grasped the
                  shrouds. The cry of "Fire! Fire!" the most fearful sound one can hear at sea,
                  resounded through the ship. In spite of my agitation I could perceive in the midst
                  of the confusion and disorder that at once arose, the imposing figure of the
                  captain towering up amidst the frightened sailors who had sprung on deck, and who,
                  commanding silence in his powerful voice, had ordered the hatchway to be closed.
                  This order being promptly executed, he darted down the forward hatch. The two or
                  three minutes of his absence seemed a century to us, who were all so fully
                  persuaded that our safety depended on his judgment and firmness, that not a look
                  or word was exchanged till his return. At length he re-appeared singed by the
                  fire, and dragging after him what seemed to be a corpse. He threw his burden on
                  the deck, and darting to where Hawkins stood, said to him in a low tone:
               "Hasten below, wake up the passengers, and bring me my pistols from the cabin.
                  Quick! quick! the loss of a moment may imperil our lives."
               Then turning to the sailors, he added, in a rapid, firm tone of voice:
               "You know that I never deceive you under any circumstances, or for any motive.
                  This brute whom you see here, the servant of Lieutenant Arguellas, has set fire
                  with his candle to the rum which he has stolen; the entire hold is on fire, and it
                  would be a loss of precious time to attempt to extinguish it."
               With a cry of rage and fright, the crew rushed to the ship's boats, but stopped at
                  the sharp, decided tone of the captain.
               "Back, not a step further! Hear me. If there be the least disorder or
                  precipitation we are all lost! But with courage and resolution perhaps all on
                  board may be saved before the fire reaches the powder. And remember," he added,
                  receiving his pistols from Lieutenant Hawkins, and cocking them, "that I'll send a
                  ball through the first man who dares to disobey me, and that all my shots tell.
                  Come, now! To work resolutely and with energy!"
               It was a superb spectacle to see the influence exercised over the men by the
                  imposing words and attitude of the captain. The panic which had seized them seemed
                  to give place to firm resolution, and in a very few seconds the ship's launch and
                  the long and the jolly boats were in the water.
               "Well done! bravo! We have lots of time before us! Let four of you remain here
                  with me" (and he told off their names), "three others leap into each of the boats,
                  two into the barge, and pull them around to the shore side. The least
                  precipitation will upset the boats, and we can only guard one gangway."
               However, the passengers were rushing on deck, half-clothed, and in an ecstacy of
                  terror, for every one knew that there was a large quantity of powder on board.
                  Scarcely had the boats reached the ship's side, when the men, both white and
                  black, rushed before the women and children, apparently not giving a thought to
                  those whom they would sacrifice, so eager were they to escape from the volcano
                  which roared beneath their feet. But the captain, assisted by the four stout
                  sailors, whom he had selected for the purpose, pushed them roughly back.
               "Back! Back!" cried be, in a voice of thunder. "We must follow the order of a
                  funeral here; first the women and children, then the aged. Give a hand there to
                  Senora Arguellas, then to Dona Antonia, her daughter!"
               As the young girl, more dead than alive, was on the point of descending, a jet of
                  flame burst forth from the main hatchway with the noise of an explosion. The
                  passengers uttered a cry of terror and made a rush to reach the gangway. Dupont
                  dashed between the sailors with the violence of a madman, and struck against
                  Antonia with such force that had it not been for the captain's exertions and great
                  strength, she would have been precipitated over the side.
               "Back, wretch! Back, coward!" cried the captain, carried away by the imminent
                  danger of the young girl. And seizing him by the collar:
               "Look there," said he, and pointing with the butt of his pistol, he showed him
                  several white sharks, distinctly visible by the red light a little distance from
                  the ship. "There!" cried he, "throw the first one into the sea that tries to pass
                  before his turn."
               "Ay, ay, captain," replied the men together.
               This terrible threat at once restored order, and they lowered the women and
                  children into the boat.
               "Away with her!" shouted the captain. "She can carry no men with safety."
               A smothered groan was heard and understood.
               "Stop an instant," continued he, "let Senor Arguellas descend. All right, away
                  with you, quick!"
               The second boat was filled with equal rapidity. The three Americans, and the
                  blacks with one exception, descended.
               "You have a noble heart," said Mr. Desmond, seizing the captain's hand; "and I was
                  a fool to—"
               "Pass on," said the captain, "this is no time for compliments."
               The order to put forth had just been given, when the captain's glance happened to
                  fall on me, who, silent from fear, stood behind him leaning against the
                  shrouds.
               "One moment," cried he, "here is a young man whose weight cannot make much
                  difference to you."
               And he gently let me down into the boat, saying in a low tone, "Gustave, remember
                  me to your father and mother, if I do not see them again."
               There was but one boat left, which could not hold more than eight persons, and we
                  anxiously asked each other, how, beside the two sailors who were already in it, it
                  could contain Lieutenant Arguellas, M. Dupont, a colored man, four sailors and the
                  captain. All, however, promptly descended except the last named.
               "Can you carry another?" asked he, in a voice as firm as heretofore. But I
                  observed that his face, though full of resolution, was deadly pale.
               "Since it is you, we are perfectly willing, but we are very heavily laden, and
                  this is a dangerous neighborhood."
               "Wait a moment—I cannot leave the ship while there is a soul on board."
               He hastened forward and returned with the almost inanimate body of the
                  lieutenant's servant, which he lowered into the boat. Then hearing a dull roar
                  close at hand, he throw the painter into the boat, crying:
               "Now away, and save yourselves!"
               The men leaned to their oars, and the boat shot away. The captain, now that all
                  except himself were in safety, began to look attentively in the direction of the
                  shore, shading his eyes with his hand; presently he hailed the first boat:
               "They must have seen us sometime ago, and the pilot boats ought to be on the way,
                  though I don't see them yet. If you meet one tell them to hasten, and there may
                  yet be a chance for me."
               All this scene of anxiety and terror, which it has taken me so long to describe
                  thus imperfectly, from my own recollections and those of others, did not last, as
                  I was afterwards assured by Mr. Desmond, more than eight minutes from the
                  embarkation of Senora Arguellas to the departure of the last boat.
               Never shall I forget the spectacle which the ship presented wrapped in flames, the
                  only object visible except ourselves, on that dark night, on the ocean's surface,
                  and when we had left that heroic man, who, after saying us all by his courage and
                  presence of mind, had condemned himself to an inevitable death! We had scarcely
                  gone two hundred yards, when the flames had entirely covered the deck, and mounted
                  the rigging and some of the sails, marking out in lines of fire the body of the
                  ship, with the masts and yards. The captain, in order not to lose the chance of
                  which he had spoken, had retired to the extremity of the bowsprit, after having
                  let go the jib and foresail, and there found a temporary refuge from the flames;
                  but to what purpose, if it was but to prolong the agonies of the death which
                  threatened him?
               The boats glided on in profound silence, interrupted only by the regular dip of
                  the oars, whilst more than one gaze narrowly scanned the shore with lively
                  anxiety, in hope of at length discovering the pilot on whom so much depended. At
                  length, a distant hail almost stopped the beatings of my heart; the sailors
                  answered back, and a boat gilded out of the dense obscurity, closely followed by
                  another.
               "What ship is that?" cried a man who stood in the bow of the first boat.
               "The Neptune, and that is Captain Stearns on her bowsprit!" I instantly sprang up
                  and shouted at the top of my voice. "A hundred pounds to the first boat that
                  reaches the ship!"
               "That's the voice and figure of young Latour," cried the pilot. "On! on! Hurrah
                  for the reward!"
               And the boats darted on with the same eagerness, without hesitating at the
                  inevitable danger of the enterprise. A moment later another boat came up, but
                  after asking a few questions, and learning the state of affairs, pulled up and
                  took part of the passengers on board. Our own boats had almost sunk to the water's
                  edge with their heavy loads, and the smallest one was in imminent danger of
                  swamping. What agonies of suspense we suffered at that time; I can scarcely think
                  of it even now without shuddering. I closed my eyes, and with beating heart
                  awaited the explosion which would end all. And it came, at least so it seemed to
                  me, and I sprang to my feet. But my brain, enfeebled by recent sickness and
                  fright, had taken for the catastrophe, the joyous shouts of the harbor boats.
                  There was no one on the bowsprit of the Neptune, nothing but a rope hanging from
                  the end. The two pilots, doubtless fearing the danger, had immediately withdrawn
                  from the burning ship. However our cries ceased not to encourage them. Suddenly a
                  vast sheet of, flame burst from the hold, and then a horrible explosion re-echoed
                  through the air. I fell, or was overthrown, I don't know how, and the boat was
                  tossed about as if suddenly drawn into a violent eddy; then came the hissing and
                  noise of numerous bodies darted from a great height into the sea; then to this
                  blinding flash and fearful report succeeded profound silence, and darkness so
                  dense that one could scarcely recognize his neighbor. This silence was broken by
                  shouts from one of the pilot boats. We recognized the voice, and our lively
                  exclamations showed the brave captain how rejoiced we were at his preservation.
                  Half an hour later we joyously disembarked; and as the ship and cargo were fully
                  insured, the only result of a disaster that had so imperilled our lives, was a
                  tolerably heavy loss to the insurance companies.
               A silver service was presented to Captain Stearns at a public dinner given in his
                  honor at Kingston. In the speech of thanks which he made on that occasion, the
                  captain explained his motive for so obstinately refusing to fight a duel with M.
                  Dupont, of which the papers had published various accounts.
               "Left an orphan at an early age," said he, "I was brought up with extreme
                  tenderness by a maternal aunt, Mrs. C—," (and he cited a well known name.) "Her
                  husband had fallen in a duel in the second month of his marriage. My aunt
                  continued to bear her great sorrow till I reached my nineteenth year; her grief
                  made such a vivid impression on me that I conceived an extreme distaste and horror
                  for the barbarous usage which had caused it, so that it needed not the solemn
                  promise which she exacted from me on her death-bed, to make me resolve never under
                  any circumstances, to accept a challenge. As for what I did at the unlucky burning
                  of the Neptune, recalled by my friend Mr. Desmond with so much praise, I simply
                  fulfilled my duty—he and I belong to a class of sailors who consider it the
                  captain's most sacred duty to be the last one to leave or abandon his ship.
                  Moreover, I should have been the greatest of cowards to display any weakness in
                  the presence of—of—that is to say under the circumstances which—in fact—that
                  is—"
               Here the captain blushed and stammered unaccountably. Evidently he was no orator.
                  I don't know whether his embarrassment was caused by the peculiar expression with
                  which Senor Arguellas regarded him, or by the glance he had given at the gallery,
                  where he observed the calm gravity of Senora Arguellas, and the blushes of Dona
                  Antonia; at any rate be continued to stammer painfully, though the company kept
                  applauding to give him time to recover himself. After a few unintelligible
                  sentences he sat down, covered with embarrassment, but in the midst of strenuous
                  applause and general good humor.
               I have but a few words more to add. Captain Stearns has been long since settled in
                  Havana, and Dona Antonia has become Mrs. Stearns. Three young Stearnses have
                  already made their debut to my certain
                  knowledge, and the captain is in a flourishing business. I don't know what became
                  of Dupont, and in point of fact, have not the slightest curiosity. Lieutenant
                  Arguellas attained the rank of major, at least I suppose he must be the major
                  whose name I see mentioned in the papers, as slightly wounded in the expedition of
                  the fillibuster Lopez.
               "And you, Monsieur Narrator," asks one of my readers, "How are you?"

               THE FOOL'S REPROOF.
               There was a certain nobleman, says Bishop Hall, who kept a fool, to whom he one
                  day gave a staff, with a charge to keep it until he should meet with one who is a
                  greater fool than himself. Not many years after, the nobleman fell sick, even unto
                  death. The fool came to see him; his sick lord said to him:
               "I must shortly leave you."
               "And whither art thou going?" said the fool.
               "Into another world," replied his lordship.
               "Amt when will you come again? within a month?"
               "No."
               "Within a year?"
               "No."
               "When then?"
               "Never."
               "Never!" said the fool; "and what provision hast thou made for thy
                  entertainment there, whither thou goest?"
               "None at all!"
               "No," said the fool, "none at all! Here, take my staff, for with all my folly, I
                  am not guilty of such folly as this."
            
            
               THE DEATH OF MARTYRS.
               Bishop Hooper endured fire for three-quarters of an hour, and died with perfect
                  calmness. His legs were charred, and his body scorched, before he was fully
                  surrounded by the fire, which was blown aside by the wind, and the pile was twice
                  refed before he expired, Ridley's lower extremities were burnt before his body was
                  singed, and he struggled in his agony. But bodily pain, when excessive, sometimes
                  ends in positive pleasure. A youth named Theodosius was so exquisitely tortured
                  for the religion that he nearly died. When asked how he could endure such torment,
                  he replied, "At first I felt some pain, but afterwards there stood by me a
                  beautiful young man, who wiped away my sweat, and so refreshed me with cold water
                  that I was delighted, and grieved only at being let down from the
                     engine."—The Leisure Hour.
               
            
            
               MUTUAL FORBEARANCE.
               The house will he kept in a turmoil where there is no toleration of each other's
                  errors. If you lay a single stick of wood on the grate, and apply fire to it, it
                  will go out: put on another stick, and they will burn; and a half dozen sticks,
                  and you will have a blaze. If one member of the family gets into a passion, and is
                  let alone, he will cool down, and may possibly be ashamed and repent. But oppose
                  temper to temper, pile on the fuel, draw in others of the group, and let one harsh
                  answer be followed by another, and there will be a blaze that will entrap them
                  all.

               THE LATE COL. SAMUEL JAQUES.
               The portrait on this page brings back to our memory the frank, manly face of the
                  late Colonel Jaques, corrugated with age, it is true, but always wearing a fine,
                  healthy color, and his erect, soldierly bearing. Colonel Jaques was in his
                  eighty-third year at the time of his death, but his old age was so vigorous and
                  elastic that his friends confidently anticipated that his life would be prolonged
                  for many a year to come. Indeed his death, which occurred on the 27th of March,
                  1859, was not the result of old age, but of bodily injuries received nearly a year
                  before that time, when he was thrown from his carriage. Few men were better known
                  or better liked among us than the subject of our sketch, and when his death was
                  announced, every one left depressed at the thought that another old landmark was
                  gone. Colonel Jaques was a connecting link between the past and present—the
                  revolutionary era and the period of national development. Intimately identified
                  with the agricultural interest, particularly in the department of stock-breeding,
                  his favorite speciality, he was probably known by reputation to every
                  well-educated farmer in the United States, while his estate, the Ten Hills Farm,
                  at Somerville, on the Medford Turnpike, was classic ground. It was here, by the
                  way, that the first Massachusetts vessel, the "Blessing of the Bay," was built and
                  launched, a portion of the "ways" being still in existence. Colonel Jaques was
                  born at Wilmington, Middlesex county, September 12th, 1776, and came of good old
                  colonial stock. His paternal ancestor, Henry Jaques, emigrated from England, and
                  settled at Newburyport in 1640. His mother belonged to the noted Thompson family,
                  of Woburn, in this State, and his uncle, Daniel Thompson, was one of the patriots
                  killed in the battle of Lexington. His earliest occupation was farming, but he
                  afterwards engaged in mercantile pursuits, and in the prime of life, married, and
                  the father of a large and fine family, found himself the possessor of a liberal
                  fortune. Losing his property by circumstances beyond his control, the liberality
                  of friends enabled him to start anew, as the manager of the large stock-farm, the
                  greater portion of which ultimately came into his possession, so that he finally
                  died in easy circumstances. In the palmy days of his earlier fortune, he was
                  distinguished for his ardent love for field-sports, particularly fox-hunting, and
                  he was in all his glory when, splendidly mounted, he took the field, "with hound
                  and horn," like the Percy, and pursued his game over a country which would daunt
                  the boldest Meltonian who ever bestrode the pigskin. His
                  favorite horse was a tremendous jumper, and the colonel was one of the best and
                  boldest riders we ever knew. Colonel Jaques enjoyed but slender advantages of
                  school education; but he was a profound and original thinker, and a close observer
                  of men and things. His correspondence was extensive, on many subjects.

                  CHAPTER XIII.
                  THE FATAL SHOT.
                  THE brig fell in with no more merchantmen until after she
                     had doubled the cape, and it was the intention of Pettrell to proceed directly
                     to England. Alfred's heart leaped with now hope as he heard this, and he
                     resolved that if he could once more get clear of the vessel, he would not he
                     brought back alive. He prayed that the pirates might not attempt to make
                     another prize, but he knew they would it opportunity were to be afforded. His
                     treatment by the captain had been cold and formal, and as harsh as
                     circumstances would allow. Bronkon scarcely seemed to notice him, and when duty
                     required that the mate should address him, it was always done in a low,
                     growling tone. To our hero the character of Mark Bronkon presented a problem
                     which he could not solve.
                  Time passed on. Summer had gone, and autumn had commenced. The pirate brig had
                     passed the Cape de Verds without any event to stir the men from the dull
                     monotony of sea-life, and they began to speak of hunting up a prize. Some
                     proposed steering to the westward and lying in wait for some American Indiaman;
                     but Pettrell decided to stand on for old England.
                  One bright day, while the Peak of Teneriffe was in sight upon the starboard
                     how, a sail was reported upon the opposite bow. In a moment all was excitement
                     upon the pirate's deck, and Pettrell seized his glass. It wanted an hour of
                     noon, and the wind was fresh from the westward.
                  In half an hour the strange sail was made out to be a ship, and in another half
                     hour she was "hull up," going before the wind, and evidently bound into some of
                     the Canary ports. It was evident that she could be cut off before she could
                     cross the brig's fore foot, and to this end the helm of the latter was put up a
                     spoke.
                  The pirate's guns were shotted, her arm chests opened, and as soon as the small
                     arms were all distributed a gun was fired for the ship to heave-to The ship
                     kept on, and ran up the American flag at her peak.
                  "We'll give 'em our flag," said Pettrell; and in a few moments more a sable
                     field fluttered out from the brig's peak. The flag was black as night, with no
                     relief or device of any kind.
                  As soon as the flag was shown, another gun was fired, and ere long the ship
                     came to the wind on the starboard tack, and hove to The pirate was now within a
                     cable's length of the American, and she made her arrangements to round to under
                     the ship's lee quarter. The mon were stationed by the rigging ready for a leap,
                     save such as were needed at the braces, and at length the pirate's yards were
                     braced up, her helm put hard down, and she came boldly around under the high
                     quarter-rail of her intended victim.
                  Alfred had taken a cutlass and pistols, but he had determined not to use them
                     save in defence of his own life.
                  "Ha! What's that?" cried Pettrell.
                  All eyes were turned to the side of the ship just in season to see two heavy
                     guns showing their wide-mouthed muzzles through port-holes that had not before
                     been noticed, the ports having been removed but an instant before the guns were
                     run out.
                  The pirates discovered their error too late, for while they were huddled
                     together ready for a leap the ship's guns belched forth a load of iron hail
                        that made terrific work among them. Wild and 
                     were the cries and curses that rang out upon the air, and
                     before the pirates had recovered from their shock their brig had fallen off
                     more than two cables' lengths.
                  Pettrell ran his eyes over the deck, and found that eight of his men were
                     dead.
                  "Spring to the larboard braces!" he shouted "Haul there in smartly. Port the
                     helm. We'll board that fellow, if we do it at the cast of half our blood! Work
                     quick!"
                  The men worked quickly enough, but the brig did not work. She was
                     all aback when she begin to drift off, and as her yards came up on the
                     starboard tack with her helm a port, she just came into the wind and there she
                     stuck. Pettrell stamped and swore, and
                     by the time he had got his sails full again, the ship had
                        filled away, and as she came off to her course she
                     brought the Brig directly under her larboard beam.
                  "Good Heavens! there comes her guns again!" exclaimed Waffon.
                  And Waffon spoke truly, for on the next instant a twenty four pound ball came
                     crashing through the brig's mainmast, while a load of grape was rained upon her
                     deck.
                  Mark Bronkon uttered a low groan of pain, and pressing his hand upon his side
                     he sank back upon the trunk of the cabin companion way. Alfred sprang to his
                     side and raised him up.
                  At that instant the heavy mainmast went over the side with a thundering crash,
                     snapping the shrouds off just above the dead-eyes, while the ship stood freely
                     off out of harm's way.
                  "Are you hart?" asked Alfred, as he bore the mate up.
                  "Ah—is that you? Yes—yes. Something struck me here. I feel faint. Help me
                     below."
                  The mate pressed his hand hard upon his left side as he spoke, and the youth
                     could see that the blood was trickling out from between the large fingers With
                     a heavy step Bronkon sought his way towards the companion way, and leaning
                     nearly the whole of his weight upon Alfred, he gained his berth.
                  "There," he murmured, "leave me now, and go on deck. You may be wanted. Send
                     Waffon down as soon as he can be spared. Don't stop.—I'm well enough now.
                     But—but—you may send Waffon down now."
                  Alfred could see that Bronkon was enduring severe pain, and having handed the
                     suffering man a can of water, he hastened on deck after Waffon.
                  "Aha! what's in the wind now?" cried Pettrell, as he met Alfred upon the
                     quarter deck.
                  "I've carried Bronkon below, sir. He's very badly wounded, I fear."
                  "The Lord save us! I thought you had been caulking. Poor Bronkon! Well, well, I
                     hope it wont prove fatal. Curse the ship! Go hunt up Waffon, sir, and send him
                     down."
                  Waffon was found at work clearing away the wreck made by the fall of the
                     mainmast, and as soon as he heard of Bronkon's accident, he hastened away to
                     attend to his wants, requesting Alfred to accompany and assist him.
                  The wounded mate was laid upon the cabin table, and upon removing his clothing,
                     it was found that some kind of shot had entered the second and third false
                     ribs, having broken the third rib. The flesh was considerably lacerated, and a
                     large quantity of blood had escaped. Waffon probed the wound, and so in his
                     wire touched the shot.
                  "What is it, Waffon?" asked Bronkon. "Will it finish me?"
                  "I can't tell yet. Can you stand it to have the shot taken out?"
                  "Yes—anything."
                  Waffon produced a pair of long-billed forceps, wreck after much exertion he
                     drew forth the missile, but it cost the patient a sharp cry of pain. It proved
                     to be half of a copper deck-bolt.
                  "Good gracious!" uttered Bronkon, as he saw the missile; "what a savage thing
                     for a Christian to fire."
                  "'Tis an awkward thing," added Waffon, as he clapped a napkin to the wound to
                     stop the increased flow of blood.
                  "Tell me the truth," urged the suffering man. "Will this finish me?"
                  "Upon my soul, I cannot tell," returned Waffon.
                  "But what do you think?"
                  "The chances are against you."
                  "I thought so."
                  Bronkon's eye rested upon Alfred as he spoke, and a sudden
                     spark lit up its dark depths. He seemed to start with some sudden emotion, and
                     still he gazed into the youth's face. The spark that had burned in his eye
                     gradually spread its light over the whole face, and a breaking smile seemed to
                     play for an instant about his mouth. It was a calm, quiet smile—very different
                     from that which was to break so bitterly about those curling lips
                  "You handle me as though I was a sick baby," he said, at length, his eyes still
                     fixed upon the young man.
                  "I handle you carefully, for I know you must be in pain," returned Alfred.
                  "It's been many, many years since I have felt a tender hand before. One so
                     rough as me don't need it."
                  "You'll need all the care you can get now," said Waffon, as he pinned together
                     the last bandage, and helped Bronkon into his berth.
                  "You shall not suffer for the want of it while I am able to care for you,"
                     added Alfred.
                  "I shall live a few days," he murmured.
                  "O, yes," assented Waffon.
                  "Then I am satisfied. Yet 'tis hard to die so—to be hurried off to the other
                     world with such a soul as mine! My God! why was I cast upon such a fate?"
                  There was something in the tone of the suffering man that touched Alfred to the
                     soul. There was a depth of feeling that betrayed a heart that had been crushed.
                     Long after Waffon had gone on deck, did Alfred stand by the mate's side and
                     hold his weakening hand.
                  "Did he not say I should live three days?"
                  "He said a few days."
                  "Yes. That will do; but I shall never see Old. England again. Alfred, you may
                     be wanted on deck."
                  "But you may want something."
                  "No, not at present. Go on deck now. I shall live a few days; but before I die,
                     I shall have something for you."
                  "For me?"
                  "—sh! Breathe not a word to another ear. Yes, for you. Who is that?"
                  Alfred turned his head and saw the captain.
                  "Ah, Mark, I'm sorry to see you laid out in this fashion," said Pettrell, as he
                     came up.
                  "It's fate, Marrok, fate! I may be as well laid out here as anywhere. The world
                     wont suffer at my loss."
                  Pettrell turned towards Alfred and motioned for him to leave the cabin. Our
                     here obeyed the silent order, and as he reached the deck he stopped a moment by
                     the truck, and he thought he heard Pettrell pronounce his name in an earnest,
                     anxious tone. He stopped to listen. He could hear the hum of voices, and could
                     hear that the subject of conversation was exciting to those engaged in it, but
                     he caught no clue to its purport.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XIV.
                  THE DYING PIRATE'S REVELATION.
                  THE mainmast was secured alongside, and as soon as it was made safe, attention
                     was turned to the burying of the dead. Twelve of the brig's crew had been
                     killed, and three more, including Bronkon, had been seriously wounded. The
                     services of interment were very brief, and only a few moments elapsed from the
                     time of preparation till the ocean's bosom closed over the corses. There were
                     no prayers, no funeral rites—only the bodies were sewed up in white hammocks
                     and consigned to the grave of waters.
                  As soon as this had been done the men went to work again upon the floating
                     mainmast. The rigging was got off and taken inboard—the top-gallant and
                     topmasts were got over, and then the lower mast was taken in, which was done by
                     means of sheers formed of spare spars. The lower mast was got in its place and
                     very strongly fished and wedged, and before night on the following day, the
                     brig was once more in sailing order, though much care was necessary that too
                     much strain did not come upon the mainmast.
                  Pettrell was cross and crabbed, and he swore more than ever. For half an hour
                     at a time he would pace the deck, speaking to no one, and hardly answering such
                     questions as were put to him. The recent defeat had not only worried him, but
                     he seemed moved by some other cause. The name of the wounded mate was often
                     upon his lips, and at such times he would stop suddenly in his nervous walk and
                     clasp his hands together.
                  It was the third day after the fatal conflict with the American. Bronkon was
                     worse, and Waffon had given him but a short time longer to live. Evening had
                     set in and passed, and the first watch had been mustered. It was Pettrell's
                     watch, but at the earnest request of the mate, Alfred was allowed to remain
                     below.
                  Shortly after eight o'clock, Dunham came down and turned in, and ere long he
                     slept soundly, for it was the first chance he had had since the battle."
                  "Alfred," said Bronkon, as he worked himself heavily over upon his side, "I am
                     dying. I feel the icy hand upon my vitals."
                  "I hope you may die happy," returned the youth.
                  "Ah, that is a vain wish."
                  "Perhaps not. Heaven is not shut to him who sincerely repents."
                  "God knows I can repent!" uttered the dying pirate, with earnestness; "but O,
                     Heaven cannot blot out the memory of the past If there is a hell, Alfred, it
                     must be imaged in the memory of the dying sinner. But my weakness is making me
                     childish. The grim ghost of old death almost frightens me."
                  "Bronkon," said the youth, reaching forth and taking one of the man's hands in
                     his own, "you are not lost to every good feeling. You have still a soul, and if
                     I am not widely in error, your early life has been poisoned by
                     disappointment."
                  "S'death! who told thee that?" uttered Bronkon, raising his head quickly from
                     his pillow.
                  "No one but yourself. I have not failed to see that you have often crashed back
                     good feelings that were rising in your bosom for utterance. I have seen the
                     dark frown upon your brow grow darker when I knew that it cost you an effort to
                     make it so."
                  Bronkon's head settled back upon his pillow.
                  "You may be right," he said. But enough of that. I have called for you to-night
                     to tell the story of my life, and when it is told you will not wonder that I
                     have looked upon you with strangely conflicting feelings. Are we safe from
                     other ears?"
                  "Yes," returned Alfred.
                  "Then bend your head nearer. There. You will not breathe a word of what I may
                     tell you to a soul on board this brig."
                  "No," said the youth, in a trembling tone.
                  Bronkon closed his eyes, and for a moment he writhed beneath the effects of the
                     pain that worked along his nerves and muscles.
                  "Alfred," he said at length, in a low, trembling tone, "I have been at times
                     most wicked, and most wretched; but I have suffered enough—suffered when no man
                     knew it. I was not always wicked. My young days were all joyous and happy, and
                     plenty was mine. At an early age I saw a girl whom I loved. She was as
                     beautiful as heaven itself, and I loved her as a man may never love but once. I
                     thought she returned my love, for she bore me company and seemed to enjoy my
                     society. I was lost—utterly lost—in the heaven of my own love, and I dreamed
                     not that a cloud could shut out my happy vision. But that cloud came. Another
                     —a wealthier suitor—one of higher rank—came, and my idol turned from me. I
                     begged, I implored—on my bended knees I besought the beloved girl to have
                     compassion upon me; but I found too late that she did not love me as I had
                     thought. She married my rival. O, what a sea of fire rolled over my heart
                     then!"
                  Bronkon clasped his hands upon his bosom and groaned. It was pain that moved
                     him, but it was bitter memory that made him weak enough to groan.
                  "You may never know such keen torture as I then suffered," resumed the pirate.
                     "It made me reckless and careless of life. But it was an unlucky hour for my
                     soul when I fell in with Marrok Pettrell. A strange bond of sympathy found its
                     way to our mutual knowledge, and we went forward upon the path of revenge
                     together. The man who had stolen away— No, no, I will not say that. It was not
                     his fault that he loved her, for he knew nothing of me. But the man who had won
                     my love for his bride, had received the sworn enmity of Pettrell, and he only
                     sought for revenge. We had revenge full and dreadful! O, God forgive me! That
                     was the most wicked act of all my life"
                  The speaker stopped and raised his hand to his brow.
                  "Alfred," he whispered, "you are the child of the woman I so wildly
                        loved! —ah! She sleeps now, and I shall see her in heaven.
                        Heaven? O, if I should never reach it!"
                  "Great God! and was my mother—"
                  "—ah! I know what you would ask. She died soon after she gave you birth. Hers
                     was a death that no mortal hand could have stayed. She sleeps beneath a marble
                     stone in St Margaret's yard at Westminster. There are marks of my tears upon
                     that stone!"
                  "Mark Bronkon, tell me of my father," uttered Alfred.
                  "I will give you more than you ask—more than you would even dare to hope for;
                     but I dare not have you know the whole story while you are with Pettrell.
                     Alfred, I'm growing weak. There's drink in that cup."
                  The youth handed the cup to the dying man, and he placed it to his lips.
                  "Now reach your hand beneath my mattress," said Bronkon, as the cup was set
                     back upon the table, "and you will feel a package. Give it to me."
                  The youth did as directed, and he drew forth a package of papers. They felt
                     like papers, but they were folded carefully in a piece of oiled silk, and tied
                     with a strong string. Bronkon took it.
                  "See if any one is near us," he said.
                  Alfred walked carefully to the foot of the ladder; but he found that no one was
                     overhearing, and he returned to the pirate's side.
                  "In this package," said Bronkon, "there is all concerning your father that you
                     could wish to ask. Marrok Pettrell thinks these papers were burned long ago,
                     but I burned a blank package in their stead, and these I have kept; for,
                     strange as it may appear, I have long repented the deed I helped to consummate.
                     When I stood last upon the spot where the mortal remains of her I loved were
                     laid, I lost all my revenge; my heart softened in its bitterness, and I thought
                     of doing justice to her son. When I give you this package, I shall have done
                     all that lies in my power. I cannot restore to you all that you have been
                     robbed of. Your father long since passed away from earth, and he left behind
                     him a son upon whose head rests the stigma of disgrace; but here is that which
                     will clear your name from dishonor. If I will give it to you, will you promise
                     me that you will not open it while you are on board this brig?"
                  "If that be your request."
                  "It is my request; and you cannot have it otherwise. I will trust your
                     honor."
                  "I pledge myself to obey you. But O, tell me something of my father!".
                  "I can only tell you this: I saw his cold form given to the same grave that
                     will ere long receive mine. I saw him buried, and I saw the blue waters close
                     over him.' There—ask me no more. Pass me the drink again—I am faint."
                  Bronkon took the can, but he had not the strength to hold it, and Alfred
                     supported it to his lips.
                  "I do not taste it. It slips over my tongue without its usual flavor. Put it
                     back. Raise my pillow, Alfred."
                  The youth raised the dying man's head, and he saw that those dark eyes were
                     fast losing their lustre.
                  "Put those papers in your bosom," feebly whispered the pirate. "Let not
                     Pettrell see them as you value your life. Ah, what's that?"
                  "I hear nothing," returned Alfred, bonding nearer to the dying man.
                  "But I did. I heard the howl of the tempest. There! Was not that a see that
                     broke over us? O, God, what a dreadful cry was that! Some one is drowning.
                     Alfred, hear the roar of the surge—and hear that wild cry again!"
                  Alfred could hear nothing save the dull rippling of the waves against the
                     vessel's run, and the rattling of the cordage upon deck.
                  "Remember," whispered Bronkon, "open not those papers till you are clear of
                     Marrok Pettrell, Hark! Who spoke to me then?"
                  "No one spoke," said Alfred.
                  "Yes—yes—I heard her voice!"
                  The pirate raised himself upon his elbow, and gazed fixedly into the face of
                     the youth beside him, but his arm weakened, and he sank back again.
                  "Do you feel much pain?" asked Alfred.
                  There was no reply.
                  "Can I do anything more for you?"
                  There was a slight motion of the head from side to side, but no other
                     answer.
                  Alfred reached forth and took the hand of the fallen man, but it was cold. He
                     sprang to his feet and leaned over, but he heard no breath. The rays of the
                     hanging lamp fell upon the pirate's face, but they revealed features that had
                     no expression. For a few moments he stood there and gazed into those dark
                     features, and then he started from the strange thoughts that were crowding upon
                     him, and laid his hand upon the storm beaten brow of the pirate, and whispered
                     a simple prayer. Then Alfred drew the blankets smoothly over the motionless
                     form, and having felt in his bosom to see that the package was safe, he hurried
                     on deck to tell the captain that Mark Bronkon was dead!
               
               
                  CHAPTER XV.
                  THE STORM-AVENGER.
                  ALFRED stood by and saw the corse of the pirate mate consigned to the ocean,
                     and as he turned away from the scene, his soul was the seat of strange
                     emotions. He was soon aroused from his reverie by the weight of a hand upon his
                     shoulder, and upon turning, he met the gaze of Pettrell.
                  "What sort of a story did Mark Bronkon tell ye, before he died?" asked the
                     pirate captain, in a low tone of voice.
                  "Nothing," quickly returned Alfred; for he hesitated not an instant at the
                     thought of deceiving the base wretch who was seeking his ruin.
                  "Something! He told you something," said Pettrell, while he sought
                     to read the very thought-marks upon the youth's face.
                  "So he did. He told me of his suffering, and of his approaching death."
                  "Don't attempt to deceive me. He told you more than that. Just tell me what has
                     given your face that strange look of anxious concern since last night! What has
                     made you cast such searching, meaning glances at me? By heavens, there's
                     something in the wind! Now out with it."
                  "I will tell you what I have thought, Marrok Pettrell. I have thought of the
                     fearful price you have paid for the cargo you now bare on board, seventeen
                     human souls!"
                  "Ah!"
                  "Yes. And I have thought, too, that those souls are but the first instalment
                     upon a still more fearful retribution."
                  "Stuff!"
                  "No, no, Pettrell, you cannot so easily hide the truth from your soul. Let me
                     tell you one other thing that has held a place in my thoughts."
                  "Silence!"
                  "Let me speak but this: I have thought that you dared not look far
                     into the future. You may dwell as you please upon the past, and ravel
                     recklessly in the wild passions of your present career, but you cannot, without
                     trembling, look forward to that which is to come. Do I not speak the
                     truth?"
                  "No. You lie!" gasped the pirate captain.
                  "Then my thoughts, since the death of Mark Bronkon, have only reached to a
                     lie," calmly, but emphatically, returned Alfred.
                  "Now you lie again! Mark Bronkon blabbed something to you; but little good will
                     it do you."
                  Marrok Pettrell was in a rage when he turned away. How much he might have
                     suspected Alfred could not judge, but the young man felt that his secret was
                     safe, and he had no fear that the evil man could wrest it from him.
                  It was evident that the ardor of the crew had been dampened by the late
                     catastrophe, and in the loss of the mare they felt that they had lost their
                     best man. Yet they were ripe for evil as over, and they stood ready to retrieve
                     their fortunes by any means that might present itself.
                  On the fifth day after the death of Bronkon, a sail was reported to the
                     southward, nearly in the pirate's wake; but Pettrell had no thought of turning
                     from his course. At night the sail was lost to sight, and on the following
                     morning it was not to be seen. Several times during the three succeeding days,
                     the same sail, or one precisely similar, was seen in the same direction.
                  On the morning of the tenth day, when the light of the rising sun beamed over
                     the waters, the strange ship was made out astern, and her heavy courses could
                     be seen. Waffon was sent aloft with the glass, and at the end of five minutes
                     he came back again, his face pale with excitement.
                  "It's a sloop-of-war!" he said, as he reached the quarter-deck.
                  Marrok Pettrell started forward and caught the glass, and then sprang up the
                     main-rigging.
                  "It's a sloop of-war!" he uttered, when he returned to the deck.
                  "Then she must have been lying in Teneriffe when that American ship went in,"
                     said Dunham.
                  "Yes, and she is now after us," added Pettrell.
                  The men gathered aft with anxious faces, for they had heard the report, and
                     they seemed to be aware of the danger of their
                     situation.
                  "If she has seen us," said Waffon, "there is no such thing as running away from
                     her."
                  "By the great heavens, we must run away!" uttered Pettrell. "The coast of Old
                     England will be in sight in a few hours at least; and if nothing else can save
                     us we must take our money and make the best landing we can. The mainmast must
                     stand her full soils. Get up the larboard-stun'-sails, sir,
                     and have them set"
                  Waffon urged that the mast would not bear it, but he was overruled, and the
                     sails were set The wind was fresh from the southward and
                     westward, and as the mainmast felt the force of the new
                     power, it bent and creaked under the load.
                  "She'll never bear it," uttered Waffon.
                  
                  "She must bear it," was Pettrell's laconic reply, as he levelled his glass upon
                     the ship. "By my soul, we can hold our own with her now. If we can but stand on
                     clear of her guns till night we are safe."
                  "Land he!" came at this moment from the fore-topmast cross-trees.
                  "Where away!" cried the captain, starting forward.
                  "Three points on the lee bow," replied the man aloft.
                  "The Scilly Islands," said Pettrell. "Foretop, there! Can you make out a
                     beacon?"
                  "Think I can."
                  "That's St. Agnes. By heavens, Waffon, we shall pass the islands by noon, and
                     before night we shall be well up on the Cornwall coast. We'll give that war-dog
                     the slip yet."
                  The crew were somewhat re-assured by the manner of the captain, and they
                     cheerfully turned their whole energies to the working of the brig. It was soon
                     evident that the sloop-of-war was not gaining—or at least not enough to be
                     perceptible. She still maintained about the same distance. The heads of her
                     courses were in sight, and from the tops a heavy swell would ever and anon give
                     a view of her bulwarks.
                  Early in the afternoon the Scilly Islands had been left upon the starboard
                     quarter, and then the brig's head was put towards the coast of Cornwall. At
                     length the intervening islands shut the pursuing ship from sight, and the
                     pirates began to count confidently upon their safety. Pettrell decided, after
                     some consultation with Waffon and Dunham, to run for Barnstaple Bay, and make
                     the mouth of the river Taw, if possible.
                  At three o'clock the log wire thrown, and the brig was going ten knots
                     strong.
                  "At this rate," said Pettrell," we shall reach the bay by midnight. It is only
                     about ninety-five miles. It will be nearly dark by the time
                     the ship can see us again. Cheer up, cheer up for we are safe yet."
                  "But this wind aint a goin' to hold on so," said Waffon "We'll have a change
                     when the sun goes down."
                  "Then let it come," returned the captain. "We can stand it."
                  "Perhaps we can," murmured Waffon, half to himself, as he cast his eyes off
                     towards the west ward, where a low, dark cloud-bank tested upon the ocean. He
                     did not speak all that he felt, for he would not give unnecessary alarm to the
                     men; but he knew all the weather signs of those seas, and he
                        saw an ominous one in the cloud bank that arrested
                        his attention.
                  Just before sundown the ship was made out again astern, but the attention of
                     the crew was soon iled from her by the lulling of the
                     breeze.
                  "Look off there, cap'n," said Waffon, pointing at the west.
                     "What does that look like?"
                  "It looks bad," said Pettrell, with a slight shrug.
                  Where the cloud-bank had lain, the horizon was turning to
                     that color of bluish blackness which is more sable in its
                     look than the clear sable, and  away off, as far as the eye could
                     reach, little caps of white could be seen upon the wave-tops.
                  "We shall have it strong, sir," said Waffon.
                  "I believe you."
                  "A regular September gale."
                  "Yes," returned Pettrell. "But we must get the canvass off from our mainmast.
                     By my soul, this is unlucky. Only six hours longer, and we night have been
                     clear."
                  All baste was made to get the sail in, and soon the brig lay under close-reefed
                     topsails and a storm staysail. By dark the gale was up in all its fury, and at
                     length it was found necessary to bring the brig to the wind. In performing this
                     evolution the lee fore-topsail sheet parted, and the sail was almost instantly
                     snapped into ribbons.
                  "By heavens!" cried Pettrell, as he stood and saw the fore-topsail snapping in
                     the wind, "if the main—"
                  His exclamation was cut short by the brig's being brought dead into the wind.
                     Of course the main-topsail was taken aback. The vessel heaved and pitched, and
                     just as Pettrell had given orders to case off the main-topsail sheet and clue
                     up the sail, the heavy mainmast snapped its fishing, carried away its loading
                     stays, and fell with a thundering, resistless crash over the stern.
                  For some time all hands were paralyzed with terror. Two men who were at the
                     wheel were killed, and several more bruised. The mainmast was gone, and the
                     fore-topsail was too fur gone for use. The foresail could be of no use, for the
                     brig could not lay to under it, as the heavy sea would keep the wind from
                     it.
                  "How far are we from the shore?" asked Dunham.
                  "Not over twelve miles," returned Pettrell.
                  "With a prospect of being nearer very fast," added Waffon.
                  "We must put the foresail on," said Dunham, "and try to lay along. "That's the
                     only thing we can now do."
                  Pettrell agreed with this proposition, and after the brig's bead had been got
                     off, the lee clue of the foresail was set; but it would not keep the wind, and
                     in a few moments the ill fated vessel was knocked off into the trough of the
                     sea. Again and again did the despairing crew try to bring the brig to the wind,
                     but all to no purpose.
                  "It's no use!" uttered the captain, as for the last time she refused to come
                     up. "She must go as she will."
                  "Then we are lost!" broke from the lips of a dozen men.
                  "Only a miracle can save us," returned the captain, as he caught the rail for
                     support.
                  "This may be the sum of the payment!" uttered Alfred.
                  Marrok Pettrell heard the remark, but he returned no answer.
                  The sea was now breaking fearfully over the brig All thoughts' of making
                     further efforts to save her had been relinquished, and the men were clinging to
                     the racks and pins in utter despair. Alfred Harrold alone, of that whole crow,
                     looked upon the scene with calmness. There may have been a pallor upon his
                     face, a slight tremulousness in his nether lip, but he was not frightened. He
                     looked forward to the coming crash that must wreck the brig as far more
                     preferable than longer servitude with wickedness; and in his soul he could
                     calmly say that death would not strike terror there.
                  Thus passed a long hours.
                  "Hark!" fell in startling accents from the lips of one of the men.
                  "The coast!" uttered Waffon.
                  "Lost, lost!" groaned Pettrell.
                  Above the roar of the wind, and the lashing of the sea over the sides of the
                     pirate brig, could be heard the thundering of the distant surge, and some of
                     the men, to whom such a thought had not occurred before for years, sank down
                     upon their knees and uttered the name of their God in prayer! But they prayed
                     too late! The hand of the avenger was upon them, and their hour of reckoning
                     had come.
                  On dashed the brig, and louder grew the thunder of the surge. There was a
                     grating of the brig's keel, and a shock. Then on again she dashed. Another
                     grating, and another shock—another space of short moments, and then came the
                     shock that fell with the death touch. The brig was hurled upon her side, and
                     the mad sea tumbled wildly over her. Alfred felt the last trembling of the
                     timbers beneath his feet, and his right hand was pressed upon his heart. He
                     raised his eyes, and through the darkness he could see a mountain of water just
                     towering above him. On it came. It broke—a wild cry sounded in his cars—his
                     hold was broken, and with a single thought of heaven and his God, he was hurled
                     away into the boiling, hissing surge beyond!
               
               
                  CHAPTER XVI.
                  FORE-SHADOWINGS.
                  ALFRED HARROLD came to himself, and found that the sun was shining down upon
                     him. It was some time ere he could command strength enough to raise himself
                     upon his elbow, but he as length accomplished the undertaking. He found himself
                     high up on a sandy beach, and half-buried in a great mass of sea-weed. His
                     joints were stiff, but he was not long satisfying himself that none of his
                     bones were broken, and that he was not seriously bruised. His right shoulder
                     and hip were very lame, and the right side of his head he found to be somewhat
                     sore. He had evidently struck amongst the sea-weed, and then was washed up on
                     the beach.
                  It must have been nearly half an hour from the time our hero came to himself
                     before be got upon his feet. The sea was still rolling in, but the gale had
                     passed. It was a low beach where the brig had struck, but she had been
                     completely knocked to pieces, and her cargo was scattered all around.
                  At some distance from the spot where Alfred stood were three men—poor
                     fishermen, by their garb—who were hauling up a dead body from the wreck.
                  "Ah, you've come to, eh?" uttered one of the men, approaching our hero. "We
                     thought there was life left in ye. What a narrer 'scapn yer've had."
                  "It has been a narrow one," returned Alfred. "But tell me—who else is alive of
                     the crew?"
                  "Don't know. There be three men as went off an hour ago. Guess all the rest be
                     done for."
                  Alfred looked around among the bodies that were upon the sand. He found the
                     stiff corses of Waffon, of Dunham, and of fourteen more, but nowhere could he
                     find Pettrell. He asked of the fishermen a description of the men who had
                     gone.
                  "One on 'em was a real bruiser," said the man to whom the question had been
                     put. "Had a great scar on his cheek—one on his nose, an' I think one on his
                     chin."
                  "Pettrell!" uttered Alfred.
                  "Yes, that be it. I hern t'other one call 'im so."
                  From further description, Alfred felt satisfied that one of the men named Paul
                     Callum had also escaped; but the third he could not make out. The youth felt
                     glad that Callum had escaped, for he had been his friend; and he was the one,
                     toe, who took the rope from Alfred's neck when Pettrell had thought to put his
                     deadly threat into execution.
                  "So you be a smuggler, eh?" said one of the fishermen, with a peculiar
                     wink.
                  "Yes, that is, this vessel was one," returned Alfred.
                  "Well, your capt'n needn't 'ave been so afeared, for there be'ant nobody here
                     as would harm 'im."
                  At this moment Alfred thought of the package he had received from Bronkon. He
                     placed his hand in his bosom, but it was gone! For a moment he staggered
                     beneath the blow; but starting back to himself, he caught one of the fishermen
                     by the arm.
                  "Who has robbed me?" he cried. "Who has taken a package from my bosom?"
                  "None of us haint touched it," said the man.
                  "Them fellers as went off felt around ye," said another; 'an' one on 'em picked
                     up somethin' as looked like a paper."
                  "It was Pettrell," groaned our hero.
                  "Yes," said the fisherman.
                  "O, God!" ejaculated Alfred, as the full sense of his loss came upon him; "he
                     might have let me had that!"
                  "Money, eh?" uttered one of the men, with a sort of sympathizing look.
                  Alfred made no reply, but he turned to the spot from whence he had arisen and
                     searched carefully in every direction; but he could find nothing of the lost
                     package. It was gone, and the youth forgot for the time to thank God that his
                     life had been saved.
                  "Come," said one of the fishermen, "you must be hurt an' hungry. Our home
                     be'ant fur from here. Come."
                  The youth did feel faint, and he refused not the man's offer. He gave one more
                     search after the lost package, but without finding it, and then he followed the
                     man up from the beach.
                  The fisherman's hut was only a few rods back from the head of the beach and
                     when our hero reached it he inquired in what part of Cornwall he was. He
                     learned that he was about fifteen miles south of Stratton, and also that there
                     were no neighbors within eight miles of the hut where he was, save a few more
                     fishermen who had small cabins along the head of the shore.
                  A comfortable bed was provided for Alfred, and towards night he awoke from a
                     refreshing sleep. Some decent cordial was procured for him, and one of the
                     fishermen cooked him a palatable supper. Again he sought his bed, and it must
                     have been nearly midnight when he was aroused by the sound of voices. He
                     listened, and from such of the conversation as he could overhear, he learned
                     that the three fishermen had found two boxes of the money which had been taken
                     from the Indiaman.
                  Early on the following morning our hero arose from his bed greatly refreshed,
                     and feeling quite strong. He partook of the plain fare that was set before him,
                     and having finished his meal, he proposed to set forth.
                  "You be'ant got no money, have ye?" asked one of the fishermen.
                  "No," returned Alfred.
                  The three fishermen whispered apart for a few moments, and then their spokesman
                     turned to Alfred.
                  "Look yo," said he, with a curious expression upon his brown features. "I
                     s'pose we may get somethin' out o' the stuff as was washed ashore, an' as part
                     of it 'longs to you, why, yer see, we mout gin yer somethin'—say four gold
                     guineas, eh?"
                  Alfred could almost have smiled at the fellow's manner, since he knew full well
                     the secret of this generosity; but he betrayed no sign of his knowledge. At
                     first he thought of refusing the money; but he knew that he might need it, and
                     he accepted it.
                  "Now," said the man who had given him the money, "let me give you a piece of
                     advice. There's been sharks arter yer, an' we set 'em on the wrong track.
                     There's a sloop o' war come into Padstow yesterday, an' they're arter pirates.
                     Some on 'em 'ave been up here, an, we set 'em off towards Camelford. Now you
                     jes' take the fish-path right straight ahead to Stratton, an' from there you
                     can go jes' as yer like."
                  "I am no pirate. I call God to witness that I am not," uttered Alfred.
                  "Well, p'r'aps ye aint. But then if they think ye be, why, it's all the same,
                     yer see; so yer'd bester kind o' steer clear, ye know."
                  Alfred wished to say no more, so he thanked the fishermen for their kindness,
                     and set off. He stopped not to look for the package he had lost, for he not
                     only felt confident that Pettrell had got it, but he feared to make any stop.
                     He was sure, from what the fishermen had told him, that the pirates had been
                     traced to their wrecked vessel, and he trembled lest he should be arrested as
                     one of them.
                  "Great God!" he mentally ejaculated, as this last thought occurred to him,
                     "what a fate that would be!—to be arrested and dragged before the public as a
                     pirate!"
                  The thought was terrible, and is presented a reality, too, which
                     Alfred could not easily drive from sight. He almost felt that the black doom
                     hung over him! He struggled, however, to overcome the fear, and he partially
                     succeeded. He know that he was innocent, and on that he rested his hopes.
                  The narrow road was easily made out, and before noon our hero reached Stratton.
                     It was his aim to make the best of his way to the old light-house upon Little
                     Devon Head. From Stratton to the north it was twelve miles to Hartland, and to
                     this place the youth determined to make his way, only stopping in Stratton long
                     enough to get a morsel to eat. The road was a mere cross-path along near the
                     seashore; but it was easy, and before two o'clock in the afternoon the
                     traveller reached Hartland, the most western town of Devonshire. Here he had
                     the good fortune to find a stage bound to Barnstaple, a distance of
                     twenty-eight miles; and in this stage, or, rather, on this stage, be secured a
                     passage.
                  Alfred rode outside with the driver, the mail-guard being the only other
                     outside passenger. The driver was an "old stager," and by dint of considerable
                     perseverance he got Alfred into a conversation.
                  "Been to sea some, haint ye?" he asked.
                  Alfred replied in the affirmative.
                  "Ever come across any o' them wagabond pirates!" resumed the driver.
                  The youth started, and for a moment his head swam; but his companion's
                     attention was at that time directed to the horses, and he soon overcame his
                     trepidation. The mail-guard was seated further up, so he did not notice the
                     emotion.
                  "I have seen them," answered our here.
                  "Blast 'em, I should like to see one on 'em. There's a cutter—a sloop-of-war's'
                     cutter, I b'lieve—come up to the pin't this mornin', an' they said authin'
                     'bout a pirate's brig bein' cast away on the coast somewhere. You heard
                     anything about it?"
                  "Yes I did hear something about it, but I took it to be only a rumor.
                     By-the-way, that is a handsome horse—that starboard one forward. All four of
                     them are very handsome ones, and, I doubt not, good ones."
                  "Good ones!" echoed the driver, giving his whip an extensive flourish, and
                     drawing the reins tighter. "Good ones! Let me tell you 'at last
                     Friday week I drove this team from Barnstaple to Exeter—an' that's hard on to
                     forty miles—"
                  "Thirty-five," interrupted the mail-guard.
                  "Thirty-five be cussed!" retorted Jehu, not at all thankful for the
                     matter-of-fact interruption. "But as I was sayin"—I drove this team from
                     Barnstaple to Exeter—hard on to FORTY MILES—in just four hours and
                     forty-two minutes; an' I had to stop, too, at Dipford, an' Clumleigh, at
                     Oldburrow, an' at the Silverton crossin' for passengers! That was
                        this team."
                  Alfred expressed a due amount of wonder at this marvellous feat; and well he
                     could afford to, since he had accomplished his object in drawing his
                     companion's thoughts away from the pirates.
                  "Five-an'-thirty miles!" growled the old stager, as he flourished his whip with
                     indignant emphasis. "These mail-guards thinks they knows everything."
                  After this our hero listened to any quantity of horse stories, and by
                     flattering the peculiar vanity of the driver, he had risen wonderfully in the
                     old fellow's esteem by the time the stage had reached Biddeford. Here two more
                     passengers took outside scale, and from thence to Barnstaple Alfred had little
                     occasion for conversation. It was nightfall when they reached their
                     destination, and Alfred took lodgings at the tavern where the stage stopped. He
                     had been somewhat acquainted in Barnstaple when he was with Luke Gurron, and he
                     had several times stopped at the very tavern where he now was; but no one
                     recognized him, and as he had no design to make himself known, he kept quietly
                     in the background, merely answering such questions as were
                     casually asked him, and at an early hour he sought his
                     bed.
                  At an early hour in the morning Alfred descended to the bar-room of the tavern,
                     where he found quite a number of the town's people assembled, who were engaged
                     in reading a placard that had been posted upon the wall. Our here walked up to
                     the spot, and found that the object of curiosity was no more or less than a
                     full description of Marrok Pettrell, the pirate captain, and an offer of a
                     large reward for his apprehension. The bulletin also stated that three others
                     of the pirates had probably escaped, one of them a young man!—and rewards were
                     offered for them, too.
                  "Shouldn't think there'd be much trouble in making out that captain," remarked
                     one of the lookers on. "Zounds! what an ugly-looking customer he must be."
                  "I should know him the moment I put my eyes on him," said a second.
                  "Then there's t'others," added a third," 'specially the young 'un. 'Gad, I'd
                     like to make a haul on some on 'em."
                  Alfred felt his heart sinking within him. It seemed to him as though all eyes
                     must be fixed upon him, and he entertained at first the idea of leaving the
                     place as quickly as possible; but he soon convinced himself that such a course
                     would be the most likely to bring suspicion upon him, and with an inward
                     struggle to overcome his trepidation, he walked calmly back towards the
                     placard, and reread it.*
                  
                  
                     
                     *[SEE ENGRAVING.]
                  
                  "Hallo," exclaimed a tammy-worker, who happened to cast his eyes upon our hero;
                     "you he a see-goin' chap?"
                  "Yes," returned Alfred, standing the simultaneous gaze of the crowd with
                     unwonted fortitude.
                  "You be'ant seen nothin' o' these pirates, I s'pose?"
                  "No, not I; and I pray that I never may."
                  The last part of this remark was made with a soul-fervor that might have
                     disarmed suspicion had it ever existed.
                  "One o' them was a young 'un," remarked the tammy-maker; "but in course it
                     couldn't 'a' been you?"
                  Alfred came nigh losing himself as this remark was made; but he saw that all
                     eyes were upon him, and with a strong effort he maintained his composure.
                  "I shouldn't be very likely to be here if I were a pirate," said the youth,
                     with a slight smile.
                  "No, in course not. But I hope as them fellers 'il be ketched—an' I hope as
                     they'll be hung—an' I hope as I may be there to see 'em."
                  As the tammy-maker delivered himself of these hopes, he turned away to seek his
                     place of business, and the rest of the people, one by one, gradually went their
                     way.
                  Many a man loses a fortune by reaching too far for it, and many a one, too,
                     fails to discover that of which he is in search, from the very fact that the
                     object is directly beneath his nose all the while. So it was with the people at
                     the tavern. Had they found Alfred in the woods he would have been recognized as
                     a pirate at once; but as it was, he was overlooked.
                  Our hero, however, could not feel easy until he had got clear of the place; so
                     as soon as he had
                     swallowed his breakfast he set off. The road from Barnstaple
                     to Comb Marlin led directly north, and the distance was only eight miles; but
                     Alfred chose to take a path directly to the Devon Head, which would be a
                     distance of some sixteen miles. Part of the way was well travelled by footmen,
                     and the whole way was easy. At length he crossed the small road that ran from
                     Comb Martin to Parlock, and entered the oak woods beneath the shade of which he
                     had so often gambolled when a boy, and ere long afterwards the little stone
                     house and the beacon were in sight.
                  Near at hand were the three graves of the women who bad been buried by the old
                     light keeper—and another had been added to the number. Its stone bore the name
                     of "NEPSEY." Alfred gazed in silence upon the grave, dropped a tear upon the
                     cold end, and then hurried on; but his heart was heavier, and a saddening
                     misgiving had crept to his soul.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XVII.
                  THE NIGHT OF LIFE.
                  WITH trembling steps Alfred Harrold approached the home of his happy, joyous
                     youth. At the door he stood for a moment irresolute, and then he knocked. It
                     was a man who answered his call, but the man was a stranger! The youth hardly
                     dared to ask his questions, but finally the name of the old light keeper
                     trembled upon his lips.
                  "So you're after Luke Garron, are ye?"
                  "Yes, yes."
                  "Poor Luke!—he aint here. But walk in."
                  The man returned to the keeping-room as he spoke, and with a tottering step
                     Alfred followed him.
                  "Luke is not dead?" fell in a strained whisper from the youth's lips.
                  "Not as I knows on. but he haint been here for over a year."
                  As the man answered, he looked inquisitively at his visitor, and gradually a
                     beam of intelligence broke over his face.
                  "Perhaps," he said, "you are the boy that lived with him once?"
                  "Yes, he was a father to me. He saved me from the storm when I was a little
                     child, and he—"
                  Alfred could go no further, for his thick-coming emotions choked him, and his
                     eyes filled with tears. The man gazed sympathetically upon him, and he, too,
                     was somewhat affected.
                  "Yes, yes," he said, "I've heard all about it. Poor old Luke! He suffered a
                     good deal after you had been taken from him."
                  "There was a girl with him—a beautiful young creature, whom he saved—or whom I
                     saved—from the wreck of the Chesham."
                  "Ah, that was the trouble," returned the man. "Luke seemed to love that girl
                     just as though she was his own flesh and blood, and when they come and took her
                     away, it almost killed him. Nepsey had died before that, and he was left all
                     alone."
                  "Took her away!" repeated Alfred. "Who did it!"
                  "O, it was her own father. You see he found out that Luke had found the girl,
                     and when he came down here he knew her, so he took her away with him."
                  "Did you know the man?"
                  "No. Luke did not tell me who he was"
                  "And it might not have been her father, after all."
                  "O, yes it was, for Luke told me there was no mistake about it."
                  "And you know not where she has gone?"
                  "No."
                  "But Luke—you can tell me something of him?"
                  "I can't tell you where he is. All I know is, that he went away from here, and
                     I was put in his place. Poor old man! He couldn't stay here after his storm
                     daughter was gone. He always used to call her his 'storm
                     daughter.' After you was gone it was bad enough; but after they came and took
                     Ella away from him, he wasn't fit for business any more. He used to let the
                     lamps go out dark nights, and then sometimes when there was a storm, he'd go
                     and set out on the head of the bluff, and not light up the beacon at all. You
                     see they couldn't have matters go on so, and they had to turn him off. I took
                     his place, but is made my heart ache when I saw poor old Luke Garron go out
                     from these doors. He was all broken down; that handsome form of his was bent,
                     and his eye was dim; his hair was turned gray, and his brow was all furrowed
                     and wrinkled. Poor Luke!"
                  Alfred bowed his head and wept like a child. His highest hopes of joy were
                     crushed, and where be had looked for the returning sunshine of life, all was
                     dark. He thought to see the dawning of day, but in the stead thereof he found
                     it still night!
                  "Can you not tell me anything of Luke?" he asked, as he raised his head once
                     more.
                  "Nothing since he went away from here," returned the light-keeper. "I haven't
                     seen anything of him, nor heard anything."
                  It was a long time before Alfred spoke again, but he was at length aroused by
                     the entrance of the light-keeper's wife. Dinner was prepared and the youth sat
                     down to the same table from which he had eaten in childhood; but he could not
                     eat much now. When the meal was finished, the light-keeper went up into the
                     beacon to trim his lamps, and Alfred walked out upon the bluff.
                  Every spot, every rock, every twig, bore to the mind of the youth the memory of
                     some happy scene. Here he had sat upon Luke's knee, and listened to that good
                     man's counsels, and there he had played with the bright-eyed Ella. Then he was
                     a playful, happy boy—now he had grown to be a man, and happiness had long been
                     a stranger to his bosom. He went out upon the bluff, and looked off upon the
                     broad bosom of the channel. Below him was the little sandy cove, shut in by its
                     guardian rocks, and there lay the very boat he had 
                        helppd
                        helped
                      Luke so often to manage. He turned to the narrow path and 
                        decended
                        descended
                      to the place. He entered the boat and sat down upon one of the
                     thwarts, and then he buried his face in his hands. For nearly half an hour he
                     sat there in one position, his mind busy in recalling the varied scenes of the
                     past. Suddenly he felt a heavy hand upon his shoulder, and on starting to his
                     feet he behold the scarred and storm-beaten features of Marrok Pettrell!
                  "Eh! By the beard of Moses, but this is a lucky bit. Blow me eternally if I
                     thought of seeing you here."
                  Alfred Harrold was thunder-struck. He gazed upon the pirate captain for some
                     moments without the ability to speak.
                  "Lucky, by the powers!" said Pettrell. "But let's be off out of this. We'll
                     work together now, and haul our wind quickly. Cut those gaskets, Alfred, and
                     then give me a lift at the halyards. I'll eat the shore-fasts. Hurry, hurry,
                     for the blood-hounds are after us. By my eternal soul, if we can get out of
                     this logger, we may laugh at them."
                  "You may go your own way, Marrok Pettrell, but I shall keep your company no
                     longer."
                  "Nonsense! I tell you the officers are almost here! They gave me chase on the
                     road, and I took to the woods; but they found my wake. Come, bear a hand, and
                     let's be out of this."
                  "You can go, but I shall not go with you"
                  "Fool! dolt! Would you be taken by the hounds?"
                  "I am no pirate."
                  "Ha, ha, ha! You may tell them that story, but they wont believe you."
                  "You know, Marrok, that I am not."
                  "No, I don't know any such thing."
                  "Good God! you would not see me taken—"
                  "O, shut up your nonsense!" hastily exclaimed Pettrell, as he drew his knife
                     across the gasket of the sail. "We've sailed together too long to part company
                     now. If I'm taken, you'll be taken with me; and what's more, if I'm hanged,
                     you'll be hanged with me. Now you'd better start up and help me off."
                  The youth was for a moment astounded by the cool villany of the pirate, but he
                     soon regained his firmness and decision.
                  "Go your own way, Pettrell," he said; "but think not that I shall go with you.
                     I have little choice between your company and that of the officers."
                  "Fool!"
                  "Ah!" uttered Alfred, at that moment thinking of the package he had lost, "you
                     robbed me of papers that I had."
                  "Papers? What papers?" exclaimed the pirate, in assumed
                     astonishment.
                  "You took them from my bosom while I lay—"
                  "I know nothing of any papers. Ha, did Mark Bronkon give you papers?" cried
                     Pettrell, seizing the youth by the arm. "Tell me!—tell me! Did be give you any
                     papers?"
                  Alfred believed now that Pettrell had not taken those papers, for there was
                     surely no deception in his earnest, anxious manner; but before he could reply,
                     the pirate dropped his arm and sprang to the shore-fast.
                  "They are upon as!" he cried. "Out with that boat-hook! Out with it—quick! For
                     mercy" sake, Alfred, help me to escape!"
                  The shore-fasts were cut, and Alfred attempted to leap to the shore, but
                     Pettrell seized hold upon him and held him back.
                  "By heavens, you shall not leave me! You must help me now. Hear them! They are
                     at the house, and will soon be here! Seize those halyards!"
                  "Marrok Pettrell," exclaimed the youth, shaking off the hold that was laid upon
                     him, "I have said that I would no longer be your companion. I mean that—and by
                     that I will abide."
                  "Back! Move a step towards the shore, and you shall die!"
                  As the pirate thus spoke, he seized the long boathook, and attempted to push
                     off; but his efforts were vain, for the boat's keel was bedded in the sand. He
                     turned to seek the assistance of the youth, and at that moment half a-dozen men
                     appeared upon the head of the bluff.
                  "O, fool! Infernal, dastard fool!—we are lost!" cried Pettrell, as he gave one
                     more desperate push with the boat-book.
                  He pushed in vain, and in a moment more the officers had leaped on board the
                     boat. The stout pirate made a strong resistance, but he was over come by
                     numbers, and his arms were soon pinioned behind him.
                  "Now who have we here?" asked the leader of the officers, as his eyes rested
                     upon our here.
                  "That's one of 'em," said an officer.
                  "Who are you?" asked the leader.
                  "I am no pirate, air—God knows I am not," uttered Alfred.
                  "Then God must have a curious way of knowing things," said Pettrell, with a
                     demoniac look.
                  "There was a young one among 'em," said one of the officers, "and it's likely
                     this are is him."
                  "Didn't you belong on board the pirate brig that was wrecked on the Cornwall
                     coast?" asked the leader.
                  "Yes, I did," groaned Alfred; "but I was—"
                  "O, never mind your buts," interrupted the officer. "I expect to
                     bear this chop faced villain swear that he aint a pirate next."
                  "He's the one; but he's a little frightened," said another of the officers.
                  Alfred offered no resistance, for he knew that it would be useless; neither
                     could he say more, for he was only met with coarse taunts, and with a painfully
                     swelling heart he was led up from the core.
                  The light-keeper came out, and saw the prisoners led by the house. Alfred could
                     see the wonder that rested upon his countenance, but he had no word to say. It
                     was a crushing blow, and he sank beneath it. Silently he walked along through
                     the woody path, and at the road he found horses. Upon the back of one he was
                     secured, while Pettrell was in like manner secured upon another. The officers
                     then mounted, and the party set off towards Exeter, which place was reached
                     late in the evening.
                  Here Alfred and Pettrell were lodged in the jail, but in different cells, and
                     at the end of a month they were forwarded to London, to answer to the charge of
                     piracy.
                  When our hero reached the great metropolis, he was sick at heart, and all worn
                     down with grief and misery: All along upon the road he had been gazed at as a
                     felon of the blackest dye, and on more than one occasion had been forcibly
                     assaulted by the mob.
                  At length the prison doors were shut upon him in London, and he knew that when
                     he came forth it would be to his final trial. He knew of no means to secure a
                     witness in his behalf, unless, indeed, he might gain something from the
                     influence of Sir William Brent. He remembered, too, his address. He received
                     permission to write a note to the old admiral, and he did so, and sent it off.
                     He waited two weeks, but he heard nothing from his letter. Marrok Pettrell had
                     sworn to claim the youth as a pirate, and there seemed no earthly way for
                     redemption.
                  The most fearful ordeal of his whole eventful life was now before the
                     unfortunate youth. He feared that the Court of the King's Commissioner would
                     condemn him. But one ray of light still shone in upon him: at the bar of God he
                     knew he would be innocent!
               
               
                  CHAPTER XVIII.
                  THE TRIAL.
                  THE day of trial at length came, and Alfred Harrold was taken to the court
                     where he was to be tried for his life. The ship which had been robbed in the
                     Indian Ocean had arrived in port, and many of her passengers were there as
                     witnesses.
                  The great hall was crowded with spectators, and the utmost interest prevailed.
                     Alfred met the cager gaze of the people as he entered the box, but as soon as
                     he could be seated he bowed his head and covered his face with his bands.
                  By previous arrangement Pettrell and the youth were fried separately. With the
                     pirate captain the case was a short and direct one. Ten men who had been on
                     board the Indiaman knew him on the instant they saw him, and their testimony
                     was direct and conclusive. He was found guilty of piracy, and the judge asked
                     him if he had any reason to give why sentence should not be pronounced upon
                     him. Pettrell arose to his feet, and cast a defiant look around upon those who
                     had collected there to look upon him.
                  "Your honor," he said, with a cool look and tone, "I suppose my case is a fixed
                     one, and the idea of asking a man his reasons for not being hanged, when you
                     have determined to hang him at all events, is a novel idea. However, my time
                     has come, and you want my life. Take it. I suppose my companion here will
                     follow in the same track. He hasn't been quite so long on outlaw as I have, but
                     that is his lookout. I could almost wish that he hadn't been caught, for he is
                     too young to hang. If he should live he might repent; but then your laws don't
                     look at such things. We must both die. No, air, I have no reason why I should
                     not be hanged. I have played the game and beat it often; now I am
                     beat. If I have any complaint to make, it is that you should put us upon
                     separate indictments. Alfred and myself have been together, and the same
                     testimony that applies to me will apply to him. He is my son, "us true,
                     but—"
                  "Liar!" uttered a voice in the crowd.
                  The judge commanded order.
                  "Excuse me, your honor; but that base wretch's words are having weight against
                     one who is yet to be tried. He has lied most foully."
                  All eyes were turned in the direction from whence the voice proceeded, and Sir
                     William Brent, the admiral of a hundred battles, was seen. making his way
                     towards the bench.
                  "Your honor," he continued, his white locks shaking with the indignation that
                     moved him, "I know that youth, and I knew his father. Let the dastard villain
                     speak no more!"
                  Marrok Pettrell trembled for a moment, and then he stamped his foot with rage.
                     He was paralyzed for a while, but his reckless daring came back to him.
                  "Let me tell the admiral that he is too late to triumph," hissed the pirate,
                     with a fiendish look. "He and I looked on and saw a man hanged years ago. If
                     this young pirate by my side is not my son, much good may it do him when he
                     finds out in reality who was his father! I am now ready for your hangman!"
                  A ray of hope had shot through our here's soul when he saw the old baronet, but
                     a strange source of new grief was opened to him by the last words of Pettrell.
                     He had heard Bronkon speak of his father being buried at sea; and he remembered
                     Bronkon's manner when the subject was broached. The thought came like a
                     thunderbolt upon him that his father had been hanged! And then
                     came the thought of the papers he had lost!
                  Sir William conversed a moment with the clerk of the court, and then he
                     whispered with the judge; and soon afterwards sentence of death was passed upon
                     the pirate captain, and then the officers were ordered to remove him from the
                     room. Pettrell objected to this; but his objection was of no avail, and with a
                     volley of oaths upon his lips he was led from the place.
                  It was now Alfred's turn to be called up. The appearance of Sir William had
                     given him a glimmer of hope; but yet the evidence of the ship's passengers was
                     somewhat against him, until one was called who had seen the pirate captain
                     knock him down. Four of the passengers were confident they had recognized the
                     youth upon the quarterdeck of the pirate brig, but they all agreed that he did
                     not board the ship. The fifth witness stated that he saw Pettrell knock the
                     prisoner down just as the brig began to round to.
                  After the evidence for the prosecution was all in, Alfred Harrold was requested
                     by the court to make any statement he chose bearing upon the question at
                     issue.
                  "Nearly the whole of my life, air, bears upon the terrible subject,"
                     tremblingly uttered the youth, as he arose to his feet.
                  "Go on. The court will listen."
                  The youthful prisoner bowed his head for a moment, and then wiping the tears
                     from his eyes, he cast a quick glance about him. He met the gaze of hundreds,
                     but he saw that every countenance bore that magic beam of sympathy which is not
                     to be mistaken; that beam which puts a brilliant spark in the eye, and a tender
                     softness about the lips—which fastens the gaze with a kind look, and images
                     hope in its expression. Quick as the passage of the lightning bolt wear the
                     conviction to the heart of our hero that the sympathies of the people were with
                     him. This gave him courage, and with considerable firmness he commenced the
                     story of his eventful life.
                  Alfred's voice trembled with emotion as he commenced; but gradually, as he lost
                     the realities of the present in the memories he was calling up, his tone
                     assumed power, and the pathos of his words was deep and touching. With a
                     modest, unwitting force, he painted the scenes of his early boyhood; he told
                     how he had been saved from the wreck by the old light-keeper, and how he had
                     lived with that good man—how he had learned—how he had loved—how his heart had
                     put forth its tender shoots of hope, and how his life was opening in the summer
                     of peace and joy. Then he told of the coming of the dark man who had just been
                     taken from the court-room under the sentence of death.
                  For a moment the poor youth's feelings overpowered him, and he bowed his head
                     upon the railing before him. When he spoke again, his voice had settled to a
                     low, painful cadence, and his frame trembled beneath the bitter memories he
                     called up. With living, speaking colors he painted the night of storm and
                     darkness that shut so fearfully about him when he was dragged away from his
                     kind protector, and as he went on with his recital every eye that beamed upon
                     him was moistened with the warm dew of generous sympathy. He told of his dark
                     sorrows, and of his soul's battles against the evil genius that had settled
                     down so menacingly by his side. He told of his escape from the brig in
                     Cumberland, of his meeting with Sir William Brent, and of his subsequent
                     re-capture.
                  And so he went on, giving a faithful picture of his career up to the time of
                     the wreck upon the coast of Cornwall. His tears flowed afresh as be told of the
                     bitter disappointment he had experienced when he reached once more the home of
                     his boyhood, and how, at that moment, his life's hopes were again crushed. Them
                     he told how the pirate captain had again met him, and how once more his fate
                     seemed linked with that of the dreaded man who had been his deadly enemy so
                     long. There was a moment's pause, and then Alfred raised his clasped hands
                     towards heaven, and while his countenance beamed with a holy radiance, be
                     exclaimed:
                  "Earth can have few joys left for me now; but, O, I would not have my name left
                     upon her history linked with a crime so black. God knows my heart; to him I can
                     look as a child may look up to a father. He will have mercy on the unfortunate,
                     and soothe the troubles of those who rest upon his arm. To my God I am not
                     afraid to commit myself: to my fellows, and to you, sir, I look for pity, at
                     least—pity for one who has been most bitterly wronged, and whose heart is all
                     crushed and broken."
                  Minutes elapsed after the youth had sank into his seat, before a whisper broke
                     the stillness that reigned in that room. When it was broken it was by a low,
                     simultaneous heaving of a hundred bosoms that sent forth the pent-up emotions
                     of unmistakable good-will and sympathy.
                  Sir William Brent arose at the call of the clerk, and gave in his
                     testimony.
                  "Sir William," said the judge, after the old admiral had related the
                     circumstances of his meeting with the youth in Cumberland, "you know something,
                     I think, of the prisoner's early life!"
                  "Nothing that I may tell here, my lord," returned the old man. "It can have no
                     bearing upon the prisoner's case."
                  In a short time the case was given to the jury, and after a deliberation of
                     some minutes they returned with a verdict of "NOT GUILTY."
                  The feelings of the excited multitude were not to be restrained, and they burst
                     forth in a prolonged shout of applause, in the midst of which Alfred sank back
                     completely overpowered. He heard the shout, and he knew that he was safe, and
                     then his
                     
                        JERUSALEM AS IT NOW IS.
                      consciousness left him. When he was aroused, his hand was clasped by
                     a warm embrace, and a friendly voice was speaking to him.
                  "Come, come, my brave youth, you are free!"
                  It was Sir William who spoke to him, and as our hero caught the kind look of
                     the old man's eye, he bent forward and leaned his head upon the baronet's
                     bosom.
                  "Come, come—you are free!"
                  "But whither—whither shall I go?"
                  "With me," returned the baronet, as he led the youth from the box. "Come; my
                     carriage is in the street."
                  Alfred followed the old man out, and as he walked down the aisle be met the
                     warm greetings of those who had remained to see him depart. He thanked them
                     with a silent, tearful look of gratitude, and ere long he reached the admiral's
                     carriage. Once more he turned his grateful look upon the multitude who were
                     cheering him, and then he entered the vehicle of his friend. He knew not why
                     the old man should be so interested in him; but of one thing he felt
                     assured—that Sir William was his friend, and that for the present he was safe
                     from persecution.

               JERUSALEM AS IT IS.
               We present herewith an excellent engraving from a drawing made upon the spot,
                  representing the city of Jerusalem in its present aspect, and from a new point of
                  view. The crowded city, with its undulating surface and hills beyond, is
                  contrasted by the wild and broken foreground with its luxuriant foliage, through
                  which winds a characteristic procession of oriental figures. The walls are pierced
                  with three city gates, two of which are walled up, and of which the only one open
                  appears as empty and deserted as if it only gave entrance to a deserted city. The
                  walls rise even above these gates, and sustain a broad and vast terrace extending
                  along two-thirds of the length of Jerusalem, on the side which looks to the east.
                  This terrace appears to be 1000 feet long and 600 feet broad; it is nearly level,
                  except in the centre, where it sinks insensibly, as it to recall to the eye the
                  shallow valley which formerly separated Mount Zion from the city of Jerusalem.
            
            
               
                  
                     PIFFERARI PLAYING TO THE VIRGIN.
                  
               
               PIFFERARI PLAYING TO THE VIRGIN.
               No one who has been in Rome long enough to become acquainted with the various
                  types of character exhibited in the Eternal City can fail to remember with
                  pleasure the itinerant pifferari or pipers, with
                  their rude instruments of music and their picturesque ragged attire. Painters love
                  to sketch these wandering minstrels, so full of character and so thoroughly
                  national. The engraving on this page, from a water colored drawing by a lady, Mrs.
                  Elizabeth Murray, is exceedingly felicitous in its truthfulness and expression.
                  There is something extremely graceful and intelligent about this little group. The
                  itinerant pipers serenading the Virgin, who is represented in an old medieval
                  painting on the wall above, is an incident the truthfulness of which will be
                  recognized by all who have visited Rome. On the opposite side of the picture is a
                  young mother, with a charming little child, whom she is teaching to pray to the
                  sacred effigy. The expression of the former is full of benignity and affection;
                  that of the latter is artless and engaging. Mark, also, the nice discrimination
                  displayed in the countenances of the two "executants." The old man, his head duly
                  uncovered, looking up with reverend gravity to the object of his musical—or
                  unmusical—tribute; and the boy, his pipe temporarily withdrawn from his mouth,
                  looks with a pleasant and curious smile at the kneeling child. The drawing in
                  every part shows freedom, power, and delicacy of execution, leaving nothing to
                  desire. The tide of foreign travel always sets to wards Rome and now that the
                  facilities of seeing Europe are so great, few Americans who go abroad neglect the
                  opportunity of seeing Rome, great in ruins, great in its history. Twenty-five
                  centuries have roiled away since the reported date of the foundation of the city.
                  Once the mistress of the world, she has fallen indeed in power. Yet the various
                  phases of splendor and power through which it has passed, have left their traces
                  in monuments which the corroding tooth of time, and the cannon of beleaguering
                  hosts, have not utterly destroyed. Still stands the Coliseum—great in decay; still
                  stand the triumphal arches which attested the victories of the all conquering
                  Romans, and a thousand crumbling pillars and fanes mark the old historic past, so
                  prolific in themes of thrilling interest.
            
            
               
               AT ANCHOR.
               
                  Ah, many a year ago, dear wife,
                  We floated down this river,
                  Where the boar willows on its brink
                  Alternate wave and shiver;
                  With careless glance we viewed askance
                  The kingfisher at quest,
                  And scarce would lived the reed-wren near,
                  Who sung beside her nest;
                  Nor dreamed that e'er our boat would be,
                  Thus anchored and at rest,
                  Dear love,
                  Thus anchored and at rest.
               
               
                  O, many a time the wren has built
                  Where those green shadows quiver,
                  And many a time the hawthorn shed
                  Its blossoms on the river,
                  Since that sweet noon of sultry June,
                  When I my love confessed,
                  While with the tide our boat did glide
                  Adown the stream's smooth breast,
                  Whereon our little shallop lies
                  Now anchored and at rest,
                  Dear love,
                  Now anchored and at rest.
               
               
                  The waters still to ocean run,
                  Their tribute to deliver;
                  And still the hawthorns bud and bloom
                  Above the dusky river.
                  Still sings the wren—the water-hen
                  Still skims the ripple's crest:
                  The sun—as bright as on that night—
                  Sinks slowly down the west;
                  But now our tiny craft is moored,
                  Safe anchored and at rest,
                  Dear love,
                  Safe anchored and at rest.
               
               
                  For this sweet calm of after-days
                  We thank the bounteous Giver,
                  Who bids our life flow sweetly on
                  As this delicious river.
                  A world—our own—has round as grown,
                  Wherein we twain are blest:
                  Our child's first words than songs of birds
                  More music have expressed;
                  And all our centrad happiness
                  Is anchored and at rest,
                  Dear love,
                  Is anchored and at rest.
               
            
            
               THE COMING ANGEL: OR, MY GENTLE NURSE.
               BY WILLIAM B. OLIVER.
               I CAME home from sea heartily sick and tired of ocean life. I resolved to build me
                  a little nest in some quiet neighborhood, and I hoped to find some woman who would
                  not disdain to share it with me, however humble and unassuming were its
                  appointments. And having so determined, I set myself speedily to its
                  accomplishment. For many months my little toy of a house occupied my mind and the
                  labor of my hands. I turned alternately carpenter, mason, painter and gardener.
                  Every day saw some improvement. The building was a small one, fronting the south,
                  where I had saved some splendid rock maples for shade. The man of whom I had
                  bought the land was surprised when I told him I was going to keep them standing.
                  They would spoil my prospect, he said. But the trees stood. I had a low wing built
                  at the eastern and also at the western end, forming two dear little rooms, in
                  which we could behold the rising and setting sun.
               It was easy to build the house; but the woman who was to occupy it with me, was
                  still out in the long future—a being unknown. I went out into society, and
                  cultivated young lady society intensely. I was not fastidious overmuch. I did not
                  seek for beauty, riches and goodness all in the same person; they seldom meet
                  thus. But I did look for prettiness and intelligence combined; for I had a
                  sailor's horror of ugly women, and had not a sailor's disregard to the
                  intellectual.
               I added every day some new charm to my dwelling, where I had already installed the
                  dearest of all mothers. Birds, and flowers, and books, the choicest plants, the
                  most rare and delicate of foreign shells, gathered in my visits to other lands,
                  all awaited the coming woman, who yet did not come, and I sought her everywhere,
                  in vain.
               My mother had a pet scheme to marry me to a young girl, the daughter of a friend;
                  and some such foolish nonsense had been perpetrated in our babyhood as to plan a
                  marriage between us. I tried to like Constance Mason, willing to please the two
                  old ladles who desired it so much; but I could not bring myself to love so passive
                  and uninteresting a being. My wife must have some character; must be able to carve
                  out life for herself, not yield blindly to me. So that project flitted by on
                  broken wing; and while my mother was bemoaning my bachelorhood, I met one whom it
                  seemed very possible that I could love.
               Henrietta Clarendon was the sister of a friend of my own, and was then on a visit
                  to him. Charles Clarendon had been married about three months, and this was his
                  sister's first visit. I knew how pleasing it would be to him, and I tried to make
                  myself agreeable to the young lady, at first for her brother's sake, and then for
                  her own. How well I succeeded may be known by the fact that we were engaged lovers
                  in less than six weeks after I first saw her.
               The days of courtship are interesting only to the parties undergoing that ordeal.
                  I shall forbear to speak of them further; yet I must justify to the reader my
                  choice of a wife, by describing her. She was tall and graceful. Her hair was
                  lighter than my taste approved, but of singular beauty and length; her eyes were
                  blue, and sparkling with vivacity. She had very beautiful hands—almost too
                  beautiful for a poor man's wife, who must use those members for household
                  purposes. There was no shying that fact; my wife must work. Her life should be as
                  happy as I could make it; but I could not have afforded a useless companion—nor
                  would I, if I could. My mother—than whom no one ever deserved the name of lady—was
                  a domestic angel. Henrietta was doomed, in my mind, from our betrothed, to follow
                  in her footsteps. Should I love my angel the less because she could furnish my
                  supper with her own fair hands?
               Thus matters stood when our country heard the cry of arms. My whole soul responded
                  to the summons, and I announced myself in readiness to depart. Mine was a Spartan
                  mother, who could bid me go, and choke back her tears as she said the word
                  good-by. But Henrietta's was not a brave spirit; she even seemed displeased that
                  my country should take precedence of herself in my heart. Thank God, I was not the
                  recreant she would have made me! I was grieved and astonished at her conduct and
                  her words. Evidently, she was no wife for a soldier; but then I expected to be a
                  man of peace again before many months, and I would not trouble the parting hour by
                  chiding her cowardice.
               Our regiment was foremost in the fight, and many of our brave boys were laid low.
                  I seemed to wear a charmed life; for I became so bitter towards the rebels, as I
                  marked their unmanly course, that I cared for no danger, and was in the thickest
                  of every battle we fought, without a thought of myself. Even my mother and
                  Henrietta were forgotten in the hour of warfare. Still, I was never touched; my
                  hour had not yet come.
               It came, however. I had joined the Western cavalry, and had been promoted to the
                  rank of captain. I was employed in establishing pickets one evening, aided by
                  twenty of my men, when we were fired upon from a cedar thicket. Two poor fellows
                  were shot down from their horses. I had just dismounted and stood beside them,
                  when another volley, took effect upon myself. I knew nothing until I found myself
                  in the hospital, amidst the dead and dying, who had been brought in hastily from
                  the scene where treachery and meanness had done their work.
               My own work was done. When I came from the hands of the surgeon, I was a miserable
                  wreck of a man, minus an arm and a leg, and with an ugly sear upon my cheek. These
                  were visible injuries; but my whole body bore the marks of bullets
                  that had been extracted while I lay insensible.
               I longed, then, for that dear mother's hand which had ministered to me so often.
                  If over a man longs to be a boy again, and cling to a mother's arms, it is when,
                  helpless and powerless, he wakes up wounded and sore, as I did. But when I had
                  time to analyze my selfishness, I felt that my mother's presence there would be no
                  joy, but deep and bitter pain to me.
               When the twilight approached, and the moans of my fellow-sufferers were subsiding
                  into sleep under the effect of the opiates, I became aware of the presence of a
                  woman at my bedside. She was bathing my hot and feverish face with some cool,
                  scented liquid. It was as if angels were kissing my brow, and fanning me with
                  fragrant wings. It was so different from the rough, though well-meant handling I
                  had first received from the surgeon and his mates. "Some old lady, who has a son
                  in battle," I thought; "and she handles me thus gently, for his sake." All night
                  she was flitting from one bed to another, as I saw in my sleepless agony—for my
                  wounds were very terrible. "I shall never see home again," I said to myself.
               Well, perhaps it was best that I should not. Perhaps it would be less dreadful to
                     them to hear of my death, than to see me brought back a maimed,
                  useless cripple. And then, too, the feeling that I had not met my wounds in open,
                  fearless warfare, with sword in hand, urging my faithful horse against the enemy,
                  and winning glory with my own right hand; but to be shot down in the dark by the
                  mean, miserable, skulking cowards from their ambush—O, the agony of all this? What
                  tongue can fully express all that a brave man might feel at such a moment?
               It was near dawn when my opiate took effect, and I slept heavily until afternoon.
                  I awoke comparatively free from pain, and beside me sat, as I supposed, the angel
                  of last night. No aged crone—no wornout nurse, hardened and, callous in her
                  profession—No! A sweet, tender face was there; no longer young, it is true, nor
                  with much of what we call beauty, but with something that touched me deeper than
                  youth or beauty could have done. All that is pure and womanly—all that man ought
                  to love and respect in woman, was there. The soft, gentle eyes shone kindly in
                  their light; the low, sweet voice, the tender, thrilling touch of delicate hands
                  when needed—all were there to minister to my shattered nerves or body. And when I
                  needed her no longer, she glided off to other sick beds, to perform the same
                  offices for my poor comrades; reading to them, singing soft, low songs, and
                  praying, as I could discern by her kneeling figure, when the parting soul was
                  struggling upward.
               She never left our ward, save for a few hours in the morning, to sleep off the
                  fatigue of the night. She seemed endowed with almost miraculous endurance as a
                  nurse. Every day she grew lovelier to my sight, until I thought there never was so
                  beautiful a being. She was very pale, save when some chance word brought up a rich
                  but fleeting color to her cheek. Her form was slender, her height corresponding,
                  yet every motion betokened health; and though very small, she was far removed from
                  lankness.
               Little by little I learned her history. She was a widow, even at the age of
                  seventeen. After her husband's death, her brother and herself, being orphans,
                  lived together ten years, when the war broke out, and he joined the army. He was
                  killed, and his body was sent to his sorrowing sister. From that moment an
                  irresistible desire to nurse the soldiers filled her whole soul. She could not
                  avenge her brother's death, for she was a woman; but she could nurse the brave men
                  who had, like him, given themselves to their country. She offered her services,
                  and was accepted.
               Thus much I learned of Helen Leigh's life. She was alone in the world, bound only
                  to the wounded soldiers, whom she loved for her dead brother's sake. This devotion
                  of hers affected me inexpressibly. For such a woman, what might not a
                  man do and dare?
               "Did you object to your brother joining the army?" I asked her.
               That rich, beautiful glow flashed into he face, with a dash of scorn and surprise
                  at the question.
               "Object! I object!"
               "Pardon me," I said, hastily. "I do not believe you would." And I thought bitterly
                  of one who did.
               "No," she resumed, after a pause, in which I thought she was shedding tears to the
                  memory of her brother. "No, Albert told me that he was called to die for his
                  country; he did not believe that he should live to return, and he flattered me
                  with no vain hopes. And I, believing that dying in such a cause was better than
                  living ingloriously at home, choked back the tears that would have come, and told
                  him to go. I am glad that I did not dampen his spirits by my sadness. I am glad
                  that he died so noble a death. Believe me, my dead brother is better to me than
                  many living ones who did not live his heroic life, and will not die his heroic
                  death."
               My intercourse with my gentle nurse was becoming each day sweeter. I was, all
                  unconsciously to myself, learning to love her better than I had ever loved mortal
                  woman. My unconsciousness was gone, however, when I read the answer to my letter
                  which I had written home by the hand of my comrade, who had lost neither of those
                  valuable members.
               "Henrietta does not write," wrote my mother; "not because you did not address your
                  letter to herself, but because she feels that, in your present state, she will not
                  bind you to your engagement. She bids me say that she grieves for your
                  misfortunes. She shows the amount of her grief by attending, this evening, a large
                  and gay party. I will not pain you, my son, by speaking of her again. You will not
                  grieve. I know, that you see what she might have been to you as a wife."
               "Ah, my mother!" I said to myself. "How little does her love bear
                  comparison with thine!"
               
                  
                     "Love, love, there are soft smiles and tender words,
                     And there are faces skilful to put on
                     The look we trust in—and 'tis mockery all!
                     A faithless mist—a desert vapor wearing
                     The brightness of clear waters, thus to cheat
                     The thirst that semblance kindled!
                     There is none
                     In all this cold and hollow world—no fount
                     Of deep, strong, deathless love, save that within
                     A mother's heart."
                  
               
               I thought how truly had the sweet poet of the affections divined a mother's
                  love.
               Weeks, and even months, I lingered at the hospital. Had I not received the best of
                  care, I must have sunk under my sufferings; not mental sufferings.
                  Strange to say, I not only felt calm and resigned under Henrietta's conduct, but
                  even hilarious at the thought that I was not bound to her.
               "I shall never marry any one, of course," I said to myself; "but I shall have my
                  mother to love me, and perhaps, when the war is over, my gentle nurse may come and
                  live with us, making our home brighter and happier."
               I do not think that I felt very and at the figure which I should make in such
                  indulgent eyes. I fancied myself walking about the garden—on crutches, it is
                  true—but with those two tender friends beside me; and the picture was not
                     very disheartening. I ventured to speak of it to Helen, as I had
                  now learned to call her. I described my mother, and the joy she would have in
                  sharing her home with one who had been so kind to her son. The vivid blushes that
                  bathed her face in crimson light, gave me the initial letters that spoke of
                  something that was not merely friendship. Then I told her of Henrietta, and I
                  showed her my mother's letter. Before she had read it through, she burst into
                  tears.
               "Would Helen Leigh have done thus?" I asked. The sweet face lay pale and tearful
                  upon my heart. I repeated what I had said to myself, "I can marry no one now." And
                  I asked, "Would you have loved me, Helen, if you had seen me in happier days, when
                  I walked among men as straight and unhurt as the proudest form among them?"
               And, amid happy tears and sobs and smiles, she whispered, "Dear, I love you best
                  now!"
               And when the war is past that now harasses this distressed country, Helen is to
                  come home—to the home where for four happy weeks I have been tended hourly by a
                  fond mother, who hails her coming as that of an angel. God be thanked, that my
                  right arm is untouched, and that the other limbs may be replaced by artificial
                  aid, so that the poor cripple may bear once more the semblance of a man! It is
                  worth all the pain I have had, to have ridden myself of a heartless coquette, and
                  to attach to my shattered fortunes a true woman's heart. And to-day I have written
                  to Helen, that a double joy will fill my heart when Peace sits brooding over our
                  country, and Love smiles upon our home.
            
            
               THE TOMB OF JULIET.
               Every stranger who goes to Verona is sure to have his sympathy moved, and his
                  curiosity excited, by what is called "The Tomb of Juliet," and there is no man who
                  has read Shakspeare, that will not hasten to the spot where it lies, regardless at
                  the moment whether it be real or not. It is well known that this part of Italy had
                  furnished to the immortal bard the materials of a tragedy, which, for all the
                  pathetic details of hapless love and devoted constancy, stands unrivalled in any
                  language. And though much of legendary exaggeration is superadded to the
                  circumstances of the catastrophe, yet the main fact is attested by the local
                  history of Verona; and therefore the mind is disposed to admit the probability
                  that the excavated oblong stone, which is now pointed out in the neglected ruins
                  of an old Franciscan monastery, might have once contained the beauteous form of
                  the unhappy Juliet. Count Perisco, one of the native nobility, who has published a
                  very interesting work on the curiosities of Verona, and of the provinces adjacent,
                  thus narrates the melancholy story of Romeo and Juliet:—"In the year 1303, or
                  about that time, Bartholomew della Scula being captain of the Veronese, Romeo de
                  Monticoli was enamored of Juliet de Cappelletti, and she of him, their families
                  being as that time in bitter enmity with each other, on account of petty feuds. As
                  therefore they could not be openly married, a private union took place between
                  them. Shortly afterwards, Romeo having, in an affray of the two factions, killed
                  Tebaldo, the cousin of Juliet, be was obliged to seek for safety in flight, and
                  proceeded to Mantua. His unhappy spouse, afflicted beyond measure, sought
                  commiseration and counsel from the immediate agent of her secret marriage, seeing
                  that there was no longer any hope of a reconciliation between families now still
                  more Incensed against each other than before. Therefore, by a preconcerted
                  arrangement, Juliet procured a sleeping draught, and shortly after, according to
                  common report, yielded up her life. Romeo having been apprised of the dire news,
                  before he heard that she was only apparently dead, resolved, in the bitterness of
                  his anguish, to take poison and die likewise Previously to his doing so, however,
                  not entirely despairing of her life, he went to Verona, and availed himself of the
                  evening hour to enter the monastery. Being here assured that his Juliet had been
                  interred not long before, he swallowed the poison he had with him, and hastened to
                  the tomb, where their mutual friend pointed out the way by a passage beyond that
                  which was ready for his return. The friar wondered very much what had happened to
                  Romeo, unconscious of the hard fate that awaited him. While he endeavored to
                  assure himself that the lady was not in reality dead, the poison began to operate,
                  and now, on the very verge of death, he called on his Juliet with a faint voice.
                  She awoke, and scarcely recognized him. Romeo expired, and Juliet breathed for a
                  moment only to share his hapless doom."
            
            
               We often regret we did not do otherwise, when that very otherwise would in all
                  probability have done for us. Life too often presents us with a
                  choice of evils, rather than of goods. Like the fallen angels of Milton, we all
                  know the evils that we have; but we are ignorant what greater evils we might have
                  encountered by rushing on apparent goods, the consequence of which we
                  know not.—Colton.
               
            
            
               
               
                  
                     THE RIGHT HONORABLE LORD LYNDHURST.
                  
               
               LORD LYNDHURST.
               We present herewith an excellent likeness of John Singleton Copley, Lord
                  Lyndhurst, one of the most distinguished lawyers and statesmen of England, and a
                  man of unblemished reputation. The circumstance of his birth invests him with a
                  peculiar interest on this side of the Atlantic, and particularly in this locality.
                  The ex-chancellor of England is an American by birth, and was born in Boston, in
                  the year 1772. His father, Copley the artist, was the Vandyke of America. Time, as
                  in the case of all true works of art, has added immeasurably to the value of his
                  productions, but they were highly appreciated in his day, as the illustrious names
                  of his numerous sitters testify. Much of his life was passed in England, where he
                  died, and where his fame is preserved by his great historical painting, the "Death
                  of Chatham" The subject of our notice was taken to England by his father, studied
                  law, and was called to the bar in 1804. As a politician, the outset of his career
                  was marked by strong radicalism, but he afterwards drifted over to the opposite
                  side. The law richly rewarded its votary. In 1826 he was appointed Master of the
                  Rolls, succeeded Eldon as Lord Chancellor, and was raised to the peerage. He
                  resigned the great seal in 1830, was Lord Baron of the Exchequer till 1834,
                  resumed the seal for another year, again resigned and was a third time appointed
                  Lord Chancellor in 1541, remaining in office till 1846. He has been the recipient
                  of various honors, and bears the civic titles of D. C. L. and F. R. S. It is a
                  fact to be remarked that all the greatest English lawyers are long-lived. On
                  examination it will, however, be found that there is nothing extraordinary in the
                  matter. In order to enable a man to go through the amount of work which alone can
                  constitute a successful barrister, you must presume a physical constitution of
                  iron, a capability of adapting his habits to the requirements of his calling, and
                  an organization in which the nervous system is not too predominant. The demands of
                  one who undertakes to reach the Woolsack or the Bench, are perfectly well
                  understood, and have been reduced to pithy phrases, such as Lord Eldon's, "that a
                  barrister must live like a hermit and work like a horse;" or the cynical aphorism,
                  that to be a great lawyer or a good judge, you must have a bad heart and a good
                  digestion. There are a few instances in which successful advocates at the English
                  bar have for a time triumphed, by the more force of energy and will, over
                  deficiencies of bodily organization; but it has been almost invariably found that
                  in these cases that one day they unexpectedly broke down and never recovered.
                  Among the body of peers which are designated Law Lords, there are some notable
                  examples of the theory above stated. Without doubt, however, the greatest
                  phenomenon among aged lawyers and statesmen, is Lord Lyndhurst.
            
            
               THE MOST IMPORTANT BUSINESS.—The pursuit of knowledge tends to cultivate and to

                  become an honest man. As such, one will abhor injustice, lies, pride and avarice.
                  If a person, though possessed of the finest understanding and the greatest
                  knowledge, should be a liar, cruel, proud and covetous, he will be hated and
                  shunned like a wild beast

                  CHAPTER XIX.
                  A STRANGE SURPRISE.
                  IT was nearly dark when Alfred reached the residence of Sir William in Hanover
                     Street. He ascended the steps and followed the admiral into the hall, where he
                     waited till one of the servants had called the secondary.
                  "Mr. McIvar," said the old gentleman, "I wish you to take this young gentleman
                     with you to Walbourne's and there see that he has clothing suitable for a guest
                     of mine. He is the one of whom I have often spoken. You know him?"
                  "Yes," returned the secretary, as he cast a kind kook upon the youth.
                  Our here could not object to this arrangement, and with a word of thanks upon
                     his lips, be followed McIvar back to the carriage, and they proceeded stones to
                     Walbourne's. The fashionable tailor had any quantity of superb clothing on band
                     which had never been called for by those who had ordered it, and without
                     difficulty Alfred was fitted with a suit. As he surveyed his counterfeit in the
                     large mirror, he could not but feel a thrill of new pleasure; for, say what we
                     will, outward appearance is-not to be overlooked in this world of ours. Dress
                     may not "make the man;" but dress does make the man of fine
                     feelings more agreeable to himself, and more pleasing to others. Labor has her
                     garb of "stout contents," and labor is honorable in that garb; but the hand
                     that sweats in the dust of toil should not go unwashed to the tea-table.
                     Neatness and comeliness have their laws, and to a certain extent even fashion
                     may be a just criterion.
                  When Alfred returned to the dwelling of Sir William, he was shown into a large
                     drawing room, where he was told that the admiral would soon join him. For a
                     little time the youth was completely dazzled by the gorgeousness of things
                     about him. The large shaded lamps sent a soft light around upon the rich
                     carpets, and the heavy, carved furniture, and the old pictures that looked
                     forth from their gilded frames seemed like tiny spots of nature in the
                     distance, seen through golden windows
                  A portrait that hung against the wall opposite to the door, had just attracted
                     the youth's attention, and he was so deeply buried in the contemplation of the
                     beautiful features which were there revealed, that he noticed not the opening
                     of the door, nor the sound of the light footfall that approached him; nor was
                     he aroused till he felt a hand upon his shoulder, and beard a low, sweet voice
                     pronounce his name.
                  He started to his feet, and, as he turned, his eyes rested upon a face of more
                     than ideal beauty and loveliness. The lips upon which he gazed were half
                     parted, and a gentle smile was breaking about them.
                  "Ella!" he whispered, half fearful that his dream was false. "Ella!"
                  "Your own little storm child," returned the fair girl.
                  Both her bands were extended as she spoke, and her eyes were fixed with a
                     beaming look upon the face of the youth. He thought not then of the maiden who
                     stood before him with the first dawn of blushing womanhood upon her checks; he
                     only thought of the little child he had wrested from the storm grasp—of the
                     gentle being who had been his companion in the flowery walks of boyhood, and of
                     her who had been the love light of many a dark hour of tempest and tribulation.
                     With these thoughts, these feelings, he drew the beautiful Ella to his bosom,
                     and pressed his lips upon her fair check.
                  "And you, too, here, he murmured, as he again gazed into Ella's face. "Her Sir
                     William been kind to us both?"
                  "Ah, Alfred I have found a father in Sir William."
                  "Father!" uttered the youth, dropping the heads he here, while a sudden shade
                     of something like four passed over his features.
                  "Yes, and a good, generous father he is," said Ella, with a happy look.
                  "Thank God for the blessing he has conferred upon you!" ejaculated the youth,
                     as he sank back into his seat.
                  
                  The beautiful girl sat down by his side, all unconscious of the sudden pang
                     that found its way to Alfred's heart. She knew not that in her present sphere
                     her companion felt that she was removed from him forever.
                  But so it was. He had held the sweet companion of his boyhood in his soul's
                     memory for years, and he had learned to look upon that image as the type of one
                     who belonged to him in love and sympathy. But the scene was changed. The child
                     he had taken to his young bosom from the grasp of death, was no longer a
                     traveller in the same path with himself, and he felt that henceforth she could
                     only be his companion in the memory of days that had passed. But the youth
                     hushed the feelings that were rising in his bosom, and once more he turned with
                     a smile towards the fair being at his side.
                  "Ella," he asked, "have you seen anything of our old protector since you left
                     the beacon house?"
                  "Once I thought I saw him," returned the girl, while an expression of sadness
                     overshadowed her features. "I stood by the window and saw an old man upon the
                     opposite side of the square. It looked like old Luke, and I ran out to meet
                     him, but when I had gained the street he was gone. I have seen nothing of him
                     since, nor have I heard anything of him."
                  At this moment Sir William entered the apartment, and Alfred quickly arose to
                     meet him.
                  "Ah, you look like another man, upon my soul," exclaimed the old man, as he
                     took our hero's hand. "What do you think of the surprise you have met?"
                  "It was a heavenly surprise, sir," returned Alfred.
                  "I thought so. My pretty Ella must seem a very sister to you!"
                  "Yes," said the youth in a low tone, while his eyes wandered to where the fair
                     girl sat.
                  "I knew she must; and it seems, too, that you were the one who saved her."
                  "Yes. I took her from the cold bosom of one who clung to her even in death. I
                        think she would have died had I not discovered her as I
                     did."
                  "And God knows you shall ever have my warmest gratitude—and something
                     substantial, too. But has Ella told you the story of her early life?"
                  "No, sir."
                  "Then you are yet in the dark. But I will explain the matter. Let's see—it is
                     thirteen years ago that her mother died. How time flies away. I then had
                     command of a squadron in the Indies. My wife was taken with one of those
                     malignant fevers, and she died in one week from the time of her first sickness.
                     She left my Ella not quite four years of age, and I at once made up my mind to
                     send the child to England. I wrote letters to my friends in London, with whom I
                     had planned that Ella should remain till I came home, and gave them into the
                     hands of the captain of the ship in which my child was to sail. The child's
                     nurse, and two more of my female servants, were sent to take charge of my
                     little daughter. Of course the letters never reached their destination, and
                     when the old light keeper sent word out that he had found a child—as I
                     understand he did—there was no one in England who mistrusted that my child had
                     left the Indies.
                  "When I came home, which was nearly two years afterwards, I thought my child
                     had perished. The account of the wreck of the Chesham reached me in Calcutta,
                     and that gave out that every soul on board the ship perished. Not a thought
                     entered my head that my child could have been saved, and I gave her up as lost.
                     Seven years passed away after my return, and during that time I divided my
                     attention between my friends in London and my estates in Cumberland. You
                     remember our meeting at the little inn near Egremont? When you told me your
                     story then, you said something about a girl who had been saved. My then present
                     interest in other matters prevented me from noticing the circumstance; but ere
                     long after I set out on the road your words came back to my mind, and by
                     degrees the idea of my own child became associated with the little girl of whom
                     you had spoken.
                  "When I returned to London, I hastened off to Devonshire. I found the residence
                     of the old light, keeper—and there I found my daughter. She had grown to be a
                     large girl, but I knew her the moment I saw her. She had retained her Christian
                     name—Ella Deane—for that was what we always called her, though she had
                     forgotten the name of her family. The facts were as clear as though my child
                     had never been absent from me for a moment; but it gave me a pang to take her
                     away from that old man. He wept like a child, and I thought his heart would
                     break. I asked him to come and live with me, but he refused. He said he had
                     nothing on earth to live for, and I believe he spoke the truth. It was a heavy
                     blow for him. Ah, Ella—does it affect you so?"
                  "Excuse me, my dear father," said the fair girl, as she wiped the tears from
                     her face. "Alas, poor Luke! I cannot think of him but with sorrow. He was a
                     good man. He was a father to me when I had none else to protect me, and I shall
                     ever love him. Alas, poor Luke! what would I not give to see him?"
                  "But tell me, Sir William," uttered Alfred, struggling to keep back his tears,
                     "do you not know anything of that old man now?"
                  "No. He left the light-house shortly after I took Ella home, and I have heard
                     nothing of him since. I have sent to Devonshire repeatedly, but could gain no
                     clue to his whereabouts."
                  Gradually the conversation took another turn, though it was a long time ere
                     Alfred could draw his thoughts from the unfortunate protector of his boyhood.
                     At length, however, he overcame the sadness that loaded his soul, and then he
                     had to recount the scenes of his own life. He had an interested listener in
                     Ella, and often did he feel the warm blood rushing to his face as he met the
                     earnest expression of her lustrous eyes.
                  It was late when Alfred was shown to his chamber and when he was once more
                     alone, what a rushing of various emotions filled his bosom. Into that one day
                     were crowded the prison—the court—the trial—the host of applauding people—the
                     unexpected protector—and last, the meeting with Ella. It is no wonder that it
                     was long ere he slept, nor is it a wonder that when he did sleep his dreams
                     were various and wild. If he dreamed of Ella, it was as one might dream of airy
                     castles which had substance only in vain wishes.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XX.
                  THE HEART'S SECRETS, AND ITS TRIALS.
                  ON the very next morning after Alfred had found a protection beneath the roof
                     of Sir William Brent, the latter received orders to prepare to go to Portsmouth
                     to attend a court-martial. The call was an urgent one, and the old admiral had
                     to obey it. His secretary was to attend him, and our hero was to be left almost
                     alone with Ella.
                  "You can make yourself comfortable till my return," said Sir William, speaking
                     to the youth, just previous to his departure. "There is my library, and if you
                     at any time wish to take a ride, the coachman will obey your wishes. I shall be
                     absent two weeks, at least, and perhaps three; but when I return I will attend
                     to your interests. However, a few weeks of rest will not harm you. And you, my
                     child," continued the baronet, turning to Ella, "will of course do everything
                     in your power to make Alfred comfortable. You owe him a debt of deep gratitude,
                     and you must not forget that I owe him the life of my child."
                  Sir William set off, and the storm children were once more left to enjoy each
                     other's society. For a week there was a mutual constraint. They conversed and
                     read together, but their conversation was formal, and the reading was resorted
                     to for the purpose of relieving the tedium. Both those hearts were swelling
                     with thoughts and feelings for which there had been no utterance, except by the
                     soft language of those tones and glances which could not be restrained. Alfred
                     told over and over again the tale of his trials and sufferings upon the sea;
                     and often were the scenes of those days, when both were children under the care
                     of the old light-keeper, reverted to and talked about.
                  During the second week, Alfred opened his heart more to the feelings that lay
                     so closely about it, and he smiled oftener, and spoke more freely. The effect
                     was not lost upon Ella, for her very joyous looks told how happy she was, and
                     how much she loved the society of him who had thus been left to bear her
                     company.
                  The third week had opened, and Sir William had not returned. Alfred and Ella
                     were sitting in the baronet's library. It was evening, and they had been
                     conversing upon topics connected with their childhood. They were seated upon
                     the same soft lounge, and they had been more than usually thoughtful.
                  "O," uttered Ella, "I shall never tire in looking back upon those sweet scenes
                     of my early childhood."
                  "We were happy then," said Alfred.
                  "Yes, and we are happy now."
                  "Happy in the present, Ella; but there is a
                     future."
                  "And there must be happiness there, too," said the fair girl.
                  "Perhaps so," returned Alfred, gazing half sadly into the face of his
                     companion.
                  Their eyes met, Over the face of Ella there came a strange look of unmistakable
                     love, and gently she put forth her hand and rested it upon Alfred's arm.
                  "Tell me your thoughts?" she said, in a whisper.
                  "They are such as may not be spoken," returned the young man, while his nether
                     lip trembled.
                  "Then they were not of me."
                  "Of you?"
                  "If you would not speak them, how can they be?"
                  "Ah, Ella—they are of you."
                  "Then speak them."
                  "Would indeed I dared."
                  The fair girl started and gazed more earnestly into her companion's face. She
                     saw the trembling of the lips, and she saw too, the glittering tear that stood
                     upon his dark lashes. She moved her hand closer to his own, and soon it was
                     nestled there.
                  "Tell me, Alfred," she whispered, while her heart fluttered till its beatings
                     were almost audible, "the thoughts that move you thus."
                  "Can you not read them?"
                  "Yes."
                  "Then why should I tell them?"
                  "They might be music to my soul."
                  "Ella!"
                  "Can you not understand me, Alfred?"
                  "O, I cannot be mistaken," exclaimed our hero. "You do know my heart, and you
                     can return me the warmest feelings of your own. You have unloosed my tongue,
                     and I will speak. I love you, Ella, with my whole soul I love you."
                  "And of that you were thinking?"
                  "Yes, and of that I have thought since I came beneath this roof."
                  "And are you not happy in that love?"
                  "Happy?"
                  "Ay, Alfred—happy? You used to be happy when you loved me."
                  "Yes, yes, but O, 'twas not such love as this. Then I felt you were all my own,
                     and the affections of my young heart clung about you to protect and shield you.
                     Now you no longer need my protection. We are grown up, and the sentiments we
                     cultivate will be firmly fixed in our fates. I cannot hide it from me that my
                     love would be dangerous now."
                  Dangerous?" repeated Ella, with a startled air.
                  "Ay."
                  "I do not surely understand you."
                  "You can see it all, Ella; but yet I can speak more plainly."
                  "Speak," the fair girl whispered.
                  "Then since you bid me, you shall know my heart. I have told you that I love
                     you; but O, mine is a love that must not be cherished unless it might live in
                     the presence of its object evermore. In short, there is one holy name that can
                     alone give forth its image—one name alone on all the earth that can syllable
                     its thought."
                  "And that name?" murmured Ella.
                  "Wife," uttered Alfred, in a low, thrilling tone.
                  Ella bowed her head, and her hand trembled violently. But soon her eyes were
                     fixed again upon her companion, and a fond, affectionate smile was breaking
                     around her finely chiselled lips.
                  "Alfred," she said, with only a slight tremulousness in her tone, "you have
                     told me that which I had only fondly hoped might be true."
                  "But can there be hope for me?"
                  "Why should there not be? Your heart can feel no more than can mine. Ah,
                     Alfred, you little know me, if you think I could forget all those tender
                     sympathies and gentle deeds of kindness that were the sunbeams of my girlhood.
                     No, no, my heart is all your own—all-all."
                  "O, God bless you, sweet Ella!" ejaculated the youth, as he pressed the fair
                     girl to his bosom.
                  Their lips met, and with that simple kiss was locked the chain that mortal hand
                     might never put in sunder
                  Moments passed—bliss-laden moments, ere Alfred spoke again. Then a cloud
                     settled over his features, and his deep blue eye looked sad.
                  "Ah, I knew you loved me," he said; "but there is a third whose will must be
                     law, that shall govern our fates. Your father's wishes may not be in my
                     favor."
                  "O, Alfred, you wrong my father, if you think he would oppose us in our love.
                     He is too generous, too kind, too noble-hearted, for that."
                  "I know he is kind and generous; but I fear you misunderstand him."
                  "Ah, no. It is you who misunderstand him, Alfred. He would not have left us
                     here together, had he entertained objections to our union. What—what do I not
                     owe to you?" she continued, with increasing warmth. "What does he not owe you?
                     I know that Sir William will not oppose us. He will not crash the holiest
                     blossom of my whole opening womanhood."
                  And so the sanguine girl thought. She looked upon her companion with the whole
                     loving confidence of her ardent soul, and she knew not that earth had an
                     obstacle to throw in the way of her hopes. But with Alfred the case was
                     different. His life had been one of disappointment, and even now he could not
                     shake off a heavy load of fear that weighed him down.
                  "Come, come," murmured Ella, as she noticed the deepening sorrow upon her
                     lover's countenance; "be happy as you used to be in years gone by. We will be
                     as we were then, and through our whole life we will remain so. You shall love
                     me and care for me, and I will share your every sorrow, and never, never cease
                     to love you. Come, be happy now, and smile as you used to smile."
                  "Blessed, blessed girl!" cried Alfred, while the warm tears started forth from
                     his eyes. "You will make me hope in spite of myself."
                  "No, no, you shall hope with a hope that hath foundation. Love shall bid you
                     hope; and love is a gentle, yet powerful monitor."
                  "O, would that I could throw every doubt away. Would that I could see the
                     future as bright as your love's pencil paints it."
                  "Hark! O, Alfred, that is my father's step. Some time you shall ask him all.
                     You will—and I will be your second. He will not refuse us."
                  Alfred opened a book that lay by his side, and while he was yet endeavoring to
                     remove the tear-marks from his face, the old admiral entered. Ella sprang to
                     meet him. He kissed her fair brow, and then he turned to Alfred.
                  "Home once more," he said, as he grasped the young man by the hand. "Ah, we had
                     some bad business at Portsmouth. There's to be a hanging at the end of our
                     work."
                  Alfred trembled like an aspen, and his face turned as pale as death. Sir
                     William then for the first time noticed the marks of the youth's tears. A dark
                     shadow flitted across his own face, and for some moments he gazed fixedly into
                     the featured of his young guest.
                  "Ella," he said, turning to his child, and seeming to speak more for the
                     purpose of saying something behind which to hide his real thoughts than to
                     convey any news of importance, "we shall have company tomorrow. My old friend,
                     Doctor Holland, came on with me from Portsmouth. He was my surgeon for many
                     years; and as for you, Alfred, I think that between the doctor and myself we
                     can bring about a good berth for you."
                  The young man expressed his gratitude, and shortly afterwards he arose and left
                     the room. A thought had entered his mind that made his head reel with wild
                     emotion, and he only sought to be alone.
                  "Stop, Ella," said the old man, after Alfred had gone, "I wish to speak with
                     you."
                  Ella stepped back to the seat from which she had risen, and her father
                     continued:
                  "What is the matter with Alfred?"
                  "Matter, father?"
                  "Yes. He had been weeping when I came in, had he not?"
                  Ella hesitated a moment, and then she arose and approached her father. She
                     leaned over, and with her hand resting upon his arm, she said, in a tone of
                     calm trust:
                  "He had been weeping father; but it was from fears that have no foundation. I
                     tried to assure him that his fate would be a happier one than he had tried to
                     imagine."
                  "But what was it, my child?" asked Sir William, drawing Ella upon his knee.
                  His voice trembled, and upon his countenance were shades of fear.
                  "Can you not guess, father?"
                  "I would rather you should tell me."
                  "Then I will, for surely I could wish to keep nothing from my father. Alfred
                     has confessed to me—no, no—I made him tell me—that he loved me, and he feared
                     that you would reject him. But I knew that you— What ails you, father?"
                  "O, my child, in my simple trust I did not think of this!" exclaimed the old
                     man, trembling violently.
                  "Did not think of what, father?"
                  "Of this thing that has happened."
                  "But what is it? Surely you misunderstand me," returned Ella, drawing her arm
                     about her parent's neck. "I told you that Alfred loved me—that he loved me with
                     his whole noble, generous and pure soul; and God knows how fondly I love him in
                     return. O, I knew I could assure him that you were too kind to refuse him my
                     hand. I knew you would not refuse me the happiest boon I could ask on
                     earth."
                  "And did you assure him all this?"
                  "Certainly. But what makes you look so strangely, father? What makes you
                     tremble so? O, heaven forbid that I have done aught to pain you."
                  "Alas! my child, you know not what you have done. I was a fool to leave you
                     thus; but I thought you would look upon each other only as brother and sister.
                     Ella, this can never be."
                  "O you mean not that. You do not mean that I may not be the wife of
                     Alfred?"
                  "It cannot be. I will de anything for your happiness, anything for your
                     comfort; but I cannot do this."
                  "Why, why,—O, why?"
                  "Do not ask me now!"
                  "Is not Alfred noble and good?"
                  "Yes."
                  "Is he not virtuous?"
                  "Yes."
                  "Is he not just and honorable?"
                  "Yes."
                  "Is be not well educated and gentlemanly?"
                  "Yes."
                  "And did he not snatch me from the hand of death, when no one else was by to
                     give me succor?"
                  "Yes."
                  "And has he not a right to love me, in that he it was who planted in my mind
                     the first seeds of pure and holy thought? who first led me to a knowledge of my
                     God and my Saviour?"
                  "I cannot deny it."
                  "Then what shall keep us now asunder? Is it because he is poor?—because—"
                  "Stop, stop, my child," cried the old man, in tones of agony. "You know not all
                     you have to fear. I cannot tell you now, for I must first see and converse with
                     Alfred. O, God, would that he had never come to my home! I did not think of
                     this—I did not think of it!"
                  Ella was now moved more by the strange agony of her aged parent than she was by
                     the thought of what he had said, and throwing her arms about his neck, she
                     imparted a warm kiss upon his cheek.
                  "There, my sweet child, go to your room now. O, Heaven grant that this blow
                     fall not heavily upon you. Dear up, Ella, and for your own sake, for my sake,
                     try to forget what has passed."
                  The fair girl took a step towards the door, and then she stopped. She turned
                     her swimming eyes upon her father—she tottered forward—and again she sunk upon
                     his bosom.
                  "O, my father! I cannot bear this! Do not tear my heart thus from its early,
                     only love!"
                  "Leave me now," the old man uttered. "I will see you again."
                  The stricken girl turned away, and as the door closed upon her, the old admiral
                     sank almost senseless into his seat.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXI.
                  THE NIGHT OF LIFE GROWS DARKER YET.
                  ON the following morning Ella came not down to breakfast as usual. Sir William
                     looked sad and heavy-hearted, and Alfred was full of fear and trembling. He had
                     vague forebodings of evil, and he thought that the sea of bitter trial was
                     again to open its tempestuous passage for him.
                  Early in the forenoon, while Sir William and our hero were in one of the lower
                     drawing-rooms, where they had sat for half an hour in utter silence, one of the
                     servants handed the baronet a card.
                  "Show him in," said the old man, as he read the name upon the missive.
                  It was an elderly gentleman who was introduced, and he wore the uniform of a
                     surgeon in the royal navy. He was presented to our here as Dr. Robert
                     Holland.
                  
                  "Harrold, did you say, Sir William?" asked the doctor, as he gazed into
                     Alfred's face.
                  The doctor pulled the old admiral one side, and for some moments they conversed
                     in a low whisper.
                  Holland started across the room as soon as he had done whispering, and a dozen
                     times did he pace the length of the room with quick, nervous strides.
                  "Why what has possessed you, doctor!" asked Sir William, in surprise.
                  "O, nothing," returned Holland; and as he answered he sank into a chair, took
                     up a book, opened it bottom end upwards, and then began to toss his foot in a
                     strange manner.
                  The baronet regarded him for some moments in silence.
                  "Doctor," he said at length, "will you excuse me a few moments?"
                  "Medicine chest isn't here."
                  "I say, will you excuse me for a short time?"
                  "Excuse — oh? You haven't done anything wrong?"
                  "You don't understand me," uttered Sir William, not a little puzzled. "I wish
                     to leave you for a while."
                  "Ah—O—yes, yes,—now I see. Yes, yes," said the surgeon, arousing from his deep
                     reverie. "You can go. Yes, yes. I'll stay till you come back."
                  The baronet beckoned for Alfred to follow him, and then turning from the room
                     he led the way to the library. When once there he closed the door, and having
                     bid the young man to be seated, he sank into his own great chair.
                  Several times Sir William seemed on the point of speaking, but his words did
                     not come forth. Minutes passed away, and yet the two cast occasional glances
                     upon each other—nervous, uneasy glances, without uttering a word. The silence
                     was becoming oppressive, and at length the old man spoke.
                  "Alfred," he said, in a tone of deep feeling and anxiety, "the hour has come in
                     which I must be plain with you. It would give me pain to be the instrument of
                     unhappiness to you, but when you know all, you will not, cannot, blame me. I
                     conversed with Ella last evening, and she told me all that had transpired
                     between you. That subject upon which you dwelt last night must go no farther.
                     My child can never be to you more than she is now. Perhaps I was to blame for
                     leaving you and Ella together, but I did not hold a suspicion that there would
                     arise between you any other feelings than those which a brother and sister
                     might feel."
                  "Pardon me, Sir William," returned the youth, with a look and tone in which
                     were shadowed forth all the anguish of that aching heart. "I could not keep
                     back the fond love that for so many years has been the sunlight of my dreary
                     path. I could not hide from Ella the heart that must be ever hers. But I know I
                     may never be happy in the possession of her hand. I am too poor, too humble for
                     such aspiration."
                  "Ah, Alfred, you misunderstand me. Poverty and humble birth weigh nor against
                     you. O, it is something deeper than that."
                  The young man started, and again that deadly pallor overspread his features.
                     His breath came heavy and quick, and his head was bowed. When he looked up, his
                     features had grown calmer—the muscles had assumed a rigid expression—the thin
                     lips were almost colorless, and the deep blue eyes were swimming in a sort of
                     painful glare.
                  "Sir William," he said, in a tone of strange, unnatural calmness, "do you know
                     the story of my family—of my earliest life?"
                  "Yes."
                  "Then I would hear it."
                  "I will tell you all, Alfred, all; and then you will know why I have done as I
                     have. Your father was Sir John Landford, and he was a rear admiral in our
                     navy."
                  "Can it be so?" ejaculated the youth, closing his eyes, and sinking back. "Now
                     I know it all. But go on, sir."
                  "Your father and myself were brought up together from childhood. We were
                     midshipmen together, and together we passed through the various grades till we
                     were both admirals. Sir John had command of a fleet in the Mediterranean during
                     the last French war, and he surrendered his own ship into the hands of the
                     French at Toulon. He did it without striking hardly a blow in defence; and for
                     doing it he received from the French government one hundred thousand
                     pounds!"
                  "O, mercy!" groaned Alfred.
                  "He received it in promissory notes and drafts signed and sealed by the French
                     minister. This business was done very secretly, but such a remarkable piece of
                     work could not remain a secret. The French minister told the story of his
                     dealings with Sir John, and in a very short time our own government got hold of
                     the matter. An exchange of prisoners was quickly made, and the admiral was
                     brought home and tried. In a small department of one of his chests were found
                     the notes of the French minister, and also all the letters he had received from
                     the enemy. These letters were all of them genuine, bearing the unmistakable
                     hand and seal of the Frenchman, and the guilt was too apparent to admit of even
                     a doubt. Shortly before this trial Sir John received news of the death of his
                     wife. All about him was dark and sunless, and he made but a feeble plea for
                     innocence. Of course he was found guilty of the most dangerous species of high
                     treason, and condemned to be hanged. After his condemnation, he barely answered
                     when spoken to, offering no assertions of innocence. He asked to be hung on
                     shipboard, and the request was granted. I had to attend the execution. I saw
                     him hanged, and I saw his corse consigned to the deep grave of the ocean. He
                     had begged that he might be thus buried."
                  "O, terrible!" groaned Alfred.
                  "It was hard," resumed Sir William, while the big tears rolled down his
                     furrowed cheeks; "it was hard; but it may have been just. Before your father
                     died he made me promise that I would look after his child, then but a year old.
                     I went to Gloucester, whither it had been carried, but I found that the little
                     boy had gone. The people told me that two men had come and taken him, and that
                     they came with a written order from Sir John himself. By the description I
                     received, I knew they must have been Marrok Pettrell and Mark Bronkon, two
                     petty officers who had belonged on board your father's ship, and who had been
                     quite conspicuous at the trial.
                  "When I met you, four years ago in Cumberland, I knew you at once, and if I had
                     a doubt, it was put at rest when you told me your story. Then I meant to have
                     helped you, out of the love I bore your father; but now I owe the debt to you.
                     I have obtained you a commission in the navy, but you must still bear the name
                     of Harrold. The name of your father is sunk in—"
                  "Stop! stop!" cried Alfred, springing to his feet. "Heap not more infamy upon
                     my father's name, for by the Judge of all things, I behave he was
                     innocent."
                  "It was hard, Alfred, hard, to believe him guilty; but so the world must ever
                     hold him. Can you wonder now that I could not link my daughter's name with your
                     own?"
                  "No, no, Sir William. I am used to misfortune, and I have schooled myself to
                     bear it. This earth has no happiness for me. Since the first moment of my
                     childhood's memory I have pursued the path of honor with unwavering footsteps.
                     I have courted virtue with the whole ardor of my soul; and though sin has act
                     against me in wild tempests of fearful power, yet never have I turned a single
                     step with its flood. But misery is mine. I was born to it, and it must be my
                     lot. I do not blame you, sir."
                  A moment the youth hesitated. Then his eye sparkled—his bosom heaved, and with
                     strange vehemence he exclaimed:
                  "But by heavens! sir, my father was an innocent man! O, why were those papers
                     snatched from me!"
                  "Papers!" repeated the baronet.
                  "Yes, yes—papers which Mark Bronkon gave me." And Alfred related the
                     circumstances as the reader already knows them.
                  When he had concluded, Sir William arose from his seat and began to pace the
                     floor. When he stopped it was directly in front of the youth, and there was an
                     expression of more than common anxiety upon his features.
                  "Would to God I could have seen those papers," he uttered. "But I see not how
                     he could have been innocent. He must have had a hand in the affair, for on that
                     night there was not a sentry on post. On board that ship, anchored within
                     thirteen miles of an enemy's heavy battery, there were but one or two men on
                     deck, and even they gave no alarm when the enemy's boats came alongside. Yet I
                     would that I could have seen those papers."
                  "They are lost now! Lost forever!" murmured Alfred, burying his face in his
                     hands.
                  A long silence ensued, which was at length broken by the baronet.
                  "Alfred," he said, "you must promise me that you will not think of Ella again
                     in any other light than that of a friend!"
                  "Anything; I can promise anything now," returned the youth, in a tone of utter
                     dejection. "Anything of earth I can now give up without another pang. The
                     death-angel alone can lift me to enjoyment again. Go, sir—go tell Ella all.
                     Tell her to pray for me sometimes, and to think of me as one who loved her
                     truly and well. You will not forget that I—I—"
                  The poor youth choked with emotion. He lifted his eyes towards the old man, and
                     with a faint murmur upon his lips—a murmur that bore no palpable word upon its
                     breath—he turned and left the room.
                  Sir William would have followed him, but he could not—he was too much overcome.
                     When he did at length arise to go, he was met by his daughter.
                  "Where is Alfred?" she asked.
                  "He has just left me, my child."
                  "And what did you tell him? O, you did not refuse him as you did me. You told
                     him that he might stay and make me happy; that I might be his own Ella forever.
                     You did, didn't you, my father?"
                  The old man sank back into his seat entirely overcome by this fresh attack upon
                     his already weeping soul. It was a long time before he could answer; but at
                     length he whispered into Ella's ear the whole tale of Alfred's misfortune, and
                     of the ignominy that hung about his name.
                  "And must he suffer for this?" exclaimed the fair girl, with an earnestness her
                     father had little expected. "O, my father, has not Alfred already suffered
                     enough? Let me go to him. Let me go and pour the balm of peace over his
                     tortured soul. He was ever noble—ever good, to me. He loves me fondly,
                     devotedly. O, let me go!"
                  "Hush, my child. You know not what you ask. Look forth upon the world, upon the
                     future, and see my child linked for life with the child of one who was publicly
                     hanged!"
                  "The world! The future!" repeated Ella, with a
                     heaving bosom. "I carry my world and my future in my own soul. O, lay not the
                     blame of a father's crime at the door of the suffering son. Let us rather bless
                     him with the love-light of our kind smiles. O, we can make him happy! It lays
                     in our power to make his life all bright and joyous. Shall we refuse!"
                  "O, Ella, you know not what you ask. Say no more—say no more, or I shall suffer
                     more than I can bear. If you would not see your poor father's head brought in
                     sorrow to the grave, think of this thing no more."
                  Sir William was kind, but his family pride was strong. Ella knew it, and she
                     felt that he would not bend.
                  "God have mercy on him!" the poor girl ejaculated. "He will have no home
                     now."
                  "Yes, yes, my child. I have already provided a good place for him."
                  "Alas! I fear he will not accept it. But let us go and find him. Let me at
                     least see him once more."
                  Sir William started up from his seat. A sudden thought flashed across his mind
                     that Alfred might have left the house. He had not thought of such a thing
                     before, but now the fear came upon him. He left the library and descended to
                     the drawing-room, but Alfred was not there. He went to the hall, and the
                     youth's hat was gone.
                  "Father, he has gone!" murmured the fair girl, as she leaned her head upon the
                     bosom of her parent.
                  The old man had no word to say. His brain reeled, and he tottered back, and
                     with his child upon his bosom he sank down upon a fauteuil that stood against
                     the wall. He felt that the youth to whom he owed the life of his daughter had
                     fled from him, and that he had gone forth with new misery in his soul. He
                     thought of his child, too; and he groaned in the heaviness of his grief.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXII.
                  THE FIRST STREAK OF DAWN.
                  WITH a dizzy, aching head, Alfred hastened away from the dwelling of Sir
                     William Brent. He could not stay there and feel the degradation which had
                     fallen upon him. With hurried steps he moved on, and at length he turned
                     towards the churchyard in Westminster, where Bronkon had told him his mother
                     was buried. He reached the place, and easily gained access to the yard. He
                     found a white marble block—a simple, plain memento—and on it read: 
                        "CAROLINE, Wife of Sir John Landford, Bart."
                     
                  
                  Alfred leaned against the cold stone, and the warm tears flowed freely forth.
                     He sank down upon his knees, and his heart felt lighter when he had prayed.
                     Once more he had resolved to walk straight on in the path of duty, though that
                     path might seem dark as utter night.
                  Over an hour did the youth remain in that home of the mouldering dead; and when
                     he at length turned his steps away, the tears had been dried from his face, but
                     his heart was sad. He knew not which way to turn, for he had no home, no
                     destination on earth. He turned to take one more look upon the churchyard, and
                     then he moved away.
                  He took his course towards the river, but ere he had gained the piers he was
                     startled by hearing his own name pronounced. He looked around, and near him saw
                     an oldish-looking man with a gray beard and slouched hat, who was closely
                     regarding him. Our hero again started to pass on, when the stranger called to
                     him a second time.
                  "Alfred," said the man.
                  "That's my name," returned the youth, utterly unable to recognize the man who
                     had called him.
                  "Just come with me," said the stranger.
                  "For what?"
                  "I will tell you something you would like to know."
                  "But first I should like to know you."
                  "That wouldn't do you any good. Come with me, and you shall have reason to
                     thank me."
                  Alfred still hesitated. He had never seen the man before, that he could
                     remember, and, besides, he looked rough and uninviting.
                  "Tell me who you are, and then I may go with you."
                  "I cannot tell here; but just follow me a short distance, and you shall know
                     what you ask, and more, too. Come."
                  "Tell me your business first. I know you not."
                  "Don't fool away your time too long, or you may lose what you might wish much
                     to gain," said the stranger, with a show of impatience. "I will not reveal
                     myself here in the street, but come to that old tavern there, where you see the
                     sign of the pipe and tankard, and you shall know me. Come, if you choose."
                  As the man spoke he started towards the place pointed out. Alfred hesitated but
                     a moment longer, and then he followed. He knew of no danger to apprehend. The
                     stranger and our hero entered the tavern together. It was a dirty place, and in
                     the tap-room were some dozen villanous-looking follows engaged in smoking and
                     drinking. Alfred's companion beckoned to the greasy publican and asked for a
                     private room. The fellow moved his corpulent body with wonderful alacrity,
                     seeming to look upon the stranger with a deferential air, and soon the room was
                     provided.
                  The man turned the key in the lock of the door, and then turned towards our
                     hero.
                  "Alfred, don't you know me?"
                  "I do not remember you," returned the youth, vainly endeavoring to call to mind
                     some scene in which a man with such looks had borne a part.
                  "Ha, ha, ha! I shall feel safe now," uttered the fellow; and he pulled the gray
                     beard from his face.
                  "Callum!" uttered our hero, in blank astonishment.
                  "Paul Callum, at your service," returned the escaped pirate. "You don't wonder
                     that I keep close, do you? Poor fellows are we who dare not look honest men in
                     the face. But that don't mind now. I've been dodging about Lunnun these three
                     weeks, trying to get a sight of you, and now you've hove in sight. Tell me,
                     Alfred, didn't ye lose something when you were cast away on the Cornwall
                     coast?"
                  "Lose?—yes, yes!" cried the youth, starting forward.
                  "What was it?"
                  "A package."
                  "Done up in oiled silk?"
                  "Yes, yes."
                  "Well, don't look so frightened, for I happened to find it"
                  "And have you got it with you?"
                  "Of course I have."
                  "Safe?—safe? Let me see it, Paul, let me see it!"
                  "That's it," returned Callum, drawing the package from his bosom. "It hasn't
                     been opened. There it is, just as I found it, and you shall have it once more.
                     I have took some trouble, and run some dangers, to get this back to you, but
                     you were always good and kind to me; you learned me to read and write, and
                     perhaps I've now done you a service in return. When we were cast away, the
                     captain and Bill Grinnell, and me, all three of us, come ashore in the bunt of
                     the mainsail. You know, of course, that the mainmast was over the stern all the
                     while. We wasn't hurt hardly any. In the morning. I heard the captain tell Bill
                     that he wanted to find your body, for he believed Bronkon had given you
                     something that you hadn't ought to have had. I found you first clean up to the
                     head of the beach, and the package was half way out of your bosom. Grabbing it,
                     I slipped it into my bosom just as Pettrell came up. I believed you would come
                     to life, so I determined to hang on to the package till I could get it into
                     your hands. I had to run, then; but I've found you now, and I hope I've done
                     you some service."
                  "Service!" repeated Alfred, as he grasped the package, which he saw had not
                     been opened; "you've done me more of good than even the saving of my life. How
                     can I repay you?"
                  "You've more than repaid me now. All I ask is that you went betray me. Pettrell
                     will swing, and I know he deserves it. Bill Grinnell has gone to the States,
                     and I shall follow him."
                  "You have nothing to fear from me, Paul; and if I can assist you in any way I
                     will do it. Have you got money enough?"
                  "Yes, plenty."
                  "Then I can only thank you for your favor, and pray that God will henceforth
                     help you to lead an honest life."
                  "Ah, Alfred, that I am determined to do. I have tried the path of evil just
                     long enough to find that there is no peace for the mind, nor real good for the
                     body, in it. A poor fellow may make a little money, now and then; but what good
                     can it do him when he can't bless himself with it? No, no; there's no more of
                     this dark life for me. I'll go where I'm not known, and there I'll commence
                     anew. I'm not too old to reform, and I've not been so wicked but that I may
                     find some real happiness yet."
                  As Callum spoke, he replaced the gray beard upon his face, and then arose from
                     his seat.
                  "Give me your hand, Alfred. There, God bless you for all the kindness you've
                     done for me; and if ever I learn to pray with an honest heart, you shall be the
                     first man I pray for."
                  "God bless you, too, Paul," exclaimed our hero, as he returned the fellow's
                     warm grasp. "You shall find often a place in my prayers."
                  "Thank you, thank you, Alfred. And now let's be off. I'm bound now for
                     Gravesend. I may never see you again; so good by."
                  Alfred shook Callum's hand again, and having once more gained the street, they
                     separated, the latter hastening off towards the river, while the former stood
                     and watched him till he was out of sight.
                  "O, mysterious package!" murmured the youth, as he pressed the same to his
                     bosom; "God grant that you contain the wand that shall remove the stain from my
                     father's name! I'll to Sir William's once more, and he shall see whether my
                     house be foul or fair. Ella, I may never reach thee, but I shall be nearer to
                     thee at least."
                  With these words trembling upon his lips, the youth quickened his pace. The sun
                     was just sinking from sight when he entered Hanover Square, and with a
                     strangely beating heart he ascended the steps that led to the baronet's door
                     and rang the bell.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXIII.
                  THE SEAL BROKEN.—THE LIFE BOOK OPENED.
                  As Alfred entered the drawing room and sank into a seat, "Thank Heaven that you
                     have come back to me," fervently ejaculated Sir William! "I feared you had left
                     this place, never to return."
                  "I intended, Sir William, to have never crossed your threshold again, for I
                     could not dwell beneath the same roof with one whom I so wildly loved, and who
                     was yet shut out from me forever. But an unexpected event has for the present
                     changed my plans. I have recovered those papers, sir, of which I spoke to
                     you."
                  "Papers!" repeated Sir William.
                  "Those, sir, which Mark Bronkon gave me, and which may yet prove that my father
                     was innocent."
                  Doctor Holland, who sat in the same room, started from his chair in
                     astonishment.
                  "Papers that Bronkon gave you?" he uttered, Innocent, did you say? Sir John Landford
                     innocent?"
                  "Let the papers speak for themselves," said Sir William.
                  "Here they are. You shall open them," said Alfred, as with a trembling hand he
                     drew the package from his bosom and passed it to the baronet.
                  Sir William took the package and then having summoned one of his servants, he
                     called for lamps. When they were brought, the curtains were drawn over the
                     windows, and the party drew their chairs up to the table. Alfred trembled like
                     an aspen, for a single stroke of the knife was to tell his doom. The baronet
                     cut the string, and revealed quite a bundle of neatly folded papers.
                  The first was directed to Alfred, and Sir William read aloud, as follows:
                  "ALFRED:—Accompanying this you will find a full statement of all the
                     circumstances connected with that fatal affair which ended in your father's
                     ignominious death. God knows that he was innocent, yet he suffered. The
                        confession I wrote shortly after you saved my life off the
                     coast of Lancashire, not then having fully made up my mind to give it to you.
                     But now I have resolved to make all the reparation that lays in my power. Some
                     things that concerned myself I cannot write; but I shall tell them to you if
                     ever I give you the papers. I refer to the relations existing between myself
                     and the fair being who gave you birth. When you open this package, you had
                     better seek out Sir William Brent, in Hanover Square, London. He was your
                     father's best friend, and he may help you. Forgive me for the part I took
                     against you, for God knows I have long since repented of it. BRONKON."
                  "Let's see! let's see!" quickly and nervously uttered Sir William. "O, if they
                     but prove that Sir John was innocent, then his son shall at least receive the
                     blessing!"
                  The next paper was opened, and it was addressed to Alfred, but also bore a
                     recommendation to "All friends of Sir John Landford." The baronet
                     opened it and read:
                  "ALFRED:—Of course you must know that you are no son of Marrok Pettrell; but
                     you are, in fact, the child of Sir John Landford, Rear Admiral, who was hanged
                     on board the Sussex, for high treason. But of that crime your father was wholly
                     innocent, Pettrell and myself being the prime movers in the affair. Four years
                     before that event Sir John tried a man for mutiny on board his own ship, and
                     had him hanged. That man was Marrok Pettrell's brother I and from that moment
                     Marrok swore to be revenged. He found me a ready tool to work with him, for I
                     was just smarting under the wound I had received in the loss of one whom I
                     loved as my own life, and who married the admiral. I may sometime explain this
                     more fully."
                  Here Alfred had to relate to Sir William and the  what Bronkon had
                     told him when he gave him the package. Then the baronet
                     resumed his reading.
                  "Marrok and myself both shipped on board Sir John's vessel, and it was not long
                     before a most extraordinary opportunity was afforded for carrying our plan into
                     execution—We were anchored off the harbor of Toulon, whither we had gone to
                     regain two of our Indiamen that had been captured by the French. Pettrell had
                     been appointed boatswain's mate, and one day while off in one of the boats
                     after a spare spar that had got afloat, he was hailed by a
                     French officer who had come out in a sail-boat. The officer came alongside and
                     gave Pettrell a letter, which he requested might be given to the admiral, at
                     the same time stating that he should be there on the next day, at the same
                     hour, for an answer. The very nature of the circumstances opened Pettrell's
                     mind to a strange suspicion. As soon as he returned to the ship he drew me one
                     side and showed me the letter. We broke the seal, and found it to be a
                     proposition from the French commander, offering to Sir John the sum of one
                     hundred thousand pounds if he would quietly surrender the ship into their
                     hands.
                  "The letter was again folded up, and the seal melted together, and Pettrell
                     went to the cabin and delivered it to the admiral. In the meantime I obtained
                     some of Sir John's chirography, and then sat down and wrote an answer to the
                     Frenchman's letter, partially accepting his proposition, but requiring more
                     definite terms. To this I affixed the admiral's signature, and then sealed and
                     directed it. As we had hoped, on the next day, Sir John handed to Pettrell a
                     letter in answer to the one he had received the previous day, and directed him
                     to deliver it to the officer of whom he had received the note. The letter
                        I had written was delivered, and the admiral's own letter was retained by
                        us! You will find it in the package. It is numbered
                        'two!'"
                  "Let's see it," faintly uttered Doctor Holland.
                  It was taken from the package, and read as follows:
                  "H. B. M. Ship Medusa.
                  "Monsieur—: —I received from you a proposition offering me a bribe for the safe
                     and quiet delivery into your hands of my ship. I am an Englishman!
                     That should be answer enough; but if you will come forth on your errand, I will
                     give you a more substantial answer in the shape of powder and cold iron.
                  "With the utmost contempt, I am your enemy,
                  "JOHN LANDFORD, BART.
                  "The old admiral himself!" cried Sir William, as his eyes filled with
                     tears.
                  "O, God!" murmured Alfred, "and that letter was kept back, and another, a base
                     forgery, sent in its place!"
                  "Yes," said Holland, "but read on."
                  Sir William wiped his eyes, and then he read again:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "After this we managed to get six more letters from the Frenchman,
                                 all of them directed to the admiral, but not one of which he ever
                                 saw until they were produced against him as evidence of his guilt!
                                 Pettrell framed rough drafts for the answers, which you will find
                                 in the package, in his own uncouth hand. These I copied, addressed
                                 to the French commander, always signing Sir John's name. The
                                 Frenchman secured his letters in a small black box, not larger than
                                 a pipe-bowl, which he fastened to one corner of the buoys, where
                                 Pettrell took it when he rowed around in the morning to square the
                                 yards, and where he also left the answer we had prepared—the
                                 Frenchman, you understand, always coming at night.
                              "At length matters were all arranged, and the night was set on
                                 which the ship was to be surrendered; and yet we were not
                                 suspected, nor did the Frenchman suspect that Marrok Pettrell was
                                 not a bona-fide agent of the admiral. We had received notes of
                                 hand, or rather drafts on a heavy bank in Toulon, for the hundred
                                 thousand pounds, which were to be cashed as soon as presented, all
                                 payable to Sir John Landford. By means of our French agent we obtained a large quantity of a very powerful sedative—a
                                 sort of quintessent extract of henbane and opium—which we mixed
                                 with the tea of the ship's company, and which we also contrived to
                                 get into the drink of the officers. Thus were all hands under
                                 control.
                              "At midnight the enemy came off in boats. Pettrell and myself were
                                 on deck; but all the rest of the watch were sound asleep. Of course
                                 the ship was taken almost without a blow. Our men were nearly all
                                 too stupid to make any resistance. As soon, as Sir John came out
                                 from his cabin, I rushed in and placed all the letters we had
                                 received from the French, together with the drafts, in a small till
                                 in one of his cheats. As they were all addressed to the admiral, of
                                 course they had an overwhelming weight in evidence, as the contents
                                 of our own forgeries were all alluded to in them. This consummated
                                 our plan. We were all taken prisoners; but the Frenchmen must have
                                 been surprised when Sir John indignantly refused their money, and
                                 at the same time disclaimed all knowledge of the affair. However,
                                 they attributed it to his fear of detection.
                              "At length the affair leaked out, and our whole crew were exchanged
                                 and carried home to England, where Sir John was tried. The letters
                                 were found in his chest, and Pettrell and myself swore to having
                                 carried them to him from the French. I could at that time see what
                                 no one else seemed to notice—and that was, that the terrible blow
                                 had turned the ill fated admiral's brain; and beneath the effects
                                 of that mental derangement he suffered all without much attempt at
                                 defence
                              "As soon as Sir John was hanged, Pettrell and myself hastened off
                                 to Gloucester, and by means of a forged order from your father, we
                                 obtained possession of you—Pettrell having sworn that you, too,
                                 should be brought to the gallows, to make up the sum of his
                                 revenge.
                              "What more can I tell you that you do not already know? You were
                                 then one year old, and your mother had already been laid in her
                                 grave. Three years after that, while we were engaged in smuggling,
                                 our vessel was cast away on Little Devon Head, and you were lost to
                                 us for several years. How you were at length found you know.
                              "And now, God forgive me for the deed I hoped to consummate. I hope
                                 this will serve you. You need no advice from me, and I will give
                                 none. I can only swear most solemnly, before that God whose laws I
                                 have so often outraged, that every word I have here written is
                                 true!
                              
                                 MARK BRONKON."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  As Sir William ceased reading, the paper dropped from his hand, and he sank
                     back in his great chair. The surgeon started up and flow to and fro across the
                     room like a crazy man. Alfred put forth his hand and laid it upon the baronet's
                     arm, and in a low whisper he uttered:
                  "Was not my father innocent?"
                  "Innocent!" repeated the baronet, starting up from his seat, and then sinking
                     back again. "O, that fearful thought has never ceased to haunt me. A dark
                     mystery always hung over that fatal scene in the closing life of my best
                     friend. Everything seemed against him, and I was forced to believe him guilty;
                     yet my soul, my heart, was never reconciled to the judgment.
                        Innocent? O, poor Sir John!"
                  Holland stopped suddenly in his walk and seized the letter which Sir John had
                     written to the Frenchman, and which the conspirators had kept back.
                  "'I am an Englishman!'" he read. "O, how like the old admiral.
                        'That should be answer enough!' O, Sir John. 'If you will
                        come forth on your errand, I will give you a more substantial answer in the
                        shape of powder and cold iron!' What a precious document is this.
                        'With the utmost contempt, I am your enemy—JOHN LANDFORD.' O,
                     Sir William, he was innocent!"
                  The old baronet could only groan, and clasp his hands in agony. The other
                     papers in the package were looked over, and they were found to be, as Bronkon
                     had said, the rough drafts of the letters which had been written to the
                     Frenchman over the forged signature of the admiral.
                  "Was not that a bass conspiracy?" uttered Sir William, as he held the papers in
                     his hand. "What a noble soul did England cast away when that man was so
                     wrongfully put to death."
                  At that moment a servant opened the door and announced that there was a man at
                     the door who wished to see Alfred.
                  "Then let him come in here," said the baronet. "Whatever interests Alfred now
                     must also interest me."
                  The old man looked upon the youth as he spoke, and the latter returned a silent
                     motion of consent.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXIV.
                  CONCLUSION.
                  IT was an old man who entered the room—a man bent down beneath heavy burdens—"a
                     man of sorrow and a man of grief." He stopped as he stood in the presence of
                     those who were there assembled, and for a few moments his frame shook like a
                     frightened child.
                  "Alfred!" he at length murmured—"Alfred, my buy. I have come to see you once
                     more."
                  The head of that old man was on the next instant pillowed upon the youth's
                     bosom, and Alfred gently murmured the name of "Luke Garron!"
                  "O, my more than father!" cried our hero, as he clasped the old light keeper
                     more fondly within his arms, "God has sent you back to me. Sir William, this is
                     now my father."
                  The baronet had sprung to his feet, for he recognized the man from whose hands
                     he had received his daughter.
                  But O, how was Luke Garron changed! That stout, noble form was bent; that
                     glossy raven hair was all frosted like the driven snow; those features, once so
                     full of the soul's life, were now in weeping for the soul's decay; those darkly
                     flashing eyes were sunken, and their light was dimmed; these hands, once so
                     strong, now trembled like stricken reeds, and he was all bowed and
                     heart-broken!
                  "You shall never leave me more," uttered Alfred. "Henceforth our home shall be
                     together. You protected me in childhood, and I will now watch over you in your
                     old age."
                  "Bless you, bless you, my boy; but that may not be. My stop here cannot be
                     long. But where is Ella? O, I must see her sweet face once more."
                  Ella was sent for and as she entered the room the first object that met her
                     gaze was Alfred, and towards him she moved.
                  "No, no, Ella," said the youth—"not to me—not to me. Here."
                  He laid his hand upon Luke's arm as he spoke.
                  "Ella," uttered the old man, "do you not know me?"
                  The fair girl gazed up into his face, and on the next instant she was upon his
                     bosom. She murmured his name—she blessed him—and she pressed her lips upon his
                     deeply furrowed brow.
                  When Luke Garron sank back upon the large sofa that stood near him, his storm
                     children were by his side.
                  "Doctor Holland," said Sir William, "this is the old light-keeper of whom you
                     have heard me speak.—An old friend of mine, Mr. Garron," added the baronet,
                     turning towards Luke.
                  That old man turned his eyes upon the surgeon, and a deadly pallor overspread
                     his features. He attempted to rise, but his limbs failed him, and he sank back
                     upon his seat.
                  "Are you ill?" anxiously asked Ella, putting her arm around Luke's neck.
                  "No, my child, it was only a sudden weakness. Ah, I have such attacks
                     often."
                  A short silence ensued, during which the doctor moved his chair nearer to where
                     Luke set. At length Sir William asked the old light-keeper where he had been
                     since he had left the Devon beacon.
                  "I have sought you often," he said, "but could never gain any tidings of
                     you."
                  "Alas!" murmured Luke, "I have had no home since that time. I have been a
                     wanderer without destination."
                  "But you should have come and seen me," said the affectionate Ella.
                  "So I have seen you, sweet child. When you knew it not, I have stood and
                     watched you."
                  "Ah, I saw you once on the opposite side of the square."
                  "Yes; I remember. I thought you detected me then, and I left my post."
                  "But you will stay with us now. O, my good father will give you a home."
                  "Yes," said Sir William; "your wanderings shall now have an end. Beneath my
                     roof you shall find a home."
                  "No, no," groaned Luke; "it cannot be. I wished to see these children once
                     again before I died; and now I have seen them. I must go now."
                  He caught the burning glance of Robert Holland, and tremblingly arose to his
                     feet.
                  "O, God!" he murmured, as he clasped his hands towards heaven, "help me through
                     this trial. Sir William, you will not turn poor Alfred from your doors. Be a
                     father to him. Bless him with your love. Ella—Alfred—one more kiss, There, I
                     must go!—O, great God! I cannot bear this! My poor heart is weaker than I
                     thought. Alfred! Alfred! God bless you! Sir William—"
                  "Stop, stop!" cried the old surgeon, springing from his chair, and grasping the
                     light-keeper by the arm. "By my soul's salvation, I know you now!"
                  "Know me!" gasped the weak old man with terror.
                  "Yes, yes. SIR JOHN LANDFORD, I know you well!"
                  "O, God! Betrayed!—discovered!—ruined!" fell from the old man's lips, as he
                     sank back upon the sofa.
                  "No, no, Sir John; none here shall betray you," exclaimed Holland.
                  Alfred heard those words—he heard the name of his father—his brain reeled, and
                     with a dizzy sensation, he fell across the old man's knees. When he *
                      came to himself his father had lifted him up, and with a bursting heart
                      he found utterance for his soul's thanksgiving.
                  
                     
                     *[SEE ENGRAVING.]
                  
                  It was some time ere Sir William recovered from the utter astonishment into
                     which this wonderful revelation had thrown him.
                  "You wonder at this, Sir William," said the old surgeon, as he settled back
                     into his seat.
                  "Wonder?" repeated the baronet, gazing first upon Sir John, and then upon the
                     doctor. "It is a miracle!"
                  "Upon my soul," replied Holland, "I do believe the hand of God is in the work;
                     but I can explain it all. If you remember, you grow sick at the sight of Sir
                     John hanging at the yard-arm, and ordered him cut down sooner than might
                     otherwise have been done. When he was taken below I saw a twitching of one of
                     the muscles at the corner of the mouth. In an instant the thought struck me
                     that life was not extinct. I had him carried to my room, and, having ordered
                     all the attendants out, I locked the door, and then commenced operations upon
                     the body. Life was there, and in half an hour Sir John sat up and spoke. He
                     prayed for me to save him, and I resolved to do it; but I first made him
                     promise that he would never reveal himself, even to his own child. His own
                     safety as well as mine, required that; for were he to be found, he would again
                     be hanged. I hastened on shore and bought a waxen figure of old
                     Dame Rollins. This I carried off in a large chest. I was forced to let my
                     steward into the secret; but I was not afraid to trust him. We sewed the waxen
                     figure closely up in a hammock, putting in lead enough to make it as heavy as a
                     dead body would be, and Sir John was carried on shore in the chest. No one
                     thought of questioning the contents of the hammock, for it bore the stamp of
                     the human form; and when it sank beneath the bosom of the closing waters, all,
                     save myself and steward, thought that the cold corse of Sir John was there. O,
                     Sir William, when I saw you weeping there, I wished that you could have known
                     as much as I did; but I dared not to reveal to you the secret. From that time
                     till this evening I have seen nothing of the man I saved, though when you first
                     told me of Luke Garron I suspected the truth."
                  "You will not betray me?" cried Sir John, as Doctor Holland concluded. "Let me
                     go. I will now seek some—"
                  "Stop, my old friend," said Sir William, starting forward to the table. "O, God
                     is surely here. His finger marks every page of life! Sir John, you are
                     innocent."
                  "God knows I am."
                  "Yes, yes, and we know it! The world shall know it. Here—here, in
                     three papers, have we your full acquittal. Sit down, sit down, Sir John."
                  The old man sank back to his seat, and then Sir William commenced to read the
                     confession of Mark Bronkon; and while he read, Sir John Landford started back
                     to life. His bosom heaved—his dark eyes sparkled with a glowing fire—his
                     muscles  with increasing power; and when the  was told, he
                     sprang to his feet and  his hands high above his head. His form was
                     straight, and his head was once more erect. A full minute he stood thus, and
                     then, as the tears rolled in torrents down his checks, he sank upon his knees,
                     and the long pent up prayer of his soul burst forth in glowing, burning
                     words.
                  When he once more drew Alfred to his bosom he told of the trials he had
                     undergone since he fled from Portsmouth, where the doctor had set him free. He
                     had found the light-house without a keeper, and he had obtained the situation.
                     He had learned that Pettrell had got possession of his child, but he dared not
                     seek for it. When, three years afterwards, Alfred was washed on shore, the
                     light-keeper know him; and when the little fellow prattled of Marrok Pettrell,
                     the fact was beyond a doubt.
                  Then the old man told him how life opened its joys to him again as he reared
                     his fond child, and as that child learned to love him. He told of the coming of
                     Pettrell, and his frame shook with a fearful tremor as he reverted to that
                     some. He dared not claim his own child as flesh of his flesh, for that would
                     have doomed him to the fearful, terrible death he had once escaped, and he was
                     forced to see the object of his heart's devotion torn from him.
                  The old man's heart bled afresh as he told of that dreadful parting, and his
                     friends gathered about him to soothe and comfort him. Soon the cloud passed
                     away, and Sir John opened his eyes upon the bliss of the present hour. Brent
                     and Holland were bonding fondly over him, while Alfred and Ella were clinging
                     to his knees. The story of his grief had been told, and now his words were only
                     thanks and blessings.
                  
                  It was again evening, and the scene is again in the large drawing-room of Sir
                     William Brent. But what a brilliant assemblage is there; the lords of the
                     admiralty are there, and some of old England's bravest, battle-scarred heroes
                     are there, too. The package which Bronkon gave to Alfred had been read by the
                     king, and Marrok Pettrell had confessed it all true, though at the time he
                     dreamed not that his victim lived. Yet the pirate captain had made the
                     confession, and he had since paid the penalty of his crimes with his life.
                  Sir John Landford was again a man among men, Upon his shoulders he bore the
                     broad epaulets of a full admiral, and
                     upon his bosom sparkled the insignia of the baronet.
                  There had just been feasting and joy upon the happy reunion of a noble Briton
                     with his noble country; but now the voice of revelry was hushed. Sir John arose
                     and stepped forth to where sat his son by the side of Sir William's
                     daughter.
                  "Alfred—Ella," he said, as he took them both by the hand, "Sir William has
                     granted me this happy privilege. I took you both to my bosom when you were
                     helpless children, and I saw the vines of your young hearts' affections twine
                     softly, tenderly about each other. You were once given to me in the midst of
                     storm and tempest, and then you were lost to me when my heaven was black in
                     night. But now—now heaven has opened the light of full day upon us—and my STORM
                     CHILDREN are mine once more. Alfred, you remember that dark night when we sat
                     together in the old beacon? Then I told you never to turn aside from the true
                     path of life. Nobly have you met the storms that have beset your way, and now
                     you see how signally your faithful virtue has been blessed. Ella, you have
                     found another father, but our laws provide that you may yet have
                        two fathers. This act makes you my daughter still— There, she
                     is yours, Alfred; and, Ella, I know you will take my son for your own with your
                     whole soul"
                  As Sir John spoke he laid Ella's hand within that of Alfred, and then he turned
                     away to wipe the happy tears from his face.
                  Sir William stepped forward and laid his hands upon the heads of Alfred and
                     Ella.
                  "O," he murmured, as he met the joyful looks of those two reunited beings, "how
                     little can they know of true joy who have no blessings to impart to those about
                     them. Surely there is more real pleasure in making some fellow creature happy,
                     than more self can ever find in the sensual wealth of earth. O, give me ever
                     the smiles of happy friends about me, and I can ask for no more."
               
               THE END.
            
            
               A WONDERFUL CAT.
               Three years ago I had a lovely 'kitten presented to me. Her fur was of a beautiful
                  blue-gray color, marked with glossy black stripes according to the most approved
                  zebra or tiger fashion, She was so pretty that she was named "Pret," and was,
                  without exception, the wisest, most loving, and dainty puss that ever crossed my
                  path. When Pret was very young, I fell ill with a nervous fever. She missed me
                  immediately in my accustomed place, thought for me, and placed herself at my door
                  until she found a chance of getting into the room, which she soon accomplished,
                  and began at once to try her little best to amuse me with her little frisky kitten
                  tricks and pussyest attractions. But soon finding that I was too ill to play with
                  her, she placed herself as head nurse. In this capacity few human beings could
                  have exceeded her watchfulness, or manifested more affectionate
                  regard. It was truly wonderful to note how soon she learnt to
                  know the ent hours at which I ought to take medicine or
                     punishment; and during the night, if my attendant was
                  asleep, she would call her, and if she could not awake her without such extreme
                  measurer, she would gently nibble the nose of the sleeper, which means never
                  failed to produce the desired effect. Having thus achieved her purpose, Miss Pret
                  would watch attentively the preparation of whatever was needed, and then come, and
                  with a gentle purr purr announce its advent to me. The most marvellous part of the
                  matter was her never being five minutes wrong in her calculations of the true
                  time, even amid the stillness and darkness of night. Surely we have here something
                  more than reason.—Routledge's Natural History.
               
            
            
               THE MEMORY OF THE DEAD.
               It is an exquisite and beautiful thing in our nature, that when the heart is
                  touched and softened by some tranquil happiness or affectionate feeling, the
                  memory of the dead comes over it most powerfully and irresistibly. It would almost
                  seem as though our better thoughts and sympathies were charms, in virtue of which
                  the soul is enabled to hold some vague and mysterious intercourse with the spirits
                  of those whom we dearly loved in life. Alas, how often and how long may those
                  patient angels hover above us, watching for the spell which is so seldom uttered
                  and so soon forgotten!—Dickens.
               
            
            
               SIMPLE DIET.—In 1799, an Englishman describes the Russian grenadiers as
                  follows:—"They are the finest body of men I ever saw. Not a man is under six feet
                  high. Their allowance consists of eight pounds of black bread, four pounds of oil,
                  and one pound of salt per man for eight days; and, were you to see them, you would
                  be convinced that they look as if they lived on roast beef and English porter." In
                  1854, when the Russians surprised the world by standing against the attack of the
                  allies on the bloody battle-field of Alma, were found dead Russians with their

                  They that deny God, destroy man's nobility—for certainly man is of kin to the

                     creature.

                  It is a vain thing for you to stick your finger in the water, and, pulling it
                     out, look for a hole; it is equally vain to suppose that, however large a space
                     you occupy, the world will miss you when you die.

                     then the care is over.

                     the reason. "O, dear, mama," replied she, pettishly, "I was thinking about my
                     husband being twice my age." "That's very true, but he is only thirty-six." "He
                     is only thirty-six now, but when I am sixty—" "Well?" "O, dear, why then he'll

               Getting through the Custom House.
               A HUMOROUS SKETCH FROM LIFE.
               BY MAJOR F. C. HUNTER.
               A TRUTHFUL saying is it, that "man dressed in a little authority," is inclined to
                  play antics, oftentimes, excessively annoying to men who may be his betters in
                  character or fortune! Among the bipeds who bask in the sunshine of governmental
                  favor (though there be honorable exceptions), there are many who are prone to put
                  on airs at once. An instance of innocence and imposition occurred not long since,
                  in Gotham.
               A novel specimen of the genus homo—a raw Yankee,
                  by the way—received an intimation by post, in Boston, that an old acquaintance had
                  sent him a present from abroad, in the shape of a jar of sweetmeats. Fully
                  appreciating the kindness of his friend, and knowing nothing of the intrinsic
                  value of the preserves, he proceeded at once to claim his property. Having visited
                  the brig which brought the cargo from the Mediterranean, he ascertained that the
                  five days allowed by law for the removal of goods from the vessel, had expired,
                  and under the general order his preserves were gone, with the rest, into the
                  public store. Repairing thither, he found the officer in charge, to whom he made
                  known his business in his own way.
               "Gut my presarves 'ere—nabur?"
               The official looked very wise, and continued to nib his pen, without offering a
                  reply.
               "I want a jug o' preserves, friend."
               "You'd better go to the grocery store," said the officer, not inclined to assist
                  the stranger at all.
               "Grocery? Why they told me to go to the public store."
               "Who?"
               "W'y—abo'd the vessel."
               "What vessel?"
               "The Yorktown—'ere's the letter."
               The man looked at the document, at last, and learned that a jar of sweetmeats had
                  arrived in the Yorktown a week before, for Peter Spikes.
               "You must go to the custom house. Get a permit, pay the duties, and then come
                  here, and I'll see if I can find 'em."
               After divers explanations and instructions, the green 'un repaired to the "big
                  stone house" in State Street, and mounting the steps, he soon found his way into
                  the collector's room. That worthy sat in his velvet easy chair, surrounded by half
                  a dozen office-seekers, when the stranger bluntly entered, with:
               "I say, friend—I'm arter a jug o' presarves."
               "What, sir?"
               "A can o' switmeets—'ere's the letter."
               The official dignitary vouchsafed a smile, evidently gratified that the fellow was
                  not an applicant for office, and referred him to his deputy in the next room. By
                  this time half a day had been spent in the search, and the victim had got a little
                  "narvous"—but he pushed on, and presenting himself before the desk of the deputy
                  collector, he inquired once more for that "jar o' presarves."
               "Where is it, sir?"
               "Wal, yu're smart! At the grocery—I mean the public store."
               "Name, sir?"
               "Swit meets—"
               "Your name, sir."
               "O! beg pard'n—Peter Spikes."
               "Foreign?"
               "No air-ec—I'm 'merikin."
               "The preserves I mean."
               "Wal, I don't know 'bout forrin; they cum in the Yorktown."
               "Yes, I see. Go to the foreign entry clerk—he will give you a permit."
               Peter went on to the fifth man, as he was directed, and a permit for the preserves
                  was at length filled out in form.
               "Fifty cents," said the clerk, briefly.
               "For wot?" asked Peter.
               "For the duties and permit."
               "W'y, the wite-headed feller yonder said you'd give me this
                  wot's-name."
               "Half a dollar, sir. I'm busy—can't be bothered. D'ye think we work for nothing,
                  man?"
               "No, you don't—it's fer four or five dollars a day, a plaguey site more'n you can
                  airn, any how!"
               As the clerk was about to throw the permit aside, Peter forked over the half, and
                  inquired with some feeling "whar' next?"
               "No. 8 must endorse it," said a bystander.
               The document was taken to desk No. 8, and endorsed.
               "Twenty-five cents," said clerk No. 8.
               "Wot fer?"
               "For the pass."
               "Luk 'ere—I'm a good-natered man, nat'-rally—"
               "So I see."
               "—'n I aint to be gouged, you understand, nabur."
               "Regular charge, sir."
               "Reg'lar? I want my swit-meets, I tell yer."
               "Well, you must attend to your duties first."
               "Look you, young master—you mustn't go ter give people nun o' yure sairce, 'fu
                  den, you'll jes git broke, sure as preechin'. I know all abaout my
                  dooties, withaout no instruck-shine from sich as you!"
               But the difficulty was finally cleared up, and Peter paid the twenty-five
                  cents.
               "What naow, cap'n?"
               "To the storage clerk, No. 12."
               Peter and the endorsed permit found their way to desk No. 12, where another
                  quarter for storage, a shilling for truckage, and another for labor—added fifty
                  cents to the bill!
               "Fifty cents," said No. 12.
               "Fifty dev—I beg pard'n for swearin'—but I tell you I'm goin' to hev them
                  presarves."
               "Not till the charges are paid."
               "Wal—take your putty. I've bin tu the cap'n, and the public grocery, and the
                  tax-gatherer's and the clark o' the wot's-names, and now 'ere-'n I've paid aout a
                  clean dollar'n aff for the blasted sugar-plums, a'ready. Will I git 'em naow?"
               "The storekeeper will settle that," continued the last man, disposed to extend the
                  annoyance—and away went Peter in a rage. Arriving at the public store, he
                  ascertained that the goods had been trucked to another place, and a direction was
                  tardily given him to inquire in Commercial Street for Mr. Maher.
               Peter misunderstood the officer, who was no more anxious than the rest to right
                  the sufferer, and believing it to be all right, he hurried up to the
                     mayor's office, City Hall, where he inquired for his honor, who
                  chanced to be at leisure.
               "What is your complaint?" said the city functionary.
               "Nuth'n partic'lar jes now, thank you, but last winter I had the roomatis most
                  orful!"
               A broad laugh followed this comical answer to the serious interrogatory of his
                  honor, who supposed he came for legal redress.
               "I want my preserves," said Peter, at length.
               "Well, sir, who's got them?"
               "W'y a feller daown in the public grocery-store, I mean, the public
                  store—'n he wont let me hev 'em. I've paid a dollar-'n 'aff so fur, an' he wants
                  to swizzle me more, I'spose. He sent me to you, and now I want to know what I'll
                  go next—for hev the presarves I will!"
               "How came be in possession of your property?"
               "W'y, rot his pictur, he went rite daown abo'd the vessel, an' tuk it aout jes as
                  of it hed a bin his'n! I could a' bought a jug aout o' enny store in Boston for
                  fifty cents."
               "I see, air—they are imported."
               "Not very important—but I didn't like to be swizzled, you see. I've
                  bin to five or six on 'em, an' one sez go 'ere, an' another sez go thar; 'n I've
                  spent n hul day, lost time, besides the dollar-'n 'aff, as I sed afore—and finally
                  they told me to go to the mayor. Yere's the wot's-name," and Peter drew-forth his
                  endorsed permit.
               "You are in error, sir. This is addressed to Mr. Maher, one of the custom house

                  continued Peter, out of patience. And in accordance with his sudden determination,
                  the following advertisement appeared next morning in one of the Boston papers:

                  The hoarse leaves draw! on hissing ground,

                  The clogged brook runs with choking sound,
               
               
                  Kneading the mounded mire that stops
                  His channel under clammy coats

                  So like a berg of hyaline,
                  Pencilled with blue so daintily—
               
               
                  I never saw her so divine.
                  But through black branches—rarely drest

                  Shot o'er with lights—the emblazoned west,
                  Where yonder crimson fire-ball sets,
                  Trails forth a purfled-silken vest.

                  All ways the molten colors run:

                  Into an azure mist, the sun
                  Drops down engulfed, his journey done.
               
            
            
               JOHN REINOLD PATKUL.
               AN HISTORICAL SKETCH.
               BY HOWARD LIVINGSTON.
               THE summer of 1707 brought about a cruel tragedy, which must ever remain to the
                  people of Saxony connected with the detestation due to a tyrant. They who are fond
                  of talking of the "great soul of Charles XII., of Sweden," had better remember
                  this tragedy, and ask themselves if it were not prompted by a cruel, tyrannical
                  and mean spirit.
               One of the generals of the king of Poland was John Reinold Patkul, a noble
                  Livonian. For some cause of dislike toward one of the favorites of Augustus,
                  Patkul gave up his commission, and entered the service of the "Great Peter," of
                  Russia. He had once been proscribed in Sweden, for defending his native province;
                  and when Peter despatched him to the court of Augustus as an ambassador, he was
                  seized as a traitor for disclosing a project. This project was between General
                  Fleming and the Chancellor of Saxony to purchase a peace at any price from the
                  king of Sweden. When it was known that Patkul had disclosed this, the chancellor
                  was so enraged, that he lid not rest until he saw him arrested and drown into the
                  castle of Konigstein, in Saxony.
               Previous to accepting the embassy, Reinold had commenced a heart history, which
                  made it still harder for him to submit to imprisonment, and to exile from ail he
                  loved. Sophia d'Einseidel was the widow of one of the young and brave sons of
                  Charles d'Einseidel, who were killed on the plain of Chison, in 1702.
               She lived with her father-in-law, who loved her with the affection which her
                  virtues, as well as her sorrows, inspired. Their abode was in the most retired
                  portion of Leipsic, where Sophia devoted herself to the mother of the young
                  heroes, who, since their death, had fallen into a state of melancholy and
                  depression, that threatened her reason.
               Four years had been spent in ministering to the grief which she shared but too
                  deeply, when chance brought the family a new friend in the person of John Reinold
                  Patkul. The pale and beautiful widow was the impersonation of all that his noble
                  heart had pictured in a perfect woman; and, with the full consent of her
                  father-in-law, whose feeble health made him tremble, lest he should leave her
                  friendless, she accepted the young ambassador, with the promise of being united to
                  him when the embassy should be accomplished. Sophia felt almost guilty at times,
                  when she thought of her own coming happiness. D'Einseidel's failing health and his
                  wife's incurable depression weighed heavily upon her mind. Still, she thought that
                  John would never ask her to leave them, and it was at least a comfort to know that
                  her marriage would secure to them a true and generous friend.
               He had gone, almost before the words had died upon her lips that assured him of
                  her love; but his letters came fast, and breathing of all honorable and noble
                  sentiments, and she was content. Suddenly they ceased, and Sophia tried in vain to
                  resist the forebodings that oppressed her. Madame d'Einseidel grow worse daily,
                  and the life of her husband seemed suspended by a mere thread. They were living a
                  lonely life in the retired street where they had taken their abode, after the
                  death of their sons. They had few visitors, and none of the family had ever been
                  out since that event. The house was as still and sombre as a cloister; the only
                  star shining over it was Reinold's love.
               And now came news of war. Already the bulletins gave notion of a pitched battle
                  between the Russians and Swedes, giving the victory to the former. Again there was
                  a report that Augustus had been forced to resign the crown to the young Palatine
                  of Pomania, Stanislaus Leczinsky; and all this time there was no mention of
                  Reinold.
               Alas, the evil tidings came soon enough! It was like a thunder bolt upon the
                  hearts that loved him, to hear that he was confined at Konigstein. Then came the
                  report that he was taken from thence to Altransad by the
                  officers of Charles, of Sweden, who had demanded "all deserters who had entered
                  the service of Augustus, and particularly John Reinold Patkul!"
               For weary months the noble prisoner remained tied to a stake, with a heavy chain
                  wearing into his flesh; but chains had no power over his brave soul. He held out
                  nobly and courageously. Even the jailors were struck with the lofty fortitude that
                  bore all indignities, scorning to complain; and they at last brought him what most
                  he longed for—the implements of writing. With these he managed to write a few
                  hasty words to Sophia—words full of hope and courage.
               Poor girl! sadly she needed such a cordial, even dashed with bitterness as it was,
                  for there were times now when she became as melancholy as Madame d'Einseidel
                  herself. D'Einseidel was confined to the couch whence it was uncertain if he ever
                  arose; and there was no one to take her place for a moment with the two sufferers.
                  It was perhaps well that her mind was thus occupied by unceasing care and
                  tenderness for them. It served to draw it away sometime, from the image of the
                  noble prisoner, whose wrongs and hardships seemed so cruelly prolonged.
               Once, when she had left her beloved charges both sleeping, she retired to her
                  chamber for a few moments, to dwell upon that other beloved, whose state she so
                  deplored. A beautiful bird had flown into the room, its wings "sparkling with
                  unnumbered dyes." It was nestling in the branches of a flowering plant, the
                  slender stalks of which seemed hardly able to sustain its weight. As she entered,
                  it flew toward her, and perched upon her shoulder, yielding gracefully to her soft
                  caress. She accepted the omen for good, and felt lonely when the beautiful
                  creature again flew away.
               She thought of it again with feelings somewhat altered, when on descending she
                  found D'Einseidel had awakened, and was decidedly worse. He had sunk rapidly, and
                  seemed to be surely approaching the death-hour. Her superstitious feelings were
                  aroused, and she almost believed that the strange, beautiful bird was the
                  messenger of that hour.
               With eyes turned alternately toward his poor wife and Sophia, he seemed trying to
                  utter a prayer for them. It was too late; utterance was denied him. In that hour
                  the strength and courage of that young creature was sorely tried; but she was
                  sustained, even in that terrible ordeal. If the thought of Reinold's situation
                  sometimes stung her into madness, she resisted it now, and tried only to think of
                  the words of his message, that bade her be strong and hopeful, as became a
                  soldier's affianced wife.
               Beside the bed she watched unceasingly. The last moment came. A smile of ineffable
                  peace came over the countenance, and long after death the faded lips wore the
                  smile unaltered. It was like rending her heart asunder to look upon the dead face
                  of him who had been so long her sole protector. How could it be otherwise, when
                  she thought of the melancholy legacy he had bequeathed her in the person of Madame
                  d'Einseidel?
               "O, if Reinold were only here!" was the inward cry of her sorely-tried spirit,
                  while the sad' preparations were going on. When the mournful procession left the
                  house, she was holding the hand of the poor widow, who seemed almost distracted by
                  the strange and unwonted appearance of persons in that ordinarily quiet house. Of
                  her husband's death she was almost unconscious.
               When they were once more left alone, Sophia turned all her care and tenderness
                  toward her, never leaving her, and bestowing every attention which her state
                  demanded. She sank into pitiable childishness, forgetting her husband, her sons,
                  and often not knowing the kind being who ministered so beautifully to her
                  needs.
               Months passed away, in which she heard nothing from the beloved prisoner. Almost
                  her hope died out. She had no faith in Charles of Sweden; she believed him to be,
                  what he really was, spite of the "great soul" about which historians have prated—a
                  tyrant, a cool, deliberate ruffian.
               She had gathered his character from him who was now in his grave; and his
                  estimation of him was a just one. Charles's disregard of danger, so highly
                  boasted, was a quality which any robber or assassin might feel; his indifference
                  to wealth was only as he did not choose its annoyances. In short, his character
                  was mean, cruel, fierce and revengeful—a cold-blooded, inhuman despot.
               From a power like this, how could Reinold free himself, when specially watched and
                  guarded, as was the command of the tyrant? This question assumed a new
                  significance, when month rolled on after month, and left the longing, lingering
                  anxiety that often merges into despair. That loving heart, that had beat quicker
                  at the murmured sounds of a love which she had never thought to hear from mortal
                  lips again, was now sick with terror and suspense. Hopes had been awakened that
                  would now end perhaps in the deepest anguish.
               When Reinold left her, it was to go on a peaceful embassy—not to strife nor
                  battle. How had all those anticipations flown! No wonder that her life passed so
                  drearily. Still, she was capable of any sacrifice for the poor, dependent being at
                  her slide; the mother of her dead hero. There are passages, after all, in this
                  work-a-day world, that amount to such positive sublimity as to awaken all our
                  admiration. Of such was the devotion of the beautiful Saxon widow to the helpless
                  Madame d'Einseidel.
               One night, when her charge slept peacefully, Sophia sat long at her open window.
                  It was a sultry July night, but the dark sky and the soft stars looked down
                  lovingly, as if they would soothe the troubled spirit beneath. The summer night
                  breeze whispered to her ear like the voices of spirits, and she almost fancied
                  that her husband's voice was among them. Sorrow and care had wrought her up to
                  that pitch of intense excitement, when the lightest thing can sway the
                  imagination, and people it with unearthly visions.
               Suddenly from the branches of a thick fir-tree, rustling like the wind, came the
                  bird of glorious plumage which she had seen before. It alighted close to her hand
                  as it lay upon the window sill. It seemed not to fear when she moved, and she
                  reached out her other hand for a small package of seeds, with which she had fed
                  the birds from her window, as was her usual practice.
               It fed eagerly from her hand, and then flew back to the tree. Twice after this,
                  during the night, it came back, each time with a low, sad murmur, that sounded
                  like a wail for the dead; and each time she repaired to Madame d'Einseidel's room,
                  to see if there were not some trouble there. She sat up until morning, and then,
                  weary and miserable, she threw herself upon a couch, and slept heavily until the
                  sun was far up in the burning sky of July.
               Had she died during that slumber, she would have waked in heaven with Reinold; for
                  on that summer morning, with the earth lying all green and beautiful in the warm
                  sunshine—with the roses and lilies all a-blow—a scene was enacted at Altransad,
                  that would unman the stoutest heart to witness. Reinold Patkul—with his brave,
                  true heart full of the bitterness of death; his thoughts turned upon her who was
                  his affianced wife; with a soldier's fame resting upon his name, and a patriot's
                  fervent, earnest zeal for his country; with all these things making life so sweet
                  and desirable, and death so terrible—was taken out under the broad canopy of
                  heaven to die. Not a soldier's honorable death, but like the worst of criminals—a
                  death so terrible that we cannot think of it without a pang.
               It was the closing week of autumn. All that time Sophia had been waiting to have
                  her fears confirmed, for she had long since resigned all hope. She believed
                  Reinold dead. There was no one to whom she could breathe his name, for Madame
                  d'Einseidel was now a poor, drivelling idiot, claiming her at her side every
                  moment. One evening, when she had laid her as one lays a child to her nightly
                  rest, she was called down to see a stranger.
               A soldier from the Russian camp he announced himself, with news to Madame Sophia
                  d'Eeinseidel; but he seemed to hesitate and falter in commencing its recital. A
                  lock of bright brown hair and a little note were passed from the soldier's
                  trembling hands to Sophia's. In vain she entreated him to say what he wished. He
                  broke down at the first word, and burst into a passion of tears—so terrible to
                  witness in a man. It was the name of Reinold that filled her heart, and sprang to
                  her lips. The man bowed in speechless grief.
               "He is dead!" she shrieked out with a voice that sounded like the
                  wall of some distracted spirit. Her face seemed like marble, so cold and stony was
                  its look; and a moment after she fell heavily to the floor.
               The soldier raised her as tenderly as if she were his sister, and called loudly
                  for help. It came, but it was useless. The heart that bad suffered so long had
                  broken with the first certainty of her apprehensions. She knew not
                     how he had died. God's pity for her, if she had! "Death the
                  consoler, laying his hand on her heart, had healed it forever!"
            
            
               CHOICE OF A WIFE.
               The Indian sage Aurva, a great authority in matrimonial matters, gives minute
                  directions for the choice of a wife, that every devout Hindoo does well to follow.
                  The girl must be only a third of her husband's age, not very black, not
                  yellow-complexioned, not a cripple, not deformed, not vicious, nor unhealthy, nor
                  of low origin, but one who has been well brought up, and who speaks with
                  propriety. She must not inherit a family malady, nor possess a masculine
                  appearance; must neither speak thick nor thin, nor croak like a raven; must not
                  keep her eyes shut, nor have them wide open; must not have thick ankles, nor
                  dimples in her cheeks, nor goose skin, nor white nails, nor red eyes, nor fat
                  hands, nor duck-like feet. She must neither be short, nor tall, nor fat, nor thin,
                  but very middling. Her teeth must be very close set, and her eyebrows wide apart;
                  finally, her gait must resemble that of a young elephant.
            
            
               POVERTY.—Bulwer says that poverty is only an idea, in nine cases out of ten. Some
                  men with ten thousand dollars a year suffer more for want of means than others
                  with three hundred. The reason is, the richer man has artificial wants; his income
                  is ten thousand, and by habit he spends twelve or fifteen thousand, and he suffers
                  enough from being dunned for unpaid debts to kill a sensitive man. A man who earns
                  a dollar a day and does not run in debt, is the happiest of the two. Very few
                  people who have never been rich will believe this, but it is as true as God's
                  word. There are people, of course, who are wealthy, and enjoy their wealth, but
                  there are thousands upon thousands with princely incomes who never know a moment's
                  peace, because they live above their means; there is really more happiness in the
                  world among working people than among those who are called rich.
            
            
               VOICES OF ANIMALS.
               There is a chapter in the natural history of animals hardly touched upon as yet,
                  and that will be especially interesting with reference to families. The voices of
                  animals have a family character not to be mistaken. All the canidae bark and howl.
                  The fox, the wolf, the dog have the same kind of utterance, though on a somewhat
                  different pitch. All the bears growl, from the white bear of the Arctic snows to
                  the small black bear of the Andes, All the cats miau, from our quiet
                  fireside companions to the lions and tigers and panthers of the forest and jungle.
                  This last may seem a strange assertion; but to any one who has listened critically
                  to their sounds and analyzed their voices, the roar of the lion is but a gigantic
                     miau, bearing about the same proportion to that of a cat as its
                  stately and majestic form does to the smaller, softer, and more peaceful aspect of
                  the cat. Yet, notwithstanding the difference in their size, who can look at the
                  lion, whether in his more sleepy mood, as he lies curled up in the corner of his
                  cages or in his fiercer moments of hunger or of rage, without being reminded of a
                  cat? And this is not merely the resemblance of one carnivorous animal to another;
                  for no one was over reminded of a dog or a wolf by a lion. All the horses and
                  donkeys neigh; for the bray of the donkey is only a harsher neigh; pitched on a
                  different key, it is true, but a sound of the same character, as the donkey
                  himself is but a clumsy and dwarfish horse. All the cows low, from the buffalo
                  roaming the prairie, the musk-ox of the Arctic lee-fields, or the jack of Asia, to
                  the cattle feeding in our pastures. Among the birds this similarity of voice in
                  families is still more marked. We need only recall the harsh and noisy parrots, so
                  similar in their peculiar utterance. Or take, as an example, the web-footed
                  family. Do not all the geese and the innumerable hosts of docks quark? Does not
                  every member of the crow family caw, whether it be the jackdaw, the jay, the
                  magpie, the rook, in some green rookery of the old world, or the crow of our
                  woods, with its long, melancholy caw, that seems to make the silence and solitude
                  deeper. Compare all the sweet warblers of the songster family—the nightingales,
                  the thrushes, the mocking-birds, the robins—they differ in the greater or less
                  perfection of the note, but the same kind of voice runs through the whole
                     group.—Agassiz.
               
            
            
               FEMALE DELICACY.
               Above all other features which adorn the female character, delicacy stands
                  foremost within the province of good taste. Not that delicacy which is perpetually
                  in quest of something to be ashamed of; which makes merit a blush, and simpers at
                  the false construction her own ingenuity has put upon an innocent remark—this
                  spurious kind of delicacy is far removed from good sense—but the high-minded
                  delicacy which maintains its pure, undeviating walk alike among women and the
                  society of men; which shrinks from no necessary duty, and can speak, when
                  required, with a seriousness and kindness, of things on which it would be ashamed
                  to smile or blush; that delicacy which knows how to confer a benefit without
                  wounding the feelings of another; which can give aims without assumption, and
                  pains not the most susceptible being in creation.
            
            
               Kindness is a language, which not only the dumb can speak, but the deaf can
                  understand.
            
            
               
               
                  
                     THE HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHILDREN, IN LONDON.
                  
               
               HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHILDREN.
               The interesting engraving on this page represents the interior of the noblest
                  charitable institution of London—the hospital for sick children in Great Ormond
                  Street. The little creatures are here kindly and generously cared for. The
                  convalescents, as our engraving shows, are furnished with playthings, dolls,
                  puzzles and other toys suitable to their age. In the girls' ward there are at the
                  present writing 19 beds; in the boys, 17. The arrangements here are indicative of
                  the good feeling, good taste, and correct judgment which characterize the entire
                  organization of the institution. There are such toys as are the best adapted to
                  "little men," and a plentiful supply of amusing pictorial books—contributed some
                  by visitors, some by the doctors, and some by their friends. There is also a fever
                  ward, containing eight beds. We may add that out door patients are relieved daily
                  to the number of 200. The indoor patients are limited to about 45, through the
                  want of ampler means. There is no other restriction upon their admission. The
                  "open sesame" is supply suffering. Eleven years only has the hospital been in
                  existence. It was established in 1852, on a very small scale, making up but five
                  or six hods, but it has grown in usefulness every year, grown unobtrusively, and
                  indeed, by the great body of the public, quite unnoticed. During the year 1857,
                  325 in-patients and 9025 out patients were admitted, making a total of 1483
                  in-patients and 30,330 out patients, who have enjoyed the benefits of the hospital
                  since it was first opened. The income for the year 1857 amounted to ¥2508; the
                  expenditure to ¥2437. The Samarian Fund, which provides for the
                  journeys of the children to Hornsey and Tottenham, and the Home
                  at Brighton, shows an income of ¥88 against an expenditure of ¥70.
            
            
               CHINESE CUSTOMS.
               On landing at Macao, the first object that attracted my notice
                  was a military mandarin, who were an embroidered petticoat, with a string of beads
                  round his neck, and who, besides, carried a fan; it was with some dismay I
                  observed him mount on the right side of his horse. On my way to the house my
                  attention was drawn to several old Chinese, standing on stilts, some of whom had
                  gray beards; and nearly all of them huge goggling spectacles; they were
                  delightedly employed in flying paper kites, while a group of boys were gravely
                  looking on, and regarding the innocent occupation of their seniors with the most
                  serious and gratified attention. Desirous to see the literature of so curious a
                  people, I looked in at a bookstore. The proprietor told me that the language had
                  no alphabet, and I was somewhat astonished, on his opening a Chinese volume, to
                  find him begin at what I had all my life previously considered the end of the
                  book. He read the date of the publication, "The fifth year, tenth month,
                  twenty-third day." "We arrange our dares differently," I observed, and begged that
                  he would speak of the ceremonials. He commenced by saying, "When you receive a
                  distinguished guest do not fail to place him on your left hand, for that is the
                  seat of honor; and be cautious not to uncover the head, as it would be an
                  unbecoming act of familiarity." Hardly prepared for this blow to my established
                  notions, I requested he would discourse of their philosophy. He re-opened the
                  volume, and read with becoming gravity: "The most learned men are decidedly of
                  option that the seat of human understanding is the stomach!" On arriving at my
                  quarters, I thought that a cup of Young Hyson would prove refresh, feeling certain
                  that, in this at least. I should meat with nothing to surprise me; imagine my
                  astonishment when I observed that the favorite leaf that the Chinaman was about to
                  infuse, looked different to any I had ever seen, it being, in color, a doll alive,
                  having none of the usual bloom on its suit see. I remarked on its appearance, when
                  my attendant quietly said, "We never use painted tea ourselves, but as the foreign
                  merchants will pay a better price for it when the brown leaves are made of one
                  uniform color, we of course have no objection to cover them with powders,
                  especially as it makes the common withered look like the best tea." On drinking
                  the infusion made from the pure uncolored leaf, I at once resolved to become a
                  convert to this fashion, leaving the other Chinese customs for future
                     consideration.—Foreign correspondence of Boston Post.
