            PREFACE.
            THE leading idea of the following pages occurred to me some years ago, when writing a
               series of articles for a newspaper, urging the importance of individual exertion for
               the salvation of souls. The idea was striking to my mind, that the influence exerted
               by emigrants flocking to the American shores, over their countrymen behind, to induce
               them to follow, is like that of Christians to gain the wicked over to a life of
               piety. This analogy, in its leading and applicable points, I have endeavored to
               maintain throughout the work; especially to bring out such aspects of it, as might
               impress the responsibility upon Christians of throwing the influence of their whole
               lives in a course of promoting the conversion of their neighbors. With what success I
               have maintained this difficult style of allegory, others may judge. I have the
               satisfaction of positiveness, that the rousing of Christians aimed at, is very
               important to the final triumph of the Gospel.
            And I have evidence of being in good company, in the effort to press Gospel truths in
               a figurative style. Our
               Lord represented the varying results of disseminating Gospel truths, by the parable
               of the sower and the seed, Mat. 13: 3-24; and the origin and influence of evil in the
               world, he illustrated by the parable of the good seed and the tares, Mat. 13: 24-43;
               the duties and rewarding of Christians, he illustrated by the parable of the laborers
               in the vineyard, Mat. 20: 1-17. Isaiah was inspired to illustrate God's treatment of
               the Israelites by the parable of the vineyard, Isa. 5: 1-7. His judgments upon them
               are here lucidly justified.
            These are but examples of the figurative style which nearly all the inspired writers
               often adopted to impress religious instructions. John Bunyan caught the spirit of
               these parabolic illustrations when he wrote his Pilgrim's Progress. It
               is hoped that The Emigrants may add something to the success
               previously realized in illustrating religious things by the familiar scenes of this
               world; that it will help Christians more fully to appreciate what they can do for the
               salvation of their fellow men.

            THE EMIGRANTS.
            
               CHAPTER I.
               Their Native Country.
               WHILE journeying through the Western world, I found numerous citizens who showed,
                  in various ways, even upon slight acquaintance, that they were not natives, but
                  foreigners, who had emigrated to live in this better country. Many were much
                  elated with the contrast between this and their father-land, and were very
                  desirous to induce their old friends, whom they had left behind, to come and enjoy
                  blessings with them. Being fully persuaded that reports made by emigrants to their
                  countrymen whom they have left, are among the most efficient instrumentalities to
                  induce more emigrations, I am led to publish some of the information I gained from
                  these adopted citizens; hoping thereby to
                  guard the people in the old country against impositions, and to prompt new-comers
                  to care and faithfulness in their representations.
               
                  SIN—YOUTH'S PLEASURE FIELD.
                  I learned that the emigrants all reported themselves to the proper authorities
                     at their landing, as having come from a quarter of the world called Sin.
                  On conversing with various families during my travels, I learned some
                     interesting particulars concerning that country. It has several provinces, of
                     various climates and productions; and the inhabitants differ considerably in
                     their habits, and speak somewhat different dialects. But yet the despotic
                     monarch, Beelzebub, understands them all without any interpreter.
                  I formed acquaintance with several interesting families of young people, who
                     had but recently come over. They stated that they came from that part of Sin
                     called Youth's Pleasure Field, which occupies a large and finely
                     appearing section of the country. Its productions are just suited to the relish
                     of the young and healthy. A great profusion of flowers are found. Beelzebub
                     claims it as a part of his empire of Sin, because its inhabitants are "lovers of pleasures, more than lovers of God."
                  Groups of young people may be seen upon its plains every fair day, busied in
                     consulting and seeking where pleasure's fruits are most abundant. Some are
                     eager to enjoy what is called Curiosity. This affords Pleasure at
                     first touch; but the pleasure of its taste does not equal the expectations
                     raised by its touch, and it never fully satisfies. When eagerly devoured, it
                     destroys appetite for more substantial food, and unduly stimulates the nerves:
                     and it may be so intemperately used as to corrupt the best qualities of the
                     soul. Yet it is an excellent fruit, and used in moderation with other things,
                     it is a valuable and essential supply for the development of the powers of the
                     human soul. It operates like instinct in the brute—draws on to untried acts.
                     But in this Youth's Pleasure Field, its use is excessive, intemperate; so that
                     persons are thereby disqualified for important duties in life. Why, one was
                     heard to say, "Away with everything once enjoyed; its freshness is gone. Give me something new; give
                     me curiosity. Serve up for me new dishes, to stimulate my inquiry—how made, and
                     of what. Claim not that I should teach others what I know, and influence them
                     to any duty; enjoyment is in learning something new.—Trouble me not to look at
                     an established and important truth, which points out the way of duty and
                     interest, long enough to be affected by it. Something new and strange will
                     tickle my fancy better.
                  "As I suck the sweets of this Curiosity, let me sing, 
                        
                           "New, something new, and wondrous strange,
                           Will feast; though light as fancy's range.
                           Material bread, of common stuff,
                           Will truly nourish;—that's not much;
                           But Pleasure's taste gets wider range,
                           By analyzing something strange.
                        
                        
                           "And bread or food, strong truths for souls,
                           Sure guide in right to brighter worlds;—
                           O, heavy, tasteless, base for food
                           To sate a mind—would be like God;
                           Which, stretching thought beyond the known,
                           The apple grasps, and is borne on.
                        
                        
                           'The strange forbidden something, back
                           Of th' needful, duty, good, I lack.
                           Why this strange interdict to touch
                           What don't concern, though lov 'd so much?
                           I love to Heaven's secrets pry,
                           Far more than serious duties try.
                        
                        
                           "The Bible is a fruitful book,—
                           For curiosities I look.
                           I wish to know; not, so's to do;
                           But, hidden causes, reasons too,
                           And all the points, like Deity,—
                           I live on Curiosity."
                        
                     
                  
                  "What shall we eat, and what shall we drink?" inquires another group. Taste, say they, can certainly give pleasure worthy of an immortal
                     soul; and to gratify this we will live. 
                        
                           "Live while you live, the epicure [does] say.
                           Enjoy the pleasures of the present day."
                        
                     
                  
                  One of these advocates of Taste, as man's chief good, was once encountered by
                     Thought. Thought urged that enjoyment from Taste is only suited to the
                     inhabitants of the earth, and cannot be had in heaven. Now as human souls were
                     created to pass most of their existence in heaven, it cannot be wise to prize,
                     as the chief good, what can be had only at one point of existence; and that to
                     no fuller satisfaction than beasts have. The pleasure of Taste is merely an animal feeling; and shall a soul,
                     made in the image of God, spend its Godlike powers upon merely animal
                     gratifications? Taste should be certainly restricted, in its use, to its proper
                     place; to guide in selections of appropriate nourishment for the body, to
                     promote healthful feelings, and to excite gratitude to the giver of supplies:
                     and all this in subordination to the interests of the soul. 
                        
                           "The soul of man, a native of the skies!
                           Highborn and free, her freedom should maintain;
                           Unsold, unmortgaged, for earth's little bribes."
                        
                     
                  
                  The lover of Taste responded: "Why, surely the Creator has given appetite to be
                     enjoyed. The fact that he has given it, argues it should be used. It is right,
                     therefore, to enjoy its gratification in Taste. And besides, the soul is
                     intimately connected with the body; and so, through the effect of Taste upon
                     the body, the soul is invigorated, and has more joy. And my creed is, not to
                     give up the pleasures of to-day for the uncertainties of to-morrow. Taste I'll
                     enjoy while I can, and as best I can. Thinking can go on, and the soul exercise
                     its various powers, (and why not do its work?) when I can enjoy Taste no more.
                     Bring me on your best and greatest variety of dishes. Excellent! Exquisite!
                     Angels can have no better. Now another course. And now for the wine. O, how
                     this touches the springs of the soul. Is not this bliss? This is the flow of
                     reason, a feast of the soul. Taste makes almost heaven. Servants, here; before
                     you clear these out of sight, let's plan what for dining,
                     tea, and latest hour, will keep this pleasure's flow. Spare no pains, no price;
                     give me Taste in all varieties: and patiently I'll wait, and live only to get
                     supplied."
                  Just as he was closing his pleas and exultations in prospect of Epicurean life,
                     Moral Sense passed along, and overhearing some of his remarks, paused, and
                     entered his caveat against the positions taken.
                  And as he was closing, a winged messenger from heaven sung as he passed, 
                        
                           "O come, and with us taste
                           The blessings of Christ's love;
                           While Hope expects the sweet repast,
                           Of nobler joys above."
                        
                        
                           "'What shall we eat and drink?'
                           In anxious, wicked care,
                           
                           Leads where all gluttons, drunkards, sink;
                           From bliss and heaven, far."
                        
                     
                  
                  Notwithstanding all these discouragements, this group of youth in Pleasure
                     Field, eagerly press on to gratify themselves with Taste; and those who cannot
                     be persuaded to emigrate, come to an end which I will not attempt to describe.
                     It is sufficient to know that their "years shall be shortened," Prov. 10:27;
                     that when they say, "Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take
                     thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry;" then God says, "Thou fool! this night
                     thy soul shall be required of thee."—Luke 12: 19, 20; and, that "he that soweth
                     to the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption."—Gal. 6: 8.
                  
                     Cupid's Flower is next seen having the preference of one of these
                     groups of youth. Said one: 
                        
                           "Love adds a precious seeing to the eye;
                           A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
                           A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
                           When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd;
                           Love's feeling is more soft, and sensible,
                           Than are the tender forms of cockled snails;
                           Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste;
                           For valor, is not Love a Hercules,
                           Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
                           Subtle as a Sphinx; as sweet, and musical,
                           As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair;
                           And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
                           Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.
                           Never durst poet touch a pen to write,
                           Until his ink were tempered with Love's sighs;
                           O, then his lines would ravish savage ears,
                           And plant in tyrants, mild humility."
                        
                     
                  
                  And as they mused over this Flower, and took in its perfumes, they cheered each
                     other on to the highest gusto. They agreed, it is right to enjoy these
                     perfumes. They are essential to the continuation of the human race. Families
                     are held together by their magic power. They create families. It will be
                     philanthropic to nourish and enjoy them. And here is work enough to enlist all
                     our powers. How can we be happier than thus? Be this our good, our duty,
                     usefulness.
                  Ah! it is true, creature-love should not crowd out that belonging to the
                     Creator. And "in Heaven they neither marry nor are given in marriage." And so
                     this Cupid's Flower, which draws the young to many tete-a-tete here, can never bloom on Heaven's plains. Some strange admonishing is felt that,
                     poppy-like, though its perfumes excite, too much will lull the soul to sleep;
                     and that dreams about earth's homes, will take the time allotted to prepare for
                     stern realities, the appropriate sphere for souls. But we are caught by this
                     Flower. We must enjoy it while youthful blood flows. By and by we can move
                     away. For awhile longer we will venture to be ranked among those who are
                     "lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;" and who "serve the creature more
                     than the Creator."
                  
                     Air-Castles were next claimed to afford satisfaction. The sight
                     of these at once excites and tickles the mind with the prospect of the greatest
                     earthly enjoyment. Sitting on a green plot of Youth's Pleasure Field, with
                     these flowers around him, the youth can draw from them pleasures like those of
                     the successful orator, the honored statesman, the millionaire, the crowned
                     Emperor,—earth's happiest man. Instead of going to the sanctuary of God on the
                     sacred one day in seven, there he sits, enjoying Air-Castles; evaporating his
                     immortal life-blood in the feverish exhalations from these flowers which are
                     nowhere found but upon a sin-cursed earth.
                  Does the orator stand before assembled thousands and, with new truths, and
                     choicest words, and most beautiful figures, and touching descriptions, and
                     musical voice, sway their opinions at his will; extorting the exclamation, "It
                     is the voice of a god, and not of a man!" This youth, living on these flowers,
                     thinks he enjoys as much. And more; he takes at once, the pleasure which the
                     other realizes in his long course of preparation for such a triumph. And thus,
                     in quick succession, he shares the delights of earth's most gifted sons. This
                     is living fast, but how sadly as to results, we shall soon see.
                  Some strangely grasp at artificial Air-Castles, sometimes called Novels. Over
                     these they bend and strain their feeble eyes, and taste and taste for real
                     good, till often friends are disregarded, children are neglected, the soul is
                     forgotten, and God is rejected.
                  "Bianca is one of the finest girls in the whole round of my acquaintance, and
                     is now one of the happiest. But when I first became acquainted with her, which
                     was about three years ago, she was an
                     object of pity; pale, emaciated, nervous and hysterical; at the early age of
                     seventeen, the days had already come when she could truly say, she had no
                     pleasure in them. She confessed to me, that she had lain on her bed, day after
                     day, for months together, reading, or rather devouring, with a kind of morbid
                     appetite, every novel that she could lay her hands on—without any pause between
                     them, without any rumination, so that the incidents were all conglomerated and
                     confounded in her memory. She had not drawn from them all a single useful maxim
                     for the conduct of life; but calculating on the fairy world, which her authors
                     had depicted to her, she was reserving all her address and all her powers for
                     incidents that would never occur, and characters that would never appear."—Wirt.
                  To many youth, life would seem a burden without one kind of these flowers;
                     either the original, as first described, or the artificial. So powerful is
                     their charm. But after all, the sad reality appears at last, that the pleasures
                     derived from them vanish in succession as soon as felt; just as these
                     bubble-like Air-Castles themselves do as soon as touched. An aching void is
                     left; and these youth "become vain in their imaginations, and their foolish
                     heart is darkened: professing themselves to be wise they become fools."—Rom.
                     1:21, 22.
                  These are some of the flowers and fruits of Youth's Pleasure Field. Many spend
                     the most important days of their life in this field, very nearly as just now
                     represented. It is quite difficult to get their attention long enough to
                     convince them of their folly in staying there. Even if they acknowledge their
                     belief that there is a better land, they often seem deprived of their senses;
                     they often look back and turn, after they have started away. Yet it is as true
                     as the Bible, and these may know it if they will, that those who persist to
                     stay there and spend their life in the way described, will feel the weight of
                     God's displeasure, and will be exiled to the home of devils.
               
               
                  NO-FAITH.
                  I found a few people who came from a part of Sin called No-Faith. That section
                     is worthy thy of notice chiefly from
                     the character of its inhabitants. They are generally supposed not to be very
                     numerous. But it is impossible to penetrate all the retreats which the country
                     affords, so as to get a correct census of its people.
                  If any persons residing there are asked who is their object of worship, they
                     stare, and say they have no worship. If asked, What is your religion? they say,
                     We have no trouble about that. What! have you no religious belief? We have
                     heard of there being such, say they, but we have none. We concern ourselves
                     with no ideas or feelings of obligation to affect us, beyond those arising from
                     natural laws and our animal nature. We know of no being superior to man, as
                     having any claim upon us, or control over us. There may be such a being; but we
                     are not concerned to be convinced whether there is or not. We have no belief on
                     such subjects. We have heard of feelings of moral or religious obligation, but
                     we do not understand them: and we have no concern to try to understand. We are
                     not sure whether we have souls or not. At any rate, we are set on enjoying
                     joying ourselves, without being disturbed by any concern about such things.
                  The course of life pursued by ——, a farmer, will illustrate the general state
                     of the inhabitants. He makes it his business to get a living. He finds it
                     necessary, like the squirrel or the bee, to lay in a store for winter. He
                     therefore brings his best knowledge into use to provide. He clears and plows
                     his land, builds fences around it, sows his seed; and, at the proper time,
                     gathers his crop into his barns. He has his grain, his cattle, his household
                     supplies. The drawings of instinct lead him to family connections. With the
                     same natural instinct, with the same promptings by which the goose chooses a
                     mate, he chooses a wife. They then unite in providing for their new wants. A
                     home is needed, and various accompaniments. They show some more skill than the
                     fowl, in building its nest; or the beaver, in constructing its mud cottage and
                     accompanying dam. But in this they only act like a superior species of animals.
                     When they rouse from a night's slumber, they no more think of the Divine power
                     which has kept them safely, than the
                     beaver does. Instead of appearing to sing their Maker's praise in the early
                     morning as the birds do, they start at once upon their round of daily
                     gathering. Not one expression of gratitude to God escapes their lips: they do
                     not think of it: they have no belief whether he even exists or not. They have
                     not brought their minds up to decide on so high a point as that; but, so far as
                     religion is concerned, only up to points level with animal capacities. When
                     hungry, they eat with the same relish that any animal does, and with the same
                     kind of feeling. They give forth no words or signs to indicate that God has
                     anything to do in supplying them. They do not thank him. And when they begin
                     their day's toil, they do it with apparently the same motives which actuate the
                     busy bee. They gather their stores and hoard them in their houses, in chests or
                     rooms constructed with almost as much exactness of economy and skill as is
                     exhibited in the bee's octagonal cells.
                  In this way they spend the season for gathering; and the rest of the time they
                     occupy in enjoying what they have gotten. They know nothing of dependence on
                     God during all this; they do not trust in him; they do not pray to him. A
                     traveller from another country, who who had never had the idea of the being and
                     authority of God introduced to him, would no more have that idea suggested to
                     him by their course of daily life, than he would by the busy life of a swarm of
                     bees. Their offspring follow the instincts of the parents; and, unless through
                     some other agency than theirs they get the ideas of their soul's being and
                     responsibilities, they grow up in similar ignorance and unbelief.
                  Such, it would appear to any traveller, is the general character of the people
                     inhabiting the place I name No-Faith. In various avocations this character is
                     sustained. They are not all as industrious as the family spoken of: but if
                     lolling in indolence, and entirely unconcerned in regard to any anticipated
                     wants, they exhibit the same blank as to any observable religious feeling.
                     Their personal appearance, words, acts toward each other, family associations,
                     social intercourse, all their rules of life, public buildings and institutions,
                     give no indications that any religious belief exists among them.
               
               
                  
                  NO-CARE.
                  No-Care lies adjoining the last named state. The climate, productions, and
                     character of the inhabitants in the two states, are very nearly alike. It is
                     far removed from the bracing climate of the temperate zone; and it is thought
                     to be attributable very much to the enervating influence of its climate, that
                     none of its natives are renowned for strength of mind, or for intellectual
                     attainments. Its soil is very luxurious, but poisonous reptiles and noxious
                     plants are its more natural products. The walk, motions when at work, and
                     general movements of the people, are exceedingly slow, and apparently without
                     aim; and they feel a peculiar lassitude when the breezes come from the
                     direction of No-Faith. Frequently, with such a mind, they care for no property,
                     no law, no friends, nor even for life itself. They seem to be doomed by fate;
                     they have no ambition to rouse and ascertain whether it merely seems so;
                     whether they can of their own free choice accomplish something worthy of
                     living. In that condition of imbecility the absolute monarch of that country
                     often exacts from them all their possessions sions; and somehow he often
                     strangely enlists them to become his most abject slaves.
                  Yet a few of these people have been waked to a consciousness of the folly of
                     staying in that state, and have been induced to emigrate to a better land.
                     These have always manifested in my hearing, whenever I met them, the highest
                     pleasure. Their escape from that dangerous land seems to them much like coming
                     to life from the dead.
               
               
                  FORMALITY.
                  This is a part of the country opposite to the states before named. And its
                     appearance is quite in contrast. It bears less marks of native wildness; it is,
                     indeed, pretty well cultivated. It is sufficiently cleared up and settled. Its
                     highways are laid out in regular order. The buildings and their appendages
                     exhibit considerable taste. Public buildings are found where needed,
                     constructed with economy and beauty. Churches and school-houses are located at
                     such distances as to be convenient of access to all the people. The state and
                     county buildings indicate that they have laws and enforce them. Indeed, in times of peace and fair weather, they
                     seem to be in a condition to enjoy life; and to have provided for themselves as
                     though they thought to stay there forever. And yet they are not without
                     religion,—such a religion that they might continue its practices and enjoy all
                     its promises in the same place eternally, if that could be allowed. They have
                     their stated periods for religious services; and also, a time for all things;
                     and, a place for everything, and everything in its appointed place.
                  In church they cannot properly be said to worship; nor indeed anywhere else.
                     But they have religious ceremonies which appear like worship. They assemble in
                     houses devoted professedly to the worship of God Most High. In their best and
                     neatest apparel they take their several places,—the minister in the pulpit, the
                     singers in the orchestra, the families in the main body of the house. With
                     solemn air the exercises commence. Presently beautiful harmony strikes the ear;
                     it seems like the sound of many voices praising God; but, on looking up, it is
                     seen by unmistakable signs to be a performance for the gratification of the
                     company present. Many look on, evidently with the impression that they have
                     nothing to do with the singing but to hear and enjoy. They do not notice the
                     expressions of language, they are taken with the sounds: of course the singing
                     does not raise the praise of their hearts in the sentiments of the hymn. They
                     feel thankful that the singers have performed their part well; and the singers
                     feel that they deserve credit and praise for their pains.
                  After this, the minister stands up, or kneels, to say prayers. It would be
                     thought out of due form for him to sit during prayer. While his voice is heard
                     in this ceremony, the congregation appears in various attitudes;—some sit on
                     their seats, either looking about or with their eyes closed, and some of them
                     reclining their heads in thoughtful mood or in slumber; others stand, and
                     perhaps a few think it appears better to kneel. The minister talks in his
                     prayer of many blessings enjoyed, and of many more wanted; and is very careful
                     to talk well and eloquently. After all, his hearers never say amen
                     with heart nor voice, to his thanks or requests, but are rather revolving in
                     their minds some business affairs
                     which have strongly engaged their feelings. If they had been appointed to go
                     with their minister to a king's throne to ask a favor, the king would never
                     have suspected that they added their names in signature to the offered petition
                     of their minister, if they conducted as this assembly does at such season of
                     prayer.
                  A celebrated bard has well described one leading class of persons in these
                     congregations. Of one such he says: 
                        
                           "He was a man
                           Who stole the livery of the court of heaven
                           To serve the devil in; in virtue's guise
                           Devoured the widow's house and orphan's bread;
                           In holy phrase transacted villanies
                           That common sinners durst not meddle with.
                           At sacred feast, he sat [a painted saint,]
                           And with his guilty hands touched holiest things.
                           And none of sin lamented more, or sighed
                           More deeply, or with graver countenance,
                           Or longer prayer, wept o 'er the dying man,
                           Whose infant children, at the moment, he
                           Planned how to rob: in sermon style he bought,
                           And sold, and lied; and salutation made
                           In Scripture terms: he prayed by quantity,
                           And with his repetitions long and loud,
                           All knees were weary; with one hand he put
                           A penny in the urn of poverty,
                           And with the other took a shilling out.
                           On charitable lists—those trump which told
                           The public car, who had in secret done
                           The poor a benefit, and half the alms
                           They told of, took themselves to keep them sounding;
                           He blazed his name, more pleased to have it there
                           Than in the Book of Life."
                        
                     
                  
                  Persons bearing such a description, and all the variety of characters there
                     assembled, do not really pray nor worship; but they are there to keep up the
                     forms of religion.
                  The minister announces his text. And how he preaches, another quotation from
                     the poet will show: 
                        
                           "He preached himself: he swore that love of souls
                           Alone, had drawn him to the Church: yet strew'd
                           The path that led to hell, with tempting flowers,
                           And in the ear of sinners, as they took
                           The way of death, he whispered peace: he swore
                           Away all love of lucre, all desire
                           Of earthly pomp, and yet a princely seat
                           He liked, and to the clink of Mammon's box
                           Gave most rapacious ear; his prophecies
                           He swore, were from the Lord; and yet taught lies
                           For gain: with quackish ointment healed the wounds
                           And bruises of the soul, outside, but left
                           Within the pestilent matter unobserved,
                           
                           To sap the moral constitution quite,
                           And soon to burst again, incurable.
                           
                           "For he another Gospel preached than Paul,
                           And one that had no Savior in 't. And yet
                           His life was worse. Faith, charity, and love,
                           Humility, forgiveness, holiness,
                           Were words well lettered in his Sabbath creed;
                           But with his life he wrote as plain: Revenge,
                           Pride, tyranny, and lust of wealth and power
                           Inordinate, and lewdness unashamed.
                           He was a wolf in clothing of the lamb.
                           —And that he was anointed, fools believed:
                           But [others] knew he was the devil's priest;
                           Anointed by the hands of Sin and Death,
                           And set peculiarly apart to ill."
                        
                     
                  
                  Whilst such a minister goes on with his discourse professedly to lead upward
                     the feelings of his auditors to adore and love God, and to induce in them an
                     enlightened fear of him, their busy minds use their liberty; and many a fine
                     bargain have they planned, and many a political scheme have they contrived,
                     during the sermon's hour. And they return to their homes wiser than they came;
                     for they have studied out, or dreamed, some valuable plans for future
                     operations; or, perhaps some have made observations upon the men and women
                     present, and are wiser from this study of human character.
                  Meanwhile they have done what they esteem a valuable service to the country and
                     to the rising generation; for, in going to church they encourage religious
                     institutions; and without these, one essential bond to hold society together
                     under the regulations of good laws, would be wanting. For the sake of this and
                     kindred interests, they, with great cheerfulness, both go to church, and bear a
                     part in paying the necessary expenses of keeping up the formalities of
                     religion.
                  The laws of these people, to be sure, are not religious laws; but some degree
                     of religious restraint is thought by legislators to be very important, in order
                     to keep certain despicable characters in awe. And for this purpose it is
                     thought desirable to give as much character as possible to religious
                     observances. All good citizens, it is supposed, will appreciate the importance
                     of encouraging decent religious institutions.
                  And yet all this religion, practiced in that region, is of a character which
                     might be continued tinued in all its
                     peculiarities of doctrine, and in the significancy of its ceremonies, forever
                     on earth, never finding in its ultimate results any sovereign Lord, nor any
                     heaven. It is a set of forms under the name of religion, for earthly purposes,
                     affording all its benefits during human life in this world.
                  As these peculiar formalities of religion are what have given name to this part
                     of the country, I need not take time to state other less prominent
                     characteristics.
               
               
                  CITY OF HEADY-RELIGIOUS DISPUTES.
                  Close by Formality lies the City of Heady-Religious Disputes. Prominent to the
                     view may be seen the floating banners of the city, with the motto inscribed:
                     "Contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints." But if these
                     citizens appear to conform to the letter of this text, they certainly fail to
                     abide by its spirit. They magnify to great importance small points of faith, to
                     the neglect of weightier matters. And this indeed seems necessary in order to
                     maintain the leading elements of their character; for if they were to have
                     their attention taken with the essential doctrines of Christianity, their
                     hearts would become affected, and their merely heady disputes would cease.
                  Persons of a great many sects live in this city; some of ancient, and some of
                     modern names. Some of these spend their religious study upon curious questions,
                     suggested by incidental remarks of the Scriptures. Prominent among these
                     curious questions is this,—Who was Melchisedec's grandfather? and hours of
                     religious talk are consumed in dispute upon it: more than these persons ever
                     spend to know how they may be saved from their sins. And whenever these read
                     the Bible, they do it with this spirit of curiosity, rather than that of pious
                     inquiry. In this way they try to study into the unrevealed mysteries
                     accompanying Christ's incarnation. A heated dispute once arose among them
                     whether the virgin Mary was or was not born by immaculate conception; and
                     whether she ever had any children after the birth of Jesus. They debated these
                     questions as though their eternal salvation depended on the correctness of
                     their conclusions. To settle the forms
                     of Church governments, frequently affords subjects for employment in this city:
                     and they never get these forms settled beyond dispute. They are more eager to
                     get right here, than they are to practice love to God and man.
                  One young man, formerly known to the writer, went to live in this city. He had
                     previously assumed an allegiance to Christ, and had soon after become very
                     zealous in arguing from house to house his views in regard to some of the forms
                     of religious ceremonies; particularly as to the form of administering the
                     sacrament of baptism. Which form he advocated I do not distinctly recollect;
                     but there arose considerable excitement among the people on the subject, and he
                     acted as though he was expending upon it all the zeal of a Christian's first
                     love. In a short time I heard of him in the City of Heady-Religious Disputes,
                     far from the city of Brotherly Love, but near Jonah's Retreat and Wrecking
                     Place.
                  A minister, once celebrated in the land of the saints, has gone to that city.
                     He ventured first into its suburbs, to advocate some views in regard to
                     enslaving the bodies of men; and in a way to neglect his great business of
                     wresting souls from the thraldom of sin. By the sweep of this controversy's
                     whirl, like that of Norway's Maelstrom, he was drawn within the circle of the
                     city, and became soon a regular citizen. He has since been heard of, bearing an
                     active part in the city, agitating various religious questions,—pertaining to
                     the time of Christ's second appearing, the day and the hour; the particular
                     part of the universe in which God will finally locate heaven, and how it will
                     appear; the annihilation of the wicked as the form of "the second death,"
                     &c., &c.
                  Pollok has well described one character found in this city. He names him, 
                        
                           "The bigot theologian—in minute
                           Distinctions skilled, and doctrines unreduced
                           To practice; in debate how loud! how long!
                           How dexterous! in Christian love, how cold!
                           His vain conceits were orthodox alone.
                           The immutable and heavenly truth, revealed
                           By God, was naught to him: he had an art,
                           A kind of hellish charm, that made the lips
                           Of truth speak falsehood; to his liking turned
                           The meaning of the text; made trifles seem
                           The marrow of salvation; to a word,
                           
                           A name, a sect, that sounded in the ear,
                           And to the eye so many letters showed,
                           But did no more—gave value infinite;
                           Proved still his reasoning best, and his belief,
                           Though propped on fancies, wild as madmen's dreams:
                           Most rational, most scriptural, most sound;
                           With mortal heresy denouncing all
                           Who in his arguments could see no force.
                           On points of faith too fine for human sight,
                           And never understood in heaven, he placed
                           His everlasting hope, undoubting placed."
                        
                     
                  
                  All these persons observe religious ceremonies very much as the inhabitants of
                     Formality do. They contend for these ceremonies; and, frequently, for customs
                     and creeds better than those upon which they practice. They generally prefer a
                     crowd, upon which they may urge their contending arguments.
                  As to the particular appearance of this city, it has this peculiarity;—it has
                     no direct sunlight. With but very few if any exceptions, it enjoys only
                     moon-light, or light otherwise reflected. A meteor-like star may occasionally
                     be seen. The inhabitants have heard of a sun which shines so clearly and
                     penetratingly as to affect not only the bodies and minds, but also the hearts
                     of the people. St. Paul reported this fact to them when he said, "God, who
                     commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to
                     give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
                     Christ."—2 Cor. 4:6.
                  But the condition of these people is represented by the same apostle in the 4th
                     verse, by asserting, "The God of this world hath blinded the minds of them
                     which believe not, lest the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, should
                     shine unto them." The light of the knowledge of the glory of God,
                     this city does not enjoy. They have rays of light, as stated, but not direct:
                     they are often much dimmed by repeated reflections through works of human
                     skill, (books,) and afford but little comfort to the soul. By such dim and cold
                     rays of light, and what they can manufacture themselves, these people pursue
                     their course of life,—studying, consulting with each other upon the various
                     points in dispute; from time to time gathering at church, there debating upon
                     the subjects of previous study and consultation; and then by the same uncertain
                     lights, gathering in knots about town, canvassing the merits of the debate. The closet, family prayer,
                     heart-searching, humility, and love, are neglected. Their heads are exercised
                     on religious topics, but their hearts are unaffected. Of course, various wrongs
                     are practiced, as the heart inclines.
                  The dim moon-light, the occasional meteor, the artificial lamp-lights and
                     fires,—all together afford but little heat, insufficient for comfort. The seat
                     of life is not warmed sufficiently to prevent an unpleasant sensation through
                     the whole system, occasioning a constant and very apparent restlessness. And
                     human nature, in this case, is very far from being able to conform her powers
                     to these circumstances so as to make them more endurable. The whole person
                     waxes worse and worse, and the nervous-like excitement more and more harassing.
                     A chilling coldness often seizes the heart, and a feeling of utter indifference
                     to the calls of the best friends: a certain premonition of the final doom of
                     the city is realized, even the brooding over it of an eternal night; with its
                     side next to heaven congealed by colder than polar frost, and the other warmed
                     only by the glare of the flames of hell. Then the often evinced truth appears
                     clearer than ever, that very little of vital Christianity and the spirit of
                     heaven, are requisite to an ardent controversialist about various religious
                     topics. One can fight for religion with none of it in his heart and but little
                     of it in his head.
               
               
                  JONAH'S RETREAT.
                  Jonah's Retreat embraces a large sea-coast and its adjoining seas. Some live
                     almost entirely in vessels, floating upon the sea; and taken all together, the
                     population is very great. This territory is now claimed by the great usurper,
                     Beelzebub, as a part of his dominions; and it is filled with inhabitants who
                     have revolted from their rightful Sovereign. Happy he who
                        escapes—emigrates to the better land.
                  
                  The general character of the inhabitants corresponds to that of Jonah, after
                     whom the place is named. 1. He was unwilling to do what his God required. "The
                     word of the Lord came unto Jonah, saying, Arise, go to Nineveh, that great
                     city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me. But Jonah rose up to flee unto
                     Tarshish from the presence of the Lord." He was unwilling to do what appeared
                     to him to be risking his reputation, even though by Divine direction. Said he,
                     "I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great
                     kindness, and repentest thee of the evil."
                  In view of this character of God, he suspected that the proclamation he was
                     directed to make against Nineveh would be reversed, just as sure as the
                     Ninevites repented and asked this favor. In such case his denunciations against
                     it would fail, and he appear to be a false prophet. He was unwilling to do duty
                     as required, and trust consequences with God.
                  In like manner all the people of this place are obstinately unwilling to serve
                     their rightful Sovereign. With this obstinacy of heart there are found here all
                     classes of persons, from the humblest peasant with the feeblest capacity, to
                     the most towering and cultivated minds. They have become so abject as to be
                     willing to forsake their lawful Sovereign for the rule of a despot. They might
                     have performed valuable service as public officers, in publishing laws and
                     their penalties, in presenting inducements to all to comply with the laws, in
                     bearing rewards to the faithful, in warning and urging against disobedience;
                     and indeed, by being always ready for any service wanted. Those less capable of
                     public usefulness, or in less favorable circumstances for it, as is the case of
                     most women—for these too are found in this Retreat—might have accomplished
                     essentially good service in building up the kingdom of their rightful Lord,—by
                     living happy lives under his dominion, strengthening and encouraging each other
                     in every day life, warning each other and all persons when danger was near,
                     helping sustain expenses of the kingdom, going in companies to drive off those
                     disposed to encroach upon the rights of their country, and by winning them,
                        per equales, from the enemy's ranks. Souls
                     unwilling to serve in all such various ways, may be found occupying this
                     Retreat.
                  2. Jonah fled from the presence of the Lord. So all these people have fled from
                     their lawful Ruler to get rid of doing duty. Jonah was told to "go to Nineveh,
                     that great city, and to cry against it." So all these have been told to do some duty; to get rid of doing
                     which, they have fled. They may have never done a thing forbidden; but they
                     have neglected to do what was required. They were required by the King of
                     Heaven to engage in his service, with assurances of rich rewards. Young men
                     were required to become his ministers, or to employ their property in their
                     King's service,—to enter upon all the several avocations in life in a way to
                     serve his interests. And the ladies were required to serve him in their
                     appropriate spheres. Once a timid female was required to warn her associates of
                     the danger to which she saw them exposed; and to carefully set an example of
                     escaping the same danger herself, in a way to encourage their effort. Rather
                     than do it she fled to this Retreat. Indeed, farmers and mechanics, tradesmen,
                     sailors, officers of civil government, male and female, the rich and the poor,
                     persons of all classes, may be seen at different times urging their course
                     toward this Retreat. Some take long and crooked journeys to reach it. For
                     instance, one C., an acquaintance of the writer, was required to give important
                     instruction and warning to certain of his friends and acquaintances; all of
                     which he was well capable of doing, and would thereby have greatly benefited
                     the government under which he lived. He begun to comply, and with marked
                     success; but became unwilling to devote his time, and endure the requisite toil
                     and reproach. He thought he would willingly suffer all this among any other
                     people; but he could not feel as he wished in going to these. He must stop and
                     go somewhere else to live. He had obtained some ideas about this Retreat. He
                     resolved to try it, and started. He went a few hundred miles, when his funds
                     run out; and he stopped to try a livelihood there. Succeeding but poorly, and
                     hearing of gold on the route he wanted to take, he started for this land of
                     gold. But he never reached it: he ended his days in another part of this
                     Retreat. He was not so fortunate as the ancient Jonah, who escaped from the
                     belly of the fish. This man was taken by the monster alcohol, and soon
                     miserably perished. Some have been more fortunate than he, and have survived
                     and escaped, like Jonah, to tell the tale of their perils.
                  
                  3. Jonah was exposed to imminent dangers. This has been already intimated as
                     the case with some before they became fairly settled in this Retreat. But
                     persons who have arrived there, and are in apparently easy circumstances,
                     suffer great misery and danger. They all spend a miserable life; for if they
                     are so stultified by their base habits as to be unconscious of the evils to
                     which they are exposed, they are equally insensible to the refined enjoyments
                     of life. They, however, know enough to have their comforts blasted by "a
                     fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation."
                  One who might have been a minister of God lives in a miserable way. He enters
                     upon a great many projects for business, but never pursues any one course long
                     enough to bring it to any successful conclusion. He is constantly embarrassed,
                     harassed, and unhappy: and all this is just what might be expected in his state
                     of mind. Every kind of business requires to be pursued a certain length of
                     time, in order to bring it to a successful issue; and his state, restless under
                     the goadings of conscience, will not suffer him to exercise patience enough for
                     this. Occasionally he sees individuals chained, and all prepared to be taken to
                     Sin's Prison-House, who assure him that he might have influenced them to a
                     course of life, by which they never would have reached their present position. 
                        
                           "Ah me! what cursing then
                           Was heaped upon his head by ruined souls.
                           That charged him with their murder."
                        
                     
                  
                  Then he sees them dragged away. And is it any wonder that he hears their
                     denunciations from their Prison-House? Can a soul, once possessed of human
                     feelings, be other than horrified at the assurance that he has contributed, by
                     his neglect, to the writhing of his former friends in torment? Especially must
                     he feel when, with this, he knows he is himself momentarily exposed to the same
                     suffering.
                  Another apparently succeeds better, and gets rich. For awhile his thoughts are
                     so absorbed with money matters that he forgets where he is. Thus forgetting, he
                     is not troubled with the ruin others are suffering because he has refused to
                     help them as he might have done. But the day of retribution awaits him: he must again awake to what evil he has
                     done, and he is every moment exposed to have the blood of many required at his
                     hands. His riches are turned to be his greatest curse.
                  Indeed, with all classes, in every avocation in this Retreat, the very opposite
                     of what is promised to those who love God, is endured.—All things
                     work together for evil to those who flee from the presence of the Lord, to
                     avoid doing the duties he requires.
               
               
                  WRECKING PLACE.
                  On one side of this is Philosopher's Valley; and again hard by,
                     is False-Hope Mountain.Troubled Seas more than half
                     surround it, and project, at several points, far into the interior. On one
                     border is the promontory Scepticism; so high as to be seen from
                     all parts of Wrecking Place.
                  The character of the inhabitants corresponds with the rough and forbidding
                     aspects of the country. But the country is most noted for the number of souls
                     wrecked there.
                  Several young men once set sail on what they termed the voyage of life. A
                     number of young ladies were with them. They took with them a chart,* prepared by one
                     acquainted with all the seas in their route; and so plainly descriptive that
                     any unlearned and inexperienced persons could know by it their best course.
                     With this they had a true and long-tried compass, always pointing its needle
                     toward the pole.†
                      Their chart and compass were designed to serve them as guides, to show
                     them at any time where they were, and to insure the correctness of their course
                     toward their proposed destination. But they begun very soon to look at them as
                     objects of curiosity and criticism. The assurances of their deserving
                     confidence because of their having never failed those who have been guided by
                     them, are forgotten in the spirit of guessing into their mysteries. Instead of
                     following their direct way, as the compass would guide them, they indulge doubt
                     of its correctness, and turn to the left.
                     
                        
                        *Bible
                     
                     
                        
                        †The representation of the Bible as a chart, and the Conscience, under the
                           influence of the Holy Spirit, as a compass, is warranted by various
                           passages of Scripture; as, John 5: 39; Acts 17: 11; Rom. 8: 14, 26; James
                           1: 5; Rom. 1: 19; John 14: 26; John 16: 13.
                      Why, say they, does the needle always point to
                     the north? We can see no reason for this; and therefore, we do not believe it
                     does. And who knows whether the chart is correct? It is true, we never heard of
                     any being shipwrecked who trusted to this chart and compass. But is it not
                     folly to trust to what we cannot comprehend? and there are many mysteries about
                     these guides.
                  One daring fellow, with more self-esteem than his associates, stood and said:
                     "Hear me, my friends, hale fellows well met. It is degrading to be so much
                     concerned about what is read upon that little parchment, and about the
                     fluttering of that little needle. I am too independent to be influenced by such
                     guides. I have a mind of my own, certainly given me to use; and I will use it,
                     to choose my own way to harbor and home. I have heard a great many things about
                     this chart and compass. Rumor says that they are gotten up for speculative
                     purposes; and that certain men called priests, who are in the secret of their
                     being palmed upon the world, chuckle over the thought that their chart and
                     compass rule the ways of thousands: and somehow they have their account in all
                     this. True, this chart has been of great service to many; and, really, I must
                     think we would be perfectly safe to follow its guidance; but who can consent to
                     be laughed at every time he hauls up on these troubled seas? I declare to you,
                     that chart and compass must be put out of sight, and we will direct our course
                     by our superior judgment, without any regard to them. Such mysterious,
                     incomprehensible guides, shall not lord it over me. I can find my own way." To
                     this all agreed, and encouraged each other in this decision; so that all showed
                     confidence, though a few felt some misgivings in regard to their safety.—"Land
                     on the star-board," cried the man on the look out. And, indeed, there was the
                     promontory, Scepticism, hard by, close along which they had been coasting
                     during their conversation, but until now undiscovered, because of the
                     fog.—"Breakers ahead," was the cry again:—and again, "Helm hard up:"—and they
                     just escaped, when lo, they found themselves in what is called Troubled Seas.
                     Of these they had heard; but they thought there were some fine prospects; and, who that is
                     a good sailor, is afraid of a storm? Like the storm bird, let this be our
                     element, said they. The women became alarmed at their daring; but were quieted
                     at last with repeated assurances of their regard; and that it was silly to be
                     influenced by fear, because that dirty chart and old compass told them they
                     were in dangerous seas. They all drank and caroused together, forgetting all
                     care about safety, when behold, they were nearly engulfed in a whirlpool,—and
                     they sunk together.
                  Some merchants started on a voyage for gain; and disregarding their chart and
                     compass, were wrecked in these seas.
                  A physician, venturing to guide his course in all respects, in the same way he
                     did in the uncertainties of medical practice, thought to pursue his perilous
                     voyage according to symptoms, and so took no chart or compass with him. He
                     trusted in no God, and found no protector. He was wrecked on these shores.
                  An attorney thought he knew too much,—he, a statesman, was too wise, to think
                     his destiny was depending on the information received from a simple chart and
                     compass, which even a negro could understand. And away he ventured upon the
                     voyage of life with no guide but a pretender for a pilot, who proved a false
                     wretch. Soon the statesman was dashed upon the rocks of Scepticism.
                  Many persons in common life, seeing these professional characters, who are
                     reputed for learning and influence in society, starting off without chart or
                     compass, themselves venture to follow the example. Thousands of these have been
                     wrecked in every part of that country. A few occasionally escape to land, and
                     linger awhile in mortal life; and, sometimes one finds a cast-away chart and
                     compass; and, resolving to trust their guidance, escapes to the land of the
                     free. O how rejoiced were those I met with of this class. Is not this escaping
                     from the very jaws of death? said they.
                  Cumberland gives a most mournful story concerning a gentleman of this
                     country.—"I remember him in the height of his fame, the hero of his party; no
                     man so caressed, followed, and applauded. He was a little loose, his friends
                     would own, in his moral character, but
                     then he was the honestest fellow in the world; it was not to be denied, that he
                     was rather free in his notions, but then he was the best creature living. I
                     have seen men of the gravest character wink at his follies; because he was so
                     pleasant and so well bred, it was impossible to be angry with him. Everything
                     went well with him; and Antitheus seemed to be at the summit of human
                     prosperity, when he was suddenly seized with the most alarming symptoms. He was
                     at his country house; and, which had rarely happened to him, at that time
                     alone; wife or family he had none, and out of the multitude of his friends no
                     one happened to be near him at the time of his attack. A neighboring physician
                     was called out of bed in the night to come to him with all haste in his
                     extremity. He found him sitting up in his bed supported by pillows, his
                     countenance full of horror, his breath struggling as in the article of death,
                     his pulse intermitting, and at times beating with such rapidity as could hardly
                     be counted. Antitheus dismissed the attendants he had about him, and eagerly
                     demanded of the physician if he thought him in danger; the physician answered
                     that he must fairly tell him he was in imminent danger.—How so!
                     how so! do you think me dying?—He was sorry to say, the symptoms indicated
                        death.—Impossible! you must not let me die. I dare not die. O
                     doctor! save me if you can.—Your situation, sir, is such, that it is not in
                     mine, or any other man's art, to save you; and I think I should not do my duty,
                     if I gave you any false hopes in these moments, which, if I am not mistaken,
                     will not more than suffice for any worldly or other concerns, which you may
                     have upon your mind to settle.—My mind is full of horror, and I
                     am incapable of preparing it for death.—He now fell into an agony, accompanied
                     with a shower of tears. A cordial was administered, and he revived in a degree;
                     when, turning to the physician, who had his fingers upon his pulse, he eagerly
                     demanded of him, if he did not see that blood upon the feet-curtain of his bed.
                     There was none to be seen, the physician assured him; it was nothing but a
                     vapor of his fancy.—'I see it plainly,' said he, 'in the shape of a human hand:
                     I have been visited with a tremendous
                     apparition. As I was lying sleepless in my bed this night, I took up a letter
                     of a deceased friend, to dissipate certain thoughts that made me uneasy. I
                     believed him to be a great philosopher, and was converted to his opinions.
                     Persuaded by his arguments and my own experience, that the disorderly affairs
                     of this evil world would not be administered by any wise, just, or provident
                     Being, I had brought myself to think that no such Being could exist, and that a
                     life produced by chance, must terminate in annihilation. This is the reasoning
                     of that letter, and such were the thoughts I was revolving in my own mind, when
                     the apparition of my dear friend presented itself before me, and, unfolding the
                     curtains of my bed, stood at my feet, looking earnestly upon me for a
                     considerable space of time. My heart sunk within me; for his face was ghastly,
                     full of horror, with an expression of such an anguish as I can never describe.
                     His eyes were fixed upon me, and at length, with a mournful motion of his
                        head—Alas, alas! he cried, we are in a fatal
                        error!—and taking hold of the curtains with his hand, shook them
                     violently, and disappeared. This I protest to you, I both saw and heard; and
                     look! where the print of his hand is left in blood upon the curtains.'"
                  Cumberland says that Antitheus survived the relation of this vision very few
                     hours, and died delirious, in very great agonies: and he justly remarks, "What
                     a forsaken and disconsolate creature is man, without his God and Savior."
                  Thus forsaken and disconsolate are all those who occupy Wrecking Place. Their
                     general career, and their end, unless avoided by timely emigration, are well
                     described by Pollok under the character of the wordly-wise man: 
                        
                           "He that to worldly wisdom shaped
                           His character, became the favorite
                           Of men—was honorable termed, a man
                           Of spirit; noble, glorious, lofty soul!
                           And as he crossed the earth in chase of dreams,
                           Received prodigious shouts of warm applause.
                           Hence, who to Godly wisdom framed his life,
                           Was counted mean, and spiritless, and vile.
                           —The wise [worldly-wise] man first of all eradicates,
                           As much as possible, from out his mind
                           All thought of death, God, and eternity
                           Admires the world, and thinks of time alone;
                           
                           Avoids the Bible, all reproof avoids;
                           Rocks conscience, if he can, asleep; puts out
                           The eye of reason; prisons, tortures, binds;
                           And makes her thus by violence and force,

                           Lets passion loose; the substance leaves; pursues
                           The shadow vehemently, but ne'er o 'ertakes;
                           Puts by the cup of holiness and joy;
                           And drinks, carouses deeply in the bowl
                           Of death; grovels in dust; pollutes, destroys
                           His soul; is miserable to acquire
                           More misery; deceives to be deceived;
                           Strives, labors to the last to shun the truth;
                           Strives, labors to the last to damn himself;
                           Turns desperate, shudders, groans, blasphemes, and dies,
                           And sinks—where could he else?—to endless wo:
                           And drinks the wine of God's eternal wrath."
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  MINING TERRITORY.
                  Mining Territory occupies the very heart of the country. Its surface is rough,
                     but picturesque; and lovers of gain think it a very agreeable climate.
                  What would strike a stranger most in passing, is the occupation of its
                     inhabitants. Their occupation is searching, digging for precious metals. These
                     are esteemed precious, because scarce, and because of its being exceedingly
                     difficult to obtain them; besides, they supply precious wants, those wants
                     which are over and above the natural; such as are artificial, superficial, for
                     glitter and show. To gather these, and either hoard them, or show them in every
                     possible way so as to make many wonder and admire, is the grand aim of their
                     laborious lives.
                  Once a passing stranger asked one of these busy beings about his native place;
                     what he was doing, and what were his prospects. He answered for himself; and in
                     doing this, represented also the case of his neighbors. Said this man, whom we
                     will call Miser,—I am of noble birth. I am in the direct lineage from the king
                     of Heaven. There is reserved for me in that other world an inheritance, enough
                     for any man, which it is my privilege to go to and enjoy forever. I understand
                     that the streets of the city there where part of my inheritance lies, are paved
                     with gold. O how I love to see gold! Surely, I may gather some here.
                  Stranger. But I thought rich men's sons were apt to think they were well enough
                     off without digging in the earth.
                  
                  M. O, to be sure I have a rich ancestry; and if I retain my father's favor by
                     being faithful to comply with his wishes, I have no want to fear. But there is
                     pleasure in the finding: there is health in the digging.
                  S. True, it is declared to all, since the fall, "By the sweat of thy brow shalt
                     thou eat thy bread all the days of thy life." We may understand that exercise
                     is important to both health and pleasure. But is it your chief business to eat,
                     and drink, and enjoy the good of your labor?
                  M. Why, this occupies most of my time. And how can one help having the
                     attention and feelings mostly enlisted upon what is so necessary? Why despise a
                     present good, to prefer that in the far off future? Indeed, I have heard it
                     said that the main business assigned to human beings in this world, is to lay
                     up treasures in heaven: that by following the instructions of their Lord, even
                     the evils of life will be made the very elements of richer good in a future
                     state of being: that souls passing through the ordeal of afflictions in this
                     world, according to instructions given, will come forth as gold tried in the
                     fire: that flesh and blood are but the crucible in which the living soul is
                     tried: that the living soul may be happy as angels, have access to everything
                     it may prize good in God's universe, live in perfect safety and unalloyed
                     bliss, of a nature so high and godlike, that all earthly substance—the
                     glittering metals and most precious pearls, and highest puffs of applause ever
                     given by earth's sons, will all be counted as chaff; and that only known as a
                     thing that was. Every human being has an immaterial, immortal nature, suited to
                     enjoy a home far different from any which these shining minerals can furnish.
                     Yet, I love to gather these mineral treasures. And what did God make them in
                     this world for, if not for our use?
                  S. What did he make corn for, if not to use? But because corn grows for man's
                     use, must we conclude it is proper to do nothing else but eat corn? And yet one
                     might conclude thus, just as reasonably as to suppose, because God has made the
                     precious metals, it is right to concentrate all our energies during life, in
                     gathering them together in the form of
                     what the world calls wealth. How would it seem, if you were a stranger, passing
                     along by that heavenly city, the New Jerusalem, and should see in it angels,
                     and saints, settled there from the earth, undertaking to gather material
                     treasures, to the neglect of the appropriate enjoyment of spiritual beings, and
                     to the disregard of the laws of the Lord, who sits on Heaven's throne? Think of
                     seeing the angel Gabriel stooping, and bending his noble thoughts to plan an
                     enterprize for the employment of a legion of angels. He surveys the heavenly
                     city, and considers the materials to be found in the surrounding regions: he
                     contrives how its grandeur might be increased. And the thought strikes him,
                     that a city of his own contrivance would be honorable. He encourages many about
                     him to the work. Think how that multitude would appear in heaven, engaged in
                     such a work. They spare not the fair face of nature to adorn their artificial
                     structures. Those trees by the river of life, which yield their fruit every
                     month, and whose leaves are for the healing of the nations—Rev. 22: 2—they cut
                     down, and form into various frame work; other er precious trees are taken to
                     ornament these structures; the hills are dug through to find structures; the
                     hills are dug through to find the most precious stones, like those adorning the
                     walls of the New Jerusalem—Rev. 21: 19, 20—and so the fair surface of Paradise
                     is broken, to obtain precious metals, with which to adorn whatever may be
                     constructed by these self-directed architects of heaven. They even dig up the
                     golden pavements of the Holy City, and wrench doors and gates from their
                     hinges, to obtain materials for their work. Chests full of precious ore are
                     laid by, and called treasures; but are never used, only by counting them at
                     intervals for the gratification of those who have gathered them. By the
                     possession of such treasures great consequence is gained in the eyes of
                     neighbors; and emulation is excited. Others select those materials which shine
                     best and are most difficult to be obtained, and exhibit them upon their
                     persons, their houses, and everything they possess, in positions where their
                     shining will most be seen; and so they fix their thoughts and attract the
                     thoughts of others to these things, until they forget who is their Lord, and
                     what is their appropriate propriate
                     business in heaven. They become reckless about the rights of other beings, and
                     with great selfishness gratify their ambition, in defiance of law.
                  Besides all this, think of their being called at one of the regularly returning
                     periods of that heavenly state, to gather in devout adoration before God, there
                     to exhibit continued allegiance to him as their rightful Sovereign: but they
                     disregard the call, and continue their material toil. They will not spare time
                     to worship the Lord. They have already neglected to take time to inquire after
                     his will. They have other business now than to serve their God; unless, indeed,
                     their labors in their own way may be for his glory. This they persuade
                     themselves to believe is the case,—that their architecture, adorning,
                     accoutrements, and showy ceremonies they are contriving, will rival the skill
                     and attractions shown by God around the place where he is adored; so that they
                     will draw, by their artificial work, more devotion to God. They think they may
                     do this great evil, even violate the laws of the Supreme, and the sanctity of
                     the Holy City, in order that this good may come. They would fain have it
                     believed that, by serving themselves, as stated, they serve the Lord. They
                     claim the privilege, too, of disregarding all sacred times and seasons, for
                     their selfish gains. And how glad they are that there is no night in heaven.
                     They can spend all the time in their work to their own mind.
                  Other beings, faithful to their trust, in a way suited to the nature of noble
                     spiritual beings, are busy in exercising their godlike powers upon subjects
                     fully equal to their capacities; they study to know more of God and his works,
                     and by this study to become wiser and rise higher and higher in the scale of
                     being, to become more and more like God; they learn better and better how to
                     promote harmony in God's universe, to understand the springs of real enjoyment,
                     how to make happiness spring up more freely all around them; ever and anon they
                     are sent in turn to some far off sphere, to minister instruction or mercy to
                     some order of beings similar to themselves; in short, their employment and
                     enjoyment are like those of the Infinite Spirit, and in these they ever
                        approximate mate toward the
                     perfection of that Spirit. As sure as God is happy, they are; as sure as God is
                     employed, they are. But these secular workers disregard such
                     employment and happiness, and somehow contrive to bend their noble powers to
                     material work. It is true, matter is found in heaven, and that of most precious
                     form; but it is designed as the instrument of spirits, to be used by them; yet
                     these daring ones bend their spirits to matter,—make the instrument the
                     end.
                  O, think how it would seem to a passing stranger, to find legions of spiritual
                     beings in heaven, bending all their energies to material work as suggested; and
                     all this in violation of the directions given by the Supreme Ruler; thus
                     neglecting the occupations and enjoyments which
                     characterize heaven. What would you think, friend, if you were a stranger,
                     passing heaven, and should see beings thus employed?
                  M. What should I think! think! why—why, I should suppose they were very
                     foolish: that they were not attending to their proper business, and were very
                     daring.
                  S. Well, what is the difference between such supposed inconsistency, and yours?
                     You make gain of earthly treasures the grand aim in all your plans and toils,
                     and force your God-like mind, your feelings, your religion—everything, to bend
                     to this. Now, for which should you live, for the body or the soul? for self, as
                     dictator; or for the glory of God? Should your spiritual nature and bodily
                     organs, the laws of God and the good of religion, be made secondary and
                     contributary to laying up treasures upon earth? or, ought you to use all the
                     abilities you have, and all of earth's treasures which come into your
                     possession, as secondary and contributary to the enriching of your immortal
                     soul with Godlike endowments?
                  M. What I ought to do is not the leading question with me nor my neighbors.
                     Where is the human being who does all he ought to do? However strange our
                     course may appear to you, a passing stranger, we feel more inclined to
                     satisfaction in the conclusion that we do well in resolving to be rich. Some of
                     us love riches for their own sake,—we love to count our treasures: some of us
                     are laying up something to make our children respectable: some are ambitious to get honor, or power; and riches,
                     you know, will essentially help us to these. Yet, with all these earthly gains,
                     we mean to have religion enough before we die to carry us to heaven.
                  So these people argue, and strangely think to do a very different work on earth
                     from that for which God has placed them here, and after all, be treated as
                     though faithful to their trust. They disregard the warning that "they who will
                     be rich fall into temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful
                     lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition." And really, it is found
                     that there is a loadstone-like power in this territory, which attracts and
                     holds its inhabitants to its soil, so that it is exceedingly difficult to
                     induce any to emigrate. Thus is manifested what Christ meant when he said, "It
                     is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to
                     enter into the kingdom of God." Yet some, through great and merciful help from
                     God, do emigrate, and give all their gains to the service of God.
               
               
                  LECHERY
                  The very name of this city indicates the character of those residing in it and
                     its suburbs. It is necessary to say but little to give an idea of the native
                     place of the few emigrants who have come over from that city. The sun of this
                     world shines there, and warms, and excites exhilarating breezes; but these
                     agencies are turned from their legitimate effects to the arousing of the
                     depraved corruptions of human nature, and a loathsome miasma pervades the
                     atmosphere. Whatever enjoyments are found there, are earth-like; and like
                     eating the book of which the angel said—Rev. 10: 9, 10—"Take it, and eat it up;
                     and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
                     honey." Many have perished with this bitterness. And yet many of the
                     inhabitants claim to be intelligent and noble: and it is true that all grades
                     of human society are found there, from the poorest serf, to the inheritor of
                     kingdoms. After all, it is a miserable land to dwell in, and the habits of the
                     people are worse than those of beasts. Happy are they who escape to the better land in time to
                     overcome the baneful effects of that inhospitable climate. In that city, she is
                     most noticeable whose "house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of
                     death."—Prov. 7: 27.
               
               
                  OFFICE-HILL FACTORY.
                  The capitol of the kingdom is upon Office-Hill. And here, above the offices of
                     the several departments of state, clerk's offices, and legislative halls, and
                     the palace itself, towers most prominent to view, the factory for manufacturing
                     officers for government. Hence the name of the seat of government—Office-Hill Factory. Here gather the chief dignitaries of the kingdom. Here
                     it is shown that, if all men are born with equal rights, they are certainly not
                     destined to continue equal. There will be the governor and the governed. But
                     though this may be generally true in all countries, in this kingdom, 'tis never
                     worth that makes the man, nor gains him office. Officers are made, or moulded
                     in the factory, of such stuff as is easily wrought.
                  The fact is, speaking without this figure, in this kingdom men seek office and
                     high station for the sake of the honors and emoluments; not in the spirit of
                     philanthropy or virtue. The spirit of selfishness is supreme with them. In
                     front of the factory on this hill, and of its sub-factories in all parts of the
                     kingdom, men may be seen chatting to attract every passing newsmonger; and so
                     gathering up and revolving in their minds the popular views and feelings of the
                     people, that they may know how to shape their course in the direction of public
                     opinion. They have no concern to enlighten and elevate the masses; but, to
                     watch the signs of the times, and sagaciously anticipate the direction the
                     masses will take, in time to flourish in their front. That being done, it is of
                     no consequence whether virtue is trampled on, and the right outraged. They are
                     the popular leaders, getting glory and wealth; and that is enough.
                  The people will not always allow them to take such front position, without some
                     manifestations of erudition and wealth. As to erudition, they can easily
                     manufacture that in Office-Hill Factory. A part of the process is for the operators to volunteer cute
                     decisions upon various affairs of their neighbors. Much bold effrontery,
                     pampering of wealth, and cherishing of vanity, will gain them notice. And as to
                     wealth, 
                        
                           "Fools, indeed, drop the man in their account,
                           And vote the mantle into majesty.—
                           So, the small savage boasts his silver fur,
                           His royal robe unborrow'd, and unbought,
                           His own, descending fairly from his sires."
                        
                     
                  
                  And if his ermined covering be borrowed, and not "his own," it is all the same
                     with that multitude; provided he can wear it as his. He must figure in wealth,
                     either real or borrowed, and scatter freely among his constituents; then he may
                     be voted into renown.
                  With all this, these notables ought to appear virtuous. Some gain much by a
                     reputation for morality; but definite, real piety, must not be in that kingdom.
                     The notion somehow has become prevalent there, that genuine virtue is
                     incompatible with the most prominent positions in civil society. In this
                     factory, and its subs through the kingdom, no efforts are made to refine
                     candidates for public office in the crucible ble of Christ's Gospel. Even if a
                     candidate has sometime passed through this ordeal, it must not be known. If he
                     has ever received any Gospel light, he must not let it shine. He must appear to
                     be in the light, to be sure; but the light of the Sun of Righteousness is too
                     clear for the comfort of those about him. If this light clearly shines upon
                     him, its reflection from him will be too bright for the conscience-eyes of his
                     favorers: they will not be able to endure it, and will turn away from him. The
                     mild tints of earth's twilight is all he must venture to reflect. The sun must
                     be out of sight.
                  And the sun not being seen, these persons persuade each other that the light
                     they have is from the earth. Super-earthly, or super-natural light, they do not
                     allow to direct them; but this natural light, or light of nature, with what
                     they can manufacture, they conclude is amply sufficient for all their wants.
                     With this they can walk erect, and they believe, without stumbling, in
                     religion's garb; and so have a show of virtue in an attractive exterior. And if
                     they may do this, their object is gained. Who ever thought of exhibiting shows,
                        where equipage and splendid scenery
                     were to attract, except by artificial light at night? Even the light of day is
                     shut out of some of their churches, to make deeper impressions upon assembled
                     worshipers by lamp-light. In the course of moulding officers in this Factory,
                     this advantage of artificial, earthly light, over the light of the sun, in
                     making impressions so as to gain admirers, is not forgotten. Too much and too
                     bright light would expose to view some evil deformities in the products of this
                     Factory, which all their drapery would not effectually cover. They in fact
                     "love darkness," or at least shadows, "rather than light, because their deeds
                     are evil." No "Sun of Righteousness" must give, at the best, any more than its
                     dimly reflected rays in that place: and then but few will deem it advisable to
                     allow that they are anything more than flashing scintillations from the earth.
                     This earth they glorify; and claim to honor the best earth-born religion and
                     virtue. In this way they flatter earth-lovers; and these being the majority of
                     the people, they gain the end in getting their votes and money.
                  They learn in this Factory to turn modern inventions to their account. They
                     have long since gained the reputation of great skill in operating behind a
                     curtain, pulling and working numerous wires unsuspected by the multitude
                     abroad, so as to exhibit to all gazers any picture they choose. In this way
                     they often excite the passions of the people, and make impressions upon them
                     greatly to their own advantage. In short, the most skillful operators in
                     wire-pulling are quite sure to accomplish any project they please, by thus
                     enchanting the people in their favor. The people rush to help them.
                  The modern invention of telegraphing helps them much in this process; for they
                     have connecting wires with all parts of the kingdom, so that they can turn up
                     pictures to view everywhere, to suit their ends. The wire-working age is not
                     passed. In the king's court and the legislative halls, they make wise and
                     blustering speeches, with the flaming introduction that they speak to inform
                     and convince in legislative capacity, as in duty bound; when in fact, this is a
                     part of their skillful Factory operation to manufacture officers. Many of their speeches would never be delivered if
                     it were not with the view of getting office. Telegraph wires are very
                     convenient for carrying such speeches where it is designed they shall make
                     their chief impression—to the multitudes all through the land. Having drilled
                     through the several processes requisite in the Factory, if one has attained
                     skill as an operator, he has only to exercise this skill a few times, when his
                     fortune will be made; unless, in the final process, where one cannot succeed
                     alone, and where they help each other by log-rolling, one turns traitor and
                     declares to his brother, on the eve of stepping to the pinnacle of fame in
                     office; "though you have helped me, I will not help you."
                  Now, strange as it may seem, the people pay the operators richly by the day; as
                     though they were at work for the people in the necessary business of
                     legislation and governmental affairs. This latter is what many of the operators
                     profess to be doing, though in fact they are working for themselves, in
                     manufacturing offices and officers in a way to bring them future rich
                     annuities. Many of the people of that country think that the officers of their
                     government are chosen from among themselves, and are selected and raised to
                     office for their real merits; when, in fact, they are made in the Factory, and
                     the people's votes simply recognize and confirm them in their already assumed
                     official stations.
                  It is evident, from the descriptions given, that a residence in Office-Hill
                     Factory is not safe: as surely so as that God is the Supreme Ruler, and that he
                     executes justice upon all those who persist in rebellion against his
                     government. To become officers against him, as these residents surely are,
                     subjects them to the more fearful danger, because of their prominence and
                     active influence. To occupy high station, and in all the power of this high
                     station to be against God, is an aggravated wrong. And He who cannot mistake,
                     has said, "He that is not with me, is against me; and he that gathereth not
                     with me, scattereth abroad."
               
               
                  
                  FALSE-HOPE MOUNTAINS.
                  Hope aspires to high position. It rests on prominent objects. If good, it may
                     be happy in the vale of content; but if false, it will not stay there. It
                     climbs to a high place, where it can peer the furthest possible.
                  False-Hope Mountains are near the sea, having No-Faith and Wrecking Place
                     within their range; and Mining Territory in their rear. Those who reside in
                     Mining Territory are very apt to change residence for these Mountains.
                  The residents are apparently a hardy, resolute class. They are noted for
                     telling what they are going to do, but never muster courage to begin: so they
                     look for the end without using the means. In fact, they could not do what they
                     talk of, if they tried.
                  Some of False-Hope Mountains are occupied by Indians; some, by Mohammedans; and
                     others by classes of persons of various views in religious affairs; but all
                     graduate their notions of heaven according to the objects by them most highly
                     prized on earth. One, naturally lazy, thinks Heaven's acme of bliss will
                     consist in its leisure. Another, enthusiastically fond of getting knowledge,
                     estimates its chief pleasure to consist in the continuous opening of new ideas
                     to the mind. And another, who is fond of mixed society, and loves their sinful
                     pleasures, cannot think of parting with such society in heaven. Their idea of
                     heaven is, that it embraces all varieties for its inhabitants, good, bad, and
                     indifferent; all somehow loving and being loved, despite of the diversity of
                     disposition and habits; and, that these are all free from what they denominate
                     religious restraint and singularity, for which they despise the pious in this
                     world.
                  "There is a better land," they claim. Very few have an idea that their present
                     homes are the only ones they will ever enjoy. They have heard of heaven, and
                     have formed some ideas about it as their future place. But as it is thought to
                     be better than their present homes, their ideas about it assume
                     their character from the character of the objects which are now most highly
                     esteemed. The untutored Indian of the American forests prizes most highly
                        the enjoyments connected with
                     hunting and fishing. So he forms his idea of heaven in accordance. He aspires
                     to a heaven where game will be plenty; and where the silver-like lakes and
                     clear rivers will abound with fish. When one dies, his friends bury by his side
                     his bow and arrows, with other equipage which they deem will be used by him in
                     his new home. Such are the Indian's Elysian fields.
                  Mohammed and his early followers lived in a country where the passions of the
                     people were naturally, and by indulgence, very warm and active; hence
                     indulgence of the bodily passions was esteemed the highest happiness. So his
                     heaven promised these indulgences in fullest measure, and never to be cloyed.
                     Many wives were promised to the faithful in another world; and other esteemed
                     pleasures in proportion.
                  From these illustrations it appears that the inhabitants of these Mountains
                     estimate heaven by the nature of their own desires and hopes. A consequence is,
                     that they think to reach heaven in a way correspondent to their desires. Some
                     imagine that when they die, their souls will be introduced to another grade of
                     living beings; if virtuous in this life, to some higher grade: and they think
                     that then, after awhile, they will pass from that grade of being; and so on
                     till, by repeated transmigrations, they shall ultimately reach heaven, that
                     abiding acme of blissful existence. Such is the false hope of some of these
                     people. They hope to gain heaven by a process of purifying transmigration, with
                     no thanks to a Redeemer of the fallen human family.
                  Others talk much of the goodness of God; and hope this will abound to displace
                     all claims of justice and judgment in the case of sinning men. They know that
                     with their present dispositions and indulged passions they are not capable of
                     enjoying heaven; but then they hope God's goodness will be exercised somehow to
                     transform them into fit subjects for heaven, irrespective of any efforts on
                     their part. So they settle upon the Epicure's motto, 
                        
                           "Live while you live,——
                           Enjoy the pleasures of the present day."
                        
                     
                  
                  They reject the poet's true declaration, 
                        
                           "Life is the time to serve the Lord,
                           The time to insure the great reward."
                        
                     
                  
                  
                  They indulge the false hope that by living here with desires, passions, and
                     acts, the very reverse of what will ever be found in heaven, they will draw the
                     sympathy and roused compassion of God's goodness to overcome every opposing
                     claim, and to introduce them, when they die, into a new way of
                     enjoyment. The dwellers on these Mountains have a hope of heaven, but it is as
                     false as the Devil's promise to Eve. By that promise her hope of increased good
                     was excited. As surely as her yielding to the false inducements of the Tempter
                     involved the human family in the after woes of this world, so surely will the
                     false hopes, above described, involve those who continue to indulge them, in
                     woes felt in a condition which is the very contrast of heaven. O how False-Hope
                     draws on its victims to leap the Land's-end precipice of their earthly homes,
                     into the fiery billows of hell! And Oh! how great a multitude are on these
                     False-Hope Mountains! Most strangely, each consoles himself the more as to his
                     hopes, because of the many accompanying. Surely, he thinks, I shall stand as
                     good a chance as the rest; and how can I be so singular, and why should I now
                     be so scared, as to break away from this joyous company? Why should I indulge a
                     child-like fear of unseen evils? Thus it is difficult to rouse these people to
                     consciousness of their real danger.
               
               
                  PHILOSOPHER'S VALLEY.
                  This runs through the whole length of the country. It has been inhabited ever
                     since Eve "saw that the [forbidden] tree was a tree to be desired to make one
                     wise." Wisdom is an object of aspiration with the people. For this they search
                     into everything which they see or hear. They examine all with a philosophizing
                     care. Religion they examine in this way, with little regard to its practical
                     requisitions upon them.
                  Sin is charged upon them by the Bible and God's faithful ministers, till they
                     are pricked in their hearts, and begin to inquire, "Men and brethren, what
                     shall we do?" Then at once they pause to look into this business a little more
                     keenly. They inquire, What is this law, of which sin is the transgression? Is
                     it the eternal fitness of things? Is it an essential sential coherence in the relations of living
                     beings? Such, that when mankind were created, this law spontaneously exhibited
                     itself? Or is it an arbitrary requirement of the Creator, to suit his fancy, or
                     to assert his authority? Let us look into this matter, and understand all about
                     law and sin, before we allow ourselves to have any disturbed feelings about our
                     violation of the law. And then the representation that one sin, quickly
                     committed, exposes to endless punishment, appears to us unreasonable. We must
                     have this explained to our satisfaction; and all these points which may be
                     questioned, satisfactorily settled, before we yield to have any great concern
                     about our guilt and danger. We must have what we call a rational
                     religion, or none.
                  And you tell us we ought to repent. Now what is that? Is it an impression
                     received while listening to an excited preacher, sympathetic in its nature; an
                     influence from the preacher by means of some subtle agency like electricity,
                     similar to that by which the clairvoyant professes to give and receive
                     impressions? Are the fountains of tears reached by the truth thrust forward by
                     the living and excited preacher, through this subtle, electric-like medium?
                     Strange compound this human nature is. We'll study it more, and doubtless we
                     shall search out the way understandingly to the soul's highest delight.
                  And as to faith, they say they have heard a great many attempt to explain and
                     enforce it, and they have read a great deal about it; but after all, they do
                     not understand it. This entering into a state of salvation by the door of
                     faith, say they, is like entering the door of a secret society before being
                     made acquainted with the ceremonies required in passing. We shall not be
                     satisfied to discern what is required as we progress. We take nothing upon
                     trust. We will understand what we are about. Tell us how saving
                     faith is exercised, and we will consider it, and decide whether that is a
                     philosophical way of getting religion.
                  They have similar sage notions in regard to salvation, or the state of
                     converted souls in this world and the next. They indulge many speculations
                     about it, but do not get wise enough to press after this salvation.
                  
                  O how glad were those whom I met, who emigrated from this Valley. They had
                     broken off at once from their speculations, and started to get out of that
                     place. They trusted God for direction and help, and ventured away. They learned
                     that action is better than the vain philosophy of this Valley.
                  
                  All these varying classes of persons, thus far described, entertain, after
                     having emigrated, exceedingly dismal views in regard to the government and
                     prospects of their native land. They agree in representing the government to be
                     an iron despotism, having as its main a characteristic, that of being conducted
                     in hostility to God's government. With this end in view, its laws are framed.
                     In many parts it keeps up a show of wealth and happiness; but the customs tend
                     to poverty and misery; and, unrestrained by any influences from that better
                     country, whither many have emigrated, the people would inevitably fall soon
                     into the worst of sufferings. Habits of idleness and dissipation lead to the
                     want of the common necessaries of life. The largest estates, and most
                     splendidly appearing homes, are soon squandered, by yielding to these habits. A
                     spirit of selfishness, possessing every inhabitant, leads to a constant
                     disregard of others' rights; and to a consequent distrust of each other. There
                     is no feeling of safety, at any time, from the encroachments of neighbors. With
                     them, might makes right. Frequent ebullitions of anger and revenge are seen.
                     They have no love for each other when it interferes with self-interest. Thus
                     even the love of kindred—the nearest family tie, is liable at any time to be
                     sundered. Uncertainty in regard to success in any pursuit, and insecurity in
                     any possessions, are marked circumstances of these people. These and many other
                     similar elements of evil are doing their work among the people; and show that
                     the kingdom must ultimately be ruined by them. The prospects of those who
                     persist to remain in that country, are gloomy in the extreme. The Supreme Ruler
                     of the universe has said: "Because I have called and ye refused fused; I have stretched out my hand and no man
                     regarded; but ye have set at naught all my counsel, and would none of my
                     reproof; I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh.
                     When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a
                     whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you; then shall they call upon
                     me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find
                     me: for that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord:
                     they would none of my counsel; they despised all my reproof: therefore shall
                     they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own
                     devices."
                  Truly, Bildad of old was warranted in his description of what shall befall him
                     who will not leave that wicked rule,—"His confidence shall be rooted out of his
                     tabernacle; and it shall bring him to the king of terrors. It shall dwell in
                     his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon
                     his habitation. His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch
                     be cut off. His remembrance membrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall
                     have no name in the street. He shall be driven from light into darkness, and
                     chased out of the world."
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER II.
               THE EMIGRATION.
               IN a well-built, plain building, a company of emigrants were enjoying a social
                  interview; relating to each other various circumstances of their past lives, and
                  contrasting with them their present enjoyments and future prospects in their newly
                  adopted country. The substance of their conversation may be summed up in the
                  following particulars:
               1. How they felt, at first, in prospect of emigrating.
               Several agreed in saying: We were startled at the idea of leaving the place of our
                  birth, and going so far away. Our home had a charm over our feelings—it was trying
                  for us to think of breaking away from it forever. If it had been only for a
                  time,—to gratify curiosity, or to make trial whether some other situation would
                  suit us better, the idea would not have startled us so much. But the suggestion
                  was to break up old and loved associations, and adopt new ones as in perpetual
                  exile. That was looked upon as a great undertaking. It was to change the whole
                  course and prospects of life. It was far different from an exchange of a little
                  property, or a turning from one class of business to another, while still
                  remaining under the same laws, and in general, with the same circumstances. If
                  emigration were once undertaken, to return would be at a great sacrifice, perhaps
                  would result in our ruin. If this subject, then, were thought of at all, the
                  thoughts were, in importance, of no common magnitude.
               While these thoughts were revolving, and the attention of course easily arrested
                  by suggestions kindred to them, representations were given us of that better
                  country: of its position, laws, the administration of its government, the
                  happiness of its people, their safety, and sure prospects; all of which excited a
                  lively consciousness of the misery of our own country, in all these respects. We
                  could no longer enjoy life there. The
                  idea of a better situation had rendered ours insupportable. And we really believe
                  we did not conceive our situation to be any worse than it was. We became alarmed
                  for safety. We hardly dared to sleep nights. We saw our danger of continuous and
                  increasing misery. The course of the government was to increase and perpetuate
                  this misery among its subjects. There was no hope but in flight. And still we
                  clung to our native soil, every day feeling more and more guilty for doing so. Our
                  uneasiness led us to inquire more and more about that better land. We made bold to
                  ask questions in regard to it; put ourselves in the way of hearing what we could
                  to enlighten us; tried to ascertain by what means we could get to it; and were, in
                  fact, though secretly, earnest inquirers in regard to everything which had a
                  bearing upon the engrossing subject of our thoughts. And while such thoughts were
                  in process, it was misery to remain under the rule of the despot. Their
                  conversation embraced,
               2. The difficulty of deciding to start.
               After all our anxieties to go, said they, todecide to
                  start was exceedingly difficult. We thought we should sometime remove. So far, our
                  minds we believed to be settled. But there was not a good time yet. Besides, we
                  were not ready. We did not see clearly how to begin to get ready. We had not yet
                  learned that to start was itself all the getting ready which would
                  avail anything. We often fixed on future dates when we would be ready and move
                  off: but as often as we came to those periods we found the ever-recurring
                  unreadiness, and the shrinking from the real decision. So we delayed a long time,
                  often thinking of the subject, and never feeling satisfied. We have often since
                  thought that a person who is always hesitating what would be best for him to do;
                  and when he does undertake anything, never strikes into it boldly, with the
                  feeling that he is doing the right and the best thing, but rather goes at it with
                  a faint heart, fearing he shall fail; one who thus spends much of his time in
                  accomplishing nothing, because of the fear he shall not accomplish the best thing,
                  or the best thing in the best way; we have often thought that person must pass an
                     uncomfortable fortable life. And this
                  was the real case with us.
               Often this hesitant, faltering course, was found to be a habit so strong as to
                  affect the movements in the simplest business transaction. The walk of many was a
                  timid, hesitating motion. It was a wonder of grace that after all this we did
                  succeed in deciding to start for the better country without further delay.
               3. They talked of the discouraging poverty, and other like
                  circumstances, when starting.
               The one who had been speaker for the rest in the preceding narrations, here became
                  more eager in his story; and with a sternness knit upon his brow, as if the index
                  of the strong resolution the circumstances he narrated had wrought up, he
                  continued: We had been accounted wealthy; but all that wealth, we learned, would
                  be uncurrent on the passage—would not pay the fare. At this representation, we
                  were startled. Our valued possessions were to be left behind. Love for these led
                  us to look again at the inducements to stay. Some of us were on the point of
                  concluding to be contented where we were. But the very fact just discovered, that
                  our wealth was good for nothing anywhere else, led us to feel more dissatisfied
                  with our country. What was all that we had good for, if it would keep us in such
                  misery, and do nothing more? We felt dissatisfied with it as "vanity of vanities."
                  We could no longer feel rich there, with all our gains. We felt poor enough. What
                  wretched material for a rational being is all the tinsel stuff of that land! It is
                  like husks for swine. But what could we do for means to emigrate, was now the
                  question. We earnestly inquired, "What must we do to be saved?"
               As for staying there, it was now out of the question. We were heartily sick of
                  home; and thought, to perish on the way, would be preferable to staying. We could
                  but perish if we started; and to stay, was a living torment. Any how, thought we,
                  we will venture to start. Who knows but that Being who rules over all, will open
                  some way by his providence, now unseen by us, through which we may get forward in
                  safety! And, thank God, we did start. That starting in that good earnest, was one
                     of the most important acts of our
                  lives. It turned the scale in our destiny.
               4. They spoke of the successful journey.
               Our decision to undertake the journey at all hazards, was no sooner made, than we
                  called to mind what we had often heard, but never before appreciated nor heeded,
                  that possessions were promised to emigrants "without money and without price;" and
                  that all required, necessary to a passage, was to place ourselves confidingly and
                  entirely under the directions to emigrants, given from that better land; and thus
                  to exercise confidence in the Lord of that country. We were only to go on,
                     believing in him with all the heart, and be saved from the
                  miseries we felt and dreaded.—Acts 16: 31. It then seemed strange to us that we
                  had felt so rich, so strong, in the idea of not being beholden to anybody; strange
                  that the rumors we had often heard about these privileges to emigrants, had not
                  made sufficient impression on our minds to enable us to recollect them sooner in
                  time of need. O the blind, infatuating self-conceit and phantom possessions of
                  that people! They are deaf to good news, blind to good instructions; their memory
                  has very little power to retain anything good. What a wonder that we were not
                  drawn on to entire callousness of all our faculties, so as to be incapable of
                  enjoying good.
               When we started, "poor, and blind, and naked," we were surprised to find the
                  distance we had to go so short.—Rom. 10: 6-10. It had seemed to us that we should
                  have a long, tedious journey to make. It had seemed much like scaling the heavens:
                  almost an impossibility to accomplish. In view of this, we had well nigh murmured
                  at our Creator for giving us existence where such impossibilities, or almost
                  impossibilities, were required, in order to our happiness. His requirements had
                  appeared grievous. We are now satisfied that those impressions of distance and of
                  difficulty of the way, were from the impaired state of our own vision: another
                  effect of that dreadful climate.
               Our eyes now began to be opened, and "we could see men, as trees, walking" on the
                  other side. We were quickly over. Now we saw that great distance is not necessary
                  to great contrast. The distance between the rich man in hell, and Abraham, with Lazarus in his bosom, was not so
                  great but that they could converse together; yet the contrast in their situations
                  was very great. There was a similar contrast in our situation, to that which we
                  had just left. Yet how quickly we passed from one to the other! How strange that
                  we delayed the venture so long! Glory to God! how happy, how light in the relief,
                  and in the hopes! The half was never told us. O that our friends knew all
                  this.
               5. The encouraging introduction to the new home, was another subject
                  of interest with them.
               They continued: And we are now realizing what was then spread out in prospect
                  before us; only in far richer measure than we could then see. We were most
                  cordially welcomed. The first sight of us seemed to gladden the hearts of all on
                  shore. They certainly raised a shout of joy, and we believe our presence was what
                  mainly excited the shout. We sung together, and were surprised that we could sing
                  in such pleasing harmony with them. We could never before make such melody. And
                  such countenances we had not anticipated. There was a peculiar expression. We
                  thought it angelic. We had known some of the persons in our father-land; but they
                  bore very different expressions then. And there was now no longer a cold reserve,
                  and suspicious glances; but a confiding air, and a heartiness of greeting, so as
                  to make one's heart glad. We did not feel at all uneasy in their presence, though
                  some of them were the noted magnates of the land. Well, our introduction was all
                  that could be desired. And we immediately found employment. We found the people
                  characteristically busy; and they took it for granted that we wanted something to
                  do. It was one expression of their welcome to set us immediately at work. To this
                  we felt no objection, and at once were contented with our lot and choice.
                  Immediate wants were well supplied before we had time to feel the pressure of
                  need. We felt at home.
               And now, sir, was not that a glorious introduction to this country? Can you wonder
                  that we have become strongly attached to the people, and that we are willing to
                  stay, never even visiting our father-land? We feel now that this is our country. We are adopted, real
                  citizens, having all the privileges as though native-born. We could never have
                  anticipated such a beginning as we have had. We are never weary in telling of
                  those halcyon enjoyments of our first introduction here. Our joyful emotions are
                  at once aroused whenever we think of them.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               THE ADOPTED COUNTRY.
               
                  ASSOCIATIONS AND CUSTOMS FOUND.
                  THE preceding representations of the "old country," and of the journey to the
                     emigrants' "better land," I gathered mainly from emigrants: but as a passing
                     friend, I saw for myself their associations and customs in their
                     new home. I found,
               
               
                  THE GENERAL CHARACTERISTIC OF INDUSTRY, AND ITS ACCOMPANYING THRIFT.
                  The people rise in the morning from their slumbers as early as they find
                     themselves refreshed; not dozing away their best hours, to rise late, with
                     enervated systems and impaired consciences, yet too hurried and disturbed for
                     retirement in the closet for refreshment from the presence of the Lord, before entering upon
                     the duties of the day. They get this refreshment,—"day by day their daily
                     bread," of the same superior sort as angels enjoy. They then go out with
                     countenances such that beholders recognize they have been exhilarated by
                     heaven's nectar—by something more than earth's products. They are thus able to
                     apply themselves to their varied avocations with a cheerfulness and composure
                     which insure success. Work is performed as a way of pleasure, not as a drudging
                     task. Acknowledging God and praying to him, difficulties are encountered and
                     overcome, temptations and all evil encroachments are resisted, all with an ease
                     and satisfaction truly surprising to a beholder. God is with them of a
                     truth.
                  With such preparations and helps, each goes to his appropriate employment.
                     Ministers of Christ, with applied minds in careful and untiring research, draw
                     out of God's treasures of Revelation, works, providence, "things new and old,"
                     to instruct and cheer on the people. They mingle with the people at their
                     homes, and so personally, as well as in congregations, teach the people. They
                     find enough to do. Teachers of youth exercise their best ingenuity and patience
                     to adapt their instructions and illustrations to the capacities of those
                     taught—study human nature in order to this; and endeavor to do their whole
                     duty, to impress and direct rightly all the powers of the young immortals.
                     Officers of civil government and of Churches, regard their offices neither as
                     sinecures nor tasks, but understand well the obligations upon them, and are
                     careful that the people who have entrusted them with the honor and
                     responsibility, shall suffer no harm from their neglect. Architects may be seen
                     in all their varieties, developing the powers of nature in numerous forms, for
                     the benefit of society, and at the same time in a way to show the goodness and
                     wisdom of God. And all laborers labor as rational beings; not merely as an ox
                     or horse would obey the bidding of their drivers; having no rational thoughts,
                     no moral reflections, no recognition of God. Parents impress their children, by
                     precept and example, with the idea that their stay in the country is for the
                     purpose of accomplishing as much as
                     possible for the general good: all in accordance with the honor of their
                     Sovereign Ruler. They "live unto the Lord." All seem inspired with a patriotic
                     spirit, the opposite of selfishness. They seem to take it for granted that no
                     lazy intruder will be allowed to stay,—that he must work or leave. I believe it
                     is in view of this impression, so exemplified by these people, that some have
                     gained the idea that a lazy Christian is an impossibility, a contradiction in
                     terms. Some of them formally adopt the rule: "be diligent, never be unemployed,
                     never trifle away time." They have all imbibed the spirit of the apostle's
                     charge: "not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord."
                  Now I ask all who have been acquainted with these people, if this industrial
                     spirit is not a characteristic belonging to them. It is allowed this is not a
                     general characteristic of human beings. It is said, a distinguished traveller,
                     who had studied human nature in nearly every country in the world, was asked if
                     he found any one thing as a general characteristic of mankind? He replied, "Me
                     tink all men love lazy." This may be so; but we claim that these emigrants have
                     overcome this natural inclination, so far that though they may sometimes show
                     that they had once been thus inclined, they now, in their new home, do not
                     indulge it; for if they allow themselves to relapse into such inclination so
                     far as to at all indulge it, they at once begin to dislike the busy society
                     around them, and soon retreat back to their father-land.
                  Livers upon this soil are industrious. And they thrive. They may be seen in
                     direct contrast to what Solomon describes—Prov. 24: 30-34—"I went by the field
                     of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; and lo!
                     it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof,
                     and the stone wall thereof was broken down. Then I saw and considered it well;
                     I looked upon it and received instruction. Yet a little sleep, a little
                     slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: so shall thy poverty come as
                     one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man."
                  In saying so much for these people, it is not pretended that none of them had
                        cultivated industrious habits for
                     gain in their former homes; but certainly, taken as a community, they never
                     exhibited industry and thrift as a general characteristic, until in this
                     country. Of this we have various assurances. And we need not wonder at their
                     present course, in contrast with the past. They have now sufficiently noble
                     motives to induce industry. They "live unto the Lord." They are "laying up
                     treasures in heaven." And while doing this, God feeds them well. This is what
                     we see. Not that they labor for this good living. This is "added"
                     to those who "seek first the kingdom of God." And who is ever industrious
                     without some powerful motive to draw him on? These have inducements to
                     industry, powerful enough to rouse all into action.
                  I found,
               
               
                  CONTENTMENT.
                  This is a general accompaniment of industry. Where is it found without? Time
                     always hangs heavily with those who have nothing to do.
                  It is not pretended that none of these people ple seek changes; that none ever
                     go back and declare themselves dissatisfied; that none indulge thoughts of
                     moving, to better their condition. But, as a general rule, there is
                     contentment; though there are some exceptions to this rule. No one in the midst
                     of the country ever says, "I am dissatisfied and will go back." If any return,
                     they gradually slink away along the border, and are missing. They sometimes
                     make ado of dissatisfaction afterward; but never within the territory.
                  Contentment, however, is the rule so generally prevalent as to be a striking
                     characteristic among the inhabitants; especially considering the emphatic
                     uneasiness and discontent of human beings everywhere else in the world. In this
                     country "the aching void" of the human heart is filled. "Godliness with
                     contentment is great gain." One said, "I have learned in whatsoever state I am,
                     therewith to be content." Of course these people enjoy life. They are content
                     with their form of government; with their rulers, with their places of abode,
                     and form of employment; and are only concerned to make the best of their
                        circumstances, so as to continue
                     worthy subjects of the government, and to enjoy the future emoluments which
                     they have in prospect. Their contented feeling is always inseparably connected
                     with a strong confidence in their Ruler, and in the goodness of his
                     administration. They cast all their care on him, assured that he cares for
                     them.
                  In all just now said about industry and contentment,
                     it is not intended to be represented that all are rich. Riches and contentment
                     are by no-means sure to be found together. These do not confine their ambition
                     to this world's goods: and, being in the world, they suffer in common with all
                     others, from sickness, and various unforeseen obstacles to gain. But if poor,
                     they yet show thankfulness for what they have, and make the best of it. If
                     their children are not dressed in rich apparel, but with patched garments, yet
                     they are whole and clean, and the children are happy.
                  These same poor families were in squalid wretchedness before emigrating. They
                     now show thrift, though they are the Lord's poor. If these poor people were
                     always seen to get rich soon after emigrating, miserly spirits would seek to
                     emigrate for the sake of this wealth to be gained: when they would be sure to
                     find it said to them, "thy money perish with thee." The motive of earthly gain
                     cannot be a prominent one in this country; though in fact the people suffer no
                     loss in this respect. Having higher, nobler motives of life, and still
                     receiving what is needful of earthly supplies, they can be contented with their
                     choice of home. They do not live in vain; a thing which a rational soul cannot
                     be contented to endure.
                  I found,
               
               
                  UNITY: NOT UNIFORMITY.
                  This appeared, 1. In the face of the country—the exhibitions of nature.
                  The goodness of the land for tillage, scenery, and health, is promoted by its
                     unevenness and varieties of soil. There are mountains, with their springs,
                     whence flow the rivulets, combining into mighty rivers. The rivers often
                     overflow, enriching the valleys. The mountains and hills, with intervening
                     valleys, promote changes in the temperature of the air, and consequent winds,
                     ever shifting in direction and
                     force. The productions are various, corresponding with the varieties of climate
                     and soil. They are not all of one kind; nor do the same kinds always grow in
                     the same form. The apples on one tree are not alike—scarcely any two of them;
                     yet of one kind. They vary in shape, size, color, perfection, or something; yet
                     are none the worse to unite to one good use. So with all products.
                  The several benefits intimated would not be found with a uniformity over the
                     country in level surface, and in elements of soil—with uniformity throughout.
                     And with such uniformity the eye would tire, satisfaction would soon end, and
                     all would soon appear as one great Sahara.
                  The skillful gardener understands this variety as connected with unity of
                     impression and end. He does not lay out the walks and plant the trees all in
                     straight lines; nor in any other uniform relations; nor does he seek a dead
                     level for his plot. He mingles the straight, curved, angular, undulating,
                     &c. He imitates nature, and beholders pronounce it beautiful.
                  Look at a single tree of the land, and it affords an illustration of the
                     general state of things. The branches vary in shape, size, hue, direction: the
                     leaves may exhibit similarity in their serrated edges, so that the botanist
                     could distinguish the genus of the tree, but these leaves are not uniformly
                     alike. Sometimes the tempest blows, and these branches and leaves lash against
                     each other; and to one sitting among the branches, not looking abroad, it might
                     seem that they were in conflict with each other, spending all their strength to
                     bruise each other. But yet they are one tree, adhering to the same root. The
                     roots strike deeper because of the wind's force; the bending branches are alike
                     benefited. The tree is one; one good is secured; but it does not show
                     uniformity in its parts. It is a picture of what is called the visible Church
                     of God in this country. It is one Church, but has many branches. And these
                     branches are not uniform in their appearance. And at times they may seem to be
                     lashing and bruising each other, like the branches of the tree in the storm;
                     but it is only in appearance. They are not opposed to each other; they adhere to one root. Said Christ, "I
                     am the vine, ye are the branches." The branches are not uniform in appearance,
                     but they constitute one tree.
                  Another instance in nature, of this unity but not uniformity, is seen in the
                     prismatic colors. When these are separated by means of the prismatic lens, not
                     one of them—not even the violet, not the blue, and not even the red—can give
                     light when separated, each one apart from the rest, yet when all are blended
                     together, they give out colorless light. And these rays of the sun's light
                     never quarrel with each other; nor do they separate themselves, nor one
                     another, from the sun. Never is there a dream of such a thing as the violet
                     rays of the sun being against the orange, nor of the red rays saying to the
                     green, because you are not scarlet, you do not belong to the sun. So all the
                     distinct denominations of the Church, blended together in like manner, become
                     fused in love, and pour forth a broad sheet of heavenly light. For, indeed,
                     there is more than one kind of real light. In this country it is very different
                     from the artificial and reflected light, mere moonshine, of the old
                     country.
                  Throughout the natural world, this same unity, versus uniformity, may be seen. Two animals of the same species
                     are seldom exactly alike, yet are one species. Human physiognomy is not alike;
                     yet with all this variety there is one human family.
                  Minds are not constituted alike. And this is another circumstance in nature
                     where there is one whole, but variety in the parts of that whole. The one whole
                     here consists in the concentrating tendency of all these varieties of mind to
                     one centre. There is one central mind; and to all these varieties of mind it is
                     said, "Let this mind be in you which was in Christ." In accordance with this,
                     families are seen, with each person differing from the other in opinions upon
                     almost every subject of every-day life. No two of them think alike upon every
                     subject. And one subject, presented in a newspaper, often leads them to
                     different processes of thought and opinions. For instance, readers can conceive
                     how it might be with a family who read for the first time an account of the
                        sewing ing machine: One, who is a
                     merchant-tailor, thinks at once of its influence upon his trade—its cheapening
                     the expense of making garments, and how he can better compete with single
                     laborers, and so enlarge his business. He is glad of the invention. His sister,
                     who has had her sympathies aroused in behalf of poor seamstresses, and is
                     naturally sympathetic, has fears at once for that class of operatives, lest
                     they shall be more oppressed. She scans the prospect of the goodness of the
                     work done by the machine with prejudice against it, and passes judgment of its
                     inferiority. Another son, who always counts closely the cost, thinks how much
                     cheaper he can get a coat, and approves at once. And so other members of the
                     family make their different remarks, as their thoughts and opinions severally
                     vary. Yet they are all one family, notwithstanding this variety: they love each
                     other none the less for their various opinions; in more essential points they
                     are agreed.
                  Now if there are no cases among this people where just these expressions are
                     used, there are those where equal differences of opinion are manifested. And in
                     like manner I found throughout the natural productions of this country, unity
                     as a whole in every department of nature; but not uniformity between the
                     several parts. And I enjoyed right well the whole scenery: a view of the
                     distant plain, the serrating valleys, the flowing rivers and the gathering
                     rivulets, the mountain forests and shrubs of the plain. The shifting breezes
                     added to my delight. The living creatures all around afforded a similarly
                     pleasing view. There was no sameness here to tire.
                  I found no difficulty in distinguishing the domestic animals which my friend
                     had before named as his own, from others of the same kind belonging to his
                     neighbor. They did not look alike. And that neighbor I knew the second time I
                     saw him, for there was no other person of my acquaintance who looked exactly
                     like him. And the people never abused each other, because they did not look
                     just alike. They never suspected from this that they were not good neighbors,
                     nor failed to have a common interest in each other's success. I enjoyed well,
                     too, the intercourse with persons of
                     so variously constituted minds. Though I heard from these the same stories and
                     opinions expressed a great many times, their way of expressing their ideas was
                     so varied that the subject always seemed new. I knew it was the same subject,
                     but the variety of views in which it was exhibited, led me often to exclaim,
                     uniformity is not essential to oneness. "There are differences of
                     administration, but the same Lord."
                  This appeared, 2. In the operations of Providence, and in God's gracious
                     influences upon the people.
                  In the providences of the Lord manifested in all parts of the land, variety is
                     found. To bless the people with a fruitful season, and excite their gratitude
                     and zeal for him, he constantly varies the seasons. No one knows what day in
                     the year there will be rain, and when sun-shine. A time of extreme drouth
                     serves its good purpose, and then the soaking rains; but their times and order
                     of coming, constantly vary. Individuals are brought to feel their dependence on
                     their God more fully, in ever-varying ways. For a time a person prospers in
                     everything he undertakes. This excites his pious gratitude. He sees the hand
                     that blesses, and consecrates his all to the service of his Maker. But soon the
                     providence is changed, and, by adversity,—disappointment in his pursuits, a
                     blast upon his harvests, the failure of his friends to meet their engagements
                     with him, when they could not because of death or sickness, sickness in his own
                     family, a cluster of evils, as though God had turned against him: by these
                     means another class of pious graces are brought into exercise, and gain
                     strength. He now not merely adores and confides, as in prosperity, but meekly
                     submits, is resigned, acknowledges God's right to all, and blesses his name. In
                     both these ways God builds him up in holiness and virtue. Job was once
                     benefited in this way; so that the patience of Job has become
                     proverbial. Many in this country are similarly dealt with, and thus made to
                     prosper. No one set of providential dealings ever perfects the work in them.
                     The providences of God are diversified in multitudinous ways all through the
                     country; all for the good of the people. This appeared to me a glorious manifestation of the unbounded
                     ability of the Dispenser of events, and of his wisdom and goodness. These same
                     attributes which once hindered the men of Sodom from injuring Lot, by striking
                     them with blindness; which hindered Pharaoh from enslaving the Israelites, by
                     drowning him in the Red Sea; which hindered Balaam from cursing Israel, by
                     putting a bridle in his mouth; which hindered Jeroboam from hurting the prophet
                     who came out of Judah, by drying up his royal hand, when he stretched it forth,
                     saying, "Lay hold on him;" which hindered Herod from destroying the child
                     Jesus, by warning Joseph to flee into Egypt, &c., &c.—that same Being
                     now varies his providences in power, and wisdom, and goodness, for the great
                     good of this people. His watchful eye is constantly upon them, and his
                     dispensing care is constantly in exercise.
                  God's gracious influences upon the people are in like manner varied. Elijah of
                     old was told to "go forth, and stand upon the Mount before the Lord. And,
                     behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and
                     brake in pieces the rocks, before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind:
                     and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: and
                     after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the
                     fire a still small voice." Now these are expressive of what transpires when
                        the Lord passes by and operates in this country. Sometimes he
                     reaches the ears of individuals by a still small voice; he soothes
                     their sorrows, calms their fears, and encourages their hope and confidence:
                     they are melted into tears by the tender regard shown, and the attractions of
                     the heart toward God are greatly increased.
                  Again, the wind, or earthquake, or fire appear: impulses upon the soul by God's
                     Spirit, like heavenly breezes, excite joy and laughter. In view of the
                     earth-shaking and heavens-rending power of God, his foes are alarmed, but his
                     people are secure; and feeling the purifying of his "fire," they are sometimes
                     wrought up to exclamations of, Amen! Praise the Lord! Glory to God! And again,
                     these same influences excite to milder expressions of feeling. Their effect is developed in the
                     countenance, and a gentle, loving demeanor.
                  God's gracious influences sometimes move upon minds invitingly, then with
                     alarm; now he assuages grief, then he excites it; now he impresses with
                     religious gains yet to be attained, then rouses to press after these gains by
                     pointing to past neglect—compunction is excited; now he seems to love, then to
                     withdraw his attentions; and the channels of his grace are as varied as his
                     numerous providences, as his untold numbers of human agents, sent to bless, and
                     as their ever-changing styles of acting upon fellow minds.
                  God's gracious influences are far from being uniformly alike in their forms of
                     operating upon human beings; but the whole multitude of gracious dealings
                     centre together—they harmonize in unity of effect, promoting the same good.
                  This appeared, 3. In the abilities of the people for usefulness.
                  The youth were not of course able to exercise as much wisdom as those older and
                     more matured; but they were peculiarly zealous in every good work, exercised
                     much vigor of body and mind, and were often able to bring those of the same age
                     into their views and practices, when older persons would have failed—would not
                     have been received in their efforts.
                  Some had stronger minds than others; hence judged more wisely in directing
                     their efforts. But the feeble minded, imbued with the general spirit of the
                     people, exerted an influence upon some minds around them by their very
                     simplicity, which the strong minded could not do. Strong minds were often led
                     to appreciate and obtain their best good, by the encouragements these afforded.
                     Arguments they were accustomed to resist, and headstrong, they were squandering
                     their substance, and tending toward destruction of soul; but the examples of
                     these feeble minded ones took them upon an unguarded side, and they
                     yielded.
                  Many err in judgment, and yet are good, and do good. But if all these people
                     should err greatly in judgment of right and propriety, they would mutually harm
                     each other by their mistakes; and this their weakness being known, few would be
                     persuaded to emigrate to join their
                     society. But their mistakes in this respect occasionally, show the ignorant and
                     fearing, that their own imbecilities are no bar to their enjoying the real
                     benefits of this country.
                  Some are eloquent in speech. And this is their chief talent by which they can
                     benefit their fellow countrymen. They show no special talent in any other way;
                     but they can talk so as to convince and move.
                  Others are slow in speech; they have not quick perceptions to catch
                     illustrations, or employ figures of speech; but they can discern the
                     connections and bearings of things, and can argue powerfully. They are strong
                     reasoners. They take hold on philosophical minds, and bear them away to their
                     own conclusions; whilst minds constituted to be impressed by beauties, and
                     moved by sympathies, would feel but little force from their arguments.
                  Add to these variations in the abilities of the people to promote the general
                     good of the country, and thereby to attract foreigners to it, the numerous
                     examples of these people in their various occupations, and it will be seen that
                     they all help to promote good, but by no means in a uniform way. There is
                     unity, but not uniformity. It is proved by them that residents in this land can
                     follow all the associations of life needful for the well-being of persons in
                     this world, and prosper well in this country. How differently would this
                     country be esteemed, if all were compelled to work at one trade, in one
                     way!
                  Of this people Dr. Mason has said: "The spiritual disciples of the Son of God,
                     amid all the varieties of physical frame, complexion and temperament, however
                     diverse may have been their outward temperaments, and their early training,
                     however opposed to each other may be their mental habits, yet in the
                     controlling moral attributes of character they are alike—subjects of the same
                     experience, produced by a reception of the same cardinal truths, living under
                     the same spiritual influences, governed by the same laws, and cherishing the
                     same immortal hopes—they are all "one in Christ Jesus."
                  This appeared, 4. In the various Church organizations.
                  The militant Church in this country has perhaps twenty or more communions. And each of
                     these may say of the other, "They have all received the Holy Ghost as well as
                     we." However diversified their denominational gatherings and doings may appear,
                     they all concentrate and meet at the Cross of Christ—around the throne of
                     grace. They all look forward to an appointed meeting in heaven, where they are
                     to unite in one shout of praise "to Him who has redeemed them."
                  The lack of uniformity need not be now noted in all of these organizations. An
                     idea of their unity, notwithstanding this lack, will be sufficiently presented
                     by dwelling upon the peculiarities of three or four of them. In speaking of
                     these, let it be remembered that "they are not all Israel who are of Israel."
                     Some persons may bear the name of Methodists, Baptists, &c.,
                     yet, not even be inhabitants of this Emigrant's home. Still, residents here do
                     bear these and other distinguishing names. And these names indicate to those
                     acquainted, their peculiarities of living.
                  I found here a company, organized and prospering, called Presbyterians. There
                     is no doubt of their being emigrants. They told of the evils of their
                     father-land; and of the trying scenes of their voyage over. They are contented
                     and faithful citizens. They occupy a province under the protection of the
                     general government, and yet have what might be named a state or provincial
                     government of their own, differing somewhat from that of any other province in
                     the country. They understand the principles of government a little differently
                     from the others, and with all honesty have framed their constitution according
                     to their best understanding. They use the same text book of common law which
                     the others do, and refer to the same precedents; but they draw different
                     conclusions, and make different applications.
                  "The great fundamental principle of the Presbyterial form of
                     government is, that the several different congregations of believers, taken
                     collectively, constitute the Church; that a larger part of the
                     Church, or a representation of it, should govern the smaller, and that a
                     representation of the whole should govern and determine in regard to every
                     part, and to all the parts united:
                     and consequently, that appeals may be carried from lower to higher
                     judicatories, till they are finally decided by the collected wisdom and united
                     voice of the whole Church.
                  "This form of government recognizes four distinct judicatories.
                  
                  "The first and lowest is that of the CHURCH SESSIONS, composed of
                     the pastor and ruling elders of a particular congregation; and the minister is
                     moderator, and performs the duties usually assigned to the chairman of a
                     committee, in all the meetings of the elders. This judicatory judges of the
                     qualifications of applicants for membership, and receives or rejects them by
                     vote of the majority present; they hear complaints, institute trials, and
                     censure or acquit the accused; they appoint one ruling elder of their number to
                     attend each meeting of the presbytery, and take the general oversight of the
                     spiritual concerns of the Church.
                  "The second is the PRESBYTERY, composed of all the ministers, not
                     less than three, and one ruling elder from each congregation within a certain
                     district.
                  "The third is the SYNOD, composed of the pastors and ruling elders
                     within a larger district, including at least three presbyteries.
                  "The fourth and highest judicatory is the GENERAL ASSEMBLY. It is
                     the bond of union over the whole Church, (represented by the judicatories
                     named,) the source of general council in cases of difficulty, and the ulterior
                     resort by way of appeal from the inferior judicatories."
                  A standard author of the province, Dr. S. M., says: "In every Church completely
                     organized, that is, furnished with all the officers which Christ has
                     instituted, and which are necessary for carrying into full effect the laws of
                     his kingdom, there ought to be three classes of officers, viz: at least one
                     Teaching Elder, Bishop, or Pastor—a bench of Ruling Elders—and Deacons. The
                     first to 'minister in the word and doctrine,' and to dispense the sacraments;
                     the second to assist in the inspection and government of the Church; and the
                     third to 'serve tables:' that is to take care of the Church's funds destined
                     for the support of the poor, and sometimes to manage whatever relates lates to the temporal support of the
                     Gospel and its ministers."
                  Citizenship is gained here in a particular way, differently from what it is in
                     some other provinces.
                  Children are recognized as citizens, by certain forms. When very young they are
                     baptized with water in a formal way, as a preparatory step to their enjoying
                     the rights of citizenship; their parents, who submit them to this ordinance,
                     engaging to devote them as the liege subjects of the kingdom, and to do their
                     best to train them up to be fit for such relation. When the children are old
                     enough to choose for themselves, they concede to what has been done in their
                     case, and yield voluntary allegiance to the government, when they are at once
                     recognized as having all the rights of citizenship. And when a person has
                     heartily entered upon citizenship in this way, they believe he will never
                     become a citizen of Satan's empire.
                  Their opinions as to the right and duty, or possibility of receiving all
                     foreigners as emigrants, are different from those of some others. They are very
                     friendly to those who come over, and have no fears that the country will be
                     ruined by the influence of foreigners: they would by no means have laws passed
                     to restrict or discourage their coming. They welcome all who are pleased to
                     come, and believe that with proper attentions they can be trained to become
                     good citizens, and will prove a blessing to the country. But the "Articles of
                     Faith" of this province declare the opinion that some foreigners will remain in
                     the miseries of their oppression: that they can never reach any province of the
                     Emigrant's home. Some unexplained circumstances are supposed to be against
                     them. Not because they have done anything to cut them off from this privilege,
                     more than others; but there is no obligation, only as voluntarily entered into
                     by the Lord, to receive any; and there are supposed to be reasons of state for
                     passing by some. Yet as none but the Sovereign Ruler knows which are passed by,
                     citizens are free to extend their invitations to all, assured that none but the
                     right will comply. They are very industrious to do what they can to induce
                     emigrations, and are zealous for their adopted form of government and
                        established customs. They sustain
                     each other exceedingly well in their home operations; they encourage friendly
                     intercourse with neighboring provinces; and are ready to extend to them needed
                     help.
                  Their forms of worship and Church activity are in the main such as are
                     prevalent throughout the country. Perhaps they have excelled their neighbors
                     for some time, in Church activity, by the use of the press. They have united
                     their efforts with several other provinces in what is named a "Tract Society."
                     It is thought they throw more strength into this enterprise than their
                     neighbors; and they are doing a great work by scattering their "tracts"
                     broad-cast over the world. By these, a great many are induced to emigrate, and
                     when emigrated, they are enlightened as to the way of living happily, and of
                     laying up treasures such as angels enjoy.
                  I found here another organization of people calling themselves Baptists. Their
                     name is expressive of a peculiarity in their manner of admitting emigrants to
                     their community. Every one must be immersed in water as one prominent part of
                     the form of admission. The people in some sections of this province believe as
                     their neighbors just described do, in regard to the possibility of all
                     foreigners emigrating; and in points where that opinion has a bearing, practice
                     similarly.
                  Their children are not considered citizens until of sufficient age to choose
                     for themselves. Every one is believed to make trial of living under Satan's
                     dominion before he becomes a real subject of this, Christ's kingdom. For this
                     experiment he leaves his father's faith and home; indulging that wandering
                     spirit which has a strong hold upon human beings, especially at a certain age
                     of youth;—they wish to see and know what is outside of the parental
                     nursery.
                  Thus these children are recognized as passing over from Satan's kingdom,
                     whenever initiated as citizens of this province. Having intimated their desire
                     to take the oath of allegiance, and to be enrolled as citizens, a public
                     meeting is appointed, when each relates his experience of the voyage over, and
                     his present satisfaction and hopes in his chosen home. Having expressed
                     publicly his devotion to the government in this way, he is immersed in water by an
                     Elder, and his name is registered as entitled to all the rights and emoluments
                     of citizenship. The same ceremony is passed through in receiving all
                     foreigners.
                  In one section of this province the people lay so much stress upon immersion as
                     an essential form of the initiatory rite before named, that they will not admit
                     any persons of another province to join with them in their principal
                     festival—the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper—lest they may not have really
                     become subjects of Christ's kingdom in this, which they esteem, the
                        regular way. They regard it as in some way very improper and wrong to
                     admit any to this festival who have not minutely observed this as a preparatory
                     rite, in the form stated. And so they "do this in remembrance of Christ" in a
                     select company, whilst those of other provinces regard it a pleasure to greet
                     all true Emigrants on this festival occasion.
                  Each congregation in this section exercises government over its own members,
                     with no right of appeal beyond. In cases of disciplining a private member or
                     pastor, a "council" is often called to advise; and their advice is often made a
                     binding decision, by previous voluntary agreement of parties in the trial. Thus
                     the collected wisdom of many is enjoyed in decisions. They have an
                     "Association," annually meeting, composed of several pastors and delegates from
                     their Churches, for spiritual improvement.
                  These people have manifested great zeal of late, to enlighten the miserable
                     heathen, and induce them to emigrate. They spend much, in men and treasures,
                     for this object. They deserve strong commendation.
                  They look well to the interests of their own province. They are exceedingly
                     well pleased with their home, and with Christian benevolence desire others to
                     share its benefits. They do not suffer one to enter upon their shores without
                     being noticed by some inhabitant, and having such attentions bestowed as will
                     be likely to induce him to become a citizen. This forwardness in hospitality to
                     strangers from abroad, and to their own countrymen from other provinces, is a
                     point in which they excel some of their neighbors. They hold a strong position in the country, and have
                     merits to deserve their great success in filling up with inhabitants.
                  I noticed here another province whose citizens were termed Episcopalians. Their
                     grounds are well laid out; their buildings display tasteful and rich
                     architecture; the scenery is beautiful; and their living and various operations
                     have a bearing in the direction of stately forms. They lay strong claims to
                     excellence. They claim that their chief rulers, their Bishops, occupy their
                     position by what is equivalent to hereditary right;—a right descended in an
                     uninterrupted line from the apostles.
                  Children are recognized as citizens from their birth; or from the time, in
                     childhood, when the rite of baptism is performed. When of sufficient age to
                     choose for themselves to stay, or yield to temptations to forsake their home,
                     they are "confirmed," and are thenceforward entitled to all the honors of
                     citizenship.
                  They are not as particular as those in some of the other provinces that these
                     children and foreigners should give evidence that they heartily love the Lord
                     Jesus Christ—that their affections fections are upon him as their Ruler, and
                     that he gives them a testimonial that he reciprocates their love.
                     They retain the names of some as members of this provincial association, who
                     are in reality across the line, within Satan's kingdom. They there observe
                     forms very similar to those of real Episcopalians; and imagine that on the
                     whole they have just as good prospects of the future. Though this same
                     circumstance of retaining unworthy names may sometimes transpire in other
                     provinces, in this it is thought by some to be done on purpose. This province
                     lies along so near the boundary lines, and a part of those who are enrolled as
                     its citizens being really residents over the other side of the line, some have
                     taken occasion to charge it with not being a loyal province of Christ's
                     kingdom. But it occupies an important portion of the Lord's territory; and
                     those who really live and labor there, are good citizens and very useful. Some
                     have been admitted, with marked approval, very near Christ's throne.
                  This province has some peculiarities in its forms of government, but not to
                     clash at all with the constitution
                     of the general government. In other words, the rights of citizens in other
                     provinces, and their contributory support of Christ's kingdom in general, are
                     not at all interfered with by any peculiarities in this form of government.
                     They are not interfered with any more than are the general interests of the
                     United States of America, by the peculiarities of the government of the State
                     of New-York. The government of this State differs from that of other States,
                     but does not interfere with their authority or welfare by this means; no more
                     does the Episcopal form of government, by its differing from that of
                     Presbyterians and Baptists, interfere with their welfare, or with the
                     well-being of the militant Church in general.
                  The peculiarities in their forms of government are said to be in that, "By
                     virtue of regular succession from the apostles, the Bishops claim the sole
                     right of admitting persons to Church membership by confirmation, the body
                     ecclesiastic assumes the appellation of 'THE CHURCH,' and claims the exclusive
                     right of precedence over other denominations; and each clergyman exercises the
                     prerogative of governing his own flock, of deciding all questions in
                     controversy, and of trying and expelling his members, without the intervention
                     of a committee, or jury, or session, or any other tribunal to modify or
                     restrict his power: and from his decision there is no appeal but to the Bishop,
                     to whom the clergyman is accountable for his conduct."
                  In forms of worship they vary somewhat from others. It appears some like an
                     imitation of the stateliness and splendor practiced among the Jews. The priests
                     have their sacred garments, in which they officiate on public occasions. The
                     whole public service is in set order. The expounding and enforcing of the laws
                     of Christ, are done chiefly in writing. They seem to think that God, having set
                     the example of proclaiming his commands in writing, upon tables of stone, gives
                     authority for his servants to reiterate them in a similar form: and that his
                     authorizing Moses to write particular explanations and instructions, surely
                     affords example for Christ's ambassadors to write and read their explanations and enforcements of his laws. So
                     their priests read their sermons.
                  And, in like manner, they gather encouragement for written prayers. Our Lord
                     gave a form of prayer. They take this as an example, and try to adapt forms of
                     prayer to the particular circumstances of individuals and communities. In
                     public and in the family, often in private, they try to follow, with the
                     heart's desires, the set words of prayer which they repeat. They think that in
                     congregations more persons really pray, really worship, in this way; that they
                     are less apt to relapse into mere listeners or spectators.
                  I noticed another community of people called Methodists. They have their
                     associations and customs professedly, with method, as their name
                     imports. Their province lies adjoining the one last named. In some respects the
                     usages of these people are similar to those of the former. They originally
                     colonized from them; principally because of the practice named in speaking of
                     the Episcopalians,—that of often reckoning persons as citizens who were really
                     dwellers in Satan's kingdom. A stricter regulation in this respect was thought
                     best for the interests of the country; and they undertook to secure it by a
                     separate organization. It is not pretended that these Methodists always
                     succeed; but they have certainly enjoyed the approval of the Lord of the land,
                     in making the effort; and with his encouragements, openly given, they have
                     greatly increased in numbers and influence. Under his sanction they have
                     extended their borders over larger and larger territory.
                  They ask for volunteer emigrants; but labor hard to enlist them. To secure
                     loyal subjects, none are taken into full privileges of citizenship till they
                     have been tried at least six months. Real love to their Sovereign and
                     neighbors, is tested during this trial; and when satisfied that this is
                     exercised, they are, in a prescribed form, admitted to all the privileges of
                     the community. And after this, as well as before, means are regularly used to
                     see that this faithfulness is heartily kept up. The oath of allegiance to the
                     government is perhaps more frequently repeated by citizens of this province
                     than by those of any other. If any
                     have deserted or moved over the boundary line, they are soon found out by this
                     means, as they do not make their appearance to declare their continued
                     allegiance. As long as these methods prescribed are attended to, the persons
                     whose names are found enrolled may be considered as quite reliable. As a
                     consequence, confidence in each other, and mutual affection, have attracted the
                     attention of strangers as a marked characteristic of Methodists. It was so at
                     least in their first organization. They have often got exceedingly happy in
                     each other's society; and especially while receiving favors and promises from
                     their Sovereign. They shout praise to him—talk of his gifts, sing hymns in his
                     praise, and show various signs of joy, so as to appear to some to be strangely
                     singular.
                  Somewhat strangely, a few of them have at times thought their province would be
                     bettered, by dropping some of its peculiarities and incorporating a part of the
                     usages of other provinces. Just so far as any have ventured to do this, their
                     distinctive peculiarities have been lost from view, and they have found the
                     interests of their own province suffering; yet with no advantage to others. It
                     is believed by many that the Lord raised up this province to rouse others by
                     the example and efforts of its people to greater zeal in sustaining the welfare
                     of the kingdom. And so, if they lower their standard of exercising love and
                     zeal to correspond with anything around them, they draw down the frowns of
                     their Sovereign, and are like Sampson shorn of his strength. I found them doing
                     a great work; and really felt in my heart to hope that they would never come
                     down to parley for less active life, or for any professions or customs, which
                     would obscure their characteristics as a peculiar people.
                  A leading feature among them is the itineration of the officers of their
                     province. The officers, once chosen, are generally retained during good
                     behavior. But those occupying the higher offices, frequently change their
                     localities for exercising their official duties. They think that various
                     advantages are derived from this usage; though they are ready to concede that
                     it might not be best for every province to adopt it. By this means, it must be
                     allowed, they are more successful than some of their neighbors, in keeping every part of the province
                     all the while supplied with suitable officers. Each locality has a claim upon
                     many for a supply, and is accommodated, though it may not be able to pledge any
                     stipulated salary, or to return an equivalent in any man qualified for an
                     official station. They are not allowed to select their supply, nor is the
                     officer supplied allowed to choose his place; but all this is done by a regular
                     system of exchanges annually or biennially, through a cabinet of chief
                     officers, who, in the position of general oversight, are best able to do
                     justice to all parties. Thus all are kept "at it, and always at it," in
                     carrying forward the interests of the province.
                  The system involves a mutual sacrifice of rights of choice, and of ease, for
                     the sake of the general good. It is found to be a very efficient means for
                     making the barren wilderness a fruitful field. The most desolate regions are
                     thus favored with the skill of the most experienced operators, as from time to
                     time they take their turns in supply; and the uncultivated inhabitants of those
                     neighborhoods are trained up to the refinements of higher life. This will
                     account for the more sparsely settled neighborhoods of this province being more
                     attractive as homes for the seeking emigrant, than the sparse settlements in
                     some other provinces of the kingdom. Officers are expected to be always on the
                     look-out in every part of the province for emigrants, on whatsoever part of the
                     shore they may first land, and to be ready to furnish them with all needed
                     instruction and help.
                  The government is mild but strict: it claims to be "very strict." Every
                     citizen, in case of alleged violation of the laws, is brought to trial before a
                     jury of his peers; and has right of appeal to a higher court, except the
                     Bishops, who have no right of appeal. Injustice is thus pretty well guarded
                     against.
                  The forms of worship do not essentially vary from those in other provinces. As
                     remarked before, they sometimes express excited joy in shouts of praise: and
                     this, with some other expressions of happy feeling, it may be conceived would
                     be somewhat restrained by written sermons and prayers. And as might be expected
                     where such manifestations of excited
                     feelings are prevalent, these people are seldom confined to reading sermons and
                     repeating written forms of prayer. Yet it is allowed that their ministers
                     understand what they teach, and that the people know for what they pray. They
                     ask as children would of a parent, for just what they want at the time, as
                     their wants ever vary. They frequently offer the Lord's prayer; but consider
                     that to be an example as to the subject and import of prayer, rather than as an
                     example to authorize a written form. "After this manner" they extend their
                     petitions to all desired particularity. In some of their meetings both men and
                     women raise their voices in supplications.
                  I have been rather particular, and yet brief as I could well be, in giving a
                     view of these four provincial organizations. As before said, the kingdom
                     embraces perhaps twenty or thirty similar organizations. I was not informed
                     precisely how many. And, these not being uniform in position or operations, yet
                     united by one bond to the Sovereign, and promoting the good of the general
                     government, appeared plainly to accord with the unity, not
                        uniformity of the country, as exhibited in the particulars before
                     named: in the face of the country, in the exhibitions of nature, in the
                     operations of providence and God's gracious influences among the people, and in
                     the abilities of the people for usefulness.
                  Now, as it has been shown, there being in these several ways an exhibition of
                     unity, yet not uniformity, if, in the Millennial glory of Christ on earth, his
                     Church should no longer exhibit similar varieties, it would appear in singular
                     contrast. God's works in men, and in nature and providence, would not appear in
                     harmony.
                  It is expected that ultimately the kingdoms of this world will become "the
                     kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ;" but that then there will exist
                     varieties of form in the militant Church. It will have various branches,
                     perhaps distinguished by some of the same names now borne. In the Millennial
                     day one may be called a Methodist, another a Lutheran, and so on.
                  This union of all the provinces into one, or not, has been a question of
                     considerable interest est in the
                     kingdom. Many most loyal subjects were quite indifferent which way it might be:
                     they were most concerned that no province should claim that its form would be
                     the victorious one, and absorb all the others. There was found to be danger of
                     selfishness creeping in, quite inconsistent with loyalty, by which each would
                     seek to make his province the chief, and to conform others to it. This spirit
                     of sectarian selfishness has been very disastrous whenever indulged; those
                     indulging being very apt to become dissatisfied with the general government,
                     and to desert the country. The true-hearted greet all citizens of every
                     province with brotherly regard, and love them and their country, surmounting
                     the contraction of local prejudices. They look upon all, despite of their
                     differences, as of one family.
                  The remarks of one of these people upon this point struck my attention as quite
                     appropriate. He said, "It is exceedingly desirable that each Christian should
                     cultivate the habit of regarding himself as one of the family. The
                     brothers and sisters of a well ordered family understand this feeling very
                     well; it is habitual with them. They have one common interest, and are bound
                     together by their affection for their parents. No one thinks of appropriating
                     to himself any more than his own share of the home comforts. No one wants to be
                     commended at the expense of the rest. They are accustomed to being treated
                     alike, and never wish to have it otherwise. If one has any particular joy or
                     sorrow, the rest share it with him. They make allowance for each other's
                     defects, and 'forgive and forget.' Each one, perhaps, has his particular tastes
                     and occupations, but they are never suffered to interfere with the general
                     comfort and convenience. Their principal happiness grows out of their love to
                     their parents and each other. Let us, then, look on the members of 'the
                     household of faith' in this light. Let us mix ourselves up with them, till that
                     rich word 'we' shall come more naturally to our lips than
                        'I'. Let us completely identify ourselves with them, and strive
                     to have no separate interest. The Bible says: 'Look not every man on his own
                     things, but every man also on the things of others.' Perhaps each member of the
                     household is as dear to our Father
                     as we are; therefore let us take the same interest in their salvation that we
                     do in our own. It will be equally glorious to God—equally gratifying to 'that
                     mighty heart of love.' Do we fervently pray for sanctification? Let us never
                     offer a prayer for ourselves without adding a petition of the same kind for all
                     the rest of the dear family. There is such a thing, perhaps, as keeping the
                     mind's eye too exclusively on our own spiritual wants, and selfishness may even
                     creep in here. Why should we wish to be holy? That God may be glorified, and
                     his whole will accomplished in us. Well, we have the same reason for desiring
                     the holiness of all the rest of his children."
                  Another argued the propriety of there being a family of religious
                     denominations, as seen in this country. Said he, "We may fairly doubt whether
                     the splitting up of Christendom into various denominations, be necessarily
                     adverse to the progress of pure Christianity; whether, in the end, and when
                     Christians become better Christians, it may not be the very best means of
                     developing among them the important graces of forbearance, and that charity
                     that 'suffereth long and is kind:' whether human nature, being
                     what it is, this may not rather be viewed as a providential arrangement by
                     which truth will be more thoroughly sifted, and thus the more certainly
                     purified and established; by which the natural diversity of tastes may be
                     innocently accommodated, while the emulation of sects may provoke to zeal and
                     good works, and the entire Church be prevented from sinking back again, as
                     under the papacy, into one overwhelming and unmitigated mass of corruption. As
                     in nature the most sublime and beneficial results are often produced by the
                     operation of contrary forces, so may it be in the kingdom of grace. And He who
                     in every department of his works, 'from seemingly evil still educes good,' may
                     have devised this very method of preserving a religion of thought and of life
                     in the world; of making our piety 'a reasonable service,' instead of an
                     unreflecting and senseless formalism. For such does all experience prove that
                     it will become, where there are none to challenge or dispute our creed. Every
                     grand hierarchy, every great national tional Church, has become corrupt, just in proportion as dissent died away,
                     and the necessity for defending the truth and guarding manners against
                     impeachment, ceased. Clearly, then, we are of the opinion that complete
                     uniformity is not essential to the end desired; and that all attempts to coerce
                     union by amalgamating Christians into one single denomination, would really be
                     disastrous to the interests of truth and piety. They who would urge this mode,
                     we think, mistake greatly the needful remedy. The attempt cannot succeed;
                     apparent success will be but temporary."
                  While these provinces treat each other in this way—exhibit unity, though not
                     uniformity—they certainly exhibit as inviting a home for emigrants as they
                     could in any other way. And who can say they will not attract, ultimately, the
                     whole world to come under their banner of many "stars and stripes?"
                  Enemies of this kingdom are mistaken in their charges that, because there are
                     many provinces here, they are therefore working against each other; are not
                     one, but divided in their interests, so that the prosperity of one is not the
                     good of the whole; and that, therefore, it is undesirable to join with either.
                     "When one member suffers, all suffer with it: when one rejoices, all rejoice
                     with it." They are bound to support each other in every case of invasion or
                     suffering; and it is contrary to the constitution of the general government for
                     them to take up arms against each other.
                  It is not pretended that any of these forms or usages of any one of the
                     provincial governments are perfect. The evils discovered in the present
                     exercise of the government, or in the doings of the people, are relics of the
                        old country rule, brought over with emigrants. The tendency is
                     to get rid of these evils; and the kingdom shows plain marks of eternal
                     durability, and of finally ridding its subjects of all the evils they imbibed
                     in their native country. They will then be transferred to regions beyond, to
                     that portion of the universe, to Heaven, where God will reign without a rival.
                     All will then be safe and satisfied.
                  But these imperfections in judgment, and wisdom, and strength, thus allowed to
                     exist among the inhabitants of this country, do not constitute crime. Opposers to this government
                     are using their breath and pens in ire against some of their own kingdom, when
                     they declaim against ungodly priests, against corrupt-hearted but professed
                     adherents to any of these provinces, and against backsliders; in other words,
                     against traitors, spies, and deserters. These do not belong to this kingdom.
                     They are scouting about for no good. All the preceding descriptions of the
                     inhabitants are designed to represent good citizens, to the exclusion of these.
                     It is only to share a place with good citizens that we wish any to emigrate.
                     And is it not a fact that such are found in different localities, and under
                     different forms of government, as described? I am one witness to this fact; and
                     many more corroborating witnesses can be brought. Be assured, this is a good
                     country; and none the worse for its variety in all the several ways described.
                     It all adheres to one Christ for its Sovereign. "There are differences of
                     administration, but the same Lord."
               
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               The Good They Can Do,
               INDUCING OTHERS TO FOLLOW THEM.
               WHAT has been said in the preceding chapters, will throw much light upon this
                  point. The condition of the people in their oppression, and all the varieties of
                  bonds which hold them there; the manner in which they must pass over, if they come
                  at all; and what has been said of the associations and customs existing in
                  Christ's kingdom, must all be taken into the view, in order to appreciate the
                  influences exerted by the people of one kingdom upon those of the other.
               1. Emigrants induce old country people to follow them, in the first place,
                     by their example of prosperity. In whatever province they settle,
                  ordinary industry secures them a competence tence. Now their contentment, their mutual love,
                  &c., as described in the last chapter, are all well known by those living in
                  the empire of Beelzebub. For, let it be here plainly understood, the boundary
                  lines between the kingdoms are not so broad as to prevent those on the one side,
                  from hearing and seeing what is done upon the other side of the line. We read of
                  there being "a great gulf fixed" between the rich man in hell, and Lazarus in
                  Abraham's bosom. Yet the rich man and Abraham held a conversation together across
                  the gulf. It may then be comprehended that this passable boundary,
                  represented between these kingdoms, is no barrier to persons being influenced by
                  what they see and hear across the boundary. It is in this way that those in
                  oppression are affected by the example of these emigrants. They become satisfied
                  that their friends, by moving, have secured a good to be prized. No instructions
                  or arguments would impress some of them so forcibly, and start them so quickly, as
                  to see and know that their friends have secured a good which they lack. Hence, the
                  responsibility of emigrants to let their good be
                  known; and in a way not to be evil spoken of. As they
                  love their friends yet in bondage, they are obligated to set attractive examples
                  before them; obligated never to conceal the amount of their gains, and never to
                  repress the expressions of their happiness.
               A view, (as it was described by an emigrant,) of one of the families of these
                  provinces, in daily life, will give a further conception of the impressions their
                  way of living makes upon their neighbors beyond the line.
               It is winter. The members of the family begin Monday morning early with private
                  and family devotions; and with renewed vigor and Christian cheerfulness, they
                  enter upon the business of the week, seriously contriving and perhaps consulting
                  together, how they may successfully look after some who were neglecters of public
                  worship on Sunday; or, how they may encourage some who appeared serious, or
                  benefit those who were learned to be in affliction. One evening visitors are
                  received. The family manage to make the interview agreeable to the religious and
                  irreligious, old and young; and yet, with the controlling intention to exert an influence favorable to piety. And they
                  succeed. Another evening they are invited abroad. If they cannot go into the
                  company proposed with a spirit of prayer for God's blessing upon them, and so as
                  to maintain their Christian character and influence, they decline. If they go,
                  they are courteous, win the esteem of all classes of persons present, and honor
                  their Master. All their visits are religious visits. No excuse which would not
                  keep them from market, prevents their attendance upon the weekly prayer meeting.
                  They waste no time in slumber because of the nights being long. They have minds to
                  improve, information to gain, enough to do.
               Sabbath morning arrives, when, with clear consciences, with warm and prayerful
                  hearts, they repair to the place of public worship. The minister can preach while
                  they are prayerful. And the co-operating results of his preaching and their
                  prayers, are felt in Divine power upon sinning souls. Thus weeks roll on, with
                  continued aggressive success among the travellers in "the broad way."
               And the efforts continue in harvest. The same morning and evening devotions are
                  performed; the same calculations to accomplish some religious good during the
                  week, are made: in whatever company labor is performed, care is exercised to make
                  favorable virtuous impressions. Business is closed on Saturday night as well as it
                  can be, to enter upon the holy Sabbath with a good degree of bodily and mental
                  vigor. With their predominant aim in their business transactions, it is easy to
                  decide whether to venture to gather their crops on the Sabbath. They are under no
                  obligations to labor for what cannot be got or saved while manifestly conforming
                  to the Divine commands, and, in such way as to promote the glory of God. They
                  never imagine that they can exert a religious influence by gathering their harvest
                  on the Sabbath; and they are satisfied with such amount of property as they can
                  secure by doing right. All gains are made subordinate to the securing of a
                  heavenly inheritance to themselves and others.
               With such a family, hired laborers would have every help and encouragement to
                  serve God. All, being "diligent in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord," would show that
                  business can be successfully followed; family cares, and business cares, and
                  laborers' cares, exercised, and various relations maintained, while full gospel
                  blessings are enjoyed.
               Now suppose this same spirit were manifested in all the lawful avocations in life;
                  that all Christians were influenced by the predominant idea that they are
                  continued in the world to do good as well as to get good. Wherever we
                  might find Christians, whether among farmers, or mechanics; merchants or
                  professional men; teachers or scholars; those in civil office, or in private
                  toils; sailors or travellers; indeed, in any rational employment, there we should
                  witness the reflection of religious light and influence; and it would be
                  exemplified to all beholders that gospel blessings are adapted to accompany the
                  various pursuits of life.
               If all professed Christians would thus turn messengers of truth, and exemplifiers
                  of the blessed effects of the Gospel, missionaries would not be wanting; but with
                  God's blessing, the whole world would soon feel the influence. Is this thought to
                  be mere fancy? Certainly such influence has been exerted in some cases. It may be
                  in others. Why not in all? It may. It should. Christians are faulty, wherever they
                  live, or whatever may be their calling, if their influence is not felt in favor of
                  pure religion. Let all Christians, in their several spheres, live in the spirit of
                  their Christian calling, and the Lord will bless with revivals of pure religion
                  unceasing and unlimited, except with the glory of the Millennial day.
               The wicked, under Satan's dominion, know many of these happy families just
                  represented. Why, say they, do we endure constantly recurring disappointments of
                  happiness here, when our acquaintances surely have it there? Let us go and join
                  them, and be as happy as they.
               It is chiefly by their manner of life that these families raise the reputation of
                  their country abroad, for affording peace and thrift to its inhabitants.
                  Frequently this reputation is what first causes, among old country people, a
                  feeling of discontent with their situation.
               2. Emigrants are careful to send back all necessary information and persuasives to
                  induce their relatives and friends to follow them.
               
               One way of presenting this inducement is to report well of the government—that it
                  affords sure protection. Strangers want to feel well assured of this. Some of them
                  have the impression that the laws of this kingdom are too strict for happy
                  liberty. It is the duty of those who have had the experience of living under them,
                  to report the contrary, and give their strong assurances that "the commandments
                  are not grievous:" that the "yoke is easy and the burden is light." They want
                  assurances, too, that there is no respect of persons shown; that the whole
                  treatment of citizens is kind; not with cold distance or reserve, with manifested
                  indifference or delight in their afflictions. There are abundant means of giving
                  assurance that the Sovereign loves his people. The people speak well of the care
                  shown for them, and while they live under this dominion, do not murmur nor
                  complain. Thus from residents a clear and uniformly favorable report is given of
                  the government. Sometimes, to be sure, murmuring and complaints are raised by
                  those who have rebelled against the government, and been expelled. But who, that
                  ever had law enforced against him when guilty and unrepenting, has failed to find
                  fault? The reports of those banished should never be heeded.
               The Lord of the land employs numbers of these emigrants, and sends them out within
                  hearing of the oppressed, as heralds to proclaim his offers and various
                  persuasives. He also supplies these heralds and their helpers with books and
                  tracts to circulate, giving information, and various instructions to induce
                  emigrations.
               One example, among the thousands which might be given, illustrative of this kind
                  of influence by letter-writing, and kindred efforts, is recorded in the Missionary
                  Advocate, of Oct., 1853. It is related by Rev. L. S. Jacoby, in his quarterly
                  report of the Mission in Germany. He says: "In one place, a revival of religion
                  broke out among the farmers by the instrumentality of a letter a young man, who
                  had been converted among the Methodists in New-York, wrote to his relatives. His
                  brother was soon converted, went from house to house, read that letter, related
                  his conversion, exhorted the people, and not in vain. Souls were converted, and people commenced to meet together."
                  It is exceedingly important that all emigrants to Christ's kingdom should
                  appreciate their responsibility to use the kind of influence here represented.
               All these efforts might seem unjust between two nations; but Satan's kingdom is a
                  revolted province of the Lord's; and that despotic king is holding the people in
                  unjust vassalage. It is Christ's right to rule over the whole. As soon as the
                  people can be induced to turn from their revolt, and allow this right to rule,
                  there is no law which can hold them any longer in subjection to Satan. It is the
                  leading care and effort of Christ's subjects to enlighten, persuade, and draw back
                  these revolted and now oppressed people; to break up Satan's empire, and annex all
                  to their own country. And I am sure it would be a far happier world if all would
                  come under the regulations of this government.
               3. Another means which emigrants employ to save their former associates in
                  suffering from further oppressions is, to present petitions to their Sovereign,
                  that he will interfere and claim individuals under oppression. The right of
                  petition is recognized. It has been specifically proclaimed, even though the
                  thorough knowledge of the Supreme Ruler cannot leave him ignorant, in any case, of
                  what is needed. One prominent condition on which he interposes his power to supply
                  the needy and to relieve the oppressed is, that his assistance shall be sought by
                  petition. No one questions his right to interpose such condition; and though he is
                  certainly under no obligation to proclaim the reasons for his laws, and for the
                  regulations of his government, no doubt he has good reasons, and many are able to
                  discover wisdom and kindness displayed in this regulation. His subjects are thus
                  led more fully to appreciate their dependence upon him, and to exercise more
                  sympathy for their friends, as they must often petition for them. Mercy is
                  peculiarly manifest in this requirement to petition for neighbors, as many most
                  suffering ones are so ground down under Satanic oppression, and their senses are
                  so stultified, that they would never themselves petition for the needed
                  interposition of this compassionate Sovereign. When they find they have friends who are interceding in their
                  behalf, they are roused to think there is something serious in their condition;
                  and, finding that others do not despair of help for them, they join their
                  petitions with those of their friends, and are then sure to receive all the
                  assistance needed.
               Petitions are required to be offered always with due respect to the character of
                  the Being to whom they are presented. He must be revered, adored; must be
                  approached with penitence for past revolts, and with humility.
               But after all, many mistake here. Having an idea that their Sovereign knows
                  beforehand every particular in regard to which they pray to him, they ask only in
                  general terms, especially when in behalf of their fellow men. Now the Lord has
                  never obligated himself to hear such petitions. He could search the world over,
                  and select objects for his compassionate help, answering to these general prayers.
                  So, when one prays that he will offer rescue and interpose his authority, to claim
                  those whom Satan holds in bondage, he could comply. But from all precedents of
                  successful petitioning, we learn that particularity is the regular form approved,
                  and is requisite to anything like marked success.
               Who ever thought of petitioning the Legislature of the State of New-York to grant
                  an Act and appropriations to relieve citizens who are wronged and
                     suffering? The petition to this body, in order to be recognized and
                  acted upon, must specify who are wronged, calling the names; or, what class of
                  wrongs are suffered. Without such particularity the petition would be thrown under
                  the table unregarded.
               Who ever applied to the Governor of a state for a reprieve to criminals, saying
                  that there were such, and that there were circumstances in their cases calling for
                  governmental clemency? The question would arise, Who are they? What are their
                  names? What are the circumstances alluded to? Such petitions always particularize
                  the cases.
               Is it not customary, when one state claims a citizen unjustly held in another
                  state, to specify the person by name, and to state the circumstances of the
                  case?
               
               With these views of the privileges and forms of petitioning before them, readers
                  can appreciate how these emigrants have their sympathies awakened for individuals.
                  They not only esteem it a privilege to ask favors for their friends, but they are
                  excited to faithfulness in this, because of their assurances that the rescue of
                  their friends depends very much on their presenting petitions in their behalf.
                  Some have a friend from whom Satan carefully keeps all information from abroad;
                  and in the darkness of his ignorance makes him contented in his dangerous
                  situation. In answer to petitions offered, Satan has to refrain from his blinding
                  measures, and heralds proclaim to the individual his danger, and the terms of
                  help; others write letters which he is permitted now to receive. He now learns his
                  danger, and at the same time his privilege to escape. Now he joins in asking for a
                  guide and help, when he is at once supplied and is saved.
               Another is made to believe everything bad of Christ and his people, while lies are
                  told him of the ultimate happiness of all mankind, or, of the fatality of his
                  situation being such that he can do nothing to escape from his present home. All
                  these lies are credited, and have their influence upon his conduct, because he has
                  not been permitted by his Ruler to consult only one side of these questions. All
                  clear information offered by his friends, has been carefully kept from him; or if
                  permitted to reach him, he is taught that it is designed to intermeddle with his
                  happiness, and with his prejudices he refuses to believe his best friends.
                  Petitions are offered to require Satan to refrain from such one-sided course, and
                  let him receive communications from his friends, and even the authorized documents
                  of the kingdom of God, on points touching his case, when he is induced to look at
                  the subject impartially, and to beg relief from his oppressions.
               It can easily be conceived that in these and similar cases, persons under Satan's
                  dominion are rescued and brought over through the influence of petitions in their
                  behalf. And I noticed that the citizens who appeared to enjoy life the best, were
                  very forward and zealous in urging their petitions in behalf of such cases as just now suggested. In connection
                  with this, it was noticed that they always stood ready to be employed in any
                  service which would further the object of their prayers. They are faithful to
                  comply with the condition on which the Sovereign has pledged his special
                  interference in these cases of oppression. They enjoy the luxury of seeking and
                  doing good.
               One of the emigrants argued at some length in favor of the prevalent custom of
                  particular and earnest petitioning as just represented. He said, "Among the many
                  words which may be employed to express ideas, there may be selected those which
                  point out either general or particular wants. Thoughts and words may be directed
                  to classes of objects, or to individual objects. Prayer may be offered for all
                  men, for sinners in general, for a nation; or, for individuals and particular
                  cases. We may look upon a forest without giving attention to the particular kinds
                  and qualities of the trees which compose it; or, we may notice the different
                  classes as distinguished by their varying qualities, and by the peculiarities of
                  each individual tree. If objects are contemplated according cording to the former
                  method, the impressions of their attributes and relations must be mingled and
                  confused; if in the latter, the impressions will be more complete and better
                  understood. This illustrates how we can view mankind, and have our notions of the
                  wants of ourselves and others, as a whole; or, to a great extent, separately.
               "Keeping these things in the mind, we may urge the propriety of particularizing in
                  prayer. It may not be advisable to be equally minute at all times and in all
                  circumstances. But, it is the regular form, in praying for the heathen, to name
                  particular nations and missions, and dwell upon their peculiar circumstances and
                  wants; in praying for the progress of truth, and the dispelling of error and
                  superstition, to name particular denominations of errorists, as Infidels,
                  Idolaters, Mohammedans, &c., also the several means used to propagate Bible
                  truth, as Bible Societies, Missionary Societies, Tract Societies, &c.; in
                  praying for a nation, to supplicate particularly for the leading officers of
                  government, and for all filling various offices and ranks in society, and to dwell
                     upon any peculiar circumstances of
                  the country, as being in a state of war or peace, in prosperity or in adversity,
                  winking at and sustaining iniquity within its bounds, or struggling to be rid of
                  evils and wrongs; in praying for the success of the visible Church, to distinguish
                  its circumstances and enterprises; in praying for neighborhoods, to be specially
                  careful to supplicate for the several individuals with a direct conception and
                  frequent expression of their peculiar exposures to temptation, and of their needs
                  of the Divine blessing; and most specially to supplicate for success to attend any
                  particular efforts employed for the religious benefit of the community or of
                  selected individuals, such as relatives, those manifesting seriousness, the
                  penitent, those recently converted; and thus, in praying for ourselves and others,
                  to 'let the requests be make known unto God, in all things, by prayer
                  and supplications, with thanksgiving.'
               "In this way prayer will be likely to be more fervent. In order to become strongly
                  interested in any object, it must be contemplated with more than a slight glance.
                  Thought and understanding derstanding must be exercised upon its peculiarities. If
                  effort were to be used to excite sympathy for a starving nation, it would be but
                  faintly accomplished when it were said that the scarcity is generally felt, and is
                  so great that many actually die of hunger. But eye-witnesses would report the
                  particular state of things. Perhaps, that in a certain neighborhood is found a
                  family, of a given name, destitute of food, and too far famished to seek it. The
                  sons are dead, the daughters are dying, the parents unable to afford relief. In
                  another neighborhood all the members of a family, well known to the listeners, are
                  lifeless several days before they are discovered, and the dwellings around have
                  inmates with stinted supplies, suffering with gnawing hunger and wasting fever,
                  unable to perform the funeral rites of their starved friends. A young lady, ——,
                  well known to have been healthy and robust, possessed of a strong mind and an
                  affectionate heart, beautiful and loved, is met at her parents' door, with her
                  steps tottering, cheeks hollow, eyes sluggish, faintly weeping, 'Father is dead,
                  my little sisters are no more, my mother with her infant babe has just fainted—we get no
                  food.'
               "Over the country, like scenes are depicted. Laborers faint while carrying their
                  scanty earnings to their crying children. In a market-town are seen a multitude
                  gathered, bearing every mark of extreme want, clamoring for food. The benevolent
                  bestow while their resources last; but resources for supply, by purchase or gift,
                  fail. Help must be had from others. To know that acquaintances and relatives are
                  thus suffering, must excite interest. Particular cases of the suffering of friends
                  cannot be contemplated without sympathy, and earnest effort to relieve.
               "Now no fancy picture or reality of multitudes suffering for want of food, can
                  exceed the awful fact that many people are suffering a 'famine of the word of the
                  Lord' to the ruin of their souls,—that they are not drawing supplies from the
                  fountain of spiritual life. And to think that a large proportion of the
                  inhabitants of the earth are wicked, is not enough. The peculiar circumstances of
                  individuals and classes, best known, should be considered sidered and presented in
                  all their bearings. Petitions offered at the throne of grace, naming the
                  particular circumstances of souls known to be suffering worse than a famine of
                  bread, will be accompanied with earnest and bold pleading. And when prayers,
                  offered as just expressed, are answered, the success is readily recognized; and
                  thereby a new impulse is given to faith in after approaches to the throne of
                  grace. But if prayer is offered with indefiniteness, for many blessings in
                  general, but none in particular, answers to it cannot be distinguished, and
                  therefore this source of encouragement to faith will not be realized."
               I found it to be a peculiarity attending these emigrations, that no persons had
                  succeeded in breaking away from the entanglements of Satan's oppression, without
                  the interposition of Supreme power, in answer to petitions in their behalf. It is
                  no wonder that petitions of emigrants for their friends are very numerous, and
                  that they are very earnest in this and other benevolent efforts to rescue
                  them.
               4. I found that some emigrants go back and settle again in the old country, and
                  that this discourages many from moving:
                  that it greatly neutralizes the benevolent efforts of the permanent settlers.
               Some become indolent, wearied with the activity required, and slink back. Perhaps
                  they are naturally sluggish. Any way, they slack the zeal and untiring industry
                  which they manifested in their first removal, appearing to imagine that when once
                  fairly settled, they may enjoy case and be less active. Those who thus relax their
                  energies, find themselves soon unhappy, and begin to wander back to seek rest; but
                  it is said they find none.
               
               Others yield to selfish ambition, and complain that they are required to support
                  the government so largely, so expensively, and to seek their own emolument only in
                  subordination to that of the government. As a regular consequence of their removal
                  to the country, and submitting to its industrial regulations, their riches
                  increase; but they disregard the injunction not to set their hearts upon them.
                  They forget that all they have or could gain in the country is by the favor of the
                  Sovereign; and to grudge him supplies when he seeks to draw, in order to carry out
                  the benevolent enterprises of his government, is showing ingratitude and
                  disloyalty. These dispositions cannot long be indulged there without further
                  dissatisfaction, repining, and the ultimate decision to seek more freedom in
                  ambitious gains. They fail then to love their Ruler and their country, and forsake
                  both. They turn their prosperity to their ruin.
               Others indulge in self-esteem so far as to be self-sufficient. They begin to doubt
                  the wisdom of the administration, and disclaim the authority over them. They will
                  be "free thinkers." and at their liberty. So they return.
               Others disobey the laws, or neglect their duties as enjoined, and are banished
                  back again.
               Of course, persons who would do these things are wicked enough to misrepresent.
                  And they do so, in speaking of this country. This, and the fact of their return,
                  causes many to believe evil of the land, and its people. Many jealousies and
                  surmises are excited in the minds of old country people in regard to the efforts
                  to induce their removal. Heralds are heard with suspicion. Descriptions of the promised country,
                  and of their own situation in contrast, are doubted. Letters of friends designed
                  to persuade to their removal, are thought to be self-interested.
               As the crazed become enemies often to their best friends, so these returned ones
                  are frequently the most virulent and successful opposers to emigration. Their very
                  presence discourages many from starting. If they even plead that they are passive,
                  and would not be found discouraging others, yet their very position effectually
                  does this work.
               Here we see the danger of emigrants, and the difficulty of their work. If none
                  ever returned, once emigrated under such a government, in such a country, they
                  would have nothing to fear. They would be beyond danger. And if none ever
                  returned, it would be pleasant, easy, and successful work to invite their friends
                  to follow them. All are safe while they remain in the country. Nothing can harm
                  them while they are followers of that which is good. No enemy can reach them while
                  under the protection of their all-powerful ful Sovereign. No want will be
                  unsupplied where their real good would suffer; for the stores of the universe are
                  open to supply. They have only to ask and receive what they need. Their only
                  danger is in leaving the country. But to stay, they must submit to its
                  regulations. This, as just stated, some fail to do. And their failure interferes
                  with the pleasure and success of the work of those who stay. Their business is,
                  among other things, to extend the bounds of the empire, to gather multitudes to
                  join it. They must work for their country. But in order to success, their country
                  must have reputation abroad; for their conquests and building up of the empire,
                  are not with carnal weapons,—the sword, powder and ball, &c. They persuade and
                  help many: they compel none. Every volunteer is sure to have all needed help to
                  forsake his country, and to join them.
               O, if every emigrant were faithful, and never slacked his energy in discharging
                  the duties here represented, to his countrymen, having all these inducements to
                  present to encourage their emigration,
                  it really-seemed to me that every person would soon join them. But a part of them
                  relaxing their zeal and going back, sadly neutralizes the efforts of the
                  faithful.
            
            
               Conclusion.
               IN view of the representations of the preceding pages, will emigrants suffer me to
                  urge a few reflections upon the responsibility of their position?
               1. Your love to relatives and friends is now tested.
               You profess to love father, mother, brother, sister,—all those with whom you most
                  associate. You ought to love them; yes, even your enemies, "Love your enemies,
                  bless them that curse you," says the Lord. You know that some of your near
                  relatives and friends, as well as enemies, are miserable; are under subjection to
                  the despot. They do not love and serve your Lord. They are seeking
                  happiness in their so-called Pleasure Fields, in vain; building
                  castles in the air does not satisfy them; sensual delights bring their sore evils;
                  gold and earthly glory cannot satisfy;
                  their false hopes and philosophizing,—all leave them with an aching void. They are
                  ever seeking a better good, grasping, feeling their way along through life, waxing
                  all the while worse and worse in misery and danger: their Ruler entangles them in
                  his wiles more and more firmly. Their doom is certain, unless they are soon
                  rescued. But you are saved. And how do you show your love? By doing all you can,
                  by making any sacrifice, to get them over with you? Do you send up repeated
                  petitions to the Sovereign Power in their behalf? Do you send letters to them,
                  warning of their danger, and telling of the good your enjoy? Are you careful to
                  have the proclamation of heralds reach their ears, presenting every persuasive for
                  them to escape from their danger? Are you sparing of no expense requisite for the
                  use of these means to obtain their freedom? Or, do you get discouraged by trifling
                  difficulties in this work? Do you slacken your zeal, indulge in murmurings against
                  your Sovereign; and, by example of unfaithfulness, dissatisfaction, and desertion,
                  do you fasten upon them the ruinous choice to stay where they are? Your unfaithful
                  lives and desertion back again to their company, are the direct means to lead them
                  to that fatal decision. Is this loving them? It is binding them in their miseries.
                  It is constantly winding worse than a serpent's coil around them,—enchaining them
                  for the pit of woe. Are you doing this? O how sad I have felt when I have seen
                  persons who professed to love their friends, doing this very thing,—doing them
                  this wrong. O for love that wins.
               2. In your present life your reliability, in any professed attachment, is
                  tested.
               A circumstance which once transpired within the observation of an officer of this
                  kingdom will illustrate this point:—"At a very early period of my ministry," said
                  the Rev. A. M. L., "I labored in a portion of the country where a singular
                  circumstance happened in the common walks of life. A well-bred young man,
                  apparently under much religious concern, united himself with an excellent
                  religious society. Although he had formerly been rather wayward and inconsistent
                  in his life, yet, by his steady attendance on all the means of grace, and the rapid improvement which he
                  seemed to make in his religious course, he had gained largely on the affections of
                  his class-mates; and some of the most pious and discerning had already begun to
                  regard him as a youth of some promise. In the same neighborhood resided a comely,
                  and in many respects, a very amiable girl. Heaven had, in mercy, granted her one
                  of the greatest earthly blessings—a pious parentage. But she was of an unusually
                  volatile disposition, and passionately fond of the world, its fashions and
                  amusements. Our young friend saw her, loved her, and finally made proposals of
                  marriage. Eliza acknowledged that she was pleased with him. 'But, William,' said
                  she, 'there is one insuperable barrier to our union. You profess religion, and I
                  have no reason to doubt your sincerity. You see what a giddy, vain, and heedless
                  sinner I am. What domestic happiness do you suppose will arise from our marriage?
                  You, as a man of God, would feel it to be your duty to erect a family altar: I am
                  illy qualified to participate in holy exercises. You would love to see everything
                  clothed in the sombre aspect of Christianity; I might love to shine out with my
                  fashionable friends. Consider the great gulf that lies between us. It is true, it
                  is not impassable. But I am not prepared to come over to you at present. It
                  remains for you to consider whether you can forego your religious associations to
                  accommodate me.'
               "William, with a sorrowful countenance and heavy sigh, observed that he would
                  consider the matter. A few days after, in a heartless and reluctant manner, he
                  requested the leader to have his name erased from the class-book, when the
                  preacher came round. The leader, supposing he was laboring under some cruel
                  temptation of the enemy, urged him to confide in his integrity, and unbosom all
                  his sorrows. The more solicitous the leader was to dissuade him from his purpose,
                  the more earnestly he pressed his suit. The preacher, judging from the vehemency
                  of his manner, that all was not right, and that it might be more creditable to the
                  Church to let him go, granted his request.
               "It was not long before he stood before Eliza and renewed his suit. She observed,
                  'You are aware of the only difficulty that lies in the way—'Before she finished the sentence, he
                  exclaimed, with a smile, 'O, that is removed—my name is taken from the book—I am
                  no longer a Church member.' The young lady fell back in her chair. A deadly
                  paleness overspread her face, and, with quivering lips, she said, 'I will never
                  consent to marry you while the world stands. It is true, I am wild and
                  irreligious; but the pious instructions of my parents, the religious opportunities
                  I have had, the many heart-searching sermons which I have heard, have for a long
                  time disturbed my peace, and have determined me not to choose death. In view of my
                  natural proneness to ruin, I had determined to marry none but a man who would help
                  me to save my soul. I had flattered myself that you were such a character, but
                  thought it would be safe to try your steadfastness. When the proposal to leave
                  your class was first made, if you had rejected it with a manly and holy
                  indignation, you would have received my hand on the spot. When you promised to
                  consider the matter, I saw an indecision of character that made me tremble But
                  even after so many days' deliberation eration, if you had returned and said that
                  you loved Zion above your chief joy—then I could have confided my life in your
                  hands. But the die is cast. You will please never mention the subject again,
                  forever.'
               "We hope the reader will never realize the anguish of the rejected suitor. The
                  Church avoided him as an insincere and dangerous character. The world, more cruel,
                  reserved him as a standing target of ridicule. Some think that a compromising
                  course, in religious matters, is most likely to win over their irreligious friends
                  and connections. Hence, they have relaxed their fervor in the services of the
                  sanctuary. They have admitted the propriety of things which were doubtful, and
                  shaped their profession too much in conformity with the views of the world. This,
                  we will admit, has often warded off persecution, and has sometimes restored peace
                  in families; but it is a peace that impoverishes piety, enervates the soul, and is
                  always bought at the expense of the cross and kingdom of Jesus Christ. We doubt
                  whether this vascillating policy has ever saved a soul; steadfastness and decision
                  of faith have, and always will, where
                  salvation is possible."
               Every emigrant must expect to see a trying hour—a trial of his steadfastness. The
                  narrative just given illustrates the nature of this trial, however diverse may be
                  the circumstances. Somehow the real character will be developed. If allegiance to
                  the government is hearty, if Zion is loved above the chief joy, if no
                  bribes can lead to a moment's hesitation whether to betray its interests, then
                  there is reliability—no indecision of character to make one tremble for the safety
                  of the person or his cause.
               Every conceivable measure is taken to influence emigrants to forsake the standard
                  of their Sovereign. Beelzebub understands full well, from the experience of
                  thousands of years, that this is an efficient means of weakening the strength and
                  reputation of Christ's kingdom. Every one is forewarned of the danger from this
                  source. All are told that they will have to pass some perilous scenes; when, if
                  they are not suddenly surprised and taken off, or bribed by offers of rich
                  rewards, or fascinated by fair appearances, or captured in hot fight, it will be
                  by the watchful care and ever-present help which their Sovereign Lord proffers,
                  and they accept. If at any time one ventures to meet these hostile forces alone,
                  or in a way different from his instructions, he is sure to be taken. He must act
                  the soldier in obedience, and the soldier in the heat of
                  battle.
               But it is supposed that all who emigrate have counted the cost; and it is a wonder
                  that any should fail to profit by their warnings, and to be braced against
                  yielding to be overcome in the hour of trial. Why not recollect in the very midst
                  of the severest conflict, that this is just what was anticipated; that this is the
                  very crisis for which much previous preparation has been made, the crisis by which
                  to step to the higher honors and confidence in the kingdom? What would soldiers be
                  good for, however well trained by their manœuverings, and however well equipped,
                  if they would not stand, and fight, and conquer, in the heat of battle? What would
                  a country full of people avail to a Sovereign, if, when his kingdom is menaced by
                  a foe, they could not be relied upon as his fast friends? Could a country prosper if the people
                  maintained their attachments only while no adverse influences tried its
                  strength?
               A Sovereign and a people who should show themselves held together by no stronger
                  bonds than these indicated, would exert but a very feeble influence upon a
                  neighboring people, to induce them to annex themselves. A failure of any
                  individual to stand firm in his attachments to his chosen home, exerts a most
                  destructive influence upon the opinions and confidence of neighboring friends, in
                  regard to the desirableness of that home. Upon every emigrant it may then be
                  urged, both for your own sake and the sake of your friends, be firm.
               
               3. Your course shows what leading motives actuate you.
               You have sought and found your present home. Do the same motives still reign with
                  you which actuated your removal? Or, having succeeded thus far, do you change your
                  principles of action, and no longer act from a controlling regard to the rights of
                  your Sovereign as connected with your eternal good; but rather let selfish
                  principles come in, leading to seek personal ease and present enjoyment, according
                  to inclinations? Are you now creatures of circumstances and of strongest
                  influences? If so, your motives of action will be as changeable as the motive
                  power dependent on the shifting winds. You will be drawn by motives in diverse
                  ways. You cannot be relied upon to stand to any position of duty or right assigned
                  to you. To-day you may be regular subjects of the kingdom; to-morrow, deserters.
                  You cannot thus have the noble motives of patriotism and human friendship
                  actuating you. Your motives must be low. You seek for indulgence of appetites, or
                  passions, or actions in rebellion against God, such as are practiced only by a
                  fallen, degraded race. You seek satisfaction which no being in God's universe
                  would think of calling good, except those dwelling on earth in a fallen state. You
                  yourselves, when you pass, by and by, from earth, will not look upon those things
                  which you now call enjoyments, as at all desirable. You seek earth-born pleasures,
                  nurtured in sin; such as cannot continue in another world. And for these you leave
                  the begun enjoyments of heaven's en's
                  supply, adapted to satisfy your immortal natures, in Christ's kingdom. Certainly
                  nothing less than this can be said of the motives which lead an individual away
                  from allegiance to Christ. They are motives low as earth, and degraded as the
                  fields of Sin; they cannot be unearthly and eternal motives. When you
                  pass beyond earth you will find nothing to fill the place of these motives which
                  you have while on earth. You must then exist and suffer, without a motive—no
                  worthy end of living in view. O how you will then wish to cease to be. But nothing
                  will be found upon which to rest the aims or hopes. A dark blank will be there—no
                  motive to invite pursuit in any direction.
               For nothing less than this are you going who forsake allegiance to Christ's
                  kingdom; who are drawn off by any motives whatever. Look well to the thoughts and
                  intents of your hearts, if you would not make the first move toward your final
                  ruin. Venture not to look down at all with desire upon earthly enjoyments, or
                  sinful offers. Reach not after them, ever. Rise over them in your aims of life.
                  Have motives worthy of your position, as subjects of a heavenly empire; worthy of
                  your God-like capacity; worthy of your immortality. Grasp not for a phantom to
                  lose a reality.
               If you persist through all trials, to go on as faithful emigrants—as adopted
                  citizens in Christ's kingdom, your motives are certainly higher than those which
                  actuate animals; higher and nobler than sinful. Nothing of sin is sought for. The
                  soul is in full stretch above and beyond the fields of Sin. The
                  thoughts are fixed on acts manifesting love to the Lord. The motives are
                  patriotic. You love your country—your Ruler. Any toil, any sacrifice, anything
                  building up the kingdom, is practiced with delight. Nothing is allowed to divide
                  the affections.
               And all this in this kingdom's prosperity, is in plain connection with ardent love
                  to fellow men. Philanthropy and friendship are exercised, as if no other object of
                  living were had. The faithful citizens live for the good of others,—that they may
                  be brought to share the same blessings with themselves. Who can find fault with
                  this way of living—living to make the
                  world happy? It is not living in vain. It is a more noble motive of life than to
                  live to make a fortune of earthly treasures. These people mean to do good. They
                  try. They contrive how. They seek instruction for this. Their very efforts exert a
                  favorable influence upon those they would benefit, though they may not appear to
                  themselves to succeed. Their motives are good, and God approves. They are of the
                  same nature as those with which angels live. Angels do not pass on in existence to
                  get money, or to gather farms or merchandise as their own, or to get reputation
                  for extensive knowledge, or to obtain influence over the opinions of others, or to
                  indulge any such feelings as are enjoyed by sinful men in eating, or drinking, or
                  seeing, or hearing. They live to enjoy pleasures, above any such, nobler and
                  richer. And these emigrants seek to enjoy as angels do. This is one aim of their
                  life. They have motives different from their sinning neighbors. They have got
                  their attention upon an object of life which will not cease to move them when the
                  earth is burned up. If there is nothing worthy of living for, only that which is
                  embraced in the motives of wicked men, why should they desire to exist when the
                  earth is no more? But these emigrants live for a good which will never perish. In
                  its nature the good they seek is eternal. It is satisfaction to their immortal
                  part—the soul.
               Now if these patriotic, philanthropic, angelic, eternal motives, are yours through
                  life, your life will not be spent in vain. You will get a real good, and will do
                  good. How is this? Are you hesitating whether to devote your all as faithful
                  subjects of your chosen Sovereign? Let nothing divide your affections, nor prevent
                  your whole life being spent in a way the most successful to promote Christ's
                  universal sway. Do not forget that upon your exertions, chiefly, it depends
                  whether your relatives and friends, now ground down under Satan's oppression, ever
                  come over to enjoy the blessings of Christ's kingdom.
