            A WORD OR TWO TO THE READER.
            THIS volume of sketches—for it claims to be nothing more—is composed of gleanings from sources to which the author contributed during the past fifteen years. It represents his writings in "Harper's Monthly Magazine" and "Harper's Bazar," in the New York "Home Journal" and the "Eastern State Journal" of White Plains, in the "Weekly Leader," when Clancy edited it, and the old "Saturday Press," under Clapp and Aldrich and O'Brien.
            Some of the sketches, particularly those in the latter part of the book, refer to incidents, events, and even personages that have passed either into history or forgetfulness; but in the estimation of the writer these are not the least readable portions of this volume. Without further preface he now submits it to his readers.

                           Of this handsome estate I am owner in fee,
                           And paramount lord of the soil;
                           And, oft as I may, I'm accustomed to go
                           And live, like a king, in my Spanish chateau."

                  CASTLE I.
                  FLYING CLOUDS.
                  ALTHOUGH I am a quiet family man of middle age, and have a wife upon whose head silvery threads are beginning to show themselves, while mine is getting bald and shiny, and wrinkles are slowly creeping across my brow; and, moreover, have children who are growing up around me with a rapidity which reminds me, when I look at them, of the growth of sunflowers and hollyhocks in summer time; and, further, though daily cares are mine, and anxiety as to the future welfare of my flock visits me as I lie awake at night, yet, for all this, there still clings about me a spice of boyish romance,—that romance which, in my youthful days, made me the lover and defender of every young and pretty girl I encountered; the admirer of King Arthur and his knights, of Robin Hood and his merry men, of the good Haroun Alraschid, of Constantine in the Holy Land, of the fearless and reproachless Bayard, of Sir Philip Sidney, of Don Quixote, of Tristram Shandy, and hosts of other heroes of the past, and which would have wedded me to the Muse of Poesy, if Nature, for some wise purpose of her own, had not forbidden the bans.
                  Sometimes, in the busiest of my waking moments, the pen, with which I am setting down the figures of immense sums to the credit of Uncle Samuel—the old gentleman for whom I labor in the large granite building in Wall Street—rests idly in my hand; and my eyes, wandering from the pages of the ledger before me, look through the window near my desk, above the opposite house-tops into the blue sky overhead, with its white clouds, like snowy vessels, sailing past toward those vast possessions of mine which lie so far away that I can only visit them in imagination. It is then that I dream dreams and see visions. Gentle reveries which fill my heart with peace, golden fancies which gild the weary hours with something akin to joy, and blessed memories which translate the past into an Arcadian present, then are mine. Then, too, I erect gorgeous castles in the air, and build chateaux in Spain, peopling them with the children of my brain.
                  I see, as I gaze above those brown walls opposite, what no one else in that room can see. I hear through the chimes of Trinity, as they fall upon my ears, what no one else in that room can hear. I know that "Uncle John," the senior clerk of the department, and who is at least a good quarter of a century older than I am, wonders, as he drops his chin upon his breast, and casts his eyes across the room at me, over the top of his spectacles, at what I am looking. Sometimes he will get down from his high chair, and, crossing to my window, will with me look up into the sky. But he never discovers anything, and will, after a little while, turn and go to his seat, shaking his head mysteriously at the other clerks, and, looking back at me, will tap significantly his forehead. As a rule he never says anything to me at these moments, but once he asked me if I would be kind enough to tell him at what I was gazing. I replied that I was watching my balloons go by. He wished to know if I had seen many pass. Yes, I answered, there is one passing now. So "Uncle John" wiped his spectacles, which he held in his hand, carefully with his silk handkerchief, and, putting them on, looked up into the sky. He failed, however, to perceive anything save, he said, what looked like a white cloud, though, as his sight was not very good, it might be the balloon of which I spoke. I assured him it was, and that it was going direct to Spain. So "Uncle John" drew a long sigh, and, saying it might be so, went back to his figures.
                  It is true that on these occasions the work on my desk does not progress very rapidly, for one cannot watch one's ships sail away for distant ports, gazing after them until they vanish in the distance, and hear the music of their bells, striking the hour—it is always eight bells to me, no matter what the true time may be—sink into silence, without neglecting less important affairs. But the head of our room—who must be, judging from his name and some characteristic traits which he possesses, a descendant of that early master of English song, who wrote— 
                        
                           "Gather ye rose-buds as ye may;
                           Old Time is still a-flying,
                           And this same flower that smiles to-day
                           To-morrow will be dying"—
                        
                      evidently sympathizes with me, and never disturbs my reveries by suggestions of a local character. I feel certain, too, that there is some of the old poet's poetry in his composition, and he must have inherited the garden from which his ancestor gathered the primrose, the daffodils, and the blossoms of which he so charmingly sung; for he always comes to the office, in these early spring days, wearing in his button-hole a cluster of the bluest of violets. If it be necessary that I should come back to the consideration of facts and figures, he has a delicate and pretty way of drawing my attention to my duties, without abruptly breaking in on my reveries. He will quietly approach my desk, and without speaking will lay on the book before me a bunch of violets, the perfume of which recalls me from my dreamings, and, though suggestive of my vanished Alice, also reminds me of the duties of the hour. So, leaving my white-winged vessels to pursue their course, requiring no chart or compass with which to guide them, I resume my pen to record the tonnage, the number of sailors, and the names of the captains, of the many vessels which daily leave for ports where no ships of my owning ever seek to enter.
                  But it is not while I am within these granite walls, or during these business hours, that my fairest visions come to me. When the hour of three has struck, and I take off, and hang on its accustomed peg in the wardrobe, my old clerical coat, smeared with the wipings of many pens and glossy with the wear of many years, and go forth into the warm sunshine of Wall Street, meeting, slowly creeping down, the shadow of Trinity spire, crowned with its shining cross, I feel that I am no longer a plodding government clerk, but a free, untrammeled man; and from that moment my musings assume a brighter and a tenderer tone. Not, though, until I reach my home do they shape themselves into words. My wife, Ruth, humors me in these my "freaks and fantasies," as she is pleased to term them, and, during the long twilights that follow summer days, and the longer nights of winter time, will, with the children clustered around her, listen hour after hour to my rambling talk, wherein truth and fiction are strangely woven together. The "might have been," with the "is" of the present, and the "was" of the past, are oftentimes so deftly blended into one harmonious whole, that neither she, with the proverbial clear-sightedness of her sex, nor I, with my knowledge of the truth itself, can separate the one from the other.
                  The vanished joys of my boyhood come back, the buried realities of my early manhood rise from their graves, and the desires and dreams of my heart, which never had birth, flutter, golden-winged, around me, and sing songs into mine ears which fill my breast with gladness.
                  When I recall that peerless creature Musidora, with her roses and diamonds; that sparkling maiden, Azelia, of the pearls and orange-flowers, either of whom might have been to me what Ruth now is; or, that other being, my pure and gentle Alice, who was, in the sight of Heaven if not of man, my bride, but who died years before I ever met Ruth, and lies buried in a quiet country churchyard in the shadow of the Catskills, it is like bringing forth a dusty scroll, long hidden in a secret drawer, and unrolling it to sight. There is to me no longer a past, no longer a might have been, but everything resolves itself into a present reality.
                  Ruth has clung to my arm so long, she knows my heart so well, that she is not vexed or annoyed by these outspoken dreamings of mine, wherein memory and fancy play fantastic tricks; but she sighs with my sighs, smiles with my smiles, and mingles her tears with mine, over the peerless Musidora, the sprightly Azelia, and the tender-eyed Alice, of long ago. Sometimes, though, she draws her chair nearer to me, and putting forth her hand clasps mine in hers. At times, too, during the pauses I make in my recitals, her voice will break forth in a little song, tender, sad, or merry, as will best accord with the tenor of my reverie, and the children, catching the motive from their mother, will join their silvery voices to hers. These songs—and this entitled "Primrose-Days," inscribed to—you know who—soothe and cheer me as I talk, and are suggestive of pleasant themes. 
                        
                           'Tis many a year since last we met—
                           Twenty years of changing weather;
                           And yet I never shall forget
                           The happy days we passed together.
                        
                        
                           And you were young, and more than fair,
                           And I was—well! I'm greatly altered;
                           There are gray hairs amid my hair,
                           But still my love has never faltered.
                        
                        
                           It was my first love—in its way
                           Somewhat Platonic in affection—
                           Which might have seen our wedding-day
                           If guided in the right direction.
                        
                        
                           But you were young, and I was young;
                           Our parents said that we were heedless,
                           And proved that Shakespeare wisely sung
                           About the course of love—'twas needless.
                        
                        
                        
                           But still, this feeling which I knew
                           When life was in its primrose season—
                           And it was May the whole year through,
                           Despite of almanacs and reason—
                        
                        
                           Has never changed, but still remains
                           The very same, perhaps 'tis stronger;
                           For love, 'tis said, like lemon-stains,
                           Gets brighter as it lasts the longer.
                        
                        
                           I know 'tis folly to recall
                           The hours we passed with one another,
                           Ere I was married to Miss Hall,
                           Or you'd become an anxious mother.
                        
                        
                           But why—this puzzles me!—at night
                           Should, in my dreams, you come to bless me,
                           When all day long, as is but right,
                           It is my wife who doth caress me?
                        
                        
                           Am I to live those days again,
                           In, so to speak, a second childhood,
                           When, free from life's dull care and pain,
                           I rambled with you through the wildwood?
                        
                        
                           No! precious golden days of youth,
                           You never can return to cheer me!
                           And—well, forgive the sober truth—
                           The days are best that now are near me.
                        
                     
                  
                  Under the influence of such songs as this my reveries assume shape and life. Why these visions should come to me I cannot tell, nor do I know when to expect them. Ruth, though, says that there is a certain tenderness in the tone of my voice, when about to recall vanished scenes and persons, which gives her the clew to my intentions, and causes her to hush the chatter of the children, to draw closely to my side, and listen to my rambling talk.
                  What these wandering words of mine are worth, whether they add a single grain to the pleasure of any one, I cannot tell; though Ruth says they lend a lustre to the past, and light with sunshine the path of the future. Others who, in the coming time, shall read these rhapsodies, will be better able to judge whether they be less fleeting than the flying clouds which I, from my well-worn desk, watch scudding across the sky.
               
               
                  CASTLE II.
                  MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER'S ARM-CHAIR.
                  IT was Sunday afternoon, and all day long the winds of March had been humming, as the dear old poet hath it, their parting song. The rain had been driven in fitful gusts against the window-panes, and the climbing vines and rose-bushes, broken from their trellises, had been swept around the corner of the cottage, and were beating wildly against the door, as if seeking to enter. The old apple-trees in the orchard creaked and groaned, and ever and anon a weakened branch would be twisted off and sent whirling to the ground. Fences that had withstood the fiercer blasts of mid-winter were laid low by this boisterous March wind, which, shifting to every quarter, beat upon them remorselessly. It seemed to be charged, too, with all manner of songs: sometimes it shouted forth pæans of victory, and again would wail dirges sad and dreary. Now it would whimper like a whipped school-boy, and then would bluster like a cowardly bully. Once, when it blew "great guns," the bricks of the chimney rattled down on the roof, and the house itself rocked in its embrace. Immediately thereafter it took a rest, and went to sleep; and so the heavens lighted up, and the children, with their noses pressed to the window-panes, watching the chips and blocks, from the carpenter's shop on the hill above the cottage, sweep past in the swollen road-side stream, thought it was going to "clear up," and said so to their mother, who was deeply interested in some goodly Lenten reading. They were, however, mistaken; for in a little while the wind awoke again, very cross, and more determined than ever to make a day of it. And so it did; for not until the sun went down and the rain ceased did the wind wind up its revels. I was lying on the lounge listening to the monotonous drip of the water from the overcharged eaves and overhanging trees, when the little ones uttered a cry of delight, and called to me to come to the window. I knew intuitively that they had descried that distant land wherein were built my Spanish castles.
                  Children oftener, perhaps, than their elders discover that fine country, though they may not be aware of the marvelous treasures it contains. To them, indeed, it is only a fairyland, gorgeous with all the colors of the rainbow, and teeming with toys and fruits and confectionery.
                  "Ah!" I exclaimed, as, going to the window, I looked westward and saw, under the lowering clouds, a lurid band of red following the line of the horizon; its brightness fading more and more as, spreading from its central point, it extended in either direction as far as the eye could reach—"it is, as I presumed, the illumination which nightly lights up the streets of that glorious city where all of my superfluous wealth is invested; where rises my stateliest chateau, within which dwells one who never walked on earth, but whom I call wife; and where, too, children who were never given hard lessons to learn sit in sunny rooms singing sweet songs."
                  "O, papa!" said Miss Em, a slim girl of thirteen years, "how I wish I were one of your children there instead of being one here! How nice it must be not to have lessons to get, and to be able to sing songs all day! Do, please, tell me more about them?"
                  The other little ones looked wistfully toward me, and their mother, closing her book, directed the eldest boy to put another block of wood on the fire. Immediately it blazed up in a cheerful manner, casting a warm glow upon the walls and ceiling, and making the room to appear more cozy and comfortable than ever.
                  My wife took the youngling of the flock upon her lap, another stretched himself on the rug at her feet, and a third sought Miss Em's protecting arms. Jeannie, Ruth's sister, stood at the window, half-hidden in the folds of the heavy curtain, watching for the coming of her lover, while I seated myself in the old arm-chair, wherein my great-grandfather, a hundred years ago, had sat and watched, as now I did, the fading light in the western sky.
                  "It is thirty years," I said, "since the old man—then close upon a hundred years of age—died; but I well remember, though a mere lad myself at the time, how, seated in this chair,"—an antique mahogany affair, with carved back, an eagle's twisted beak at the end of each arm, and eagle's claws grasping a ball at its forelegs,—"he would, in the gathering twilight, tell us children, who, clambering around him, would seat ourselves on his knees, or, climbing up the back of the old chair, would stand there smoothing back from his forehead with our hands his long white hair, of his many adventures in foreign lands, of his shipwrecks on lonely islands, and his fearful encounters with monsters of the deep. But we liked best to hear him tell of his own childhood, when he, a little boy, used to play, as we then did, around his great-grandfather's knees; and this great-great-great-great-grandfather of ours was the first of the name who was born in this country,—about the year 1650,—his father, Tristram, having come over from England in 1642. All this seemed so very wonderful and strange to us, and carried us so far back into the past, that we never tired of hearing him tell of those days, and repeat, over and over again to us, the self-same stories which his great-grandfather had told to him.
                  "I have often thought," I continued after a little pause, "that this old arm-chair which I inherit, and in which so many generations of my family have sat, must have caught, in some way, the peculiar characteristics of my race. I have observed that, when seated in it, my thoughts are generally of a retrospective nature. Scenes and persons of long ago, rather than those of to-day, present themselves before me. Dead and buried memories are resurrected, withered flowers bloom again, the melodies of forgotten songs are heard once more, and visions so life-like that I know they must be the reflections of actual scenes rise before me. Often, too, while seated in this chair, I feel that I am not the sole occupant of it: the ghosts of those whose descendant I am, who, in bygone years, have therein sat, are seated there with me. Their arms are around me, their hands are clasped in mine, and their lips meet mine in kisses. At such times, though peace fills my heart, yet tears will rise to my eyes as on the wings of tradition I am carried back through the centuries behind me. The good and valiant men, the fair and noble women, who, for generations past, have made our house honored, come and stand before me. Tristram, and James, and Ebenezer, and the Alexanders, and the Williams; and Deborah, and Ruth, and Eunice, and Merab, and Martha, and the Marys—all appear, those of olden times, in the quaint garb of the Quakers; but those of more modern dates in less formal and more worldly attire. Each one has a tale to tell, new to me but old to them, and sad or merry as the case may be.
                  "I speak of this chair, my dear," I went on, "as my great-grandfather's; though in reality it originally belonged to the founder of the family in this country, who brought it to Boston from England, and afterward, in 1660, carried it with him to Nantucket, where it remained until 1783, when my great-grandfather removed, with other persons from the Island, to found the present city of Hudson, in this State. My earliest recollection of this famous chair is in connection with my great-grandfather. It was his especial chair, and when he was present no one else presumed to occupy it. If he found any one seated in it though, he would not allow the person therein to resign it to him.
                  "I can recall him now, seated composedly in it, a cheerful look on his face, and always a kind word ready on his lips. He was very companionable with children, who all took most kindly to him. He was never annoyed, as many old persons are apt to be, by the noisy mirth of the little ones. He had a faculty of sympathizing with their griefs and joys, which endeared him tenderly to them. He used to join with us in our plays, and many a time have I pitched guineas—he kept a small canvas-bag well filled with them in his writing-desk—with him, at a steel table-fork set up on the floor across the room! I must have won hundreds of dollars of him in an afternoon; but for some good reason, doubtless,—I cannot recall what it was now,—I always allowed the guineas, after we had finished our game, to be put back into the canvas-bag and replaced within the desk.
                  "He was close on to ninety years of age when, as my memory goes back, I first can recall him to mind. I was then three or four years old, and the occasion which so impressed him on my memory was his giving me my first sled. He also gave me shortly afterward my first pair of boots and my first skates,—three events in a boy's life that he rarely forgets." Here my little boy kicked off his boots and stood them up beside the fire-place.
                  "For nearly ten years thereafter my great-grandfather and myself were closely associated, and became the warmest of friends. He kept my pockets supplied with pennies, and on Christmas Eve a silver dollar from his purse always found its way into my stocking. I have one of those silver dollars now; it has a hole in it, and the ribbon which he run through it so as to hang it around my neck is still unbroken."
                  Thereupon Miss Em exclaimed that she wished she had so kind a great-grandfather.
                  "Poor girl!" I said; "you never knew what it was to have even a grandfather, letting alone a great-grandfather, for they all died before you were born. The nearest to a grandfather of any one you ever knew was our dear old friend the General, who died a few months ago, and is buried in the cemetery at Sing Sing. There was something in the manner of the General and in his kindly nature which, when he used to visit us and you little ones hung around him, reminded me very much of my great-grandfather. Like him, he was a Christian and an honest man, and when called to go hence he was not found unprepared. He was crowned with years and with honors. He had fought the good fight under the banner of the cross, and won the perfect victory."
                  This allusion to our good friend the General brought tears to the eyes of the children, and caused my wife and Jeannie to look quite sad.
                  After a little pause I said, pointing to the portrait of my great-grandfather hanging on the wall, "It is a good likeness of the old man as I remember him; and it was painted as early as 1824 by Paradise, one of the early members of the Academy of Design, when my great-grandfather was over eighty years of age. He is represented wearing a white neckerchief,—and I remember it was his daughter's (my grandmother) special duty to tie in a proper bow-knot that neck-tie,—a buff waist coat, and a dark-blue coat. He holds in his hand the cane which in my most juvenile days I employed as a horse to carry me around the rooms; and he is seated in this chair wherein I have so many dreams and reveries, and to which, as a family shrine, the spirits of departed generations come. Looking at these little ones around me, my dear, I can trace in their young faces many marked resemblances to those of their race long since passed from earth, but who still in visions appear to me when seated in this family chair."
                  It is little wonder, therefore, as Ruth says, since such associations belong to this chair, and so many departed spirits delight in occupying it, that when seated therein I should see the heads of my family passing in solemn procession before me. They come, and uttering words of admonition, of advice, and encouragement, stop for a moment, and then silently and swiftly glide away. But the spirit of my great-grandfather lingers the longest by me, and when he leaves me, smiles as in the old days, and utters in the well-remembered voice the words which no one on earth utters now to me, because of these gray hairs and this wrinkled brow, "My boy, my boy, good-night!"
                  Ruth draws near to my side, and laying her hand gently on my arm, looks up lovingly into my face. The little ones creep up to kiss me good-night; and though I know I shall never be a boy again, I feel that it is better, far better to be what I am—a husband and a father.
               
               
                  
                  CASTLE III.
                  THE PEERLESS MUSIDORA.
                  UNCLE JOHN came to my desk the other day, and, tapping me on the shoulder, asked, in his mild, quiet way, if I would be kind enough to tell him what I was doing.
                  "Not that I desire," he said, apologetically, "to be rude or inquisitive; but it has struck me, when, looking up from my work during the past hour, I have glanced at you, as if you were engaged in some pleasant occupation. I knew you could not be watching your balloons go by, for your eyes were bent upon your papers, and yet you did not seem to be studying them. I confess, too, that for a while I thought you were asleep, and I said to myself that yours must be a very easy conscience to allow you to slumber over your accounts, and, you, too, so far behindhand with them. But I soon discovered that you were not asleep, and have ever since been puzzling my poor old head with conjectures as to what was occupying your attention. Now, will you please to tell me what you were doing?"
                  "Certainly," I replied, "I was travelling."
                  "Travelling!" echoed Uncle John, in a tone of voice which implied an additional mystification; "travelling, eh?" he repeated, this time interrogatively.
                  "Yes," I answered.
                  "Where?" he asked.
                  "Uncle John," I said, "do you see this pile of papers?" placing my hand on them.
                  "Yes," he replied, "I had them at my desk this morning. They are manifests, and no vessel can clear from port without her manifest being duly signed and counter-signed by the proper officers."
                  "You are mistaken, Uncle John," I said; "those are mere red-tape formalities, which I can cut as easily as"—and here I flourished my eraser—"as"—
                  "As easily," interrupted Uncle John, drawing back a pace or two, "as you just came to cutting off the end of my nose."
                  "I beg your pardon," I said, returning the eraser to its case, "but, as I was about to say, I can myself clear any vessel from this port without either the owner or any custom-house officer being the wiser for it. I should not mind, either, sailing without a manifest."
                  "You would be running a great risk by so doing," said Uncle John, "and make your vessel liable to seizure and confiscation."
                  "Ah!" I exclaimed, "that is an old fogy notion. The fact is, Uncle John, that I have cleared this afternoon no less than half a dozen vessels."
                  Uncle John looked at me over his spectacles as if he half doubted my word, and then, taking up the papers on my desk, carefully examined them to see if they possessed the proper signatures and stamps for the clearance of their respective vessels. Not discovering them, he shook his head sadly, and turned to go to his seat.
                  "Uncle John," I said, placing my hand on his arm and gently detaining him, "here is the manifest of the Spanish brig, Bella Donna, Don Juan Fernandez, master. I sailed on her this afternoon, going direct to my castles in Spain. The sea was smooth, the breeze was fair, the sky was clear, and the air balmy and soft. We made a good run, in a little less than no time, as I think you will find it recorded in the log-book. A few glasses of sherry, made from the grapes which grow in my vineyards in Xeres, and a handful of olives, raised in the orchard on my Spanish estate, sufficed for my bodily wants. By the way, Uncle John, try an olive or two," and I drew several from my pocket, and offered them to him.
                  "I think one will do," said Uncle John, as he took it and bit into it.
                  Uncle John, I could see, was not fond of olives.
                  "Olives, Uncle John," I said, "especially pickled olives, are the finest condiments in the world. But they are greatly improved by being carried in the trowsers pocket for three or four days, until they become softened, or macerated, as my old friend, the Professor, hath it."
                  Uncle John said, however, that his taste did not incline that way, and that for his part he would as lief eat green plums as pickled olives.
                  "But," said Uncle John, "pray tell me how you reached your Spanish estates."
                  "As I approached," I replied, "the music of guitars fell on mine ears. A troupe of dancing girls, with castanets, and tinkling bells upon their ankles, and flirting their short dresses in the movements of the dance, came forth to meet me. Banners more beautiful than the sunburst of Ireland, the lilies of France, or the flag of the Union, waved from every turret of my castle. The drawbridge was lowered, and, as I passed across it, my serfs and vassals, gorgeously appareled, arrayed on either hand, received me with shouts of welcome."
                  "It must have been a very fine affair," said Uncle John, stroking his chin with his hand, "and equal to a review by the Mayor of the Seventh Regiment in the Park on the Fourth of July."
                  "As I passed up the marble stairway, leading to the grand hall, with its sparkling fountains, Moorish in its architecture, and suggestive of the Alhambra, to where the peerless Musidora, magnificent in her diamonds, stood ready to greet me, a thousand birds broke forth in song, and a thousand distinct perfumes floated in the air."
                  "Which must," said Uncle John, "have been rather overpowering. But who, by the way, is Musidora? Is your wife acquainted with her?"
                  "Uncle John," I replied, "I knew Musidora long before I ever met my wife. She was the daughter of old Carbon, who owned a diamond washing in Golconda, and had more money laid away in bonds and mortgages than would buy Wall Street from Trinity Church down to the ferry."
                  "He must have been quite wealthy," said Uncle John.
                  "He was," I replied, "but his greatest wealth was in his daughter,—this woman with little heart but surpassing beauty. She was a princess in her way, and held her court right royally, surrounded by scores of gallant gentlemen, who felt it an honor to do her lightest bidding. She had wealth greater than she could use, and she wore more diamonds than Tiffany ever imported."
                  "Do you know," asked Uncle John, in a statistical tone of voice, "the amount of diamonds imported by that house in the course of even one year?"
                  "I do not," I replied, "know exactly, nor do I care to know; but I do know that the diamonds worn by Musidora were almost fabulous in their amount, and with her stately Juno-like form, her dark velvet robes, set off with old lace obtained in the Old World at an extravagant price from some dead queen's wardrobe, and her flashing eyes, more brilliant than the diamonds themselves, she could wear them imperially, and without being overshadowed by their magnificence. One looked at Musidora before noticing her diamonds. Her face was indeed glorious, and in her smile there lurked a power which enchanted the luckless wight on whom it fell, so that he became her slave and follower forever. And this was so with me."
                  "Ah! Musidora," I exclaimed, "you have much for which to answer. Your smiles lured me from the memory of my earliest love. You, with your diamonds and your roses, made me forget Azelia with her simple pearls and orange-blossoms. You charmed me, like a serpent, with your eyes, and beguiled me, with your soft, low voice, from the narrow path in which I was walking. I plucked roses and carnations for you, and crushed, heedlessly, the lilies of the valley and the violets under foot. For your sake, Musidora, I became a dreamer and a poet; I built castles in the air; I blew bubbles which carried on their rounded forms the hues of the rainbow, and, breaking, passed into nothingness. Your presence was as Paradise, your absence as Purgatory. But you trod upon my heart, Musidora, you cast my love aside like a withered flower, and built up between us an impassable barrier."
                  "Then why," asked Uncle John, in a wondering sort of way, "did you visit her to-day?"
                  "Uncle John," I said, impressively, laying my hand upon his shoulder, and looking straight into his honest, though dimmed, old eyes, "there are things in this life of which even you, in your deepest philosophy, do not dream, and this concerning Musidora is one of them."
                  "It must be so," he replied; "but will you oblige me by telling me if Musidora is living or not?"
                  "Musidora, Uncle John," I answered, "like the King, never dies. Nor do I need to visit my stateliest castle in Spain to see her. As I go up and down Fifth Avenue, or drive in the Central Park, or listen to the opera, Musidora in all her youth and beauty and diamonds, as she was more than twenty years ago, meets my sight. It is true she is not my Musidora, nor has she any knowledge of me. But she draws, as I was drawn, a throng of youths in her train, and she dazzles them, as I was dazzled by her diamonds. For aught I know, however, the identical Musidora, whom I knew in the lush days of my youth, may still reign a belle in the circle where she dwells. If I should ever encounter her I am certain I should recognize her, and though the old love I bore her—which once lay smouldering in my heart—long since burned itself to ashes, which have been scattered broadcast over many hearts,—ashes is a good fertilizer, Uncle John"—Uncle John nodded,—"I could not see her without a pang"—
                  Uncle John looked into my face inquiringly.
                  "A pang," I repeated, "of pity for her that she had lost so good a husband as I, judging from my wife's happiness, would have made her, and a smile that I had gained, through her scorning, so dear and loving a woman for a wife as I have gained. And now, Uncle John," I added, after a pause, during which he had taken the opportunity of wiping his spectacles with his handkerchief, "how does this strike you?"
                  Thereupon Uncle John, placing his glasses on his nose, and looking steadily at me, replied, that he thought it one of the most remarkable cases of which he had ever heard. And then, more than ever perplexed and wondering, he went back to his desk.
               
               
                  
                  CASTLE IV.
                  THE FAIR AZELIA.
                  IT is many years—I think about twenty-five—since I built my first castle in Spain. It was a magnificent structure, and resembled in many respects the one which Cole, in the second of his series of pictures, entitled the "Voyage of Life," so skillfully erected in mid-heaven. I was a young man then, and had hopes which have never yet been realized. Often, though, at the close of these mild spring days, when I enter my little cottage, where Ruth and the children welcome me with kisses and loving words, I feel that the time is close at hand when many of my youthful desires will be consummated; though as yet much is vague and undefined.
                  Looking back into the past I recall with pride and satisfaction the number and grandeur of the castles I have raised. I remember, too, with tenderness and thanksgiving the many beautiful women who have from time to time inhabited them, and departing, have left as souvenirs their portraits on the walls of memory. Not a few of them have been apotheosized and become blessed saints to me for evermore.
                  When, as I sometimes do, I steal quietly from my desk at midday, and, seeking the open door of Trinity, pass into its sacred precincts, just as the organ peals forth the Te Deum of praise, I sink down upon the nearest hassock, and that peace which passeth all understanding comes over me. When, the service ended, I rise, and see in the holy women whose figures are emblazoned on the windows the semblances of some of those fair beings who in the days of long ago held court within the walls of my fairest castles, I recognize that sweet and pure maiden, Azelia of the pearls, and that still sweeter and purer maiden, Alice, the bride of my soul.
                  It is years since Azelia in her purity and loveliness walked beside me; years since I clasped her hand or listened to the tones of her voice; and yet I can recall the time when to be out of her presence was banishment, and my only joy was to be near her. She to me was more than woman ere again can be, and yet, in all the years wherein we two were cast together, I never told her of the love I bore her. Whether she ever divined it or not I cannot tell. I only know that she said, "My coming cast a sunshine and my going left a shadow on her path."
                  "Why then," asked my wife, laying her hand tenderly on my arm, and heaving a little sigh, "did you not marry her?"
                  "My dear," I replied, "in the romantic and chivalrous days of my youth, before I had grown selfish and worldly, before I weighed hearts and money against each other in a balance, but when I did weigh friendship against love, there was one dearer than a brother to me who equally with me loved Azelia. It was a dark hour to me, Ruth, when he, in the gathering twilight of a summer day, as we walked together within sight of the Catskills, behind which the sun had just gone down, told me of his love for Azelia. There were reasons, which even now I cannot give, why I felt very tenderly for my friend. I knew, too, that he had wealth, while I had none, and that she, reared in all the luxury of a Southern home, would miss, as the wife of a poor man, the more than simple comforts to which she had been accustomed."
                  "You did not know," said my wife, "how much a woman would resign for one she loved."
                  "True, my dear," I replied, "I did not then, but you have shown me by your faithfulness and love through these many years how much a true woman will resign and endure for the sake of one whom she devotedly loves. But, feeling as I then did, you could not deem it strange if, pressing his hand, I told him, as I did, that she was worthy of his love, and that he could find no better mate."
                  "And they were married?" asked my wife.
                  "They were," I replied, "and I have never seen either of them since. And yet I often ask myself, loving Azelia as I did,—as earnestly, I believe, as my friend loved her,—whether she is any happier with him than she would have been with me. I had a distrust of myself in those days as to my power to make a woman happy, and I felt that he would prove a better husband than I could hope to be. Indulged as I had been as a youth, and accustomed to having my own way, I feared that I might play the tyrant, and bring more tears than smiles to Azelia's cheeks. And because I loved her so well I feared to risk her happiness in my keeping."
                  "Is she living now?" asked my wife, with a tremulous voice.
                  "Yes," I answered, "and though her pleasant Southern home was laid waste in Sherman's victorious march; and the orange-trees, with the blossoms of which she used to crown her brow in the years of her girlhood, were destroyed; and her husband, fighting for a wrong cause, lost an arm, yet they have managed, I hear, to rear on the ruins of their old home a roof for their household gods, and to see again the orange, the magnolia, and the palm flourishing around them."
                  "Would you not," asked Ruth, "like to see Azelia again?"
                  "No," I replied; "the picture which I retain of her in my memory is too fair and precious in its character—even, perhaps, idealized in some of its tenderer expressions, and enriched with a halo which only the purest love could give it—for me, in these latter days, to desire to look on that which might prove a complete disillusion and destruction of what now to me is simply a sweet memory and a thoughtful 'might have been.' The years which have brought gray hairs and wrinkles to me have not, I fear, passed over Azelia less indulgently. When last I saw her she was fairer than the lily, sweeter than the orange-flower, and more modest than the violet. Have years, think you with the increasing cares of wife and mother-hood, added to or taken from these delicious qualities? No, my dear, I do not want to see Azelia with these added years upon her head. Not until in the hereafter I shall meet her purified from all earthly taint, and wearing the white robes of righteousness, do I desire to look upon her face or walk beside her as in days of yore. The book of the past is closed forever upon earth, and though, gazing toward my Western possessions, I may behold Azelia presiding in one of my fairest castles, ready to welcome me with her sweetest smiles and tenderest words,—such smiles and words as I shall never see and hear again,—it can be only as a dream and a vision, which disappeareth like the mist before the morning sun."
                  My wife drew nearer to me as I spake, and, when I ceased, placed her hand within mine own, and looked fondly into my face. I bent over and kissed her, and as I did so the roseate light faded out in the western sky, my fairest castle crumbled and disappeared, and the glittering stars of evening peeped one by one into the window and watched us two seated there in love and silence.
               
               
                  
                  CASTLE V.
                  MY CHILDREN'S UTOPIA.
                  MY little ones called to me the other morning to look out of the eastern window and see their chateaux d'Espagne. It was just before sunrise, and stretching along the horizon was a line of roseate-hued clouds, fantastic in form, and more ethereal than the smoke which rises from meerschaum pipes. Although the little ones called them chateaux, they could scarcely be dignified by such title, as they more resembled the House which Jack built, or the pretty little parlor into which the polite spider invited the fly to walk.
                  I said as much to the little ones, but they replied that, as I was in bed, I could not discern them clearly, and, as I simply observed the reflection of the clouds in the mirror opposite the foot of my couch, it may have been that I was in error. It may even have been that my eyes were still clogged with sleep, and I only saw as through a glass, darkly.
                  Children, I have observed, look toward the east for their possessions, while their elders invariably turn their eyes westward. The one sees them only at sunrise, the other at sunset. The morning stars sing together in glory for the first, the evening stars chant sad dirges for the last. The former oftener see the Star of Bethlehem, but the latter oftener the rainbow of promise. The little ones dream of the future, their seniors of the past. Their castles are just rising, ours are crumbling into dust. A child's Utopia is very different from that of a grown person's; as a rule, too, it is divided into boys' and girls' quarters, though there is a portion of the estate common to them both.
                  After the sun had risen, and the beautiful chateaux which my children possessed had disappeared from sight, they climbed upon my bed, and enthroning themselves amidst the pillows,—the extra pillows with lace borders, which Ruth keeps more for show than use,—they severally told me of their Utopian possessions.
                  "Mine," said Miss Em, who, being the eldest, was permitted to speak first, "is a lovely cottage, with honey-suckles and roses clambering all over it, and a pond in the garden with white swans swimming to and fro. Birds of beautiful plumage and sweetest voices sing all day long from the peach and nectarine and plum trees which grow about the house, and ring-doves coo around their cots. Arbors with grapes—especially the large white Malaga grape—are very numerous, and within them, when the sun shines warmly, I go and sit, and eat fruit and read nice story-books. Sometimes I have syllabubs and floating islands and jellies and ice-cream, and in the early morning, before it gets very warm, I go to the lawn wearing a jockey-hat and a short dress and high laced boots, to play croquet. Then I go into the cottage and play beautiful tunes on the piano,—I don't have to practice any, for somehow I know everything without having to study,—and then I sing some, and after that I dress dolls for little Mary."
                  Here little Mary opened her eyes widely, as if she hadn't yet seen it done.
                  "And then," continued Miss Em, "I dance, and read more story books."
                  "Well, is this all you do in Utopia?" I asked.
                  "Yes, pretty much," she answered, "except that sometimes I go a-strawberrying, and take walks in the woods, and look for wild flowers, and gather mosses."
                  "After all," I said, "that is not a very satisfactory life to lead: don't you often get tired of it?"
                  "No," she replied, "not often; but when I do I go to sleep."
                  
                  "Ah!" I exclaimed, "there may be something in that. Going to sleep is not such a bad thing to do, especially after everything else in the way of enjoyment fails. And now, Master Will, what have you to say?"
                  "Well, I live on an island," said Will, "and I have one little black boy, whom I named Saturday, because I like Saturdays, and wish they would run all through the week. And he picks up my ball for me when I throw it, and gets my kite up in the air, and cracks my walnuts for me, and does errands for me generally."
                  "Why, you must be pretty lazy when you are in Utopia," I said.
                  "Yes," he replied, "I am. I don't go to school; I don't study any lessons; I make mud pies; I don't wash my hands; I tear my trowsers whenever I please; I wade in the water and get my feet wet just as much as I want to; I eat nothing but pound-cake, with frosting on it, and sweet-meats sometimes; and I never take any medicine; and I'm never sick; and I never have a toothache, nor the"—
                  "Never mind," I interrupted, "about that other ache—go on."
                  "I own a hand-organ and a monkey; and always have plenty of five-cent pieces in my pockets, and lots of marbles and tops, and a four-bladed knife; and I go to the circus whenever I like; and I don't go to bed until nine o'clock; and I don't get up in the morning until after breakfast."
                  "Well," I said, "that is certainly a pretty life to lead. I am surprised, my son, to hear you talk in this way. Your manner of living in Utopia is highly discreditable, and I shall deem it necessary to put a stop to it."
                  Master Will was evidently taken aback by my serious manner, and said, in excuse, that he was only funning, and he was just as good a boy in Utopia as he was at home. Which, after all, is not saying a great deal.
                  "And now, Miss Mary," I said, "we will hear from you."
                  This young lady is rather sly and quick, and had evidently dently taken warning from her brother's experience. So she started off with saying that her chief occupation in Utopia was going to Sunday-school, and keeping her hands clean and her hair smooth. After which preliminary she branched off in this wise: "I cut out paper dolls, and eat candies—I like peppermints best, and I wish papa would bring some home for me to-night. I eat peanuts, too, and I wish I had some now; and I want a wax doll on my birthday, with eyes that open and shut, and I don't want to have to take care of the baby; I pick flowers and currants, and find eggs in the barn; and I study spelling, and make sums on the slate, and draw pictures with a red lead-pencil, and I help mamma sew, and that's all I do."
                  This report was so much better than that of either of the others, that I commended the little girl, and promised her that she should have a wax doll on her birthday. Then I asked the baby-boy what he had to say, and all that he answered was, "Oranges;" which, of course, I assured him he should have.
                  "Now," I said, "listen to the Utopia of my boyhood. It is a spot where the hours of play, study, and sleep are about equally divided; for one cannot enjoy play unless one has been studying, and one can neither study nor play unless one had been strengthened by sleep. Santa Claus makes this Utopia his headquarters, and there it is Christmas or Thanksgiving Day, more or less, all the year round. Just around every corner, too, an old woman sits at a stand, where she sells fruits, and nuts, and candies for a thank you. Toy-shops and book-stores are in every block, and nice little ponies, with long tails and manes, stand already saddled and bridled, at almost every post along the streets, for good little boys and girls to get upon and ride. It is a noteworthy fact, however, that they always manage to throw over their heads, upon the soft sward, any naughty child who refuses to learn definitions or the multiplication table, and the smart little boys call this act of the pony's a sum in subtraction.
                  
                  "The wind is always favorable here for flying kites, and marble and ball playing are always in season. If one wants to skate or ride down hill on a sleigh, it is always practicable; and so, too, is boating and swimming. Fruits of all kinds grow here in perfection; and as for going nutting in the woods it is the easiest thing to do imaginable. Bird-nesting is not, however, so available, and seldom do any kind-hearted boys indulge in it. Fourth of July happens several times in the year, and the display of fire-works on these occasions is immense. Every hydrant runs with iced lemonade, and tarts and mince-pies may almost be said—so plentiful are they—to grow on every bush. Magnificent wax dolls, dressed in the height of the fashion, with chignons a foot long, sit all day on satin sofas and receive calls. Milliners take great pleasure in having little girls come into their 'establishments' just to 'try on' their newest and prettiest bonnets. Jewelers like to present them with diamond rings, and pearl necklaces, and gold bracelets, and ear-rings, and brooches, and all kinds of costly jewels. Confectioners fill their satchels with bonbons; the dry-goods men—especially the Stewart of Utopia—send home to them patterns of silk dresses; the furriers cover them with costly furs; and the bouquet man gives each one of them every morning a magnificent bouquet of choice flowers. Armies of wooden soldiers march to and fro every Saturday, and fight bloodless battles wherein both sides are victorious. School 'keeps in' during the morning, but lets out' all the afternoon. Church 'holds,' however, twice every Sunday, but the sermons are so short that no one ever gets a chance to go to sleep. As to amusements, they 'come off' six days in each week, and they are of the most entertaining character. Barnum has a museum there, but it is conducted on much better principles than the one he keeps in the city. Nice arm-chairs are placed about the doors of the blacksmiths' shops, so that little boys tired with play can sit down comfortably and watch the big smith beat the red-hot iron into horseshoes, and then nail them fast to the horses' hoofs. This last is a very delightful spot to visit. Carpenters' shops are always open in Utopia to good boys, and edged tools of every kind are kept sharp on purpose for them to use. Painters, too, keep pots of paint—especially red paint—with brushed in them, for boys to paint anything they like—fences or stable doors—with.
                  "In short, the number of enjoyable sights and scenes in Utopia is almost marvelous; and I have often thought, seated at my desk in the 'receipt of customs,' watching the boys loitering through Wall Street, and stopping to gaze through the windows of the money-changers at the piles of gold and silver coin displayed therein, that I would like to be a boy again, if only for the purpose of visiting once more that Utopia of childhood where so many of my earlier years were passed."
                  When I asked Uncle John if he would like to be a boy again, he replied that he thought he was a little too old for it; and when I added, "and go with me to Utopia?" he answered that that was a port of which he knew nothing, and that no manifest of any vessel had ever gone through his hands with a clearance for that place, and he did not believe it was down in any chart or survey.
                  And I think Uncle John is correct.
               
               
                  
                  CASTLE VI.
                  UNCLE JOHN.
                  ALTHOUGH only a Government clerk, with a salary which would bear a considerable increase without even then making me proud and ostentatious, I yet feel rich in many things wherein men better paid than I are poor. With them, however, I would not exchange desks if it were necessary also to exchange individualities. Greenbacks, though of the largest denomination, could not outweigh the handful of orange-blossoms or violets, the perfume of which carries me back to the sunny days of youth, where I meet once more in castles whereon the sun ever shines the fair Azelia and the sainted Alice.
                  I doubt whether the Collector of the Port himself owns as many fine castles in Spain as I do. His couch of late, I know, has not been one composed altogether of roses—a good many thorns have been mingled with it; and it may be, as a compensation for the trials which have been his, that in his leisure moments—though, come to think, I do not imagine he has recently seen many such moments—he may have erected a gorgeous palace or two in Spain, at the doors of which no investigating committee ever comes, or applicants for office seek to enter, where no dogs bark, and Tray, Blanche, and Sweetheart content themselves with merry gambols in the court-yard of the palace. Its eastern windows doubtless command fine views of the Cats-kills, and the clear waters of the Popacton, well filled with trout, wind southward through its grounds. I would not, however, even under these favoring circumstances, care to change places with the Collector. I would not assume his duties and responsibilities, his annoyances and trials, for all the money in the Treasury of the United States.
                  Uncle John, who is quite modest in regard to his clerical abilities, said when he heard me make the above remark, that though he did not feel himself to be equal to sustaining the position of Collector of the Port for a lengthened period, yet he would be willing to accept the office on the conditions I named for one day.
                  "You would not be able, Uncle John," I said, "to endure it even for that time. You would be making too much money, Uncle John, and the newspapers throughout the country would so attack you for it that their slanders would break your heart; and then, how, I would like to know, Uncle John, would the work in this office go on without you? Moreover, Uncle John, not contented with knowing that the press abused and misrepresented you in every possible way, some of your enemies—you would have them by the hundreds then, Uncle John, though you may not have one now—would cut these articles from the papers and send them to your wife and children, so that they might learn that you, the kind husband and indulgent father, whom they had loved and respected for so many years, was after all little better than a swindler and thief."
                  Uncle John was quite startled at this view of the case, and said that doubtless it would be so; and he hoped, looking timidly at me over his spectacles, as if he feared such a thing might come to pass, that I would not mention his remark to any one outside of the office!
                  "Certainly, Uncle John," I replied; "and I think that you now will agree with me in declaring that you would not care to hold an important official position for all the money in the Treasury."
                  To this Uncle John, much relieved, assented.
                  "Few men who have much wealth, Uncle John," I said, "are apt to own many Spanish castles, or possess any amount of property in Utopia. The largest proprietors in those regions never have any trouble in collecting the interest on their bonds and mortgages, since there is none to collect. Every one owns his own castles there, and only he or his dearest friends occupy them. The more houses one owns on Fifth Avenue, the less prospect one has of being the proprietor of a Spanish castle."
                  "Pray," asked Uncle John, "of how many Spanish castles are you the owner?"
                  "I have not," I replied, "the slightest idea, though the number must be very great, for I have been investing in that kind of property ever since I was a lad."
                  "It is a little curious," said Uncle John, "that I possess no castles in Spain."
                  "It would be, certainly," I said, "if it were so; but it is a singular circumstance that a man may live to be as old as you are, and yet never discover the fact that he has vast possessions in the West, containing the most magnificent of castles, and peopled with the fairest visions of his boyhood."
                  Thereupon Uncle John, taking off his spectacles, rubbed them with his red silk handkerchief, and then, with a thoughtful look upon his face, asked me if I had ever encountered in Utopia a young woman named Minerva?
                  "Minerva!" I echoed, "Minerva! I think I have; a fair young person, isn't she, about nineteen years of age I should judge; with light hair and blue eyes, and dressed in a plain, though neat calico gown, and having a low soft voice?"
                  "Yes!" exclaimed Uncle John, his eyes brightening, and a tinge of color coming to his faded cheeks. "Yes, that is her portrait as she looked the last time I saw her; but that was many years ago, and," sighing, "I lost sight of her somehow after I came to the city, and had almost forgotten, indeed, that she ever lived. She was my sweetheart when I was a young man; but after I came here, she moved out West somewhere with her parents, and so we drifted very far apart, and never, never met again!"
                  "Uncle John," I said, taking his hand, "here are some verses I wrote the other day, which, though not addressed to Minerva, are none the less applicable to your case." Whereupon I handed to him—
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              FAN AND I.
                              
                                 Fan and I were youthful lovers—
                                 Many and many a year ago!
                                 And the brightest cloud that over us hovers
                                 But dimly reflects the roseate glow
                                 Which lighted the twilights of long ago.
                              
                              
                                 Fan was a little blue-eyed maiden,
                                 And I was a rosy-cheeked boy of nine:
                                 Her heart with sorrow Time had not laden,
                                 And brief was the grief that weighed on mine
                                 When she was but eight and I but nine.
                              
                              
                                 Fan had lips like red twin cherries—
                                 The prettiest lips in the world to kiss!
                                 They were just the color of ripe strawberries,
                                 And life for me had no sweeter bliss
                                 Than I found in her morning and evening kiss.
                              
                              
                                 When the days were long in the sunny summer,
                                 And the berries ripe and the flowers in bloom,
                                 Under her window, an early comer,
                                 I wandered with her 'till the twilight gloom,
                                 Gathering berries and flowers in bloom.
                              
                              
                                 Sometimes we sought the pleasant valley,
                                 Where we waded, knee-deep, in the running brook,
                                 Seeking for lilies that loved to dally,
                                 Half-hidden from sight in a shady nook:
                                 And we lingered all day by that running brook.
                              
                              
                                 For two swift years we played together,
                                 'Till I was eleven and Fan was ten:
                                 And then came a season of stormy weather,
                                 And I never saw little Fan again:
                                 And the years that have passed since then are ten.
                              
                              
                                 They said she had gone to live in the city;
                                 But whether 'twere true I do not know.
                                 
                                 At any rate, 'twas a very great pity
                                 Without kissing ME that Fan should go,
                                 And that whither she went I never did know.
                              
                              
                                 If Fan is now living she's quite a woman;
                                 And, doubtless, is blest with another beau;
                                 But, I candidly think, there can be no man
                                 Whose love is as true as the love I know
                                 Is still treasured for her by her earlier beau.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  "Minerva," I said, after he had read the verses, and brushed a teardrop from his cheek, "lives in one of the most beautiful castles in Spain, and, if I am not greatly mistaken, the title-deeds of it are in your name."
                  Uncle John squeezed my hand responsively, and said he hoped it was so. "Indeed," he added, "I think that there can be no doubt of it. When I lost my fortune years ago some one—I have forgotten who—told me, I remember, that I might just as well have invested my money in Spanish castles as in what I had. I should not be at all surprised now if, unbeknown to me, some portion of my funds was at that time appropriated to the purchase of Spanish estates."
                  "You may rest assured, Uncle John," I said, "that it was. And now," I added, "as you and I are Spanish proprietors I will, some fine day, when the sky is blue, the clouds fleecy, and the breeze blows softly to the west, accompany you to that fair castle, where Minerva in all her youth and simplicity presides."
                  Uncle John thought, however, that, as this was to be their first meeting in many years, it would be as well for me not to be present, and suggested that I stop to see Musidora. And I, assenting, Uncle John, with a brisker step than I had ever known him to employ, and his face smoothed of sundry wrinkles, went back, humming an olden melody and cheery as a cricket, to his desk.
               
               
                  CASTLE VII.
                  MY LOST ALICE.
                  ONE of my finest castles in Spain is without a mistress. She who was to have presided over it has been dead these many years. Only her portrait hangs upon its walls. It represents a fair maiden of sixteen summers, with blue eyes, hair,—"brown in the shadow, golden in the sun,"—falling in ringlets about her rounded throat and neck, lips just parted in a smile, clad in a simple white robe, and with only a blue ribbon as ornament, with flowing ends, tied around her waist. She is stooping down, half-kneeling, on a green bank in the woods, plucking violets; a bunch of which she carries in one hand, while with the other she parts the grasses and leaves at her feet, seeking for more.
                  This is Alice as she was when my boyish eyes first looked upon her; the darling of my youth for two short years, and ever since a sweet and precious memory. How much I loved her in those days my heart refuses to tell. How much she loved me, the few letters I received after she went to her home amidst the mountains to die fondly attest. These letters, which I keep in a secret drawer of my desk and bring forth on the anniversaries of our meeting, her birthday, and her death, are more precious to me than the diamonds of Musidora, or the pearls of the fair Azelia. They are tied together with a blue ribbon, and in one of them a few withered violets, faded and scentless, which she gave me at our first meeting, are preserved. Those flowers, in their silence, speak even more eloquently to me of Alice than the letters themselves.
                  
                  A summer, a winter, and a spring went by after we met, bringing new graces to her, and making my love deeper and stronger. The perfume of innumerable violets, growing upon sunny hill-sides and in hidden nooks in the valleys, floated on the air, and hovered about the path along which Alice walked.
                  Then the roses came, and blushed, and faded, and were scattered on the ground at her feet, and the lilies were broken on their stems by the first blasts of autumn when Alice, drooping and weary, sought her mountain home.
                  "Something, she knew not what," she wrote me, "a mere shadow which would doubtless vanish before the sunshine of spring, had fallen across her path. She had taken cold; a slight cough, which had hung about her for several weeks, troubled her more than she cared to confess."
                  Afterward: "Her physician prescribed rest, and, when the March winds came, a milder climate. It was nothing, though, to be alarmed about, and she thought a trip to the Bermudas would be a pleasant change."
                  Later: "I cannot deceive myself or you any longer. I am going to leave you, and neither medicine nor travel will benefit me. I know that I am dying, and all that I ask is that you will be with me at that hour. In truth I desire, more than words can tell, to see you once again."
                  For weeks I sat by her bedside, watching the breath of life as it fluttered like a caged dove within her breast. And one morning, when the snows had melted from off the neighboring hill-sides, and the first violets of spring had raised their modest heads above the mould, Alice, bursting the trammels of affection which held her to earth, passed, without a sigh, from life, leaving behind her crushed hearts to mourn over her early departure.
                  The sod has long been green on the grave where Alice sleeps, and the violets for many springs have shed their perfume above her bed. Her shapely form has mouldered into dust, her voice is stilled forever, and her life is swallowed up in eternity. But in my heart she still retains her place, and as I unfold, one by one, those long treasured letters, and read them with tear-dimmed eyes, my life goes back to the day when I stood before her and told her that I loved her.
                  "O, Alice!" I exclaim, with a tremulous voice, and dimmed eyes, as I gaze on them, "why was it that my most precious hopes should have come to naught! Why was it that you the good angel of my youthful days, should have been called away from earth, leaving me, for many years, to guide alone the bark of life through the dangerous currents and whirlpools that attracted it from its proper course! With you, Alice, seated at the prow, to encourage and cheer me, I should not, as many times I did, have grounded my hapless bark on the shoals, or suffered it to be almost wrecked amidst the breakers which roared around it. The glad haven, which was reached at last, and where my vessel has long been safely moored, protected from the winds and waves, was not dreamed of by either you or I, when, in those spring days of life, we hoped to sail together down the tide of time."
                  Just when our ship's sails began to fill, and the gay pennon at its peak to wave in the rising breeze, a deadly calm arose, and a black cloud came up and settled on the scene. Then the spring-tide went out, the flood became an ebb, and my bark lay still in the sluggish waters, and finally stranded upon the shore. Time went by, mildewing its sails, rotting its cordage, and opening its seams to the sun and air. Its keel was broken, and its bottom fouled with shell-fish and sea-weeds.
                  When at last the waters rose, and my bark floated again in the current, it was almost a wreck and a ruin. Its rudder, rusted in its bolts, failed to obey the bidding of its helmsman. The wind carried it whither it listed; the tides, as they came and went, drifted it hither and thither: and, under the influence even of the waxing and waning moons, it yawed here and there from its forward course.
                  No wonder then that years afterwards, she, who is now my all in all, found the bark wherein I sailed, and into which I carried her (ready to go where I went, and prepared to share with me alike the sunshine and the storm), to be an unseaworthy and trustless vessel.
                  "But how then," asked Uncle John, interrupting me, "does it come that she is registered as an Al clipperrigged bark?"
                  "Uncle John," I replied, "you may not be aware that repairs will sometimes make these vessels as good as new, if not better; and, besides, it is not clear to me but that you are thinking of another vessel—your own, perhaps, the 'good Maria,' which for so many years has been your pride and comfort."
                  Uncle John said it might be so, but that really he never knew he owned a vessel, though the name was familiar to him, as Maria chanced to be the name of his wife.
                  "It is no wonder," I repeated, resuming my talk, "that she whom I asked to accompany me should have hesitated about setting forth; though finally, such was her confidence in my good seamanship, that she put aside all scruples, and set out on a voyage which I had contemplated making with another more than a dozen years before. Perhaps our bark encountered fewer head-winds, and floated on the top of stronger and more favorable currents than it would have done had it weighed anchor in the olden time. I know that it was better ballasted, that a firmer hand was at its helm, and that the channel through which it sailed was broader and deeper, and the route more clearly laid down on the chart than it could have been if I had sailed out in the early dawn, instead of waiting, as I did, until the morning sun had risen in the heavens.
                  "The further I sailed the smoother grew the waters, the more favorable the breeze, and the faster flew the bark The trail it left behind sparkled more and more, and before it the sun by day and the moon by night made a luminous path across the waves through which the vessel ploughed—reaching at last that long-looked-for harbor, where, furling its sails, it cast anchor within the Bay of Utopia."
               
               
                  
                  CASTLE VIII.
                  UTOPIA FOUND.
                  I LEFT the granite building in Wall Street the other afternoon, just as Trinity's clock struck the hour of three, more wearied and jaded than I had been for months before. All the afternoon I had been listening, leaning my elbows on the desk, and gazing through the window opening toward the west, to the strains of a hand-organ, played by a swarthy Italian, in the street below. "Love not," and "Home, sweet home," seemed to be the organ's stock of tunes, and these were repeated over and over again. Somehow it seemed to me, as I followed the music of the first-named melody, that it had something to do with my Spanish castles and their inmates. I almost saw these splendid structures crumbling into dust, and the fair women who inhabited them going forth disconsolately to seek other homes and other lovers. On the other hand, when "Home, sweet home" was played, it appeared as if my own small cottage grew more beautiful, and that the woodbines and roses wrapped it with their loving tendrils more closely from base to roof. Within it Ruth, surrounded by our little flock, presided with increased grace and dignity. All about was joyous and peaceful. The sun shone brightly, the air was balmy, and the sky without a cloud.
                  How long I was engaged in these dreamings I cannot tell, but I know that when Uncle John came over to my desk to compare certain accounts, the examination of which, unfortunately, I had forgotten all about, he had to touch me on the shoulder twice before he could arouse my attention. I asked him immediately if he liked music.
                  "Ah," he said, "I perceive that you have been travelling again; you have been visiting your Spanish estates. Pray tell me," and his countenance assumed a dreamy look, such as I had never before seen on it, "did you meet with or hear of Minerva?"
                  "I don't think," I replied, "at least I am not certain, that I have been to Spain. It rather seems to me that I have been engaged in visiting property nearer home. But you have not told me yet whether you like music, and if you heard those sweet airs with which an itinerant musical spirit—a troubadour or minnesinger he would have been called in the olden time—favored us during the long hours of the afternoon?"
                  The excellent Uncle John replied, that however much he might like music—and in the days of his youth he used to think Minerva had a fine voice, and of later years his wife and daughters of a Sunday evening were accustomed to sing a hymn together, often it was Dr. Muhlenberg's "I would not live alway," which he greatly admired—he did not care to have it come from a street organ; and that even "Yankee Doodle," if played everlastingly, might, before being finished, get to be slightly wearisome, and confuse, while engaged in the addition of figures, the best regulated and most mathematical mind. As for troubadours and minnesingers, as I called them, he did not know much concerning them.
                  When I asked the descendant of the poet who wrote "Gather the rose-buds as ye may," whether he liked music, he nodded his head, but did not speak; and I fancied that somehow these organ-airs had set him to dreaming, as they had me, of other days and other scenes, as well as of those of the present. I thought, too, as I noticed him gazing on the bunch of wilted violets that lay on his desk, that he repeated to himself these lines of his sweet-tongued ancestor,— 
                        
                           "We have short time to stay as you;
                           We have as short a spring,
                           
                           As quick a growth to meet decay,
                           As you, or anything.
                           We die,
                           As your hours do; and dry
                           Away
                           Like to the summer's rain,
                           Or as the pearls of morning dew,
                           Ne'er to be found again."
                        
                     
                  
                  There is about this descendant of the Anacreontic poet, with his appreciation of wine, women, and flowers, something that leads me to think he holds large estates in Spain, where choicest vineyards flourish, queenliest ladies hold imperial court, and the most fragrant of flowers are ever in bloom.
                  When I passed out into the dust of Wall Street, with its din and turmoil and excitement; its fierce Gogs and Magogs of traffic ever fighting each other, and, reaching Trinity, crept under the shadow of the cross, and entered the sacred precincts of the church, it seemed to me as if I were about to enter a new era in my life. The boy choristers were chanting the Cantate Domino: "O, sing unto the Lord a new song!" and immediately there came over my spirit a contentment better than wealth, a joy purer than earth can yield.
                  It was not, however, until I entered my cottage home that I understood what all this meant. For these many years had I been seeking throughout the length and breadth of my Spanish estates, visiting every castle I possessed, making long voyages to El Dorado, the land of Arcadie, and Utopia, looking for the San Greal of Happiness. Musidora did not possess it; if Azelia held it it was not for me; and while Alice was lifting it to my lips it was snatched away, and I knew not where to find it.
                  Sometimes, when I had gone home, weary and dejected, and found Ruth, with a smile and a loving word, awaiting my coming, it had occurred to me that she might know where this jeweled cup of happiness was kept. With a perverseness, however, which can only be accounted for on the ground that we are too apt to overlook that which is nearest and dearest to us, and go afar off in search of those treasures which lie around us, I neglected to question Ruth concerning it. Moreover, perhaps, I felt that it was a thing of such a nature that unless it came unsought and unasked for—unless it rose up before me, as plainly to be seen as was the cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night to the children of Israel, it could not be attained.
                  So when, in that sweet May afternoon, as I approached my house, and saw Ruth, with our children clustering around her, standing at the garden gate, embowered by early roses, I could see, while still far off, that she held in her hand that San Greal for which so long I had vainly been seeking.
                  The loves of our youth may be fair and beautiful; but, after all, they are little more than sweet flowers that fade and wither; and though their perfume may linger in our hearts for years, it is as evanescent and unreliable as the flying clouds of spring-time.
                  As I came near to her a sweet savor, not so overpowering as the perfume of the orange-blossom, nor yet so delicate as the scent of the violet, greeted me. It arose from a lowly plant which grew about my door-step, and is significant of domestic virtues: it is the sage. Its fragrance permeates my dwelling, and the virtues it represents, shine forth in the actions of my wife and children.
                  When I said to Ruth, as we gathered that night around the evening lamp, that I had succeeded in finding the San Greal for which for so many years I had been searching, and that the draught I had quaffed from it had enabled me to enter that Utopia which, in the days of my youth, I had discerned afar, and yet until now had never succeeded in reaching, she asked—while a happy smile illumined her countenance—in which of my castles in Spain had I found it? Had Musidora treasured it among her diamonds monds; or Azelia hidden it beneath wreaths of orange-flowers; or Alice buried it under a handful of violets?
                  "No," I answered; "none of these have had the keeping of it. In a spot closer at hand than are my Spanish castles did I find it; and one far dearer to me than are those olden loves carried it unsullied in her bosom. Here, my dear, in this humble cottage, which you have made beautiful by your domestic virtues, did I find it, and from your pure hands was it received by me. After all, Ruth, I find that the noblest castles of man are built on the foundations of home, his fairest mistress is his wife, and his greatest treasures are his children. I feel that if I should search the wide world over, or should in dreams and reveries visit those wonderful Western estates where airy castles are erected and ideal beauties dwell; or, upon the wings of memory, should go back to the morning of life, with its vanished loves, I should fail to find so blissful a place as home, or such loving hearts as those which now surround me. Yes, Ruth, with you seated beside me, clasping my hand, and the little ones reading or playing around me, I am satisfied that no happier lot could be given me, and that my lines could not have fallen in pleasanter places."
               
            
            
               
               BROKEN SHEAVES AND BITTER ALMONDS.
               
                  
                     The sheaves are broken and scattered, and the almonds are bitter in the mouth.
                  
               
               
                  CHAPTER I.
                  MY COUSIN KATE.
                  MY Cousin Kate has seen her fortieth birthday, and is still unmarried. I doubt, now, if she ever will marry: though by her not doing so, a charming wife and a delightful home are lost to somebody; for Kate possesses every requisite necessary to insure domestic happiness.
                  She is the most unselfish of mortals, and would at any time sacrifice her own pleasure, and, indeed, interest, to those of another. In fact this self-sacrifice is carried by her to an extent only a little short of suicide. By it she has blasted her fairest hopes, and seen the tenderest desire of her youth fade and wither within the grasp of her hand.
                  Kate, despite her age, despite the troubles—self-inflicted to a great degree—which she has known, appears, to-day, younger and more beautiful than does many a woman of half her years. She possesses a fullness—not to be confounded with voluptuousness—of form, a gracefulness of movement, unlike the swaying litheness of girlhood, it is true, but resembling the stately inclinings of the calla-lily on its stem; a round, melodious tone of voice, differing from the silvery treble of girlhood, an honest open laugh, more joyous than the irrepressible falsetto of youth, a thoughtful look which sinks deeper into the heart than do the dancing glances cast by maidens of eighteen summers on favored lovers, and a speech which appeals to the understanding rather than to the fancy of the listener.
                  Kate reminds me, as, sometimes in the fading twilight of a summer day, I watch her seated at the piano running her plump, white hands across the keys, of a moss-rose fully blown, which is passed by unplucked, because its chief charm, the delicate, green moss which enfolded it as a bud, is hidden from sight by its opened petals, which, however, catch the nourishing dew and the sunshine more fully, and throw off a sweeter perfume than ever the folded bud could yield. The gallant gentlemen who walk coldly past Cousin Kate, do not perceive that she bears a pure, fresh heart in her bosom, which could, if she would allow it, beat responsively to the tenderest tokens of affection. They do not know that under that calm exterior lies a volume of love, seemingly extinct because it sends forth no fire or smoke, and is covered thickly with a layer of cold and lifeless ashes, which, but for one thing, would not now be dormant.
                  Alas! for Kate, her sheaves are broken and scattered, and her almonds are bitter in the mouth.
                  Ruth, my wife, who is as quick as most of her sex to understand the feelings of those around her, occasionally directs my attention to Cousin Kate, when, in the fading twilight of an autumn day, she sits, surrounded by the children, gazing silently out of the western window upon the setting sun, while a dreamy, retrospective look beams from her eyes, and a sweet, sad smile unconsciously creeps over her face—a smile so like a passing shadow that one less observant than is Ruth would fail to tell which it were. I have sometimes thought that Kate had other reasons than those she gave, for not marrying, which, however, she has never divulged. It seems to me that she carries the weight of a great sorrow in her bosom; though if she has one she has never told it even to my wife.
                  Once, in the late afternoon, as we sat together, my wife said to me, softly, "Kate"—and, pausing an instant, during which her glances travelled from me to Kate, and thence to the mirror, wherein she saw reflected her own sweet face, less fair and blooming, perhaps, than it was in her girlhood, when I first met her, but none the less dear and charming to me,—"Kate," she repeated, "is thinking of the past and the pleasant days that are no more. The memory of a buried but not forgotten love fills her heart, and struggle as she will against it, the thought of all she has renounced, and the fair picture which is presented to her mind of what might have been, rise before her and make her regret that she pursued the course she did."
                  "My dear," I made reply, taking her hand tenderly in my own, "you do not know Cousin Kate as well as I do, or you would not say that she regrets the course she pursued. She may regret that it was necessary, as she believed, for her to do so; but not for an instant, regarding the matter in the light she did, and doubtless still does, has the shadow of a regret crossed her mind. Nor, and I say it from my heart, my love, do I regret either for her sake or my own, that she deemed it her duty to walk in the path which twenty years ago she marked out for herself to follow. To every one on earth is given a mission to perform, and rest assured that that mission, whatever it may be, is for the best. It was ordered that Cousin Kate should be an old maid; that so she might make every one around her happy and contented. Do you remember, my dear, the poem by Mrs. Welby, entitled 'The Old Maid'? I often find myself repeating it, as I look at Cousin Kate, and this stanza is especially significant in connection with her:— 
                        
                           "'Joy's opening buds, affection's glowing flowers,
                           Once lightly sprang within her beaming track;
                           O, life was beautiful in those lost hours!
                           And yet she does not wish to wander back.
                           No! she but loves in loneliness to think
                           On pleasures past though never more to be;
                           Hope links her to the future—but the link
                           That blinds her to the past is memory.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  
                  "Yes," my wife answered, "and these lines from the same poem are equally applicable:— 
                        
                           "'Yet life is not to her what it hath been;
                           Her soul has learned to look beyond its gloss;
                           And now she hovers, like a star, between
                           Her deeds of love, her Saviour on the cross.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  Next to her God and deeds of love, Cousin Kate lives for her father—a hard, cruel, selfish old man: a man who caused her to lead the life she leads—a quiet, solitary one, lighted by few gleams of sunshine; but yet not altogether joyless. For if to possess the will and the ability to do good to others; to give largely in charity; to visit the sick and the afflicted, cheering them with words of assurance and comfort, and scattering, wherever she goes, the sweet savor of sympathy, which is better to the bruised spirit even than the bounty she dispenses, can make one happy and contented with one's lot, surely Cousin Kate should be such an one.
                  Moreover, Cousin Kate possesses, in an eminent degree, the power of winning to her the love of little children. At her coming their tears are turned into smiles, and their joys are doubled. An hour with her is better than a whole Saturday afternoon without her. She tells to mine nicer stories, sings to them sweeter songs, teaches them better how to dress their dolls and play at marbles, and enters more fully into the spirit of their sports, than even their mother herself can do.
                  Ruth often declares that she would not know what to do without Cousin Kate, and our eldest boy, who has picked up at school a good deal of unnecessary knowledge, somewhat startled and puzzled his mother the other day by saying that Cousin Kate was her right bower, while the governor, meaning me, was only her left. So far as relates to cards, Ruth simply understands the good old-fashioned game of whist: she knows all about honors and trumps and the odd trick, but as for euchre, with its right and left bowers, she is supremely ignorant. She has heard, however, too much sailor "lingo" since she became an active partner in my house, not to be aware that a bower and an anchor are synonymous; but how to apply the word, as our eldest had done, until I explained it, exceeded her comprehension. The children themselves have an idea that Christmas would not be Christmas were it not for Cousin Kate. Santa Claus, with his stockings, they say, is all very well; but Cousin Kate, with her Christmas-tree, is much better. The truth is that Cousin Kate comes as nearly as can be, without doing it,—for Ruth's teachings and discipline overbalance Cousin Kate's indulgences,—to spoiling my little ones. She actually makes it Christmas for them all the year round, while Christmas itself is a kind of terrestrial Paradise. What with the Christmas-tree with its harvest of presents; the enactment of charades and parlor theatricals; the sleigh-riding and skating parties,—to say nothing of the holiday-ball and supper which Cousin Kate gives annually to the children of the neighborhood, in the great dining-room of the old mansion where she dwells with her father, not far from my own less pretentious cottage, the little ones enjoy the sacred season to an extent which even the wildest dreamer and believer in fairy tales and the "Arabian Nights" would scarcely credit.
                  What, indeed, as Ruth says, we should do without Cousin Kate is a mystery to me, and though I have deeply mourned over some incidents in the past, whereby she and I were compelled to walk through different paths in life, yet have I since then been constrained to acknowledge that wisdom which permitted the half-twisted chords of our hearts to be separated, and turned into separate channels the streams of our lives. Else had I not these little ones around me, and else would not Kate herself, in all these years, have been the dear and honored guest of my home, the companion and confidant of my wife, the playmate and guide of my children, and the true friend of mine which she has proved herself to be.
                  
                  I speak of Kate as my cousin, but it is a cousinship so many degrees removed, that it used to puzzle even my grandmother, who prided herself on her knowledge of the family genealogy, to explain clearly our exact relationship. Somewhere on one of the upper shelves in my library, dusty and mildewed with age, is a roll of parchment, on which is traced by the hands of one of my long-buried ancestors, a genealogical tree, purporting to be the record of our family from the days of William the Conqueror.
                  I believe that most genealogies go back to his time, when everybody worth speaking of was a Norman; which, after all, is only another name for a freebooter; or what in these latter days is termed a filibuster. Attached to this parchment is a bronze medal, issued, since the beginning of the present century, by an English admiral of our name, in honor of "Tristram, the first of the race," so the legend runs, "that settled in America," which event happened in 1642, during the stormy reign of Charles the First, and just after the outbreak of the civil war in England, which ended in making Oliver Cromwell Protector of the Realm.
                  I have always contended that this cavalier ancestor of mine, who has the credit of being a royalist, and an earnest adherent of the king, showed more discretion than loyalty in taking it into his wise old pate, just at the outbreak of the rebellion, to migrate to this country. Had he been less discreet he would have remained at home, and, probably, have lost his life in the fight on Marston Moor, or at the battle of Naseby, and thus effectually have wiped out from the face of the earth the eight generations of his descendants in America who have since risen up to do honor to his name.
                  The medal bears on its obverse a full-length effigy of this notable ancestor, clad in trunk-hose, slashed doublet, a mantle fallen from his right shoulder, a wide crimped ruffle around his throat, a soft hat, turned up at the sides, on his head, knotted ribbons at his knees, silk stockings, low quartered shoes with silver buckles, and a cane in his left hand. His hair is long, and he wears a moustache. The reverse of the coin presents in relief, four hands—the wrists surrounded with ruffles—clasped together and forming a cross. Around the edge are the mottoes; "Be united," and "Do honor to his name."
                  Over this parchment-roll of genealogy, with its painted crests, ensigns, armorial and heraldic seals and medals, in the mellow days of our youth, Kate and I, spreading it out upon the floor, used to kneel, and pore with curious eyes; her golden curls mingling with my darker locks, and her fingers touching mine as we essayed to trace from the ancestor of the medal our separate lines of descent.
                  It must have been a pretty picture which we two children, in those winter days of thirty years ago, reclining in graceful attitude, with that musty parchment unrolled before us, on the soft rug in front of the cheerful wood-fire on the hearth, our young faces lighted up by the dancing blaze, presented! Our eyes, doubtless, were filled with a strange and solemn light, and our countenances must have worn a look of mystery and wonderment, in keeping with the awe-inspiring subject of our search: for were we not like moles delving under ground, lifting above them the earth, as they slowly moved along, which had remained undisturbed for centuries! Aye, the ghosts of two hundred years, so we felt, were being ousted from their graves, and called upon to give evidence in our behalf. Scores of brave men and galaxies of beautiful women were forced at our bidding to present themselves before us, and tell the separate story of their lives.
                  Then I was a rosy-cheeked boy; and it seems to me, as I recall to mind that boy's face, that the lad who now stands beside me, and calls me father, is no other than the lad I knew in those long since vanished days. As for Kate herself, she was little less, at that time, than a fairy of loveliness. Every motion was graceful, and every look and gesture evinced a pure and guileless soul. To a spirit as gentle as a dove's, a mind as unsullied as the petals of a lily, were united a heart as warm and confiding as love itself.
                  Is it any wonder then, that, boy though I were, I loved my Cousin Kate, and that for her sake I would have encountered perils unknown, and performed deeds such as Launcelot, the peerless knight of chivalry in good King Arthur's reign, for the love of Guinevere, on the battlefield, and in the courtly tournament, successfully accomplished? Kate, with her winning way, her enchanting smile, her coaxing tongue, held me from Christmas to Christmas, through many years, a willing and a happy captive and lover.
                  Even at that time, while mere children,—Kate was my junior by two or three years,—we were sweethearts, and loved each other as sincerely as those of larger growth can do. Then, too, we used to talk together, seated under an old cherry-tree at the foot of the garden, of the time when we would be married, and keep house, and have ripe cherries to eat all the year round. Which, after all, is only geographically, not scientifically impossible. But nothing is impossible to youth, and though we might, perforce, have been unable to have enjoyed the feast of cherries we promised ourselves, yet I am not certain but that we spoke of this cherry festival only in a metaphorical sense, allowing it, in our minds, to represent the pleasure of a golden life, such as we hoped to lead together. And what a delightful spot, too, was that garden, from early spring-time, with its fragrant lilacs and syringas, until the first snows of winter sifted down upon the still flowering dahlias. The upper part was laid out in flower-beds, bordered with neatlytrimmed box, and the lower part was devoted to fruits and vegetables. My grandmother reigned in the former, my grandfather ruled over the latter.
                  In my grandmother's kingdom the crocus and jonquil, pushing themselves up through the frozen earth, came first to fill the air with perfume and gladden the sight with their presence. Then came the roses, and troops of summer flowers: great beds of nodding poppies, which made one's eyelids wink with sleepiness as one passed by them; tulips, as stately and magnificent as courtly dames robed in the richest of Tyrian silks; lilies like those of the valley, hiding their pearly bells under green leaves,—or like those of France, the fleur-de-lis, lifting their heads proudly to the light of day,—or like the tiger-lily, blazing under the noontide sun,—or, further, like the gladiolus, filling its palm-like shafts with various colored gems of beauty.
                  The nodding canterbury-bell of white and blue, the thoughtful monk's-hood, the merry larkspur, the sweet-william, and fragrant pinks, from the wild India pink to the spicy and sensuous carnation, grew there in profusion. There, too, sweet peas, "on tiptoe for a flight," and homely morning-glories and four-o'clocks, grew side by side. While the pomegranate, with its scarlet flowers, bursting from thick, wax-like cups; the oleander, with clusters of pink blossoms; cacti of various varieties and flowers; the flowering almond, with its wreaths of blossoms, fit for a maiden's brow; and, growing in great tubs, lemon and orange trees, bearing flowers and fruit together, were to be found.
                  I think that in the spring and summer time, the flower-garden was our favorite haunt; but, when the autumn came, and the peaches, ripening against the wall, turned their blushing cheeks toward the sun, and the apricots and nectarines grew mellow, and the plums purpled, and the pears became golden, and the grapes were swollen and bursting with unmade wine, then we sought the summer-house amidst the trees, and, with great baskets of fruit before us, read from the same book, seated side by side, poems like that of "Genevieve."
                  
                  So we grew up together,—I always her champion and companion in childhood, her worshipper and follower in early manhood. Youth, with its spring-time, went smoothly and noiselessly by,—no cloud casting a shadow on our path, and no doubt arising in our minds as to the future.
                  When, however, the garden became a wild, and weeds grew up and choked the flowers, and the trees, neglected, no longer bore fruits, and were cut down and cast into the fire, then the shadow had fallen across our way, and the present was dark, and the future altogether doubtful; and so our sheaves became broken and scattered, and our almonds turned bitter in the mouth.
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  OLD TOPAZ.
                  OLD Topaz is the reputed father of Cousin Kate. I say reputed, not that there exists any legitimate question as to the fact, but because of the dissimilarity of their minds and hearts. I have a theory, which may or may not prove to be correct, and which can only be decided in the hereafter, that in the spirit land many, who on earth are related by the closest bonds of consanguinity, will, as spirits, be strangers to each other.
                  I have little doubt as to the truth of this as regards Kate and her father. That he is receiving from her in this world the full meed of filial affection, and more, indeed, than that of which he is deserving, is to me a convincing proof that he will know nothing of it in the world to come.
                  Perhaps he will be so situated in that other world—the world, indeed, not being exactly the one which she will inhabit, but separated from it by an impassable gulf—that she will not be able, even if willing so to do, to sacrifice, a second time, her happiness to his selfish pleasure.
                  Old Topaz, of the ruby nose and rubicund complexion, is well known in Wall Street. Indeed, portions of his heart and soul, aye, and of his very life itself, are undoubtedly builded into the granite and marble walls of the banks which line either side of this street, where Mammon, even within the shadow of Trinity's cross, sits a crowned king. In the cool depths of iron vaults, secured by bolts of steel, driven home by a complicated mechanism, which the thief does, however, occasionally break through to steal, and where moth and rust, notwithstanding the free use of lubricating oils, will come to corrupt, are gathered the idols which Topaz in reality worships before any god. These are bags and bars of gold and silver, bonds and mortgages, railroad and mining scrip, and government securities.
                  When his course on earth shall have run, and the final sands of time shall slip through his stiffening fingers forever, the old spectre Death, careful to gather up the last dust of his earthly tabernacle, will, within some one of these dark vaults, stumbling, in his patient search, over the accumulated wealth of fourscore years, find it, dry, impalpable to human touch and undiscernible to human sight, settled upon a cankered piece of gold.
                  Then, indeed, will his sheaves be broken and scattered, and the almonds prove bitter in the mouth.
                  In the palmy days of old Topaz, before the hand of Time was laid heavily upon his shoulders, and the king of diseases, gout, had not taken possession of his almost octogenarian legs, and blood instead of turtle and Madeira coursed through his veins; when he lived, as it might almost be said to be, perpetually on 'Change, he was an oracle in Wall Street, and controlled the market at his pleasure. Stocks rose and fell at his bidding: through his machinations men made or lost fortunes in an hour. Bank, railroad, and mining stocks flourished or failed as he decreed. He was skilled in instituting mock companies, whose bubbles he inflated with such ability, that he could waft them higher into the air, and keep them longer afloat, than could any other operator on the street. Moreover, they sailed more gracefully before the breeze, and showed more fully, not only the prismatic colors, but golden bands and silver linings, than the radiant bubbles which were sent forth by other schemers and dreamers. True, though, when they burst, as they were used to do, there was less left of them than there is night's dew to be found on the tiniest blade of grass growing on eastern hill-side after the summer sun is midday high.
                  Like King Midas, after he had entertained Bacchus, everything that Topaz touched turned to gold, while the speculators around him, who essayed to follow in his steps, resembled the King only when, after his foolish decision between Pan and Apollo, the latter, in revenge, changed his ears into those of an ass.
                  His ships, too, always came home from sea, while those of his rivals, wafted apparently by the same breezes, and floated on the same currents which bore his so triumphantly along, suffered shipwreck in sight of port, or were never heard of more. His ships never turned from their course, or grounded on treacherous sands, or went to pieces on sunken rocks; but rode into harbor, with all sails set, on the day he looked for them, laden with the costliest of silks, the rarest of teas, the most fragrant of spices, the choicest of wines, the purest of ivories, and the richest of sandal-wood. Spiritually, as well as temporally, Topaz, especially in these his later years, flourishes and spreads himself "like a green bay-tree." He is a pillar of strength in the Church of Ancient Malachi, and, as the senior warden of its vestry, on Sunday mornings, when not kept at home by an attack of the gout, arrayed in purple and fine linen, carries around, among his brother lepers and sinners, the plate whereon to collect his accustomed thirty pieces of silver. No one, not even the deaf old gentleman in the front pew, who cannot hear his own voice, much less that of the clergyman's, and, consequently, makes fearful blunders in his responses—responds louder, or with a more unctuous, self-satisfied God-I-thank-Thee-that-I-am-not-as-other-men-are, than does the Pharisaical Topaz. Having been a most persistent and consistent sinner all his days, and having covered himself with hypocrisy as with a mantle, he cannot forgive the shortcomings of others. Indeed, the forgiveness of sin, at least between mortals, he regards as not only a weakness, but as little less than being in itself a sin. A fault committed against him he never forgets or pardons, and yet he repeats the Lord's prayer—especially that part of it which relates to the forgiveness of trespasses—with a fervor of utterance, and a pathos of expression, which impresses those who sit near him with the idea that he lives up to all its requirements, and is the most merciful and forgiving of men.
                  Perhaps the sad-eyed old woman in the rusty bombazine, kneeling in a remote corner of the church, murmuring her prayers in a whisper, and bowing her slender form to the pavement, could tell a story which would somewhat alter these charitable views. Could he recognize in that wrinkled face, as it lifts itself up, looking towards the altar, filled with sorrow, penitence, and a growing faith in the mercy and goodness of her Lord, the one which, forty years ago, he had spurned from his side, making its owner an outcast from society, and her name a by-word and reproach in the mouth of the world, he might be less certain than he is, that his sins are forgiven; and it might cause him to regard with leniency the lesser shortcomings of his neighbors.
                  When I see old Topaz, as I sometimes do, of a Sunday morning, assisted by the sexton of Ancient Malachi, go hobbling up the middle aisle of the church toward his velvet-cushioned pew, turning frowning glances on the occupants of the oaken benches near the porch, but allowing his features gradually to relax into a sort of grim smile as he approaches the more aristocratic portion of the church, and catches the eye of old Carbon, who sits in the pew adjoining his, I am led to think of the vanity of riches, and the little real happiness which is to be derived simply from the possession of gold and silver and precious stones and large estates. "Here is a man," I say to myself, "who, though he has everything of this world's goods that the heart can desire, is far from being happy. To be sure he has not reached his fourscore years, when, as the Psalmist hath it, 'his strength is but labor and sorrow,' but even when he was in his prime, which was after he had gained his wealth, I question whether he then or since has known a single hour of unalloyed happiness. And yet wealth properly used," I continue, after a little pause, during which I watch Kate pass along the aisle, in a quiet, unpretentious manner, bearing about her an undefinable air of purity and sanctity (she had stopped a moment in the porch to speak to two or three poor women who, weekly, there await her coming, two always expecting a money offering, but the third, the sad-eyed, penitent Magdalen in the rusty bombazine, contented with simply touching the hem of her garments as she passes, and obtaining from her a single glance, or a smile, or, highest boon of all, a pleasant word), and have repeated to myself as, hidden from her sight behind a pillar, she went by, unconscious of my presence,— 
                        
                           "My lady comes at last,
                           Timid, and stepping fast,
                           And hastening hither,
                           With modest eyes downcast;
                           She comes—she's here,—she's past!
                           May Heaven go with her!"—
                        
                      "And yet wealth properly used," I repeat, "as Kate uses it, must add to one's happiness. But unless such a one has suffered, and through self-sacrifice has been crucified in the spirit, one will not know how to employ it, so as to comfort others, and bring contentment to one's self. But all this experience Cousin Kate has known."
                  At this moment the priest, clad in his snowy surplice, sweeps, with a rustling sound, into the chancel, and the great organ in the loft peals forth triumphal notes, and all the assemblage bow their heads, and kneel in silence before the Lord of Hosts. As the music ceases I pass quietly out from the crowded church into the summer air and sunshine, and linger about the stately columns, crowned with urns, and the mossy headstones, old and quaint, whereon are carved winged cherubs and extinguished torches, which, despite the impropriety of so doing, I used, in my juvenile days, to regard as patterns of the shuttlecocks and battledores with which good angels played. There, too, were drooping willows, and Father Time, with broken scythe and shattered hour-glass, graven on other stones, which serve to mark in this olden burial-ground the places where repose the dust of those who died a hundred years and more ago. Whether the sermons which these old tombstones preach to me sink deeper into my heart, and, taking root therein, bring forth better fruits than the sermon preached by the rector of the Church of Ancient Malachi, must ever remain undecided.
                  Kate often says, when she learns, as she frequently does from my wife, that I have been lingering about the open door of the church, giving no heed to the words of the preacher within, though enjoying the sacred music of the organ, as, wafted through the open doors and windows, it falls, subdued in sound, upon my ears, and exerts a tranquillizing influence on my mind, causing me to have solemn thoughts, even while I watch the yellow butterflies, emblems of the soul, sporting above the sunken mounds; that I have lost thereby words fitly spoken, which were "like apples of gold in pictures of silver."
                  Ruth always joins with Kate on these occasions, and declares that I might better be within the walls of Ancient Malachi, listening to the proverbs of the Reverend Philo Tupper, than chasing butterflies around the graves, or grubbing amidst the tangled grass to discover the dates, half obliterated by age, on the lichened and neglected headstones.
                  All which, however, I soberly, and, very properly, deny.
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  MAGDALENE.
                  WHO is this sad-eyed, wasted woman in the faded gown, who kneels, a penitent and a suppliant, within the outer doors of the Church of Ancient Malachi? whose greatest joy is to touch the silken robes of Cousin Kate, as, on Sunday mornings, she glides like a sunbeam into the gloomy walls of this olden church; but who shrinks, cowering, on the pavement, under what she imagines to be sharp glances from the bleared eyes of old Topaz, as he hobbles pompously up the broad aisle to his well cushioned seat near the chancel! Is she like that woman in the Scriptures to whom Jesus once said, "Neither do I condemn thee; go and sin no more?" With her the sheaves were years ago broken and scattered, and the almonds became very bitter in the mouth.
                  In a New England village there dwelt, over forty years ago, a white-haired old man alone with his only child—a daughter, young, beautiful, and innocent. For ten years—ever since her mother died—she had been the sole stay and comfort of her father. He was as simple and untutored in the ways of the world as his prototype, the Vicar of Wakefield, and, like him, he preached the word of God acceptably to the little flock of hearers who, on Sundays, gathered in the meeting-house to listen to his teachings, and, perchance, unmindful of the duties of the day, to muse on secular employments, and even doze away the wearisome hours. If some portion of the congregation slept through the old dominie's long prayers, and still longer and prosier sermons, it was not among the young men that any such could be found; for they were too much occupied in gazing upon the fair face of the daughter, and seeking to gain from her a glance of recognition, to think of closing their eyes in slumber so long as she was present.
                  When the hymns were being sung, however, even the drowsiest ones of the congregation,—old farmers who looked on Sunday as being emphatically a day of rest, a respite from the weary six days labor they had undergone, and who, moreover, regarded their inclination to sleep as in some way an act of sanctity, and an evidence that they possessed quiet and untroubled consciences,—even these old farmers, I say, aroused themselves to listen to the clear, sweet voice of the minister's daughter, which rose above those of the rest of the choir, like nothing else, to which these simple souls could compare it, but the blithesome song of a robin, heard above the twitter of sparrows in early spring-time.
                  Many a callow swain fell deeply in love with the young girl because of her singing; and many a reputation for "godliness" was obtained, and proved by a regular attendance at divine worship, which was due solely to the attraction which the sight of her face and melody of her voice wielded.
                  To all the gentle words whispered to her, beneath the moon on summer nights; to all the vows uttered at the merry-makings in winter time, around the blazing fires, she turned a silent ear, and while she jested and laughed with, and was kind to all, she showed for none a preference. The arrows of the god of love fell blunted at her feet, while her heart remained unscarred.
                  The young god, as well as the young men, grew furious. The latter pronounced her cold and heartless, and, with a sigh, restored to their proper bosoms the hearts they had individually laid at her feet, and collecting their property, vows, sighs, entreaties, and oaths, together in bundles, through which they severally thrust each his stick, and placing it over his shoulder, bade her what may poetically be termed a long and lingering adieu, but in simple parlance good-by, and went out into the world to seek a better fortune than he had, and a better wife than he could get, in that quiet country village.
                  Cupid, however, was pluckier than the young men; pluckier, too, at that time than he is now. He had never traded in gold and silver for hearts, as he allows himself to do in these degenerate days,—I am speaking, you will please to bear in mind, of the native Cupid of New England, as he existed nigh on to half a century ago: since then even the love-gods of that immaculate land have materially changed,—and though that plucky but unsuccessful Cupid had but one arrow remaining in his quiver, he risked its loss; and one drowsy afternoon in summer time, when the buzz of the locusts in the apple-trees of the orchard, and the humming of the bees busy among the clover-tops in the meadow, were heard, even above the drone of the good old parson in the pulpit, as he neared the tenth clause of his sermon; within the very walls of the old meeting-house; under the very eyes and noses of the most sanctimonious of deacons, and while she herself was singing this apposite line, "My heart is pierced as with a sword," which appears in a paraphrase of the Forty-second Psalm, aptly commencing,— 
                        "As pants the hart for cooling streams,"
                      he sent it flying at her unguarded bosom, aimed from between the laughing eyes of a stranger, to whom the half-blind and utterly witless old sexton had given a seat in her father's pew.
                  Is it worth while to recount the story of their wooing? Is it not as old as the hills; aye, as old as the day when Goodman Adam first looked upon Mistress Eve in the garden of Eden; and have not young hearts, from that time on, through cycles of years, in spring-time and autumn, in summer and winter, on land and on sea, in the midst of lonely forests and of crowded cities, in poverty and in wealth, in sunshine and in storm, from the equator to the poles, learned it well, either for weal or for woe?
                  If the sheaf be not securely bound, it will be broken and scattered, and the almonds, so fair to the eye, may prove bitter in the mouth.
                  It is enough to say that the stranger was a man of culture, that his manners were pleasing and refined, and his speech plausible and flattering. He speedily won the confidence of the old parson, and the love of the young maiden. The days were all as May-days to her, and the summer months slipped rapidly away. Although he had won a promise from her to be his wife, he failed to gain the consent of the father to part with her.
                  "She," said the dear old man, "is my sole comfort; the only link that binds me to earth, and the single reminder left me of what my dead wife was when I first married her. I am old: only a little while longer, a few months it may be, scarcely a year, before I shall be placed in the earth, beside that precious one whose image I fondly cherish in my heart, and whom this child so closely resembles. My last days must be solaced and made precious to me by the presence of my daughter. I may be selfish in all this, but I cannot, will not spare her. Can she, will she leave me?"
                  It was a sore trial for the poor girl to decide between her father and her lover. But duty and affection triumphed over love and desire, and her choice was made. The lover entreated and threatened, wept and was angry, by turns, and sought, with all the means at his command, to induce her to alter her decision, and go with him. But she was firm and unyielding; the obligations she owed to her father outweighed all the considerations which her lover could adduce. And so, with the leaves of autumn falling around him, he left her presence, angry with her, and still angrier with her father, and declaring that he would never see her more.
                  The girl mourned his absence: forgot how to smile, went about the house silent and abstracted, toying with the engagement ring he had slipped upon her finger in a happy hour, and wept herself to sleep night after night. The old man could only sigh, as, seated in his great arm-chair, he beat with trembling fingers a tattoo on the table beside him, and watch her tenderly as she came and went in his presence.
                  One day, as Christmas drew nigh, a letter arrived from the lover, saying that he was coming to spend the holidays with them. The smile, so long vanished, came back to her lips, the color to her cheeks, and her steps grew light once more. The old man still sighed, however, and beat with restless fingers upon the table; but he was glad to perceive the change in his child.
                  And so, in due time, the lover made his appearance, and Christmas came and passed, and the last days of the year drew nigh, when a sudden and mysterious illness fell upon the old man. The learned doctors of the village could not understand the case: it was beyond their power to manage, and fairly baffled all their drugs and potions. Indeed, they quite disagreed as to the proper treatment to be pursued, and while they vainly wrangled together, the patient died. Perhaps none of the villagers were more surprised at this result than the two physicians themselves, who each laid the blame on the other, and ever afterwards dated all important matters as having occurred at such a time after that barefaced quack allowed the good old parson to die because the other would not follow the speaker's advice.
                  His congregation duly mourned the loss of their kind old pastor, and spoke of his sudden death as "one of those strange dispensations of Providence," the reason of which mortals could not be expected to comprehend. It never occurred to any of the wiseacres of the village to institute a post mortem examination of the body. If they had, perhaps, they would have discovered that he came to his death through unfair means, and this would not have been pleasant for a stranger to have heard. Whether this were really so or not, will now be likely to be known only at the judgment-day, when the last trump shall have sounded, and the graves shall have given up their dead, and every mortal shall stand before the Bar of Heaven.
                  After all was over, and the "earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust," had been pronounced; when the grave had been filled in and rounded over, and the last night of the passing year had settled in darkness above the old minister's resting-place, then the greatest mourner of all, resting trustfully on the arm of her lover, turned her footsteps for the last time towards that home where for eighteen years she had dwelt peacefully, happily, and contented.
                  Alone in the world, with none of kin to her, to whom she might turn in her affliction: what could she do but go with the one being whom she loved and trusted before all others on the earth!
                  And he: "Believe me, dearest, and trust in what I say. When we reach the city I will make you my wife."
                  And she answering: "Thy people shall be my people, and whithersoever thou goest, I will go."
                  For a year, as his wife, she lived a happy life, and then he began to grow careless of her comfort, and treated her coldly and harshly; but it was not until after the birth of a daughter, that he taunted her with being no wife of his, and declared that the ceremony by which they had been united was performed by a mock-priest, and was binding neither in the eyes of the Church nor of the world. Frenzied with shame and grief, she fled from his house, taking with her their babe. But the strong hand of her destroyer overtook her, wrested the child from her bosom, and cast her, pleading, weeping, and powerless, into the street.
                  Passively, because she had no friends to redress her wrongs, and shame, like a spectre with finger pointed at her, walked before her in the path leading up to justice, she yielded, and buried herself in a garret, from human sight and knowledge. Toiling to keep life and body together, she dwelt for years unfriended and alone, forgotten by the world, and outliving even its memory of her shame.
                  But he prospered, and grew rich. On him Fortune never seemed wearied of lavishing her tenderest smiles in the way of riches and honors. He became in time a money king, and was known, wherever stocks were bought or sold, as old Topaz. She became a seamstress, eking out a paltry livelihood by stitching shirts for a less sum apiece than Topaz was accustomed to pay for a single cigar, and finally was known as the "sad-eyed old woman, clad in rusty bombazine," who knelt upon the marble floor of the Church of Ancient Malachi. The daughter grew from infancy to childhood, and from childhood to womanhood, and became that "Cousin Kate," to touch whose Sunday robes that poor, old, broken-hearted mother only cared to live.
                  Shall I stop here? Is my story ended? Are all the sheaves broken and scattered, and all the almonds turned to bitterness? No! broken sheaves can again be bound together, and the bitterness of the almond may be changed to sweetness.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  THE SKELETON IN THE CLOSET.
                  OLD Topaz is dead. The winds of winter, hurtling through the leafless trees, whistle his requiem, the while they whirl the snow madly down on his grave. The earth is frozen hard above him, but, for all that, the crows, seeking for carrion, alight on the spot.
                  On his death-bed he called Kate to his side, and giving her, from under his pillow, the key of the strong box, locked in the inner vault of his bank in Wall Street, told her that within it she would find, besides the bonds and mortgages, and other securities and evidences of his wealth, his last will; a letter addressed to herself, and another to the rector of Ancient Malachi. Then saying that she had been an obedient and loving daughter to him, and bidding her kiss him, he turned his face to the wall, and died.
                  The funeral of the "lamented" Topaz, as the newspapers called him, was an imposing affair, and quite in keeping with his earthly state and dignity. No expense was spared, in accordance with his written directions to that effect, to make it, as the genial undertaker who supplied the coffin—a rosewood, gold plated one—happily observed, the funeral of the season. The hearse, built of plate-glass and ebony, was ornamented with tall plumes of black and white feathers, which nodded sociably to each other above the coffin; but in a dignified and mournful manner at the pedestrians, who stood on the curb-stones to look at the procession as it moved slowly and becomingly down Broadway to the Church of Ancient Malachi.
                  The hearse was preceded by several coaches containing the pall-bearers,—gentlemen of great wealth and influence "down town."—each wearing a broad, white scarf, gathered on the shoulder with a large rosette of black crape; and followed by a long train of carriages, representing millions of dollars, mountains of pride, and oceans of self-conceit. To be sure, most of these carriages were unoccupied; but this circumstance in no degree detracted from the imposing character of the proceedings. Indeed, if anything, it added to its solemnity, for, in a certain way, it expressed the desolateness and grief which, it is to be presumed, the owners of the empty carriages entertained for the deceased—a grief so deep as to deter them from appearing in public, even though it were to attend his obsequies, until time, say a day or two, had somewhat ameliorated their sorrow.
                  The sexton of Ancient Malachi was dressed in his blackest suit—a little gray on the knees from habitual kneeling, and slightly shiny on the elbows, caused by an active use of them in forcing his way through the crowd of poor parishioners within the church porch, in his endeavors to make an open passage-way for the late lamented Topaz or the irritable Carbon, as they hobbled into the aisle. He was in the best—that is to say, gloomiest of spirits. Indeed, so elated was he with the idea of assisting at the funeral obsequies of the great Topaz, that he was led to forget himself so far as to attempt to shake hands with the illustrious pall-bearers as they entered the vestibule of the church. This audacious act was incontinently frowned down by all of them, and old Carbon, who succeeded Topaz as senior warden, made a note in the back of his prayer-book to have the sexton displaced; and another to the effect that the old woman in bombazine should be instructed not to snivel at the funerals of rich men, as it jarred disagreeably on the nerves of the pall-bearers.
                  
                  Yes, the sad-eyed old woman was present, and her sobs though subdued, were heard during the pauses in the service. Could it be that any spark of love still remained in this poor woman's heart for one who had so illy treated and injured her! Did the remembrance still exist in her mind of those innocent and happy days, when he, who now lay dead before her, was fair and comely, and had wooed and won her! Did she carry no angry, bitter feelings in her bosom against him! Could she, for all her sufferings and trials, forgive, and weep for him! She could and did; for woman's love is a strange and wonderful thing, and defies all analysis.
                  Many of those present in the church wondered why that poor old woman bewailed the death of Topaz. Some thought that she must have been a pensioner on his bounty, and that notwithstanding his reputation for hardness of heart, he had ventured to do good by stealth. Others, less charitable, declared that she was a hired mourner, and had been engaged by Topaz before his death, to "wail at his funeral."
                  Kate, too, heard her sobs, and, as she passed out of the church, glanced at her so keenly that the poor old creature, either from fright or other cause, sunk, swooning, on the pavement at her feet. Kate stooped to raise her up, and as she did so, the resemblance between her own haggard and grief-worn face, and that of the old woman, was noticed by more than one of the many persons standing near.
                  The burial-service of the Church, whether it be read over saint or sinner, is alike impressive and beautiful! And from the opening sentence, "I am the resurrection and the life," to the benediction, it appeals to the most solemn feelings of man's nature, and exerts a solacing influence on the stricken hearts of the mourners.
                  The bells in the tower of Ancient Malachi tolled laboriously for old Topaz, as his remains were carried for the last time out of its walls, and again deposited in the hearse for removal to Greenwood. The procession passed through Wall Street on its way to the ferry,—for, by an express injunction laid upon his old friend Carbon, his body was to be taken through that street, where he had won his wealth, and where, if his spirit could return to earth, it would most assuredly prefer to go,—and as the cortege moved slowly along, the flags on the Chamber of Commerce, and on several of the banks, were displayed at half-mast; while the brokers on the street gathered in groups, and said one to another:—
                  "There goes old Topaz. How will he cut up?"
                  "O," is the reply, "about ten millions, they say; and his daughter gets it all."
                  "No," puts in another speaker, "she is out a few millions on that count."
                  "How so?" exclaim the others.
                  "Why, it's a curious story," is the answer, "but so far as I can learn, it seems that there is a wife living, who, of course, will come in for her third."
                  "By Jove," exclaims a fourth, "what a sly old buffer he was! up to all kinds of dodges, and yet always managing to show clean hands."
                  "Well, I wouldn't have thought," said the first speaker, "that he was much in the woman-line of business, you know. It always seemed to me that he was too closely wedded to money-getting, you know, to find time for making love. Still, he was fond of his daughter, I hear, and would scarcely allow her to go out of his sight when he was home, you know; and let her have pretty much her own way in everything."
                  "Except," was the reply, "that he prevented her, a dozen years or more ago, from marrying a young fellow, a cousin or something of that sort, I believe, whom she loved."
                  "But who," broke in the cynical one of the party, "hadn't a penny, I suppose."
                  
                  "That was it, exactly," was the reply.
                  "After all," said the cynic, "one can't blame a man for not wishing his daughter to marry a beggar."
                  "Well he wasn't a beggar, exactly, you know," the other replied, "but then, to be sure, he hadn't the rocks. Though as far as that matter, old Topaz had enough for a dozen sons-in-law, you know."
                  "But," said the cynic, "he was a careful man with his money, and could make better investments of it than by putting it into the pockets of sons-in-law. He did not give much, either, to the Church, though, as he was a warden in the vestry of Ancient Malachi, he must have been a good man."
                  "A good man," exclaimed a new comer, joining the group, "a good sinner, you mean; why, haven't you heard the news? No? bless me! why it's all over town by this time, that old Topaz, in a letter he left for the rector of Ancient Malachi, which was not to be opened until after his funeral, confessed to a murder committed more than forty years ago, on his prospective father-in-law, a minister living in some inland town in New England. The rector, though, couldn't wait until old Topaz was under ground, but as soon as he had finished the services in the church, deputing his assistant to accompany the body to Greenwood, he retired to the vestry-room, where everything was comfortable, and proceeds to read old Topaz's letter, not doubting but that it contained a bequest to him of at least half a million of dollars. You may judge of the good man's surprise when the truth was revealed to him. They say he fell down in a fit, and during the turmoil a newspaper reporter of the 'Lightning Train' rushed in, seized the confession, and will print it in full in the first edition of that paper this evening. I hear, too, that old Topaz has kept his wife shut up in a dark room, and fed her only on bread and water, ever since he married her, because she found out that he had murdered her father, through his talking aloud in his sleep, and was afraid she'd reveal it."
                  "The hoary-headed old sinner," was the indignant cry from all.
                  "Why not stop the funeral procession," proposed a speculator,—one whom Topaz had once cornered to the tune of fifty thousand,—"and seize on his dead body, and hang it on the nearest lamp-post?"
                  But as no one seemed anxious to second this proposal, he contented himself with denouncing Topaz as "a bloated old villain."
                  And with such tender expletives hurled after him, the body of Topaz went quietly on toward Greenwood, and, finally, was soberly and decently placed in mother earth, while the group of brokers adjourned in a body to Delmonico's to talk the matter over more fully and indulge in certain comforting beverages.
                  As the carriage containing Kate made its way back from Greenwood, she buried herself in the cushions and gave way to her grief. To Kate, with the sole exception of prohibiting her from marrying, Topaz had been a kind and indulgent father. She never had a wish, which money could procure, ungratified. While his hands, which clutched the money-bags with a grip of steel, opened at her lightest suggestion, to every one else they were as tightly closed as if they had been welded together, never to be loosened either through time or eternity.
                  Kate, too, had become accustomed to her father's strange whims and odd ways, and each passing year grew to love him more and more, while he loved her. To her he was always kind and affectionate, though to others he was little better than a bear in his deportment. And now that he was dead Kate mourned him deeply, and the only consolation and hope she had was that she might find her long-lost mother.
                  The letter which her father had addressed to her simply stated that he believed her mother to be still living, though where, and under what name, he could not tell. It further declared that she was his true and lawful wife, as the marriage certificate, which he inclosed, would fully prove. That for reasons which he could not unfold to his child, but which in no way cast a stain upon the honor and purity of her mother, he had, though loving her, discarded her from his heart and home.
                  The other paper, the one addressed to the rector of Ancient Malachi, stated that previous to his marriage, being on a visit to the home of his betrothed, he had, through a fatal mistake, substituted a poisonous powder for an innocuous one, an anodyne, which he gave to her father. He confessed, however, that he obtained the poison with a dim, undeveloped idea in his mind, that, if he should fail in inducing his betrothed to marry him, in opposition to her father's wishes, he would give it both to her and to himself, and thereby end their troubles. Moreover, he said, that the thought did occur to him that it could be given to the father, but that this wicked suggestion of the evil one, he solemnly declared he never meant to pursue. That he did give it was solely due to the circumstance that the two powders were put up, the one in a green and the other in a blue paper, and that in the evening, by the lamp-light, he mistook the green paper for the blue.
                  When he discovered the terrible error he had made, which was not until after the old man was dead, he was horror stricken, and would have confessed the truth, but feared to do so, lest he might be adjudged a murderer, and the woman whom he loved might be separated from him forever. So he buried the secret in his own breast, and tried to forget it, and be happy. But remorse kept eating its way into his conscience, biting more fiercely as the months went by, and affrighting his soul with the idea of discovery. He thought, too, that he babbled about it in his sleep, and feared that his wife might overhear him, and reveal the secret to others. So at last he grew afraid of her, and finally, because he could no longer endure the terror of her presence, he concocted the story of a false marriage, and soon drove her, homeless, penniless, and disgraced, from his presence.
                  He strove, by giving up his life to the attainment of wealth, to forget the past; but in the flush of his success, when riches, like the golden sands of Pactolus, flowed into his coffers from every side, the deadly fear of discovery broke upon him, and the vision of his victim peered at him through every window, and from behind every door.
                  His daughter was the only one in the world in whose presence he found solace. So long as she was near him, the visions failed to appear before him, and the skeleton shut itself up in its closet.
                  For over forty years life had been a burden to him: his sheaves had long been broken and scattered, and his almonds had proved very bitter in the mouth.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER V.
                  MY WIFE AND I.
                  OVER a year has elapsed since old Topaz died, and my wife and I, sitting before our blazing hearth, with the children clustered like kittens at our feet, are talking, this last day of the old year, of Cousin Kate and her husband, who are over the ocean keeping the Christmas holidays in England. Yes, Kate is married,—much to the openly expressed regret of the children I know; but to the secret satisfaction, I think, of my wife.
                  The daughter of the old clergyman, the wife of Topaz, the sad-eyed woman of the Church of Ancient Malachi, and the mother of Kate, presides with old-fashioned grace and dignity over the palace-like home which was left to her by her husband. Although old Topaz failed to "cut up" as richly as the Wall Street brokers thought he would, yet the four or five millions he did leave placed his widow and daughter beyond actual want, and enables the old lady to give bountifully to those Christian charities of our city—one of which, in her days of adversity, had given her a home and a support—which Topaz neglected altogether to mention in his will.
                  Kate, immediately after the funeral, instituted an active search for her mother, nor did many days elapse before, through the rector of the parish, she had the satisfaction of being once more united to that being, from whom since infancy she had been separated, and of placing her in her rightful position in that house, from which for so many years she had been an exile and an outcast.
                  In the paper which Topaz addressed to the rector of Ancient Malachi, appeared the maiden name of his wife, and a further statement that he believed her to be living and bearing that name. The rector was not long, with these links in the chain of evidence to work upon, in arriving at the conclusion that the sad-eyed old woman who had attracted his attention by her evident grief at the funeral, whose resemblance to the daughter had been observed on that occasion, and who, moreover, bore the maiden name of the discarded wife, was no other than the mother of Kate.
                  Before apprising Kate, however, of his impression, the rector visited the old woman, and, informing her of his suspicions, learned from her of their correctness; but at the same time she entreated him not to let her daughter know of her existence and her shame.
                  When he informed her, however, that she already knew the story, and was even then engaged in seeking her, the poor creature wept piteously, and begged him, by the sacred name of his mother, to keep the knowledge he had gained of her existence to himself.
                  When he told her that the truth had been revealed, and that she was indeed the wife of Topaz, and that no shame rested on her name, her fear was changed to joy, and the tears she shed were no longer those of shame and grief, but of peace and happiness. It was long, though, before she could realize the truth. Though she knew her own innocence, still the fact, as she believed it to be, that she had been deceived and betrayed, held so powerful a sway over her imagination that it caused her to regard herself, through all these long and dreary years, as being little better than the self-abandoned women who nightly trod the street under her window.
                  For more than half her life had this fearful cloud been over her, causing her to walk with downcast eyes and faltering steps, and weighed down by a deep sense of her own unworthiness, through darkened and devious ways, which led, however, though she knew it not, up to heaven's gates, over which rose the golden cross of Christ, with the dove of innocence and peace hovering above it, and the sacrificial lamb, dyed in its own blood, resting at its feet.
                  Strange, indeed, are the ways of Providence; and the means He uses to perfect his plans, what mortal shall question? We know what is, but we cannot tell what might have been. We are like— 
                        
                           "An infant crying in the night,
                           An infant crying for the light:
                           And with no answer but a cry."
                        
                     
                  
                  Some such thoughts as these pass though my mind as, on this dying night of the year, my wife and I recall to remembrance the singular story in which, though we each played a part, and of it knew somewhat, was yet, in its winding-up, as unforeseen and astounding to us as though we had never known old Topaz or delighted in claiming Kate as a cousin.
                  "And to think," said my wife, looking tenderly at me, "that after all, Kate has married. Observe, too, how curiously things come about. Here was Kate, three or four years ago, who, desirous of emulating Florence Nightingale, puts by her silken robes, together with her easy life at home, and in the humble garb of a nurse, enters a hospital where, amidst sick and dying soldiers, she binds up their wounds, holds to their burning lips the cooling draught, and with soft and gentle touch wipes the death-damp from their brows, the while she reads aloud the prayers for the dying, or listens with quick ears to the last uttered words of the sufferers—words which will yield comfort to the loved ones, when the boy, the husband, or the father will be mouldering in the earth.
                  "One night she finds herself seated at the bedside of one whose pulse flutters between life and death. She, like a ministering spirit, hovers about his couch, heedful of the slightest change in his symptoms, and attending to every want which her experience tells her is needful. Her very presence soothes and comforts him, and in his delirium he deems himself at home, and that his mother is standing beside his couch. When the morning breaks, fresh with early showers, she leaves him, thanks to her careful watchfulness, slumbering as peacefully as a child on its mother's bosom. When, late in the afternoon, she visits him again, she finds the fever gone, the pulse reduced, and the eyes clear and bright; and as they look into her face, and meet her own, the color on her cheeks comes and goes, her heart is filled with wild emotions, and beats more rapidly than it has done in years before; and she, no longer the patient nurse, who but the night previous stood calmly at his bedside, but a woman with a woman's hopes and passions, passes, with a swift step from his presence, feeling that her fate is sealed henceforth forever.
                  "Thus Kate met her future husband—a gallant officer who, though he lost an arm in the service of his country, yet won a woman's heart.
                  "Of their after meetings," continued my wife, moving nearer toward me and placing her hand on my arm,—"when convalescent he sought her side, and with the impetuosity of a soldier, told her of his love; but, strangely as he thought, could gain from her no response, although he read in her heightened color and her heaving bosom that she loved him—who may seek to lift the veil?
                  "That she gave him no encouragement by words, nor led him, through any hint or otherwise, to hope that the time would come when she would be his wife, no one who knows Kate as we do will for a moment suppose. And yet for three years he followed her and kept her name green in his heart. Even when her father died she would not have consented to marry him, had she not been able to clear away the supposed stain on her birth. Years ago, my dear, before you and I had met, Kate had confided to me, that this alone, even if her father had not objected to her marriage, was sufficient to deter her from marrying you, and would ever keep her from becoming the wife of any one, since on him as on her the disgrace of her birth must rest."
                  "Dear Kate!" I sighed, while memory went back over the vanished years to that day, when Kate, giving me back my letters and gifts, said she could never, never be my wife.
                  "Yes," continued my wife, placing an arm around my neck, and brushing back the thin hair from my forehead, "for years Kate lived under the impression that she was a child of dishonor, and this belief was impressed on her by her own father, who, aware of her delicate sense of honor, knew it would be more effectual in preventing her from marrying, and thus enable him to keep her for his own selfish comfort, than any threats or entreaties of his could accomplish. And it was with this powerful lever," said my wife, bringing her face nearer to mine, and looking into my eyes, through her soft, though tearful ones, "that he was able to force so far apart your heart and hers."
                  "The rascally old scoundrel," I exclaimed, jumping up and pacing to and fro on the rug, before the fire, with the little ones asleep thereon, "if I had known that, I'd have"—and here I shook my fist at an imaginary old Topaz, and left the rest of my sentence unuttered.
                  "Perhaps," said my wife, slyly, "the knowledge that Topaz himself had caused the death of his own father-in-law, made him a trifle shy of introducing a son-in-law into his house, lest he might suffer at his hands a fate similar to the one he so unfortunately administered to the old clergyman."
                  "It is not improbable," I said; "and, moreover, he would have deserved it. I will own, my dear," I continued, resuming the chair at her side, "that the idea of his death, in those dark days of my life, often crossed my mind; for I thought it would enable me to marry Kate: but now I see that it would not have so resulted, while it might have been the means of preventing Kate from ever knowing her mother, and have left her, indeed, to live and die believing in her own dishonor. For it was not until recently that the two letters to Kate and the rector, as their dates show, were written, and this is another proof, my dear, that Heaven is wiser than we are, and ordereth everything for the best.
                  "I cannot but acknowledge, too, that you, my love, have been the best of wives, and though in imagination I may sometimes have travelled regretfully back to the past, yet I can truly declare that in all these many years, wherein you, passing from blooming girlhood to the maturity of woman, have presided over my household gods, there never has been a happier husband than I have been, nor one who can more conscientiously say to his wife, in the words of Holy Writ: 'Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.'"
                  My wife's arms were passed around my neck, her head drooped softly on my shoulders, and thus, with the music of the bells in the neighboring church-tower, ringing out the old and in the new year, filling our ears, we sat quietly and silently together, watching the glowing fire in the grate, and glad and thankful that our sheaves were not broken and scattered, nor our almonds grown bitter in the mouth.

                           "That age is best which is the first,
                           When youth and blood are warmer;
                           But, being spent, the worse and worst
                           Times still succeed the former.
                        
                        
                           "Then be not coy, but use your time,
                           And, while ye may, go marry;
                           For having lost but once your prime,
                           You may forever tarry."
                        
                     
                     HERRICK.
                  
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER I.
                  FRANCIS ATWOOD, ESQUIRE.
                  MY name is Atwood,—Francis Atwood, Esquire. Frank, I was familiarly called, when, in the heyday of youth, twenty years ago, I was sowing my wild oats; but now that I have arrived at years of discretion, and enjoy, more than anything else, a saunter through the alleys of mine orchard, when, in the early spring-time, the air is filled with the perfume of apple-blossoms, and their white and pink leaves sail noiselessly to my feet, it appears to me that Francis is the more proper and respectful appellation. Besides, the family dignity should be maintained. As the representative of two of the oldest families in this country,—the Atwood's and the Atterberry's,—it behooves me to see that no indignity is put on the name. Sir Francis Atwood, Baronet, my great great-grandfather, was a friend of Cecilius, Lord Baltimore, and it was through the urgent invitation of Lord Baltimore that Sir Francis, in 1649, emigrated from England to this country, and settled in Maryland. Although entreated by Lord Baltimore to accept a position in the Colonial Government, Sir Francis declined to do so, and contented himself with attending to his plantation, where he cultivated tobacco to a large extent. It is hardly necessary to add that Sir Francis was an earnest disciple of the Roman Church. William Atterberry, my maternal great-great-grandfather, was, on the contrary, a Quaker. He came over to this country with William Penn, in 1682, and was one of Penn's most valued advisers.
                  It does not seem to me at all strange that my worthy progenitors, believing, as each did, in the two extremes of religious faith,—one crowded with ceremonies and the other freed from all adornment,—should, in living up to the ultima thule of their opinions, have finally met on a common ground. I would like to have witnessed the courtship between the grandson of the proud old Catholic, Sir Francis, and the granddaughter of the equally proud old Quaker, William. If anything the Quaker had more pride in his composition than the baronet. Indeed, I don't know of a prouder people at this day than the Quakers. Their very simplicity of life is founded on pride, and they and the Catholics are the only Christian sects in this country who are so exclusive as to deny the right of their children to marry outside of the pale of their religious belief. If solemnized by the Church, the marriage between a Catholic and a heretic is valid; but no Quaker can marry a dissenter without being liable to be "read out of meeting." Human nature is so made up of contraries, that it seems to take especial delight in bringing together persons of opposing elements. The tall and the short, the blonde and the brunette, the loquacious and the silent, the quiet and the gay not unusually come to love and wed each other. And so, when young Francis Atwood married Susan Atterberry, notwithstanding the frowns and objections of the parents and grandparents, there was a union of dispositions and temperaments so dissimilar through natural and educational causes, that every one prophesied for them a life of disturbance and unrest. The contrary was however the case: not only was there a union of hearts and hands, but a perfect union of soul and spirit,—so much so, indeed, that it became common to say of them, "their lives have run into one."
                  It was not until 1703,—ten years after their marriage,—and in the beginning of Queen Anne's reign, that Francis Atwood and his wife, being on a visit to England at the time, withdrew from their respective religious sects, and were admitted to the communion of the Established Church of England. Their portraits, painted at this time by Sir Godfrey Kneller, still adorn the walls of the ancestral home of the Atwoods, in Warwickshire, England. Copies of these portraits, which I have in my possession, represent a very handsome couple. He, with his long hair falling over a lace collar, a short cloak of velvet hanging carelessly from one shoulder, and half-covering a doublet of crimson velvet, and with his right hand resting on the hilt of his half-drawn sword, looks the gay cavalier he was. She is attired in a pearl-colored satin gown, exceedingly short-waisted, and displaying, through the folds of lace covering it, her bosom, in a most enticing manner. Her complexion is fair, her eyes blue and liquid, and her hair of an auburn tint. None of their descendants of this period, I am sorry to say, are as good-looking as they were.
                  It is in commemoration of the names of Atwood and Atterberry that I call my place in the country Woodberry Park. Here, with my widowed sister, Priscilla Maria Bliss,—whom I, jocularly referring to the initials of her Christian name, sometimes term my evening bliss,—I live a quiet, peaceful life, save when her son, Alcibiades Marius, my nephew, comes at college vacation time to stir up my stagnant blood, and make night vocal with his persevering efforts at winding the mellow horn. As for myself, it is hardly necessary for me to state that I am a bachelor, something past forty years of age, with a predilection for landscape gardening, and the raising of strawberries, pears, and celery. I have, also, as my sister terms it, an idiotic idea (as if idiots could have any ideas at all) that I can mix a salad better than any man living. My old friend, the Reverend Benjamin Bacon, with whom I often wag beards over a bottle of wine, contends with me, however, for supremacy as a salad mixer. That he can excel me in writing a sermon, and, probably,—because he has had experience,—in the reading of the marriage service, I freely admit; but that he knows how to concoct a salad I deny. Like his sermons, they are apt to be a little too vinegarish. While a little more of the oil of Christian charity, and a little less of the vinegar of self-righteousness, would improve his sermons; so, too, would a little more olive oil, and a little less wine vinegar improve his salads. Ben, notwithstanding his shortcomings in these particulars, is a good fellow. We were boys together; played truant from school with one another; studied out of the same books; were flogged, time and again, by the same master, at the same hour, for the same faults; fought each other, for cause and without cause, now one, and then the other coming off victor. We have made love together, happily not to the same maiden, though, fortunately, with the like results, for Ben is a bachelor and so am I. Finally, Ben is the only one of all my boyhood friends who has gone hand and glove with me through life. He is the only one, too, whom I meet daily, who calls me Frank, and I am the only one who calls him Ben. So, it would take something more than the matter as to the mixing of a salad to separate Ben and I. Besides all this, I knew Ben's mother, and Ben knew mine.
                  It was only last New Year's Day that Ben and I alone together passed the day. It was a stormy winter day, and no one came to see us, nor did we go to see anybody. So while the Parson was taking his after-dinner nap, I wrote the following lines, entitled—
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              BEN AND I.
                              
                                 The wild New Year has come to town,
                                 With a dash of stormy weather;
                                 But Ben and I care nought for his frown,
                                 As we gather around the mahogany brown,
                                 While we wag our beards together.
                              
                              
                                 We welcome his coming with song and toast—
                                 With "Good luck!" to the jolly fellow;
                                 For a short twelve months he will be our host,
                                 And then he will vanish away like a ghost,
                                 While we o'er his corse get mellow,
                              
                              
                                 The sleet may beat on the window-pane,
                                 And the wind round the gable whistle;
                                 But we'll laugh at the storm that gathers amain,
                                 And we'll fill up our glasses with rare champagne
                                 And chant from our Christmas-missal.
                              
                              
                                 The friends we love best are far away;
                                 Hills, valleys, and seas divide us:
                                 For some are dancing in Paris gay,
                                 And others have gone to Rome to pray,
                                 And there's not one left beside us.
                              
                              
                                 But Ben and I at the table sit,
                                 A couple of ancient chummies;
                                 And if we launch some shafts of wit,
                                 'Tis our absent friends, not ourselves, we hit,
                                 As we play our whist with dummies.
                              
                              
                                 'Tis forty good years since he and I
                                 Were truants from school together;
                                 And though we may think of the past with a sigh,
                                 Our hearts are still warm as a summer's sky,
                                 And as light as a gray goose-feather.
                              
                              
                                 O, the mad, gay times we two have seen!
                                 And to think that they're gone forever!
                                 The spring with its days of tender green,
                                 The summer with nights of silvery sheen,
                                 And the hearts only death could sever!
                              
                              
                                 And what has become of Ned and Joe,
                                 Whom we clung to more than others?
                                 They've gone, alas! where the dead men go,
                                 And the places that knew them no more shall know
                                 The two whom we loved as brothers
                              
                              
                                 And where's little Kate, with her laughing face,
                                 Whom Ben in his soul once cherished?
                                 And Fan, with a more than Juno grace,
                                 Who for years in my heart held a sacred place?
                                 Alas! like our hopes, have they perished?
                              
                              
                              
                                 No; Fan is a widow, and wears her weeds
                                 In the most becoming of fashions:
                                 And Kate in a convent tells her beads,
                                 And believes in the Pope and good Catholic creeds,
                                 And we have outlived our passions.
                              
                              
                                 We shake our heads as the seasons pass,
                                 Our jovial lives recalling;
                                 And we care no more for a pretty lass
                                 Than we do for the butter-cups decking the grass,
                                 Or the snow-flakes slowly falling.
                              
                              
                                 So the years may come, and the years may go,
                                 In pleasant or stormy weather;
                                 But Ben and I will chuckle and crow,
                                 Nor envy the love that other men know,
                                 While we wag our beards together.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  Ostensibly, Ben lives at the parsonage, but no one ever thinks of going there to find him. That he sleeps there occasionally, and even writes one or two sermons there in the course of a year, his aged housekeeper will, perhaps, confirm. He says the house is damp, that the graveyard, that nearly surrounds it, makes it unhealthy, and that, moreover, there are ghosts about. I have always thought the house was haunted, and, though I confess I never saw a ghost there, yet I have heard most mysterious noises, and one night, when I stayed there, detained by a storm, I was terribly annoyed by a nightmare. Ben says that nightmares run wild all over the house, and that they nocturnally chase the rats and mice up and down the wainscots and between the ceilings. At all events, Ben don't find the parsonage a pleasant place to live in, and, therefore, passes the greater part of his time at Woodberry Park.
                  Woodberry Park is appropriately named, since a portion of it is well wooded, and the berries, wild and cultivated, that grow along its boundary fences and in its garden, keep its table supplied all the year round. Fruits and vegetables of all kinds, that grow out of doors in this locality ity, flourish under the hands of the gardener, and flowers and plants make glad the heart of my sister.
                  Books, especially in the winter season, form my greatest solace; and, with Ben to talk to, my days glide happily along.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER II.
                  REVEREND BENJAMIN BACON.
                  THE Reverend Benjamin Bacon is one of the most eccentric of parsons. Tall and slim, and dressed in a close-fitting suit of black, he reminds one, as he stalks along the street, swinging his arms from side to side, of an animated sign-post. He is very near-sighted withal, a defect which sometimes leads him into making ludicrous blunders. Once, in the dusk of evening, he apologized very politely to the town-pump for running against it, though as he had his spectacles knocked off in the encounter, and bruised his nose besides, while the pump itself suffered no material injury, it would have been only courteous in the pump to have expressed its regret at the occurrence. The Parson has the habit of walking along the streets with his eyes cast upon the ground, as if searching for lost pieces of silver, at the same time meditating over his next Sunday's sermon. And it was this unfortunate habit which caused him to come into collision with the handle of the town-pump. And he apologized, he said, because in the twilight he took the pump for my sister Priscilla, standing in her favorite attitude, with her arms akimbo. This incident furnished the Parson with a theme for many a happy discourse, delivered outside of his pulpit, of pleasant moonlight evenings in summer time, seated on the veranda, or, within the walls of the library, in winter time. I would be much inclined to believe that Hawthorne took notes for his charming essay, entitled "A Rill from the Town-Pump," from the Parson's talk, were it not that the former was dead ere the latter met with his famous encounter. When I tell the Parson that the only thing in history that will compare favorably with his attack on the pump, is the encounter between Don Quixote and the wind-mills, he is inclined to be vexed, and wishes to know if I think he is as cracked-brained a fool as was the Knight of La Mancha.
                  To which I reply that as the Knight was simply the personification of chivalry, he ought not to feel aggrieved at the comparison; and, moreover, if this were annoying to him, how much more ought my sister to be annoyed for being mistaken for the town-pump. This usually confounds the Parson, who immediately changes the subject of conversation.
                  While the Parson is a strict Churchman, accepting the Liturgy as it now exists, nor desiring any revision of it, and following the Rubrics as set forth in the Book of Common Prayer, and even questioning the propriety of printing them otherwise than in red, yet he is not a Ritualist, or, putting it more mildly, even a High Churchman, any more than he is a Low Churchman. When, twenty years ago, he entered the ministry, the divisions which are now disturbing the Episcopal Church were unknown, or, at least, did not excite the attention of Churchmen in this country to the extent they are now doing.
                  "Why the Church at this day," the Parson once pertinently remarked, "should vary in any way from its former practices, I do not understand. Its teachings and ordinances, as followed for centuries past, are good enough for me and my flock to live and die by; and as for any change whatsoever, I'll none of it. There is an old proverb, applicable and to the point, which says: 'Leave well enough alone.'"
                  Owing, therefore, to the Parson's consistency,—or, as I term it, conservatism,—no disturbing element of a doctrinal character has ever arisen in his church. Once in a while there is war among the members of the choir,—a war which defies even the Parson's wisest words and most conciliatory speech to overcome, and in which, vanquished and discomfited as a mediator, he is, perforce, compelled to allow the contending parties to fight it out between themselves. The leaders in the war are, usually, the organist and the chief chorister. These two high powers seem to be natural antagonists, and, when the war is at its height, and rages most violently, the scowlings of the leaders at one another are fearful to behold. Then it is that the organist plays the most solemn of music in a style and with a rapidity that makes it difficult for the congregation to decide whether they are listening to "Yankee Doodle," the "Star Spangled Banner," or an air from the opera of "La Grande Duchesse;" and it is not until the chorister, with his part of the choir, continues slowly and impressively, after the notes of the organ have ceased, to sing the concluding lines of the Te Deum, or psalm, as it may be, that they are enabled to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion in the matter.
                  Once when a musical war was raging, the good Parson astonished the choir, at the beginning of the morning prayer, by saying that he would dispense with the usual music and singing, and requested the congregation to join him in reciting the anthems and psalms. Thereupon both the organist and chorister indignantly withdrew from the scene of their labors, and for several Sundays thereafter the services were conducted without assistance from the choir.
                  To further illustrate the independent spirit of my friend the Parson, I would relate that on the occasion of the sexton's striking for higher wages, one spring, just as Lent commenced, the Parson assumed his duties, not only ringing the bell for daily service, but keeping up the fires in the church, so effectually as to set fire to the church, and thereby nearly destroying it. Owing to the circumstance that the Parson's bell-ringing was what may be termed of a secular more than a sacred character, he had in his early efforts succeeded several times in bringing the village engines gines out, under the impression that an alarm for fire was sounding; but after a few "turnouts" they grew wiser, having learned the style of the Parson's ringing. So it happened, that when the Parson did in reality ring for fire, the firemen paid no attention to it, and the church was nearly burnt down in consequence.
                  This was only another rendering, I told the Parson, of the boys and the shepherds: the boys cried "Wolves, wolves!" and the shepherds, in a neighboring field, going to their rescue, found themselves made sport of; so, at last, when the wolves really did come, the shepherds, remembering the trick played upon them, gave no heed to their calls, and the result was the young scapegraces were eaten up.
                  When the Parson first came into the parish, fifteen years ago, he was, comparatively speaking, a young man, with pleasing manners, and agreeable in conversation. Being unmarried he speedily became the target for all the marriageable ladies, and mothers with daughters on their hands, to throw hearts at. The number of "tea squalls," as he quaintly termed them, to which he was weekly invited, was enough to have driven any other than a professed celibate like the Parson into matrimony. He, although he often felt the noose tightening around his throat, never failed to loose it at the proper moment, escaping with only a few black and blue spots around his neck, to show where, figuratively speaking, loving arms had been twined. It took several years for the young and otherwise ladies of the village to ascertain the fact that the Reverend Benjamin Bacon was not a marrying man. After this had been satisfactorily learned by the old inhabitants, there would occasionally happen along a new comer who had to be taught the same lesson. Without really enjoying his position as tutor in these matters, I do not think they ever caused him many sleepless nights; for he would come forth from these encounters with a lightness of spirit and a radiance of countenance only to be accounted for by the reason that victory tory had, as it were, again perched upon his shepherd's crook.
                  There is one lady, however, who has never given up her wooing of him, and of whom, I am certain, he stands in dread. Twice since she first cast loving eyes upon him has he had the satisfaction of uniting her, in the happy bonds of matrimony, with other than himself, and twice has she, undoubtedly, frightened them into the grave, by telling them how much better a husband the Parson would have made her, and how much happier she would have been with him. She probably failed to state, however, that all her efforts to win him had been futile. Now once more this lively widow has an opportunity to get the Parson in her toils, and he, I believe, trembles when he thinks of the attack she will make on him when the days of her mourning are numbered.
                  He, however, gathering more closely around him the surplice of his calling, and holding the cross of Christ more firmly in his hands, will, like the good Saint Anthony, fix his eyes more earnestly than ever on the Book, and bid the cheerful widow to do her worst.
                  It was, as I tell the Parson, a beautiful woman with two blue eyes who finally caused the dear old Saint, even Anthony, to break his vows. Perhaps the Parson will succumb even as he did.
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  ALCIBIADES SOWS A FEW OATS.
                  "'TIS no more than I expected," said the Parson, shoving his spectacles upon his forehead, and folding the letter he had been reading; "no more, madam, than Frank and I used to do, when we were boys. Young men, my dear Mrs. Priscilla, will be young men. They all have a certain quantity—some more and some less than others—of wild oats to sow; and I hold to the opinion that it is better to sow them in youth than in manhood. I have seen wild oats planted by generous, free-hearted lads like your son, that, when harvested, turned out to be sweet-peas. No such pleasant miracle happens, however, if the oats are sown when the sun of life is approaching its meridian: then the seed comes up after its kind, and a very bad kind, too, it often is. No, madam, let not your heart be troubled about Alcibiades. His shutting up the cow in the college chapel over night, is not, after all, such a very heinous offense, and hardly deserved the punishment of a month's rustication awarded to him for it by the faculty."
                  "But," said my sister, wiping her eyes with a corner of her apron, "think of the disgrace of being rusticated,—a disgrace that falls not only on Alcibiades, but on all of us."
                  "Tut, tut!" I exclaimed, "hang the disgrace. No doubt the young rascal feels it keenly, and it's right that he should; but I've no doubt that this bit of rustication will be of service to him, and that, under the Parson's tuition, he will, on his return to college, reach the head of his class. You see by his letter," I continued, taking it from the Parson, "that he is already contrite."
                  
                  My sister shook her head.
                  "No?" I exclaimed, interrogatively; "let me read it to you."
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "ALL HAIL COLLEGE, June 10, 1869.
                              
                              "DEAR GOVERNOR,—I'm in for it now. Rusticated for a month just for shutting up a cow over night in the pulpit of the college chapel,—a pulpit which, many a time, I've seen occupied by a donkey. The poor beast got hungry in the night and ate up the cushions, which were stuffed with bran, and, indeed, made herself at home generally. The earliest attendants at chapel in the morning discovered her reverence, with her fore-feet resting on the top of the reading-desk, and looking as wise as a fifty years old professor. They had quite a time getting her down the pulpit-stairs, and out of the chapel,—much more than we had in getting her there. Of course I was not alone in the scrape, but, with my usual luck, I was the only one discovered,—a handkerchief, with my name in full on it, being found, under the feet of the cow, in the pulpit. So, when accused, there was nothing for me to do but to own up, though I refused to reveal the names of my companions,—the consequence being that I am obliged to take their, as well as my own, share of punishment.
                              "Break the news gently to my mother, who, I know, will grieve sadly over it; and tell her that I am both sorry and ashamed of it, and that I will endeavor, under Uncle Ben's rigid tutoring, to accomplish more in my studies than I would if I were to remain here.
                              "Send John to the station for me to-morrow afternoon; and, till then, believe me to be,
                              
                                 "Your penitent nephew,
                                 "ALCIBIADES."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  "There," I said, as I finished the reading, "you see that he declares himself to be penitent, so let us receive him kindly, and"—
                  "Kill," said the Parson, interrupting me, "the fatted calf."
                  "Parson Ben," I said, "you speak wisely: we will kill the fatted calf, and make glad and be merry, for to-morrow will be the lad's birthday."
                  His mother heaved a little sigh, and smiled through her tears, as she remembered that the next day would, indeed, be her son's birthday,—and that eighteen years had gone by since she first held him in her arms, and pressed his velvety cheeks against her yielding bosom. This memory softened her heart towards the young scapegrace, and did much toward reconciling her to his coming home.
                  So my sister went to make ready for the feast, the Parson returned to the sermon he was writing on the prodigal son, and I, lighting a cigar, took from my desk a package of old letters, and from one, bearing date June 1, 1850, I read,—
                  "To-day my sister Priscilla was married to Captain Henry Bliss, of the American navy. How long must it be, sweet one, before you consent to name our wedding-day. Life is too short for either you or I to let its best years run to seed. Already have I waited patiently five years, and still you say not yet. Why should you, for what, after all, is only a whim of your father's, forego your life's happiness, and doom me to a solitary and wearisome existence? You say that it is duty that leads you to do it, but I say that no man of a kind and generous nature would require of his daughter the sacrifice you are making. Such a one he neither deserves, nor can he appreciate it."
                  Another letter, written the same month, reads thus:—
                  "You say, my love, that I have no right to judge your father as I have, and as his daughter you cannot permit it. Pardon, I have the right. When you yielded your heart to me, confessing that you loved me, and promising some day to be my wife, you became, before Heaven, if not before fore man, my wife in all that is pure and holy; then it was that you gave me the power to question the right of any one to come between us and our love. From that moment father and mother, brother and sister, lost all claim to priority in your affection."
                  Another letter:—
                  "You cannot accept my views as right, nor be guided thereby. So let it be. I will press you no more to fulfill your promise; but will wait, silently and uncomplainingly, for you who now see your duty, as through a glass, darkly, to discover how warped and destroyed it is."
                  Thus ended the only love passage ever written on the pages of my heart. Measuring time, not by years, but by the bitterness of unfulfilled desires, I should say that this little episode in my life occurred centuries ago, and that the being who broke her own heart, and made me an avoider of woman, through a mistaken sense as to her duty, ought to be by this time, older, and yellower, and more wrinkled than the mummies placed in the Pyramids during the times of the Pharaohs. And yet they tell me she is a very buxom-looking woman, and that, though her hair is streaked with gray and crow-feet creep around her eyes, she has more admirers in her train, as, with her old father leaning on her arm, she paces the piazza of Leland's at Saratoga, than half the belles who flirt and dance around her.
                  Many years have gone by since she and I last met. Many apple-trees have blossomed and borne fruit, and the fruit been garnered since then. Yet still, when I think of her, my heart pulses more rapidly than usual, and the dreams and visions of youth once more fill my mind and crowd upon my memory. We do not readily forget the loves of early life. We may think for a while that they are dead and buried, and that the orange-blossoms our fair ones might have worn in their hair upon the wedding-day day that never came, now grows above their graves; but we are apt to be mistaken, and a word, a sigh, a tone of music, or a touch of a hand, will recall the half-forgotten past, and make the love smouldering in ashes to burn as warmly and brightly as of yore.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  A LIGHT DESSERT, WITH TARTS.
                  ALCIBIADES has partaken of the fatted calf. In fact, its remains have just been taken from the table, and the young man, together with the Parson, his mother, and myself, are waiting for the dessert to be placed before us.
                  "You have given us, my dear," I said, in reply to a regret my sister uttered, as the meats were being removed, that a richer dinner had not been prepared,—"you have given us," I repeated, to make it the more emphatic, "a better dinner than this young scapegrace deserved, even on his birthday: a dinner, the savor of which—because prepared under your direction—will be recalled to my mind, and smell sweet, even in the presence of more costly and richer feasts."
                  "Parodying Wordsworth, I may say of it," remarked the Parson, "that it was— 
                        
                           "'A dinner not too rich or good,
                           For human nature's daily food—
                           For appetite and simple taste:
                           Chickens and veal—all else were waste.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "But, indeed," my sister said, smiling, "the dinner is not yet ended; I have a light dessert, with tarts, which I think you will relish."
                  "Say on, ma mere," cried the incorrigible Alcibiades, "and choked be he who first cries Hold—enough."
                  My sister smiled, somewhat gravely, however, and glanced at the champagne bottle, nearly emptied, on her son's side of the table. She said nothing, though; but a slight pause ensued, as the dessert was being placed on the table, while I silently watched the beads effervescing in my glass.
                  "When I was a school-boy," I said, as my sister handed to me a plate of pastry, "there was nothing my appetite so delighted in as a gooseberry tart. And I am sure that Alcibiades, collegian as he is, knows the shop of the pastry-cook better in Old Dorp than he does the college chapel. Hey, Al?"
                  The young man winced at this, but said nothing.
                  "It was, if I mistake not," said the Parson, coming to the lad's rescue, "Tom Hood who said— 
                        
                           "'I used to revel in a pie, or puff,
                           Or tarts—we are all tartars in our youth—
                           Indeed, all human children have a sweetish tooth.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "Yes," said the gay young man, recovering his spirits; "and elsewhere he acknowledges that he likes, even above a tart,— 
                        
                           "'The sweetmeats almost sweeter still,
                           No satis to the jams.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "While I have somewhat lost," I said, "the relish for sweet things which in my boyhood made me wish to be a confectioner or pastry-cook, I am thankful that I still have an appreciation of tarts. There is something about a gooseberry tart," I continued, taking a forkful—for the tart I was eating was a gooseberry—and holding it within an inch of my mouth, "that elevates it above all others. This may somewhat be owing to its rarity; for the gooseberry is not as common in our gardens now as it once was. Perhaps no shrub fruit is so difficult to grow as this; unless the season be warm and dry, the fruit is apt to mould or not reach perfection."
                  "Besides," my sister said, interrupting me, "of late years, the rhubarb plant has usurped its place in the concoction of pies and tarts."
                  "True," remarked the Parson, "but the rhubarb pie or tart is to the gooseberry what mock-turtle soup is to the real turtle—very good in its way, but not to be depended upon. No alderman, with any regard for his reputation, would sit down to a dish of mock instead of green turtle soup; nor should any lover of gooseberry tarts seek to console himself for their absence by partaking of rhubarb instead. Rhubarb medicinally taken in pills, is well enough; but I object to taking anything of the name in the way of a dessert."
                  "Garrick," I said, "who knew as well as any man a good dinner from a poor one, and was, moreover, partial to turtle and gooseberry tarts; and who, in his lines on Quin, the actor, says,— 
                        
                           "'Let me embalm this flesh of mine
                           With turtle-fat and Bordeaux wine,
                           And spoil the Egyptian trade,'—
                        
                      would not have submitted, even in his hungriest moments, to either mock-turtle or rhubarb tarts."
                  "Well, all that I can say," said my sister, "is, he would have been a most foolish man, and deserved to go hungry."
                  "Perhaps," said the Parson, "he would have eaten them under protest."
                  This remark amused Alcibiades, who said that they often eat their morning hash at college under the protest of a round-robin; but that it did no good, because, he supposed, their appetites never seemed to fail them, and they always eat as heartily of the hash as they did of any dish they liked better. As for gooseberry tarts, he said, helping himself to a fifth one, why, they never saw one, and were only too glad to get rhubarb pie.
                  "Dr. Johnson,"—not the M. D. of our village, but the LL. D. of—ever so long ago, the Ursa Major of letters,—I said, "was an appreciator of gooseberries, and said of some that were saved on a bush for him, he was neither too proud nor too wise to gather them. Nor have I any doubt but he enjoyed a gooseberry tart as well as I do."
                  Here my sister helped me to a second tart.
                  "In Sir John Sinclair's 'Correspondence,'" said the Parson, who usually became quite prosy toward the close of dinner, perhaps because he drank so little wine, "I remember reading of an enthusiastic experimentalist in agriculture who formed an idea that he could make his fortune by an improved mode of cultivating the soil. His plan was to plant on his eight acres forty thousand gooseberry-bushes, and, because his wife desired it, in the interstices between the bushes to raise cabbages. Strangely enough, as he thought, his gooseberry-bushes came to naught, while his wife's cabbages turned out profitably, and made his fortune. She ever afterward called him by the endearing name of goosey."
                  "Which was," my sister said, "a just appellation."
                  "The eating of tarts," I said, "according to Sir Walter Scott, is no 'inelegant accomplishment;' for a tart, as he says, should be bitten into, not cut, and it is not every one who can take a tart in his fingers without soiling them. School-boys, like Alcibiades, can do it, for they have constant practice, and the men in town who lunch at Delmonico's counter on tenpenny tarts may be expert, but the Parson and myself, who have outgrown our school-boy tricks, prefer a knife and fork."
                  "No knife, if you please," said the Parson, "simply a fork."
                  "Or chop-sticks," suggested Alcibiades, "such as our friends the Japanese use."
                  "Yes," said the Parson, "but I prefer them for rice. When I was a missionary at Hong-Kong, I became quite expert in handling them, and could gobble up as much rice, in as short a time, as the liveliest eater among my Celestial friends. There was one poor fellow, though, an Englishman, but a very good missionary, who was unfortunately choked to death by swallowing—or, rather, not swallowing—one of the sticks. They are quite as bad to get in one's throat as a fork would be, and almost invariably get into the throats of foreigners who incautiously handle them."
                  "That is horrible," I said; "I think I will never go to China. Why, it is worse than eating gooseberries with the furze on, and I would rather any time—indeed, several times—stay at home, and eat a chop—a mutton-chop, I mean."
                  Now the Parson had never been to China, and had never eaten rice with chop-sticks, or, indeed, any kind of sticks, and this romancing on his part was something novel to Alcibiades, who received everything he said—as who should not from a Parson?—for gospel truth.
                  So Alcibiades asked the Parson about China and its people, and the latter, being well read in the matter, gave the youth, from time to time thereafter, a deal of information regarding it. It even seemed to me, as I listened to him, day after day, as he talked to Alcibiades, that he must have lived in China to have gained the knowledge he possessed, and that he could not have gained it all from books.
                  Then, over our nuts, such nuts as Thomson, in his "Seasons," sings, we lingered.
                  "Do you know," asked the Parson, "that Thomson has a good word to say for almost all the dishes of which we have partaken to-day? Of these nuts he says, addressing the virgins,— 
                        
                           "'For you their latest song
                           The woodlands raise; the clustering nuts for you
                           The lover finds amidst the secret shade;
                           And, where they burnish on the topmost bough,
                           With active vigor crushes down the tree;
                           Or shakes them ripe from the resigning husk,
                           A glossy shower, and of an ardent brown,
                           As are the ringlets of Priscilla's hair.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  Hereupon my sister reminded the Parson that her hair was slightly touched with gray, but that Melinda's hair, which the poet celebrated, was undoubtedly— 
                        
                           "Brown in the shadow,
                           Golden in the sun."
                        
                     
                  
                  "Thomson," I said, "even has a good word to say about wine, for he speaks of— 
                        
                           "'Claret smooth, red as the lip we press
                           In sparkling fancy, while we drain the bowl;
                           The mellow-tasted Burgundy; and quick
                           As is the wit it gives, the gay champagne.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "And now," I continued, filling the glasses around the table, "let us drink to the lad whose birthday we keep: 
                        
                           "May he grow each year in grace,
                           And bring to none of us disgrace."
                        
                     
                  
                  The mother smiled, the boy looked lovingly towards her, and the Parson said "Amen."
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER V.
                  ALCIBIADES FALLS IN LOVE.
                  "I REALLY believe," said my sister, as the lad, mounted on his pony, the other afternoon, rode out of the gateway, "that Alcibiades is in love."
                  "Nonsense!" exclaimed the Parson, lighting a fresh cigar; "why, he's scarcely able to walk alone yet. It would be, though, confounded odd if it were so."
                  "But it is so," said my sister, "and with the school-mistress, at that."
                  "Good heavens!" I cried; "why, she is old enough to be his mother."
                  "Not quite," my sister replied, "though she is older than he."
                  "I should say she was, a trifle," said the Parson; "why, she was one of my earliest persecutors when I first visited the parish twenty-five years ago."
                  "It was her mother of whom you are thinking," my sister said; "Kate was scarcely born so long ago."
                  "School-teaching, then, runs in the family," said the Parson, "for I'll be bound it was the school-mistress who made love to me in those pristine days."
                  "Yes," my sister said; "and she afterwards married, and the year following, on the death of her husband, she resumed her place as teacher."
                  "I remember," said the Parson, "she married that reckless fellow, Tom White, who blew himself up with a quantity of fireworks one Fourth of July, leaving Mrs. White and little Kate to get along the best way they could. Do you know,—he once owned the parsonage, and when he was first married, lived there; but that was years ago. Ah, well, how time flies! I can hardly believe it was so long ago. Kate now must be twenty-three or four years old, and Alcibiades is only eighteen. Yes; she is too old for him,—that is certain."
                  "The first love of a boy, curiously enough," I said, "is usually given to a woman older than himself. How do you account for that, Parson?"
                  "Why, there is nothing more simple in human philosophy: boys are taught to regard their mothers as models of womankind, and, naturally, their standard of admiration for another is governed by that other's resemblance in manner and bearing to their one ideal—their mother. So that a woman of mature years is more likely to win a boy's love than is a young girl; it is a natural instinct rather than reason that guides him in the choice. He soon outgrows this, however, and takes kindly to the blossom rather than to the ripened fruit. Miss Kate, now, for various reasons, is more mature and thoughtful than many young women of her age, and, now that I think of it, her face and bearing is somewhat like your own, Mistress Priscilla, so that it is not surprising that the boy admires her."
                  "But, pray," I asked, "does Miss Kate encourage him?"
                  "Not that I can perceive," said my sister. "She seems unconscious of the admiration she has excited, and treats him simply as a school-boy. He is very much given to taking her flowers, and has robbed my garden of its choicest blossoms. Every afternoon he rides over to the school-house to meet her, and, I believe, walks home with her through the woods."
                  "Botanizing and geologizing, I suppose," said the Parson, with a slight sigh, "as they walked. I have been there myself," he continued, "and it is very pleasant while it lasts; but the ending is not so agreeable."
                  "Without asking my consent," said my sister, "Alcibiades has invited Miss Kate, in my name, to dine with us on Saturday."
                  "It was cool in the boy, to do so," I said.
                  "Never mind," said the Parson, "let her come. He is building his castle very fast, and it will topple over before many days. By the way," he asked, "how, Mistress Priscilla, do you and the Professor get along? I have not seen him here lately. It can't be that you have pulled away the foundation from under his castle yet!"
                  My sister laughed.
                  "His castle," I said, "is built on a foundation of dead men's bones. On its walls, instead of pictures, hang beautiful skeletons; the bowls that adorn its tables are made out of the skulls of his buried friends and enemies; and its decanters, though filled with spirits, contain within priceless specimens of deceased humanity."
                  "Shocking!" said my sister.
                  "If the Professor continues to send you," I said, "as heretofore, polished bones and malformations of various kinds, modeled in wax, instead of books and flowers, you will soon be able to open an anatomical museum, where Alcibiades can study surgery with little expense to himself."
                  "I never believed it was true," said the Parson, "that the Professor's last gift to you was a hand in wax, a heart in spirits, and a rib-bone highly polished."
                  "Nor was it," she answered, indignantly. "The Professor has never presented me with any gift; and if he ever brought any bones or anything else into the house, they were for you and my brother, and not for me."
                  And my sister thereupon went out into the kitchen to make some biscuits for tea.
                  "Do you really think, Parson," I asked, when we were alone, "that the boy has fallen in love with the school-mistress?"
                  "I think he has," he replied; "something of the kind impressed itself on my mind when Al, who has no taste for singing, even if he had the voice, took a seat next to her in the choir at church last Sunday. I think, too, that he has it very severely, and it has broken out all over him, like the measles; still, he'll get over it, and it is better for him to have it here at home, under his mother's eyes, than down at Old Dorp, with no one to look after him. Besides, Miss Kate, when she perceives his condition, will not encourage him; nor yet rudely repel him; but will lower his castle very gently to the ground, and, perhaps, give him a little vanilla cream, in the form of sage advice, to cool off with. At Old Dorp he might have fallen into the hands of some thoughtless woman, who would have taken him in a balloon above the clouds, only that he might have the further to fall when he dropped to earth; or even worse might have happened."
                  "True," I said; "but do you suppose that Miss Kate is not aware of the impression she has made on his too susceptible heart?"
                  "No," he replied; "else she would not have consented to come here to dine. She is a young woman of too correct principles to do anything of that kind."
                  "Might there not be," I added, "considerations over-riding any reasons connected with Alcibiades, which would induce her to come?"
                  "I think not," said the Parson, sending a halo of smoke around his head.
                  "Might she not," I persisted, "have a thought in her little head, that her coming might lead to her being, one day, the Parson's wife, and so, in a general way, the lad's aunt, instead of his wife!"
                  "Monstrous!" exclaimed the Parson, making two distinct syllables of the word. "Why, I'm old enough to be her father."
                  
                  "Well," I replied, "what of it? Would that prevent you from being her husband, if you wished?"
                  "But I don't wish it," he said. "Am I forever to be stirred up from my dreams of celibacy, as if I were a wild beast? If Miss Kate has any such thoughts in her noddle, I'll soon drive them out. Zounds! If I don't marry her to Alcibiades in spite of herself, or anybody else." And the Parson strode in a rage into the garden.
                  I always thought that Parson Ben, when a youth, loved Miss Kate's mother. He was a lad fresh from college then, and the school-mistress was as good-looking as Miss Kate is now, and—older than he. Therefore it was that the Parson declared it to be "confounded odd," and sighed a trifle when he spoke of the botanizing walks through the woods. I think the Parson never got fairly over that little episode in his life. And though he sees his charmer every Sunday now, in her pew, looking comely and neat, in her black silk dress, she stirs no emotions in his breast. Yes, the fires of his early love are covered too deep with cold, dry ashes, ever again to kindle into a blaze. They may smoulder on while life lasts, but their warmth and brightness have forever perished. Let us trust that Alcibiades' love will not, by being turned aside, pass from sight, nor his heart be seared till it, like the Parson's, opens no more to tender emotions.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  THE PROFESSOR.
                  THE Professor, to whom the Parson, in by-play with my sister, alluded the other day, is quite as eccentric and odd in his movements as is the Parson himself. A widower of many years' standing, and principled against marrying again, he yet has a most profound respect for the ladies, and is never happier than when in their society. Although he is what may be termed a bon vivant, he observes closely certain rules of living, of his own prescribing, which in any other person would be looked upon as being a step beyond abstemiousness, but which he only employs as whets to his appetite. He will live for days at a time upon the simplest of food, to enable him, as he himself declares, to get his system into a proper condition for gorging himself with turtle-fat and Burgundy. Oysters, soft-shell crabs, the hind legs of frogs, terrapins, and turtles, are a few of the Professor's choice dishes. A favorite pastime with him is the catching of frogs, and it is no unusual thing of a summer day to encounter the Professor, wearing an old straw hat, and with his trowsers rolled up to his knees, en route to the frog-pond. Once he advertised in the village newspaper for a few frogs to put in his well to keep its water clear; whereupon all the idle boys and men in town went to catching frogs, and emptying them into the Professor's well, until at last there were more frogs than water in it. The Professor avers that he often heard the frogs calling to him in the night,—the big fellows with their deep bass voices waking him with, PRO-FESS-OR—PRO-FESS-OR—PRO-FESS-OR! dying away in "small caps" at the end, for all the world as if, as the Professor remarked, they had turned into little babies and were going to sleep. Then the younger ones, with treble notes, would break forth saying, Let me out—let me out—let me out! and so would they keep it up all night, or until the Professor, distracted by the outcries, would rise from his bed, and, robed in the loose apparel of a somnambulist, taking his favorite tom-cat under his arm, would sally forth in the chilly night air, and, placing the cat carefully within the bucket, lower him down among the noisy crew. "The silence that ensued," said the Professor, "when Tom reached the surface of the water, was something marvelous. The frogs seemed to be aware that some one—Jupiter, perhaps—had sent a king to reign over them, and they ceased to utter any remonstrance against their imprisonment. Occasionally an imprudent or unwary frog would come to the surface, and break out with PRO, in the bass, or get as far as Let me, in the treble; but it was his last utterance, for the cat would pounce upon him as if he were a mouse, and, once in his claws, there was no escape. The result was, that in the morning, when I went to the well, and raised the cat, still in the bucket, to the top, I had a fine mess of frogs for breakfast. And let me tell you," he used to say to my sister, who, I think, was half afraid of him, "there is nothing better for breakfast than a dish of frogs, either fricasseed or fried. Frogs, my dear woman, come between chickens and oysters, and are neither fish, flesh, nor fowl. They are to the animal creation what the strawberry is to the fruits of the earth,—the best eating, next to the apple, which Eve and Adam ate together in the Garden—that God has given to sinful man; though, by the way, He didn't give us the apple, we took it. Yes, my dear, the frog is the sweetest, the most nutritious, and the most delicate of morsels. It is, as the Italians would say of a dainty dish, un boccone di cardinali—a mouthful for a cardinal."
                  As long as the Professor's frogs lasted he lived, as he himself declared, "most epicureanly;" though there were few, besides the Parson and myself, who enjoyed his breakfasts and suppers. People generally, and most unreasonably, have an antipathy to frogs. One day, however, the frogs in the well gave out, and what became of them was a mystery. There were plenty of them there the night before; indeed, they had been more than usually vociferous, and had called the Professor, in the most heart-rending manner, to let them out. But lo! when he went to the well in the morning to get his frogs for breakfast, there was not one remaining therein. The Professor always declared that the bottom of the well must have fallen through and let the frogs out, for by no other hypothesis could he account for their disappearance.
                  The Professor had once been at the head of a college, and had trained many a young man in the way he should go, though the young men did not always follow his training. Still, he was a most successful instructor, and would, doubtless, have always remained so, had he not unwisely taken it into his head that he was cut out for a surgeon. From that moment his occupation as an instructor of youth was gone, and he devoted his days and nights to the study of anatomy. His chief delight was found in experimenting on his pupils. On the slightest pretext he would cut off a finger or a toe; and woe to the youth who complained of imperfect vision. In an instant out came his eyes into the Professor's hand, and it was lucky if they went back into his head other than upside down. One poor boy who was afflicted with strabismus was experimented upon by the Professor so successfully that he not only could see "two ways of a Sunday," as the boys have it, but five ways of a week-day. He could see into the trunks and boxes of the other boys, and many a nice cake and paper of candy disappeared from the rightful owner's sight, though to memory dear, owing to the superior fore-sightedness of cross-eyes.
                  
                  When, however, the Professor amputated the leg of a little boy, who had fallen and bruised his shin, and it was rumored around the school that he intended to cut off the head of the first lad who choked while eating dinner, it was high time, so the boys themselves thought, to take their hats and go home, which many of them did. Consequently the school gradually broke up, until only one poor little Cuban remained for the Professor to experiment on. He had a "fester" on his heel, and so couldn't walk, or would doubtless have gone with the others. To the Professor this was a festa worth having, and he poulticed and lanced it so effectually that finally it came to an end, and with it the little boy, who died of tetanus, that is to say, the lock-jaw.
                  After his death the Professor went out into the highways and the byways, and brought in the halt and the lame, and, like a good Samaritan ministered to them, and poured oil upon their sores, and enjoyed himself generally.
                  When all the beggars of the neighborhood were either killed or cured, and there were no more ills to conquer, the Professor devoted himself to four pursuits: eating, drinking, sleeping, and dissecting,—the last being his favorite employment, though he never refused to partake of a good dinner, or shirked a bottle of wine.
                  That the Professor was in the habit of bringing anatomical specimens to show to the Parson and myself was true; but that he ever presented any to my sister Priscilla is hardly presumable. He would come now and then, of an evening, to take a fourth hand at whist with us, or discuss with the Parson doctrinal points in religion: but he never made love to Priscilla, though he treated her with all courtesy and kindness. Years before he became a professor, he had lost his wife, after a brief year of wedded life, and he had never met since, he said, the woman whom he would care to have fill her place.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  ALL HANDS AROUND THE MAHOGANY.
                  MISS KATE, the tidy and pretty young school-mistress, dined with us on Saturday. More than that, Kate's mother, the old-time love of my friend, the Parson, also dined with us. This addition to our party somewhat surprised his reverence, who, I think, would rather not have encountered it. Still, he bore the infliction with Christian manliness, and, although he did not refer to bygones, he conversed pleasantly with her, while she looked unutterable things. The Professor was likewise present, and brought with him, for the especial entertainment of my sister, the skeleton of a kitten, skillfully mounted, by himself, on wires, so that it could be placed not only in each posture it could assume in life, but in some poses which, to attain, would have broken its back when alive. He mentioned to my sister that he had this pretty bit of anatomy to show her, just as the meat-pie was being placed on the table: "a proceeding," as the Parson declared, "more suggestive than agreeable." Still, it prevented none of us, I imagine, from doing ample justice to the very savory morsels the pie contained.
                  "It would have been wiser in the Professor," said the Parson, who is learned in such matters, "to have withheld the introduction to our attention of his anatomical preparation until we had finished our dinner; since, thereby, he would have imitated that ancient people, the Egyptians, who, at the close of their feasts, had the strange custom of passing a skeleton around the table to admonish and improve the guests."
                  
                  "Your skeleton story," said the Professor, "should be taken, in my opinion, cum grano salis,—that is to say, Alcibiades?"
                  "With," answered the young man, proud of his knowledge of Latin, "a grain or pinch of salt."
                  "Not at all," said the Parson; "it is an historical fact. Why, have you never heard of the skeleton at the feast? Frequently, too, these Egyptian banquets were given within the sepulchral hall of tombs, where the guests were not only cheered by having the skeleton shown to them after the feast, but were able, at any moment during it, to see, standing around them against the walls, the mouldering remains of the ancestors of their host."
                  "I would rather," said the Professor, "have partaken of it al fresco in a graveyard; though it must have afforded the guests a fine chance to study anatomy between the courses."
                  "Doubtless," the Parson said; "and they probably availed themselves of it. Caius Siba, if you remember,"—which no one, not even the Professor, did,—"gave a supper to celebrate the return of Nero to Rome; and near the close of the feast a present arrived from the emperor, which consisted of a silver skeleton; but the guests failed to take warning by it, and remained drinking and dancing, till the fire lighted by Nero, to destroy the city, overtook and burned even the mansion of Siba, with all its assembled banqueters. Josephus, the most veritable of historians, relates this, and"—
                  "And,"—I exclaimed, interrupting him, for the Parson was sure to get on his highest hobby-horse whenever he quoted Josephus, and would have ridden us all to death with it before the dinner were ended, leaving us, so to speak, sitting around the table, mere skeletons of our once happy selves,—"and, strange as it may seem, many is the feast I have attended, even in this enlightened age and civilized country, where little else was left upon the board, at its conclusion, than a well-picked skeleton; not a human skeleton, to be sure, but of a fish, a bird, or a beast. Indeed, it always seemed to me that the skeleton at the feast was simply applied to the bones left on the dish from which we had been feasting."
                  "A most foolishly erroneous idea!" the Parson exclaimed. "Utterly destructive of all faith in the truth of history, and especially calculated to throw a doubt on one of the most interesting incidents narrated by Josephus. Paradox of the age! that I should live to hear this fact questioned." And the Parson, with two pairs of spectacles on his forehead, relapsed into silence, and devoted himself to an effective investigation of the mysteries embodied in his plate of meat-pie.
                  I think all at the table were glad when the Parson succumbed to my trifling talk, for the subject was spoiling our appetites, and my sister was very desirous that we should appreciate the good dinner she had provided. And it was a good dinner; nor was the dessert, with its pudding and pies and fruit, to be passed over without remark. Indeed, the Professor quite surprised us with his intimate knowledge of the art of cookery, and the many stories and anecdotes he related in connection therewith; winding up the recital with his last mouthful of blackberry pudding, which he declared even better than King Arthur's famous pudding, which was made and eaten, as chronicled in the old English ballad, in this wise:— 
                        
                           "When good King Arthur ruled the land,
                           He was a goodly king;
                           He stole three pecks of barley meal
                           To make a bread-pudding.
                        
                        
                           "A bag-pudding the king did make,
                           And stuffed it well with plums,
                           And in it put great lumps of fat
                           As big as my two thumbs.
                        
                        
                           "The king and queen did eat thereof,
                           And noble men beside;
                           And what they could not eat that night
                           The queen next morning fried."
                        
                     
                  
                  
                  "Which," my sister said, "was very economical in the queen, and worthy of imitation."
                  "I would agree with you," said the Parson, "if there were ever any pudding left over from dinner in this house, especially since Alcibiades has been home. That boy," he continued, turning to Miss Kate, "will, I'm afraid, gorge himself to death some day on apple-dumplings or black-berry-pudding."
                  As the young fellow didn't like to be called a boy, especially to his mistress, nor care to be accused of "gorging" himself on puddings, he looked quite indignantly at the Parson, who gave no heed to him, but kept on talking to Miss Kate in a low, confidential tone, who, in turn, seemed, to the jealous eyes of Alcibiades, to smile approval to all the Parson said. He tried several times to join in their conversation, but each time he ventured to put in a word the Parson quietly snubbed him, and even Miss Kate seemed to take her cue from the Parson, and, more by her manner than her words, silently gave him to understand that she would rather he would not disturb her tête-à-tête with the Parson. So the poor lad was fain to turn to Kate's mother for comfort, and finally wandered with her out of doors to the summer-house at the end of the garden. Here, boy-like, he confided to her his grief, and she, woman-like, offered him consolation. She promised to intercede with her daughter in his favor, and she hoped that her efforts would meet with success. Kate, to be sure, was several years older than he; but she had known happy marriages to follow even where the wife was many years older than the husband. The trouble in his case, doubtless, was not so much because Kate was older, as that he was very young—a mere school-boy; but this difficulty, she assured him, he would, in the natural course of events, gradually overcome; and that, if he would wait patiently for ten or twelve years, and Kate didn't get married in the mean time, he might be almost certain of winning her.
                  This was scarcely what Alcibiades desired; but he refrained from further complainings, and like his namesake, the famous Athenian general, who never suffered one defeat to deter him from again attacking his Spartan adversaries, he immediately returned to the house, and, in spite of the remonstrance of the Parson, carried off, by sheer force of will, Miss Kate, who, perhaps, was not loath to yield to his importunities, inasmuch as thereby it caused the Parson to look a little as if he had been defeated, and would naturally—how wicked it was in my sister to imagine such a thing!—incite him to attack the citadel afresh.
                  After Al had taken away Miss Kate, the Parson, with his cigar, wandered down the garden and into the summer-house, where the widow still sat, dreaming, perhaps, some of her olden dreams over again, and quite oblivious of his approach. In the coming twilight, the Parson, through his near-sightedness, did not observe the widow, and so seated himself near her, and it was not until she heaved a little sigh, on discovering his proximity to her, that he was aware of her presence. What passed between them, only the full moon that peered boldly in between the leaves of the matrimony vine, clambering about the open windows of the summer-house wherein they sat, could behold. I am inclined to think that the Parson had a long and pleasant chat with the widow, since he returned to the house with her leaning on his arm, and with his cigar out,—which last could only happen when something of interest had occupied his attention. As for the Professor and my sister, they were found, late in the evening, in the library, examining with much interest the skeleton of a kitten; the Professor dilating in unmeasured terms on the elegance of its form, the flexibility of its limbs, and the gracefulness of its movements. He denied in toto the assertion, so often promulgated, that a cat has nine lives, and offered to prove, by killing my sister's favorite tabby, that it has but one life,—the same as a saint and a sinner. To this, however, my sister would not consent, so at last the Professor finally settled down with me on the piazza, over a jorum of punch and a half-dozen cigars.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VIII.
                  GHOSTS AT THE PARSONAGE.
                  IF ever there was a haunted house, it is the parsonage. For years past I have felt it; now I know it to be so. Nor is it haunted by one ghost alone, but by scores of them. If the old housekeeper at the parsonage had not been sand-blind as well as stone deaf, she never would have dwelt as contentedly as she has in this shaky old mansion. When and by whom it was built, are points involved in obscurity,—an obscurity as great as that surrounding the Pyramids. For aught I know, it is as old as they; at all events, the hands that built it have long since crumbled into dust, and its earlier tenants long ago been laid to sleep in the mossy churchyard wherein it stands.
                  The house itself is a large, two-story, square frame-building, with a wide hall running through the centre, and two stacks of chimneys, each rising from the ground floor, and passing between the two rooms on either side of the hall. In the open garret, under the steep, gabled roof, through which they pass, they stand, sheer brick and mortar, like a couple of giants, Gog and Magog, keeping watch over the great iron-bound chests, covered with years of dust and cobwebs, shoved hard up under the eaves around the wall. What are contained in these chests none of this generation positively know: the Parson says there is a legend which declares them to be filled with the sermons preached by his ancient predecessors. Perhaps the children who once played hide-and-seek around those chimneys and behind those mouldy chests, may have discovered, in their idle rummaging, more in regard to their contents than the legend the Parson sets forth. It seems to me, now that I think of it, that, when a lad, I used to hear mysterious whisperings among my elders in relation to these same old chests—a tradition, I think, existing in connection with them—of a most unholy and wicked character; something blackening to the fair fame of an early shepherd and sundry lambs of his flock. What it was, however, is not now clear to my mind, though I think I can recall it, and in the meanwhile, with the Parson's permission, I will ransack these chests and find out what they contain. Perhaps thereby I may obtain a clew to the cause why mysterious noises are heard in the house, and strange sights are therein seen.
                  But, without seeking at present to solve this enigma, let me simply state what has actually come before me—what I have seen with mine eyes and heard with mine ears.
                  Perched, like an eagle's aerie, on the peak of this old mansion, is an observatory, anchored firmly by iron bolts to the timbers of the roof, and protected from lightning by a rod, rusted by long exposure, and twisted by so many blasts that it has assumed the shape of a cork-screw. One might think, from its being on the parsonage, that it was placed there to point the way to heaven; and yet, judging from its spiral form, one would be likely to infer that the road thither was a very crooked one. Notwithstanding the swaying motion to which the rod is subject in every storm, a venturous swallow has seen fit, during several years past, to build its nest in the fork at its extremity. Here, sitting on its eggs, or brooding over its young, it is rocked by the blast and warmed by the sun. To a person seated in the observatory, its twittering may be clearly heard; and the Parson, who occasionally writes a sermon in that solitary spot, says they are better than those written elsewhere, for his spirit is soothed, and his heart made tender, by the sound of the rushing wings and the faint murmuring notes of the swallows round about.
                  Here, too, is placed a telescope; and many a night, in summer and winter, have the Parson and myself sat, with our cigars, and watched for falling stars, and seen the comets whirling in their course. Here were we seated the other day, watching the eclipse and taking notes thereof. It had occurred to me several times that there were sundry sounds of an unusual character proceeding from the garret beneath us; but, as the Parson apparently paid no attention to them, I arrived at the conclusion that the old housekeeper was engaged in thoroughly overhauling and rearranging the contents of the garret, though I thought she might have selected a more appropriate time for her labors. Once or twice it seemed to me as if she must simply be occupied in piling the trunks and old furniture together, only for the purpose of tumbling them down. The noise increased as the eclipse progressed, and at the moment when the greatest obscuration occurred, the disturbance was terrific; it sounded to me as if everything in the garret was being thrown from floor to roof, and above all the noise rose a shriek so wild and agonizing that I started to my feet, exclaiming: "Good heavens! the old woman must have brought down all the furniture upon her this time."
                  "Old woman!" said the Parson, deliberately knocking off the ashes from his cigar, "why, man, it's the ghosts you hear."
                  At the same instant, two blows, that lifted the trap-door on which my chair was placed, seemed to say, "That's so!" in confirmation of the Parson's remark.
                  I am by no means a believer in what are called spiritual manifestations; nor have I ever attached credence to stories of haunted houses. I have, though, I confess it, a childlike faith in ghosts, witches, and fairies,—a faith similar to that which, notwithstanding the years of discretion at which I have arrived, keeps green, as is the holly of Christmas-time, my belief in Santa Claus. Neither age nor experience can destroy my belief in the good old saint, in fairy lore, or hobgoblin literature.
                  Up to this time, however, my belief was purely theoretical, and was derived from books and traditionary records. Now, it seemed, I was called upon to face the ghosts themselves, to witness their performances, and mark the results. Still, I laughed at the Parson when he denied that the disturbance I heard proceeded from the old housekeeper, and, to convince him as well as myself of it, I attempted to raise the trap-door, so as to enter the garret and investigate the matter. I lifted the door five or six inches without difficulty, but, to my surprise, could raise it no higher, nor could I discover, by peering beneath it, the reason of my inability. Meantime the noise beneath continued, and suddenly the door was jerked out of my hands and closed.
                  "Parson Ben," I said, "this is growing serious; perhaps we may be kept here all night."
                  Thereupon he stooped down, and, taking hold of the trap, lifted it open. As he did so, the noises ceased, and I passed into the garret. Everything looked as it did when I went through it less than an hour before. The iron-bound chests remained close under the eaves, the disabled pieces of furniture stood against the chimneys, and the dust and cobwebs were undisturbed. The ancient, mouldy smell was not even tainted by sulphurous fumes, as it ought to have been under the circumstances, but held its own with remarkable persistency. Not a sound, not even the boring of a worm in the timbers, disturbed the quiet. Now and then, though, there rose to my ears, through the open stairway door, the voice of the housekeeper crooning an old psalm-tune, as she went about the kitchen, preparing for tea.
                  "How," I asked of the Parson, when I went back to the observatory, "do you account for these noises we have heard?"
                  "I do not seek to account for them," he answered; "I can only regard them as one of the wonders of the age,—a wonder which will, some time or other, either here or hereafter, be made clear to us. When these manifestations—for, in lack of a better word, I thus term them—first appeared, I was much troubled at them, and sought by study and investigation to unravel the mystery surrounding them; but it was mere groping in the dark; no clew presented itself for me to take hold of, and so, finally, I resolved to pay no attention to the matter, but let it alone for better or worse. Sitting here in the twilight, as I sometimes do, I often hear, floating in the air around me, like the strains of an Æolian harp, the sweetest and the saddest music mortal ever listened to. Whence it comes, whither it goes, or how it is produced, I cannot tell; I only know it is, and am contented to listen to and enjoy it. On such occasions, too, it not infrequently happens that I will see, moving slowly around me, white hands, which will drop down upon me from above, till they softly touch my forehead, and then, beckoning, will fade gently away into the distance."
                  If I had not known the Parson to be a practical man, with little of the dreamer about him; and if I had not myself heard the strange noises in the garret, I would have said he was the subject of a monomaniacal fancy. Still, as it was, I felt that all could be accounted for through natural causes, and that, in time, I would be able to unlock the mystery. But even while I thought about it, there came to my ears notes of marvelous sweetness, and, with the deepening twilight, what looked like white hands, floated around me.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER IX.
                  I LISTEN TO MYSTERIOUS MUSIC.
                  IT was some time after our ghostly adventure at the parsonage before I ventured to speak to the Parson on the subject. One day, however, as we sat together on the piazza, after dinner, smoking our cigars, I told him I had made arrangements for sleeping that night at the parsonage.
                  "It is little sleep you'll get, I'm thinking," he replied, "unless you are proof against the most outrageous of noises."
                  "It is not so much with a view to sleeping," I answered, "as to investigating the cause productive of the noises which have given the old place the reputation of being haunted, that prompts me to visit it."
                  "Shall I go with you?" asked the Parson.
                  "No," I said; "I'm afraid that your churchly presence might exorcise the spirits, and deprive me of the opportunity of hearing and seeing them. Alcibiades wanted to accompany me, but I told him he had much better go and make love to the school-mistress."
                  "By the way," said the Parson, with the slightest tinge of jealousy in his tone, "isn't she leading the lad on a little too far?"
                  "Perhaps so," I answered. "I confess I am sorry that she is so fond of him: though, after all, it is only a sisterly fondness, and, as the boy will soon go back to college, there can be little harm done."
                  "True," said the Parson; "still, it is not well for him to be so much with her; it has seriously interfered with his studying, and I fear he will return to college far behind his class."
                  "Then he'll have an opportunity," I said, "to overtake it. And now I believe I'll start for the parsonage."
                  "Let me, at all events," said the Parson, "walk with you there."
                  We took a short course through the woods and across the fields, a pleasant walk at any time; and now, in the coolness of the afternoon, with the air fragrant with balsamic odors of pine-trees, and the murmuring voice of the wind in their branches falling softly on our ears, it was more than usually so. Here and there, along the pathway, a few early fallen, colored leaves, from the deciduous trees scattered among the pines, rustled beneath our feet,—sad reminders of the approach of autumn. As we emerged from the woods into the open fields the sun was just setting, and our eyes, looking over the wide, uncultivated fields before us, yellow with an unwelcome harvest of golden-rod, were dazzled by the reflection of the sun's rays on the windows of the old parsonage; the entire front of the house was in a blaze of light. It seemed as if it were on fire within, and the flames were just bursting through the windows. "See!" I exclaimed; "the ghosts are already at work, and have lighted the house in honor of my coming."
                  "You may speak lightly now of the ghosts," said the parson, "but if you will take the trouble, at midnight, to step into the graveyard, you will see, as I have seen, when you look at the house, a single light through the windows, borne from room to room by a white and ghostly form."
                  "Not unlikely," I replied; "and if it does occur, the probability is that that ghostly form and I will have a personal interview."
                  "You will be more successful, then, than I have ever been," he replied; "and I wish that you may, but"—and here the Parson shook his head, and gave a long sigh.
                  
                  "Shall I go with you into the house?" he asked, after a pause.
                  "No," I replied; "I shall not enter at present. I mean to take an outside view of the premises first."
                  "Well, good-night, then," he said. "I hope you'll enjoy yourself, and be able to report satisfactorily to us all at the breakfast table to-morrow morning."
                  "Good-night," I answered, and so the Parson left me.
                  I noticed, however, that he did not take the direct road homeward, but another which would lead him past the house of the school-mistress. "And yet," I said to myself, as I watched his tall form going down the hill, and noted his long shadow trailing after him, "he will not go past the house, but will stop and have a pleasant talk with Miss Kate. It would be curious, indeed, if, after all these years that have gone over his head, the Parson should at last marry, and marry the daughter instead of the mother."
                  Thus occupied with my thoughts, the time passed unheeded by, until the twilight settled down upon the earth, and objects about me began to assume uncertain forms. As I mused, my ears were greeted by a few low, soft notes of music, that seemed to float in the air around me, and then fainted, as it were, from hearing, in the distance.
                  "One need not enter, the parsonage, then, it seems," I said to myself, "to hear this weird music."
                  Looking around me, I sought to detect the cause that produced these harmonious sounds. Before me lay the old churchyard, with its white and brown head-stones, marking the resting-places of the villagers who died anywhere from a hundred to twenty-five years past; for it was only occasionally at present that an interment took place in its grounds, the new cemetery over the hill having become the fashionable burial-place. A few of the graves yet showed that the dead who slept within were not forgotten, but the greater part evinced only neglect, being sunken in, the tombstones crooked or fallen, and briers and weeds growing ing over them. To the right was the church itself, an ancient blue-stone building, with a tower at one end containing a clock with three dials, the hands on which never agreed within fifteen minutes of each other, and, moreover, struck the hours so irregularly that it was said to adapt itself solely to the wishes and requirements of the topers who hung about the village tavern, and went home whenever it suited their convenience. Over the clock, in the belfry, was a bell that had rung forth many a merry wedding-peal, and tolled for many a death. For fifty years, from its place beneath the steeple, it had talked to the people, calling them to prayers, or tolling for gray hairs that had gone down to death. Rising above it was a wooden spire, surmounted by a vane that persistently pointed east, and the legend runs that, having been put up on Christmas Eve, it was, in a mysterious way, ordered always to point toward the star of Bethlehem. This pretty little miracle is fully believed in by all, from the oldest inhabitant down to the newly-born babe.
                  Within the church was an organ, and, to my mind, after listening a while to the music wafted to mine ears, I was very positive that it was produced by no more mysterious instrument than the organ itself. Fully convinced of this,—indeed, I had arrived at the decision beforehand, and had taken the precaution to provide myself with the Parson's key to the vestry-room, so as to be able to enter the church without disturbing the unknown player,—I passed into the building. All was silent. I entered the organ-loft, expecting to find the organist with hands resting on the keys; but no one was there: the organ was closed and locked, and nothing existed to show that any one had recently touched it. I lit the candles about the organ, and then, taking one in my hand, searched the church. The doors were locked and the windows fastened, so that no one could have gone out without my knowledge, and no one, I felt assured, was hidden in the church. I put out the lights and paused to listen; no sound save the ticking of the great clock, far above my head, broke the silence. I groped my way down the stairs, and out of the church into the graveyard. The moment I closed the door behind me, I heard again, plainly, the soft, sweet notes I had listened to before. They rose and fell, more like the strains of a harp than those of an organ; and yet the daughters of Israel, ere they hung their harps on the willows by the rivers of Babylon, never, with all their cunning, wrought such harmony as this I heard. Before me, looming up dark and gloomy in the deep twilight, rose the old parsonage, gray with age and green with moss. Whatever paint once covered its surface had long since been washed off, and left it, a faded, dilapidated old affair, with here and there a window-shutter hanging by one hinge, or, guiltless of any fastenings, swinging wearily about on its rusted hinges with every passing gust. One half of the house was utterly untenantable, several of the window-sashes being blown in, and the paper on the walls torn and hanging, like tattered banners, in strips there-from. This part of the house, as the Parson informed me, was more than usually haunted, nor was I surprised to hear it. Stumbling over the graves, I approached the house, and, climbing over what was left of the low wall that formerly separated the inclosure wherein it stood from the churchyard proper, I opened the kitchen door of the parsonage.
                  Entering, I found the old housekeeper kneeling before the huge fire-place, watching, bellows in hand, with a patience worthy of Job, the boiling of the tea-kettle over a few sticks of green wood. It was not, owing to her deafness, until I touched her, that she was aware of my presence. She seemed glad to see me, and showed me to the library, where a fire was blazing on the hearth, and a table laid for tea. The house was so damp, she said, that she kept a fire the year round burning in the Parson's room; otherwise he would have no place in the whole house decent to sit in. As it was, the room had a musty smell, and the books, some of them, were blue with mould. Soon she brought in the tea and toast, after partaking of which I lit my cigar, and, taking a volume of Jeremy Taylor's sermons from the shelf, prepared myself comfortably to await the coming of the ghosts.
                  There is something very disturbing and unsatisfactory in the idea of watching for a ghost. It don't belong to the nature of things, and one, when thus situated, is apt to start nervously at, and listen to every unusual sound; to glance quickly over one's shoulder at the rustling of the curtains at the open window, and to detect one's self watching narrowly, and with more than usual interest, the flickering shadows thrown on the walls and ceiling by the blazing fire; at least it was so with me, and it took me sometime to forget, in the perusal of the pages before me, that I was sitting up for a ghost.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER X.
                  I LOOK FOR A GHOST AND FIND A TARTAR.
                  HOW long I read I do not know: I think, though, I fell asleep early, for old sermons, no less than new ones, have a most soporific influence over me; but when I awoke the volume had fallen from my hands, the fire had nearly died out, the candle was flickering in the socket, and my watch indicated twelve o'clock.
                  Midnight, all the world over, is regarded as being the most fitting hour of the twenty-four for ghosts, if ever they intend to do so, to appear. Shakespeare makes the ghost of Hamlet's father to appear "in the dead vast and middle of the night," and all novelists, from Mrs. Radcliffe to Dickens, cause their ghosts to put in an appearance invariably at the noon of night.
                  Of course, when I found it to be the "witching hour of night," I was prepared to behold any number of ghosts; consequently I was not startled when I saw, through the open door leading into the hall—I had carefully closed it when I sat down to read—a tall, white figure glide noiselessly down the passage-way. I sprung to my feet, and seizing the candle in my left hand, and my cane in the right, rushed toward the door, resolving to intercept my visitor. The candle, however, which was just expiring, was put out by my suddenness of movement, and I was left in the dark. Looking toward the spot where I had last seen the ghost—if ghost it were—I could discern nothing, neither could I hear a sound to indicate the presence of any one. After a moment I could trace the moonlight falling through the fan-window over the front door, and, seemingly, resting in a great, white, silent mass on the gray painted floor.
                  "Could it have been," I asked myself, as I turned back to the library, "a mere matter of moonshine, after all, that I took for a ghost?"
                  I found, however, when seated in my chair, that I could barely detect the presence of the moonlight in the hall, even in the dark, and not at all after a candle was lighted. It was not then, I felt certain, the moon's rays that had glided before my sight, but something more tangible and real. Resolved to follow up my ghost, I again passed into the hall, and carefully examined by the light of the candle the hall and its surroundings. Of the five doors opening into it, but one, besides that of the library, was unlocked. Into this, which was the parlor, and which the Parson used only on state occasions, I entered; but discerned nothing unusual in the appearance of the room, nor detected the presence of any one therein, although I looked carefully about, even to peering beneath the old-fashioned sofa, and searching behind the curtains at the windows. The other rooms, the doors of which were fastened, were, as I knew, rarely entered, even by the housekeeper, and then only to give air to their musty interiors, and dust the hanging cobwebs from their walls.
                  The stairway, however, leading to the floor above, was accommodatingly open to the passage of a ghost. Indeed, half a dozen of the fattest of ghosts might have passed abreast or rode up in a coach and six, so wide and roomy had it been built. Here, however, as on the first floor, the doors, with two exceptions, were locked; one was the Parson's bed-room, directly over his study and connected with it by a private staircase, and the other was a door leading into the wing, over the kitchen, where the housekeeper and a servant slept. Passing by the Parson's room, a mere glance therein satisfying me, I directed my steps to the two sleeping rooms in the wing.
                  
                  A younger man than myself might have hesitated ere he invaded the sanctuary of two women—one, although I did not know it at the time, an old maid, and the other a widow; but I was too much engrossed in my search for a ghost to let any scruples of delicacy interfere with my purpose. I don't think I could ever before have invaded, at the dead hour of night, the sleeping apartment of any female; for I am sure that, if I had, I would not have gone so recklessly into the very jaws of destruction as I did.
                  Now, simply walking, unannounced and unexpected, into a woman's bed-room, at a late hour of the night, is not under certain circumstances—for instance, if the room is unoccupied, or, if otherwise, the person therein is your wife, mother, or grandmother—reprehensible; but to go into a room occupied by a strange female, a man needs to have a good reason for so doing, or else he will be subjected to all kinds of suspicions. "Looking for a ghost," as I learned to my surprise, does not come under the head of "a good reason;" for when I opened the door, and walked into the room where the maid-servant slept, she, raising herself bolt upright in bed, looked at me a moment, as if to assure herself that it was a real man who stood before her, and then uttered a shriek so wild and full of fear that it would have frightened the wickedest ghost that ever walked the earth, could he have heard it, into his grave, without more ado. Even the old housekeeper, deaf as she is, was aroused by it, and, with an echoing scream, came rushing, in scanty attire, from her room adjoining into the one where I stood, profoundly astonished at the disturbance I had unwittingly provoked.
                  As soon as the servant caught sight of her friend, she shouted murder, and another equally obnoxious and untruthful phrase, following it up with a prolonged yell, and then hid her head under the bed-clothes. Fortunately for me, the housekeeper had a little more sense than the servant vant, and, recognizing me, asked for an explanation, else I cannot tell how it might have ended.
                  To enable her to hear, I was obliged to approach her, and in my eagerness to explain the matter clearly to her, I took hold of her arm; in an instant she sprung back, exclaiming: "You viper, don't touch me, or I'll scream." This seemed to be a signal to the servant in bed to sit up and yell, which she did with a will, popping her head immediately thereafter under the clothes again.
                  It was well, I thought, that there were no neighbors dwelling near by to be roused from their sleep and called to participate in this midnight orgie, for by this time I could regard it as little else. It was long before I could make the old housekeeper understand, in the intervals of pause between the screams of the woman in bed, that I had come into the room in search of a wandering ghost; and when at last she did understand me, she showed by her manner and the hysterical laugh she uttered, that she didn't believe a word of it. I could hear her, as I quickly retraced my steps, after having gotten this explanation into her skull, laughing, and muttering aloud,—"A ghost! indeed, a ghost! ha! ha! ha!"
                  After I regained the Parson's study, and had thrown a fresh log of wood on the fire, I could hear the two stupid women above bolting and barricading the door that led into their part of the building. As for any further search for ghosts, on my part, it seemed to me to be utterly out of the question. I was too much disturbed by what had taken place, and annoyed, that the Parson, when he learned it, would keep the story as a standing joke against me for the rest of his life, to care whether the house was haunted by ghosts or not; at present it was sufficient for me to know that it was inhabited by a couple of stupid, foolish old women. As to the account of the night's adventure which they might carry around the neighborhood, and the construction the villagers generally would put on it, I didn't care a continental snap. With them, however they might look at it, it would in time die out and be forgotten. But with the Parson it would never come to an end. At first, I knew, he would laugh heartily over it, and the true state of the case would for a while be sufficient for him to make his jokes upon; but in time he would take another view of it, assuming the old women's version of the story, and with a sober face and solemn voice would regret exceedingly that I had been tempted to commit so gross an impropriety. He would say that he had thought I had sown my wild oats long ago, and regret that a man of my years and position should let Satan get the better of him.
                  Such thoughts as these filled my mind to the exclusion of all others, as I sat in the Parson's chair, waiting for daylight. No ghosts greeted my sight, nor did any strange sounds fill mine ears. Only with the break of day, as I went forth from the now doubly haunted house, I heard as I crossed the churchyard, once more the same sweet sad notes to which I listened the previous evening.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XI.
                  HOW THE TABLES WERE TURNED.
                  ON my return home, after my night at the parsonage, I found the Parson himself, pacing the garden walks, enjoying his matutinal cigar. Although habitually an early riser, I was, nevertheless, somewhat surprised to meet him at this unusually early hour.
                  "Well," he asked, after we had exchanged the salutations of the day, "how about the ghosts? Did you see them? and how much sleep did you get?"
                  "One question at a time, if you please," I answered.
                  "Well, well!" he cried, impatiently.
                  "Don't be in such haste," I said; "wait until I've got my hair out of tangle, and the cobwebs out of my throat;" and, without further parleying, I hastened into the house.
                  When, later in the day, I gave the Parson an account of my adventures, he laughed most heartily, and said he had thought it would be something more serious. "The truth is," he said, "I was kept awake the whole night thinking about you, and was on the point of starting for the parsonage, when you made your appearance. But you have not told me what conclusions you have arrived at in relation to the strange music you heard, and the fleeting figure you saw."
                  "I have not reached any conclusion yet," I answered; "but I will say I do not believe there is anything supernatural about them. I have not finished my researches yet, I assure you, but mean to pass another night in the old house before long."
                  The Parson chuckled, in a provoking sort of way, and hoped I would keep out of the maid's room the next time I visited the parsonage.
                  Alcibiades is too much occupied with his love affair to take much interest in ghostly affairs; but the Professor is quite enthusiastic on the subject, and declares that if he could only get a few ghosts for specimens to preserve in his collection of unnatural curiosities, it would be the height of his ambition. He is very anxious to accompany me on my next excursion to the old parsonage, and has offered to present me with a rare skeleton if I will accept him as a companion. I have promised to consider the matter, but imagine that I shall prefer to go alone.
                  Various business matters have prevented me from day to day from carrying out my design of spending a night in the haunted mansion, and I have had to bear the joking of the Parson on my adventures therein with what equanimity I can muster.
                  This morning, however, the Parson came to grief, and I enjoyed my revenge. I confess to having been the "best authority" spoken of below, but without any expectation of seeing my story repeated in print. The editor, too, who publishes it has drawn slightly upon his own imagination for certain "facts" therein stated. We were seated at breakfast, the Parson as is his wont reading the newspaper, when suddenly he threw it down on the floor, upsetting his cup of coffee thereby, and exclaimed, "Here's a pretty kettle of fish! and all owing to your foolish philandering about the parsonage the other night, looking for ghosts—confound the fellow!"
                  This last ejaculation was addressed, not to me, but to the editor of the journal he had so violently cast on the floor.
                  "What is a pretty kettle of fish?" I asked, quietly.
                  "Read it, sir, read it," he answered, shoving his spectacles to the top of his forehead, "and see what a predicament you have got me into. Confound the stupid blockhead!"
                  Editor again, not me.
                  Here the Parson rose from the table, and walked the room in an excited frame of mind.
                  Taking up the paper I read aloud,— 
                        "A PARSON CHASING A GHOST."
                     
                  
                  Here I gave a low whistle.
                  "O, you may whistle, sir, as much as you like," cried the Parson, energetically, "but it is an outrage, and—confound the blundering ass!"
                  Editor intended this time unmistakably. So I repeated— 
                        "A PARSON CHASING A GHOST,"
                      —and then read aloud as follows:—
                  "Not more than a hundred miles from our village dwells a worthy parson, somewhat noted for his eccentricities, but who, nevertheless, is a good and pious man."
                  "Why, that, Parson," I said, stopping my reading, "is not so bad."
                  "Confound him!" was all the Parson deigned to utter.
                  So I continued:—
                  "He inhabits an old, crazy-looking parsonage, which has the reputation of being haunted. So impressed is the parson himself with this that he rarely if ever stays over night in the lonely building, but spends his time mostly with an old friend who resides in a neighboring mansion.
                  "One evening last week, however, the parson was detained in his study, probably writing his next Sunday's sermon, until it was past his usual hour for seeking his old friend's house, and, though we may presume he shook in his slippers"—
                  "Confound his presumption!" interrupted the Parson.—"at the thought of so doing, he boldly resolved to remain all night.
                  "His housekeeper, and aged crone of exemplary life, with no fear of ghosts in her composition, had long before retired, and near her, in an adjoining room, the maid-servant, a pretty, buxom girl of nineteen or twenty years"—
                  "Sixty, if a day," interrupted the Parson; "confound him!"
                  —"slept the sleep of the virtuous. Without disturbing the household, therefore, the parson proceeded to his bedroom, above his study, and after saying his prayers, betook himself to sleep, and soon silence reigned in the parsonage. How long he slept, our authority—and we get this account from the best authority—does not state"—
                  "Who," asked the Parson, interrupting me, "does the confounded fool mean by 'best authority?'"
                  "Why, how should I know?" I replied; "probably, however, the housekeeper or the maid-servant."
                  —"but suddenly, it seems, he was awakened by something tapping, tapping at his chamber-door, and before he could say Jack Robinson, or bid the intruder enter, the door opened, and an awful spook, six feet high, with a skull and cross-bones in his right hand, and the skeleton of a baby in his left, appeared before the astonished parson.
                  "Our parson no sooner saw this apparition than he leaped from his bed, and seizing a lighted candle in one hand, and his cane in the other, struck out right and left with it at the visitor. Out of the room went the ghost, closely pursued by the valiant parson. The spectre, however, had the start and kept it, leading the parson a pretty dance, down into the cellar, up to the garret, and around the chimneys, and then back to the second floor, where the ghost, hotly pressed by the parson, slipped into the room where the maid-servant was quietly sleeping. Aroused by this forcible entrance into her chamber, the girl started up affrighted, and as the parson in his night-clothes advanced to the front side of the bed, she jumped out on the other, screaming with all her lungs, and immediately bringing the old housekeeper to her assistance.
                  "Here was a pretty scene,—something which would be effective in the coming tableaux at Atterberry Park: there stood the parson, almost as nude as Adam in the Garden of Eden before eating the forbidden fruit; there stood, too, the maid-servant, almost as lightly clad as was Eve; and there stood the old housekeeper—we hope the old woman will pardon us for the simile—acting the part of the serpent. The parson, now thoroughly awake—for it seems he had been suffering from a nightmare, the natural result of a Welsh rarebit and a mug of ale, partaken of just before retiring, and had been walking in his sleep—was the first to recover his senses, and to realize the questionable position in which he was placed; and with this single favorite exclamation,'Paradox of the age!' he turned, with lamp still in his hand, to his own room, locking and double-bolting himself within, for fear another ghost might entice him to a second ramble.
                  "Somehow, although strict secresy was enjoined on all the parties, the story, which is too good to be kept a secret by two women and a parson, leaked out, and we give it as it was told to us.
                  "Moral.—Parsons should not eat hearty suppers just before retiring; nor should good-looking young maid-servants go to bed leaving their doors unbolted."
                  "Confound the impudence of the fellow!" again exclaimed the Parson, as I finished. "'Paradox of the age'—but I'll sue him for libel."
                  By this turning of the tables on the Parson, I think I shall be able to escape being made the subject of any more joking in the matter of chasing a ghost.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XII.
                  THE GARRET IN MY GRANDFATHER'S HOUSE.
                  FROM early boyhood a garret has had especial attractions for me. I recall, with peculiar satisfaction, the garret in the old house where I was born. It was a corner house, on the main street of the little city which has the honor of being my birthplace, and was built by my great-grandfather nearly a hundred years ago. In some respects it was similar to the parsonage, though only one chimney was built through its centre, the second being erected in connection with the adjoining house. Two windows in the gable looked out on the side street, and between them, on the outside, run the lightning-rod, down which many a time in the dusk of evening I slid to join my playmates below, when my good mother thought me to be in my own room fast asleep. Halfway to the ridgepiece, supported by the queen-posts, were the braces, over which were laid a few boards, with wide spaces between them, yielding but a precarious footing to the venturous boy who climbed by a steep step-ladder thereto. Here, in this upper region, inch-thick with dust and draped with ancient cobwebs, it was my delight, throwing open the scuttle above my head, to pass many an idle hour, lying on my back gazing up at the blue sky and watching the white clouds as they sailed past. Here I used to hoard my winter's share of walnuts, gathered along the shores of Claverack Creek, and the rocky heights of Becraft's Mountain. Here, at times, while searching in the duskiest hidingplaces of this neglected region, I would make strange discoveries. Once I came across an old musket, its stock worm-eaten, and its barrel and lock rusted and shackly. This musket, which had seen service in the early Indian wars, and had fought a good fight at Bunker's Hill, was one of my greatest trophies, and I still have it, with other similar curiosities of a warlike character, enshrined in my house, on the wall above the kitchen fire-place, the hearthstone of which it perhaps helped to save from desolation.
                  Here too I once found, tied in an old stocking hidden beneath a rafter, a few silver and copper coins, which my great-grandfather had missed years before from his secretary, probably stolen and secreted by a servant, who was unable, from some reason or other, to take them away.
                  The garret under this loft was the acknowledged kingdom and play-ground, especially on rainy days, of the children of the house, though my grandmother, having a prior right thereto, made it to some extent a store-room for savory herbs, strings of onions and peppers, seed squashes, and ears of corn. Under the eaves, too, in great cedar chests, she kept during the summer her housewife wealth of blankets and quilts, strongly impregnated with dried stems of tobacco,—a preventive to keep the moths from attacking them. Here, also, in a box of sandal-wood, brought by her husband from India on one of his voyages, she kept her winter furs: a sable muff almost as large as a pillow, a cape that reached nearly to her feet, and a boa so long that it was used by my sisters and myself until we were detected, as a skipping-rope.
                  Here, too, reposed in honorable retirement—instead of finding their way to the auction house, as such things do in these degenerate days—the worn-out and obsolete pieces of furniture that had done honest duty in the earliest days of my grandmother's housekeeping: tables with three shaky legs, instead of their complement of four; chairs without backs, or, if blest with them, so straight and high that we children, when we climbed up into them, used to wonder if any one ever sat in them an hour without wishing ing one's self dead; and, as for any courtship going on—such as my grandmother used to recount to us of hers—between two persons seated in these stiff and hard-bottomed chairs, it was utterly preposterous; a couple of spinning-wheels and a machine for reeling the yarn spun thereon, most interesting objects of all; and the frames, with pieces of glass still retained within them, of three mirrors that had mysteriously fallen at different times from their places on the walls and were broken just before the death of a member of the family, beyond all question the most supernatural of anything therein, were a few of the antiquities contained in this wonderful garret.
                  Nor must I neglect to mention a portrait I found on the floor of the loft, lying flat on its face, of a young girl in a low-necked, short-waisted gown of dove-colored silk, with a face such as poets sometimes see in their dreams, so fair and sweet, yet sad withal, it was.
                  I shall never forget the frightened glance my grandmother turned upon her father—my great-grandfather—when, full of boyish curiosity and delight, I burst into the room where the two were seated, bearing it triumphantly in my hands.
                  Dropping her knitting, she sprung forward to turn me from the apartment; but too late to prevent my great-grandfather from catching sight of the portrait. Instead of casting it from him, as my grandmother evidently expected he would, he said, in a low, calm voice, when he perceived she was intending to take it away, "No, Margaret; let my old eyes rest upon it once again. Bring it to me, and you and the child leave me for a while."
                  My grandmother, without a word, though the tears streamed down her wrinkled cheeks, placed the portrait before him, and, taking my hand, led me from the room.
                  As for myself, I was so much astonished at what had happened that it was some time after I had reached my grandmother's apartment, whither she took me, before I was sufficiently myself to ask her of whom it was the portrait. Some day, she said, she would tell me, but now I had better go out and play with my sisters in the garden.
                  Instead of doing her bidding, however, I went directly to my great-grandfather's room, and found him, seated, as I had left him, before the portrait. He called me to him, as I entered, and, taking me on his knee, asked, as he stroked my head, "Frank, do you know whose portrait this is?"
                  "No," I answered.
                  "Well," he said, "it is that of your grandmother's sister, my daughter, and your great-aunt. Years ago, when she was really little more than a child—for she was scarcely eighteen—she ran away from her home with and married the man who painted this picture. And I never forgave her or saw her afterwards. I feel now, Frank, that I was a cruel, hard-hearted man, and that I should have taken her and her husband home to my house, and forgiven them. I did offer a home to her if she would leave him, but she preferred to share his life of poverty, and I—your grandfather, Frank, your cruel-hearted old grandfather—let her do it. Within two years, Frank, from the day she left me, she died—died of starvation, I believe—and her husband disappeared, taking with him their boy, an infant of a few months old, and I never have been able to obtain a trace of them. Her death nearly broke my heart, and I have never forgiven myself for my cruelty." I could only press the old man's hands, and look up piteously into his face.
                  "Frank," he said, after a little pause, "years ago I told your grandmother to destroy this picture, and I thought she had done so. Yet, many a time, since my child's death, I would have given all my wealth to have it restored to me. Frank, little boy!" he exclaimed, twining me closely in his arms, his voice tremulous with emotion, "you have made me almost happy!"
                  
                  And then, kissing me, he told me that he wished to be alone.
                  From that day onward, until the old man died, the portrait hung on the wall of his chamber, where he could see it from his bed.
                  Many years have gone by since I found that picture; many, too, have elapsed since my great-grandfather was laid in his ancestral tomb; nor has the remembrance of the event here narrated entered my mind in almost as many years. To-day, however, when I walked by the old parsonage, and recalled the quaint aspect of its garret, with the old chests under its eaves, the great chimneys running through it, and the loft under its ridge-piece, I was somewhat—I know not why—reminded of the old garret of my birthplace, and, like a premonition, it seemed to me that in some way it was connected with the story of my great aunt, whose portrait I had discovered in the old homestead so many years ago. And I said to myself, "To-morrow I will investigate the iron-bound chests in the garret of the parsonage."
               
               
                  CHAPTER XIII.
                  I MAKE A DISCOVERY.
                  IT was a chill, dreary afternoon when I again visited the old parsonage. An equinoctial storm was raging, and the tempest, as if possessed of as many hands as Briareus, stripped the trees of their leaves as it swept through them. The path along the woods was strewed thickly with these fallen emblems of autumn, the rain bringing out their various colors with great vividness. The vane on the spire of the old church, true to its instinct, pointed due east, and on this occasion did not belie itself. The church itself looked gloomy and desolate, and no notes of music, as there had on other days, reached my ears; though occasionally I thought I detected amidst the blasts of the wind a wailing sound, which rose and fell with the rising and falling of the gale.
                  The parsonage wore a drenched and wretched appearance. The shutters slammed to and fro, and as I approached the house I could hear the rattling of the sashes in the windows. Shoving open the front door, I entered without disturbing the inmates, and proceeded immediately to the garret, and, seating myself on one of the old chests, sat listening to the rain as in fitful gusts it beat against the windows, and swept in a wild dance across the roof. Now and then I could hear, as the wind dashed fiercely around the chimneys, a noise like that I heard when seated with the Parson in the observatory; but more muffled in character. It was some time before I could make up my mind as to whence it proceeded, but was satisfied at last that it came from the interior of the chimneys. The storm prevented vented me from passing to the roof to examine them from the outside. Convinced, however, that I had discovered the source of the noise which had so long disturbed the parsonage, and given to it a bad reputation, I contented myself by simply listening, standing close to each chimney, to the thud, thud, thud, alternated with a rattling sound which came therefrom.
                  Deferring any further examination of the chimneys to a more opportune occasion, I turned my attention to a closer scrutiny of the chests which lumbered the garret. One in particular attracted my attention. In size it was equal to the Saratoga trunks which the fashionable ladies of to-day carry with them on their summer tourings, and which contain a wardrobe of such marvelous extent and curious workmanship that we men, when we see them paraded in the parlors of the watering-place hotels, are apt to exclaim of their wearers, they "are fearfully and wonderfully made," and, furthermore, that "Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these." It was into such a barn-like chest that, after much exertion, I finally succeeded in forcing an entrance. The first glance at its contents sufficed to show me that they belonged to the gentler sex. Here were silk and satin dresses of the fashion of our grandmother's day; yards of delicate lace of an antique pattern, yellow with age, and ready to drop to pieces at the slightest touch; a pair of high, red-heeled shoes, into which were thrust a pair of open clock-worked white silk stockings; a pair of faded yellow kid gloves, and pressed between them a withered and crumbling nosegay. Moths had done their work with this once beautiful and costly wardrobe, and as I lifted one of the dresses, there fell from it upon the floor an ivory miniature in a gold case, which I picked up with eagerness, and sought to trace therein the features portrayed, but time and dampness had so effaced the painting I could only make out, by the dim light in the garret, that it was of a woman, evidently young and fair to look upon. Taking it to the window, however, I was enabled to obtain a better view of the painting, and was not a little astonished to recognize, as I thought, a resemblance to the portrait I had discovered so many years before in the garret of the old homestead. Inlaid in the back, protected by a glass covering, on which a gilt monogram was painted, lay a ringlet of flaxen hair, woven with one of a darker shade. The monogram was composed of the initial letters of my great-aunt's Christian name, together with those of her husband's Christian and surname.
                  This, then, I thought, was my great-aunt's bridal wardrobe. This was all the riches she carried with her from her father's house when she deserted him for a poor and unknown artist. But how came it here in the old parsonage? Had she, my fair young aunt, who died when she was only nineteen years of age, anything to do with the mysterious music I had listened to! As a girl she was noted, I remember my grandmother as saying, for the sweetness and purity of her voice. Could it be that she was allowed to visit the earth again, and, hovering about the spot containing her bridal attire, speak in sweet, sad notes the love and grief of her soul. While musing thus, and occasionally turning over with gentle hands the contents of the trunk, I came across several torn and tattered letters. The ink in some parts had entirely faded out, but enough of the writing remained to enable me to decipher that they were somewhat in the character of a journal, and were written in a delicate female hand, and addressed by a daughter to a father. There were other letters besides these—some written by a husband to his wife, and still others by the same person, but evidently at a later date, to his son.
                  These were precious relics, and as I gathered them carefully together, I knew that they were letters written by my aunt, but never sent to her father, or, if sent, returned to her unread; unread, I say, for my grandfather could never have resisted the tender appeals contained in them for forgiveness and reconciliation. Those by her husband had been written to their son long after his mother's death, and while he was at school in England. They seemed to relate the history of his life after the death of his wife, and would necessarily prove a link to guide me in ascertaining something concerning the son, and possibly might lead me to his very door, if still living. If alive he would be only a trifle over fifty years of age,—not sixty yet, at all events,—and he might be married and have children, whom, of course, for the sake of the good old blood that flows in our veins, I ought to know and love.
                  Placing the letters in my pocket, I closed the chest, and, leaving the parsonage, took my way homeward. The storm had nearly ceased, and along the western horizon, where the sun was going down, stretched a reddish glare, while overhead the clouds still looked dark and gloomy. As I passed the church the sound of the weird music again fell on my ears, nor did I cease to hear it until I had entered the woods.
                  That night, with the Parson, seated before the fire in my library, I looked carefully over the newly-discovered letters, and learned therefrom some new and surprising things.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XIV.
                  MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER'S LEGACY.
                  "TO think," said the Parson, as he carefully refolded the last of the packet of newly discovered letters he had been reading,—"to think," he repeated, shoving his spectacles above his forehead, "that Tom White, who married my old flame, the school-mistress, years ago, and who was the father of Miss Kate, the young school-mistress, was the son of your great-aunt, and that none of us should have known it until now."
                  "Why, then," said my sister, "Kate is our cousin. I always thought that she had a look of the Atwoods—especially when she smiled, and it has puzzled me not a little to understand it. What will Alcibiades say when he hears of it? Poor boy! he went back to college feeling very sadly, for Kate had told him very plainly that she looked on him as a mere school-boy."
                  "Why," said the Parson, "if he is a lad of sense, he'll make the best of it, and be very glad he has found a new cousin."
                  "It will be a great surprise to Kate and her mother," my sister remarked; "and I think an agreeable one. They will, perhaps, be glad to learn that they are of our family, and that Kate has our blood in her veins."
                  "And gladder still," I said, "to find that they are rich; at least so well off as to relieve Kate from the necessity of earning her living by teaching school."
                  "How so?" asked the Parson.
                  "Why," I replied, "my great-grandfather, before he died, left by will to his daughter's child the sum of ten thousand dollars, and though all efforts to discover the whereabouts of Mr. White—save that he had gone to England, taking his child with him—utterly failed, and the money itself might lawfully long since have reverted to the other heirs, it has, as I am most happy to say, never been touched; but, on the contrary, has year by year increased in amount, until it has grown to more than ten times its original sum. When hard pressed for money I have been tempted to use it; but the thought that some day the rightful owners might appear for it has always deterred me. And I cannot be too thankful that this legacy has remained intact."
                  "Paradox of the age!" exclaimed the Parson; "but she'll be a rich girl. What a pity it is that she is too old for Alcibiades, for then the money need not pass out of your hands."
                  "True," I said; "but even as it is, it need not go farther than the parsonage. With a hundred thousand dollars you might fit up the parsonage very snugly; and I'll warrant that a good wife, such as Kate would make, would drive all the ghosts away."
                  The Parson merely said, "Pshaw!" and, lighting a cigar, walked from the room.
                  I observed, moreover, that he walked out of the house and down the lane leading to Kate's cottage.
                  "I suppose," said my sister, "that he has gone to tell them of their good fortune."
                  "No," I said, "the Parson will leave that for me to do. He has only gone to look at Kate, as is his custom at this hour of the day to do."
                  "It is strange," said my sister, "that you should have known Tom White as long as you did, and never suspected that he was your aunt's son."
                  "Not at all," I answered. "Tom White, as these letters show, lived in England with his father, whose Christian name was Robert, twenty years before he returned to this country. All search for him had then ceased, nor did I ever know his baptismal name, although I was under the impression it was the same as his father's."
                  "May there not, after all, be some mistake in this matter?" said my sister. "It would be sad to raise the hopes of Mrs. White and her daughter, and then disappoint them."
                  "No," I replied, "there can be no mistake. These letters are proof enough that Tom White and my aunt's son were the same individual."
                  Here I read from sundry of the letters, as follows:—
                  "Your mother was a daughter of Alexander Atwood, of Atwood Place, etc., etc., and should you ever, before or after my death, visit America, I charge you in the most solemn manner not to make yourself known to any member of the family. Your grandfather drove your mother to the grave through his unkindness to her, and I should never wish to claim you as my son if you ever forgot or forgave it."
                  From another letter I read:—
                  "Your grandfather's family are searching for you. He himself is dead, and has left you a few thousand dollars. My curse will rest upon you if you ever accept a single cent of it: die a pauper, and in the kennel first. Hate the name and harm the bearers of it all you can: but not in such a manner that the law can lay hold on you for so doing."
                  "Good advice, isn't it," I asked, "for a father to give a son. And do you remember how, in small ways, Tom White used to annoy me? I even was led to think, at the time, that he married Kate's mother to spite me, for it was supposed by many that I was a suitor for her hand, though I was only doing a little love-making there on the Parson's account. Tom was welcome to the lady, so far as I was concerned, and it was my private opinion that he wished himself as free as I was, when, however, it was too late."
                  "Yes," my sister said, "it always seemed to me a curious match, and it was said they did not live very happily together. At all events he took to drinking shortly after his marriage, and never ceased therefrom as long as he lived. Mrs. White had a hard life of it with him, but fortunately for her it did not last long."
                  "Let me see," I said, "if I remember, he was killed by the premature discharge of a cannon one Fourth of July."
                  "Yes," my sister replied, "Kate was only five years old at the time, and I remember how the little thing took on at the funeral, and had to be carried from the house. She was a great pet of her father's, and her mother often sent her to the tavern close by to call him home. When he would come for no one else, she could lead him along. It was something pathetic and sad to see that toddling wee thing clinging fast to that great, strong man, as with unsteady steps he went, guided by her, homeward. Once, as he reeled from side to side of the walk, she asked him, 'Papa, what makes you walk so crooked?' and the poor fellow answered, taking her in his arms, as he leaned against a tree, only by bursting into tears and exclaiming, 'God be merciful to me a sinner!' and then, still bearing her in his arms, but with footsteps steady and firm, he passed onward to his own house. For several months thereafter he was a changed man; no drop of liquor passed his lips, and his friends hoped he had reformed for good; but temptations too great for his nature to resist assailed him, and he fell never to rise again."
                  "'Twas a sad case," I replied, "and, taken in connection with his terrible death, it made a deep impression on the community. He was a fine classical scholar, and 'in his cups' was fond of quoting from the Greek and Latin poets. These letters show that he was educated at Oxford, and graduated with honor."
                  "Here comes," my sister said, interrupting me, "Mrs. White and Kate up the garden walk. The Parson has evidently sent them to us to learn their good fortune."
                  And, without further words, my sister went to let them in.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XV.
                  A WORD ABOUT CHIMNEYS AND CHIMNEY-SWEEPS.
                  MANY years ago an inventive genius constructed a machine for the benefit of chimneys that failed to draw, and persisted in discharging the larger portion of their smoke through the fire-places into the house, instead of above it into the free air. Another beauty of this invention lay in the circumstance that these ventilators were capable of closing up much of the unnecessary space within the chimney, thus producing not only a stronger draught, but keeping the wind from pouring itself down the chimney, as in blustering days it was accustomed to do, thereby sending clouds of smoke, and even sometimes scattering ashes and cinders into the various rooms connected with it.
                  In those days chimneys were built of great circumference for two reasons: one was, that the immense fire-place, with its cord of blazing wood, gave forth a huge volume of smoke, requiring more space on its way to the house-top than is required for the gases evolving from the coal-fires of to-day; the other was, that it was necessary at least once a year to give the interior of the chimneys a thorough sweeping, to free them from the soot that had accumulated therein. Were this not done, there was much danger of the soot taking fire, and thus exposing the house to the risk of being burned. Men as well as boys were employed to sweep chimneys, and to enable them to do it, with whatever degree of comfort to themselves they could gain thereby, they were constructed of ample and generous proportions.
                  
                  Thus far had I written, when the Parson, looking over my shoulder, and reading the concluding paragraph, asked the somewhat impertinent and unnecessary question, as I thought, as to whether the "ample and generous proportions" referred to the chimney-sweepers or the chimneys.
                  Whereupon I told him he might apply it to either or both, as he saw fit.
                  "Besides," said the Parson, "you have omitted to state that which I from childhood have always regarded as the main reason for building these chimneys of our grandfathers' time on the extensive scale they were; which is, that children on rainy days, assembled in the garret, might find their enjoyment in playing tag around them."
                  "My dear Parson," I said, "you doubtless are correct. A large chimney is a great addition to a house, and a most comfortable thing in a garret in the eyes of children."
                  "If," said the Parson, "I had never taken to the business of sweeping clean the souls and lives of humanity, I think I should have followed the profession of a chimneysweeper. In my early days I was especially attached to chimney-sweeps, and regarded them as beings of a supernatural character. There was something inexpressibly fascinating to me in the idea of climbing through the dark and devious ways of a chimney,—exploring, as it were, its hidden secrets, and searching, like your true navigator for a northwest passage, if I may so term it, through avalanches of soot and windings of flues, for the outlet above the house-top. There is a story told, I forget by whom, of a young sweep who, losing his way among the intricacies of the principal stack of chimneys at Arundel Castle, the home of all the Howards, alighted by accident in one of its magnificent chambers, and, wearied by his tedious explorations, could not resist the temptation of creeping into one of the state-beds, where under a ducal canopy draped with crimson curtains, and between sheets 'whiter and softer than the lap where Venus lulled Ascanius,' he laid his blackened head upon one of the lace-fringed pillows and slept the sleep of the pure and innocent. Here by chance, after all means of discovering him by searching the lordly chimneys had failed, he was found at noonday fast asleep. This story made an impression on me which I have never outgrown; and I used to think, and still do, that I would rather have been that soot-soiled sweep, with tattered garments and shining ivories, than a troubadour, with light guitar and fantastic robes, singing under my lady's window of a moonlight night in summer time."
                  "Parson Ben," I said, "you speak like a gay romancer and poet, instead of the grave old bachelor and priest you are. I know, though, from whence you got your story. Charles Lamb in his 'Elia' has an essay entitled, 'The Praise of Chimney-Sweepers,' wherein, if I mistake not, this story of the lost chimney-sweeper is related. Moreover, he tells therein of his friend James White, who instituted an annual feast of chimney-sweepers at Smithfield, London, upon the yearly return of the fair of St. Bartholomew. Merry and noisy was the assemblage over which Jem White, as head-waiter and host combined, had charge, assisted by his trusty companion Bigod and Charley Lamb himself. The mad doings of these roystering lads; their clambering and jostling to get the first places at table; and their enthusiasm when the crowning toast of the evening, 'May the Brush supersede the Laurel,' prefaced with, 'Gentlemen, give me leave to propose,' etc.,—which title was a prodigious comfort to those young sweeps,—are aptly described by the gentle Elia."
                  "Ah, yes," said the Parson, "I remember it now; and the essay winds up with that olden and pretty distich,— 
                        
                           'Golden lads and lasses must,
                           As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.'
                        
                      But what has all this to do," he continued, "with the patent smoke and heat-radiating ventilator of which you were writing?"
                  
                  "Nothing at all," I answered; "and if you had not introduced to my attention the story of the lost chimneysweeper, I should ere this have completed what I had to say on the subject of chimneys, and especially the chimneys of the parsonage, with the mysterious noises issuing therefrom."
                  "And what, pray," asked the Parson, "have these ventilators to do with the mysterious sounds prevailing at the parsonage?"
                  "Everything," I replied. "I made an investigation of the chimneys to-day, and discovered that these strange noises, which have for years given to the parsonage the name of being haunted, were produced by these very ventilators, placed there ever so long ago, and so out of order now that every wind that blows causes certain parts of them to sway to and fro, like the unfastened shutters on the outside of a house, and, striking each other, to produce the mysterious noises for which we have hitherto failed to discover the cause."
                  "Paradox of the age!" exclaimed the Parson; "is this so? But can you account for the music that we so often hear?"
                  "Yes," I answered; "it is easy of explanation. For it we are indebted to the telegraph wires that stretch across the churchyard; it is simply the music of an Æolian harp on a large scale."
                  "Paradox on paradox!" he exclaimed; "but the ghosts,—the spirits that nightly walk the halls and chambers of the parsonage. Have you discovered their secret? and is it for a murder committed, or money falsely obtained, or for injustice done to the widow and the fatherless, that they are 'doomed for a certain term to walk the night,' and make, upon my head, the few particular hairs I have 'to stand on end, like quills upon the fretful porcupine?' Answer me this!"
                  "Yea, my lord," I answered, falling into his humor, "I will. There is, within the parsonage, an old and shriveled crone, purblind and deaf."
                  "O, my prophetic soul! my cook?"
                  "Aye, that ancient dame who broils your chops and makes your coffee strong; that 'wrinkled, blear-eyed, ancient granny' is addicted to—let all thine ears attend to what I say—SOMNAMBULISM."
                  "O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible! O, most pernicious and perfidious woman. O, cook, cook, cook! That one may stew, and roast, and bake, and fry, and be—a ghost!"
                  "True as I live, my lord. I caught her at it only yesternight. Candle in hand, and in a cutty-sark, she roamed the house. I let her roam, for she's a Catholic, while I myself came home."
                  "Paradox of the age! and is this so?"
                  "It is."
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XVI.
                  THE PROFESSOR'S INSANE FRIENDS.
                  WITH the cool evenings of autumn time,—the coming of which causes us to gather more closely around the fireside,—we have formed a kind of literary society, which includes in its membership not only the Parson and my sister, in addition to myself, but also the Professor and Mrs. White and her daughter Kate. To confess the truth, our society has more of the social and festive character in its composition than the literary. It is a weekly festival, each meeting being inaugurated by a dinner; after which we play whist or have singing, with Miss Kate at the piano, or listen to the Parson's prosy dissertations on men, women, and books; or the Professor's reminiscences of his past life, intermingled with learned dissertations, or my lighter and more trifling stories. The other night, while the cold duck of our supper still remained on the mahogany and the claret in the jug was far from being low, the Professor, filling his glass and looking around the table in, as I thought, rather a wild manner, said, "Fifteen years ago it was my fortune—or rather misfortune—to be confined for several months in a 'Retreat for the Insane.' Of course I was wrongfully deprived of my liberty. The reasons which my friends—precious friends they were, indeed—gave for shutting me up were puerile, and strangely at variance with the truth. A desire on their part to obtain control and possession of my property was at the bottom of the affair. Singularly enough they succeeded in their plans; and when at last I was permitted to walk forth from my prison, I found myself, as it were, tied hand and foot, so far as any management of my own business was permitted me; and from that time till the present I have been living on a miserable pittance, a small annuity which I receive with great punctuality, I must allow, at the commencement of each quarter. I do not think, however, that in all this time my property has materially increased. I have a few rare specimens, it is true, of skeletons and preserved monstrosities of one kind and another; but I am afraid, unless some virtuoso's attention was directed to them, they would not bring much under the hammer."
                  "They would probably," said the Parson, interrupting him, "bring as much as would my old sermons, were they put up at auction; and I assure you I value some of them very highly, they having cost me much time and labor to compose."
                  "Pshaw!" exclaimed the Professor; "I can buy at any second-hand book-stall in the city far better sermons than you ever dreamed of writing—sermons, too, that have never been delivered—for a mere song."
                  "None equal," said the Parson, rising and going to his sermon case, from which he took one of his oftenest-delivered discourses, "to this," and which he wished then and there to read aloud; but which, as the Professor had the floor, could not be accorded to him. He, however, persisted in being listened to for a few moments, wherein he stated that the subject of his sermon was the Murder of the Innocents, and that he had endeavored to show in it that Herod was not exactly in his right mind, but rather in the condition of the Professor when his friends regarded him as slightly non compos mentis.
                  
                  This remark of the Parson's so excited the ire of the Professor that I was obliged to interfere between them, which I did by desiring them to fill their glasses, and proposing the toast which Charles Lamb once gave at a dinner, where he had been annoyed by the unruly conduct of the children of the host, namely, "The memory of the much calumniated, good king Herod."
                  This episode concluded, the Professor, after shaking hands with the Parson in token of restored amity, continued:—
                  "Before my property was taken out of my hands and placed with trustees, it was doubling itself very rapidly. I was investing largely in ancient pictures, paintings by the old masters,—Rubens, Rembrandt, Raphael, and others of those remote days. I had a houseful of them, which I purchased of Hebrew gentlemen, who warranted them to be originals. If I had been permitted to go on in the course I was wisely pursuing I should have realized an independent fortune in a very short time. As it was, however, my friends, who possessed no kind of taste, except a distaste for the old masters, took possession of my pictures, and selling them at an alarming sacrifice, invested the returns in common bonds and mortgages; and it is on the yearly interest that accrues on these bonds and mortgages that I manage to live and support myself in a semi-barbarous way."
                  "No one," here chimed in the Parson, who felt slightly belligerent, "who has the privilege, as you have, my dear Professor, of listening each Sunday to my sermons, can honestly say that he lives in a semi-barbarous way, and I trust that you will have the kindness, for my sake, to withdraw this expression."
                  "That," said the Professor, "I cannot consent fully to do; but I will modify it to this extent: I will call it a semi-civilized way, and you can apply all the civility the circumstances warrant to yourself."
                  The Parson was so astounded at this logical reasoning of the Professor's, and in endeavoring to understand the tenor of it, that he was unable to say a word. So the Professor went on:—
                  "There were a number of sensible persons at the Retreat treat besides myself: men who were detained there on no stronger evidence of insanity than I was; men who possessed their little eccentricities, to be sure, but who were sound on the old picture question, and favorably indorsed my proceedings; men with whom I not only fraternized, but fought in a war of words; men in whose company I used to go forth of bright, sunny mornings, wandering through the grounds in search of—what, indeed, we never found—the Holy Grail. We found mushrooms, though, and very excellent they were, broiled and served up on toast. Men who were of a literary turn of mind, and had written for the old 'New York Mirror' in its palmy days, when Legget and Fay, as well as Morris and Willis, conducted it. And so, to while away the time, which hung heavily on our hands, especially when we were not undergoing the shower-bath or the strait-jacket treatment, we formed a literary society,—somewhat similar to this of ours,—and wrote articles of a rather startling character, which were read before it."
                  Hereupon, as I thought he would, the Parson objected to comparing our literary gathering with that held in the Insane Retreat, accusing the Professor of being as mad as a March hare for venturing to make the comparison.
                  The Professor, instead of taking offense at the Parson's words, as I feared he would, immediately entered into a long dissertation to prove that hares were no madder in March than in any other month of the year; and, more than this, that they never were mad, and that any person who would say, after partaking of jugged hare, cooked in the English style, that hares were liable under any circumstances and at any season of the year to go mad, could not himself be accounted a sane individual.
                  Whereat the Parson confessed that he had never eaten jugged hare, but that he had eaten, and did not admire it, its near kin, Mr. Rabbit.
                  "Rabbit," said the Professor, "is by no means a dish to be compared with hare."
                  
                  And thereupon appealed to me for my opinion.
                  I replied simply by quoting an old distich, familiar to me in my youth, which run in this wise:— 
                        
                           "For rabbits hot, for rabbits cold,
                           For rabbits young, for rabbits old,
                           For rabbits tender, rabbits tough,
                           I thank the Lord I've had enough."
                        
                     
                  
                  This effectually settled the matter, and so the Professor, continuing his remarks, said: "Many of these papers passed into my possession, and as they are somewhat singular in style, composition, and subject, being oftentimes the photograph, as it were, of the writer's mind, I am tempted to read them before our little gathering around the mahogany; but as it is now quite late, will postpone the reading of the first paper until our next evening together."
               
               
                  CHAPTER XVII.
                  DOCTOR FAUSTUS SPEAKS.
                  AT the next reunion of our Social Unscientific Society, the Professor, who was big with his theme, claimed, immediately after the withdrawal of the members from the festive board in the dining-room to the solitude and sageness of the library, to have the floor. No one contradicting him, he proceeded in a slow and dignified manner to unroll his manuscript, which act, as soon as the Parson observed it, led the latter to remark, sotto voce, that the MS., whatever it was about, seemed to be as long as his sermons, and he doubted if it would prove to be as interesting.
                  "Bearing in mind," said the Professor, turning his eyes benignly upon the Parson, "the infirmities of others, and not forgetting my own peculiar weakness regarding old pictures, I have the honor to ask your attention to the present paper, contributed to the literary society of which I was once a prominent member, in the Retreat for the Insane, by my friend Doctor Faustus:—
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              DOCTOR FAUSTUS SPEAKS.
                              "O the mad days that I have spent, and to see how many of my old acquaintances are dead!"
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  "It may have been one year, it may have been ten—for I take no note of time—since I was brought to this institution. I say brought, for I am confident that I would never have come here of my own free will. I feel certain that force must have been employed, since I am not a man to be either coaxed or bullied into doing that which it is not my pleasure to do. Yes, force must have been used; force, too, of a barbarous and cruel character. I think I remember—though sometimes I fear my memory is failing me—of being encased in a strait-jacket,—a most devilish contrivance,—and bound with cords that cut into my flesh, stopping the circulation of the blood in my limbs, and forcing it into my head, where it simmered and boiled and bubbled till my brain was scalded, and my hair, which was black, became a fiery red. It is false, 'tis not white, but a blazing, fiery red!
                  "The military chieftain over yonder, with his arms folded, who stands gazing meditatively on the ground, calls me Captain Mars. Is it, wonder, because he sees in me a likeness to the red planet Mars,—I with my fiery head and burning brain,—that he thus addresses me? I think it must be so, for his mind, poor fellow! I understand, is seriously affected, and he believes himself to be the first Napoleon. It is curious, very curious to me, that one can so far lose the control of one's reason as to imagine one's self another person than that one actually is. Ha! ha! how laughable! How strange it would be if I should fancy myself Mohammed, or Washington, or Potiphar's wife! I would laugh at myself for it; and would not all the persons in this 'Institution' laugh at me, too, and cry shame! shame! Of course they would; though, somehow, no one laughs at or cries shame to Napoleon there. Possibly because he has a way of brandishing his cane as if it were a sword, and thrusting it at you in a dangerous sort of way if you stand in his path, or make faces at him when he passes. He is most unsafe to encounter, and I've told the Czar so (the Czar is the tall man, the strong man, the mighty man who sits on the high throne in the office with always a glass of gin and water beside him, and holds the keys that unlock the doors of this peculiar 'Institution' in his possession), when he believes that he is reviewing his army, and, astride of his cane, goes galloping about the inclosure, ordering to the right or left every one whom he encounters. If any fail to obey him, he hastily dismounts from his charger, which temporarily is converted into a sword, and fiercely rushes at them with it. One must be nimble to escape his attack. The Queen of Sheba, while promenading with Daniel in the lion's den, was run down by him the other day and lost her chignon. She offered, through Judas Iscariot, a reward for its recovery of thirty pieces of silver, but compromised with Pontius Pilate, who found it, for a bottle of soda-water—not soap and water, in which he daily washes his hands. But—what was I saying? O! yes—whenever Napoleon charges on the people I usually retreat behind the fat woman,—old Mother Hubbard of juvenile memory, who is always either occupied in churning, by bobbing up and down like the dasher of a churn, or else in making great cheeses, by whirling around on her toes till her skirts become fully inflated, when she sinks gracefully down in the centre thereof, and, lo! and behold! straightway is a cheese. By the way, she is one of the oldest historical dairy-maids of the nursery. She is the original milk-maid all forlorn, who milked the cow with the crumpled horn, of whom our great-grandchildren will read long before they become grandfathers and grandmothers. She obtains, she tells me, one hundred and eighty-six dollars and nine cents per pound for her butter, and ¥18 6s. 9d. sterling apiece for her cheese. When she told me this, one afternoon while we lay under the currant-bushes, where we had crept to get out of the sun, I immediately made a little calculation in my head, which took me nine days, nine hours, nine minutes, and nine seconds to compute, the result of which, to my utter surprise, showed that the old woman to all practical intents and purposes was bankrupt. In fact, I discovered that she owed me a larger sum than her receipts amounted to for the tubs and boxes—wash-tubs and cigar-boxes—I made, and in which she packed her butter and cheese. Of course my profits are enormous, and if I can only induce the old woman to settle with me I shall esteem myself a fortunate individual. I offered to divide the profits with Napoleon if he would frighten her, some day when reviewing his army, into a settlement. He promised to do so; but, poor fellow! I understand his mind is diseased; I am afraid he will forget it. If the times were not so hard just now I would not ask his assistance; but the fact is—I would not tell this to everybody—I need the money. I am getting up a fac-simile edition of the Bible which I printed and sold in Paris in 1462. How old am I? That is my business, not yours. What is my name? That again is my own business and yet I'll tell it to you. My name is Faustus,—Doctor Faustus. I invented type. I discovered the art of printing. I printed the first Bible. I sold them for a good round price, too, and made money; but the Parisians, fools that they were, accused me of magic, and of having dealings with the devil, and they would have killed me, but I fled from the city, leaving behind me all my money. I nearly starved, I was so poor; then, indeed, I did make a compact with the Evil One. I sold to him my soul, and in exchange I received food,—canvas-back ducks and olives,—and, further, the privilege to dwell on the earth until each living human being thereon can read his own mother tongue. I cannot but think sometimes, when I am very weary, and my brain seems racked to pieces, after an unsuccessful attempt to instruct a horde of ignoramuses in the alphabet, that I drove a hard bargain for myself when I entered into this agreement with Satan. I often with I were dead; but, no! I cannot die till the whole world knows its alphabet."
                  At this point in his reading the worthy Professor was taken with such a severe fit of coughing that he nearly choked to death, and would, doubtless, if the Parson had not taken the most vigorous methods to resuscitate him. With a zeal worthy of the cause that called it forth, he pounded, with an energy only equal to that which each Sunday leads him to pommel the cushion of his reading-desk, the back of the Professor, thereby transferring the purple hue of his face to the vicinity of his spinal column. Even with this effective treatment the Professor was unable during the remainder of the evening to recover his breath sufficiently to enable him to proceed with his reading, which was consequently postponed until our next meeting.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XVIII.
                  THE PROFESSOR HAS THE FLOOR.
                  THE question arose at the last meeting of our "Social Society," whether the Professor still had the floor, and could continue the reading of his paper attributed to Dr. Faustus. The Parson contended that he could not, and said, as he had failed to come to time when called at the previous meeting, that he thereby forfeited all claim to the right of reading the conclusion of his wild, rambling, and erratic paper. "Besides," said the worthy Parson, "this holding up to the light, as it were, the foibles and weaknesses of poor humanity is not in good taste. It is, if I may use so strong an expression, simply pandering to a morbid appetite, and in no way is a benefit to any one."
                  "I contend," said the Professor, in reply, "that this is not the case. The desire which prompts a person to examine into the acts and expressions of one bereft of reason is a natural and proper one; and at the worst is simply prompted by curiosity, while it oftentimes arises from an honest wish to benefit them by clearly understanding their moods and fancies. My opinion is," said the Professor looking benignly at the Parson, "that out reverend friend simply desires to get me off the floor so that he may have the opportunity of taking my place to read us one of his old sermons; and the question is whether you would rather listen to a musty discourse on the building of Noah's Ark, or hearken to the rambling talk of Dr. Faustus."
                  The Parson contented himself by exclaiming, "Another paradox of the age!" and the Professor, with the assent of those assembled around the table, continued his reading as follows:—
                  
                     DR. FAUSTUS HAS THE FLOOR.
                     "There is an old woman here—she makes butter and cheese; a toothless old woman, almost deaf and dumb, and so fat! who has not yet got beyond the letter 'A'—with whom I strive night and day trying to teach, but she will not learn, because she is so busy making butter and cheese.
                     "I do not know what to do with her. Sometimes when I have repeated the letter 'B' to her nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine times, and think she has learned it, and is about to pronounce it, I invite Napoleon to hear her; but when he folds his arms and stands silently gazing at her she becomes so frightened that she forgets it, and can only mumble, 'Butter and cheese, butter and cheese.' So I quite despair of her ever becoming a great scholar.
                     "For my own part, I am a wonderful scholar: I speak all languages; I have read all the books that were ever printed; I am full to overflowing with learning, and wisdom, and good sense; I know who built the Pyramids and carved the Sphynx of the desert; I have a mortgage, duly recorded in the Doomsday Book, on the late tower of Babel; and I hold a title-deed to a pew in Solomon's temple."
                     At this point the Parson interrupted the Professor to say that he thought this must be a mistake, as there was no record in existence to show that there were pews in this ancient edifice.
                     The Professor answered by saying that the deed was sufficient proof there were pews, and continued his reading.
                     "Yes, I am a wonderful scholar,—none greater in the land than I. But four hundred years of constant study ought to make one a scholar, and it is this length of time since I commenced to study. You don't believe it! Some people do not believe, either, that the Wandering Jew exists, but I do; I know he does, for I have seen and conversed with him. He was present in Germany when I made my compact with the devil. He shook his head at me and advised me not to sign it. He approved, though, of the duck and olive part of the agreement—canvas-back ducks and olives farce each Friday afternoon at five o'clock as long as I lived; for he, poor, long-bearded wanderer over the face of the earth, had oftentimes gone hungry to bed; but the Aleph, Beth, Gimel portion of the compact did not meet with his approbation.
                     "'Because,' he said, as we sat together that day for the first time, eating ducks and olives,—I had asked him to dine with me, and he has dined with me once a year ever since,—'because,' he repeated, 'you will find it an impossible task to teach every one the alphabet, even if you were to live as long as I shall; and to live forever on the earth is terrible. You become a stranger even in your own land, and your children's children, after a few generations, look on you with suspicion, and fail to discover that the blood which flows in their veins is the same that courses through your own. I expect to be Macaulay's "Last Man"mdash;the one who shall stand on London Bridge and survey before me the ruins of St. Paul's; while you, doctor, at the same moment, perched on the summit of the Bunker Hill Monument, may behold Barnum's Museum, Independence Hall, the White House, the Natural Bridge, the Mammoth Cave, Niagara, and the Mississippi River in the New World, swallowed by the sea-serpent or a tidal wave. Ah, doctor, the world is a hard road to travel; but with ducks and olives every Friday you may find it comparatively easy.'
                     "But, sad to say, despite the d's and o's I have not. It has been a hard road for me to travel,—harder than the Jordan of which the boys outside the inclosure wherein I walk sing.
                     "There is a military character here who imagines himself to be the first Napoleon—I have mentioned him before, have I? Well I don't care if I have; I'll mention him again. There is a military character here who declares himself to be the first Napoleon,—but he is not,—who promised one day, while he was eating ducks and olives with me, that he would assist me in propagating the alphabet among the ignorant. The following day he came very near being eaten up by the English bull-dog Waterloo, which is kept chained near the entrance-gate, within whose reach he ventured for the purpose of teaching the brute his letters from a newspaper. Since that occasion the Emperor has done nothing towards educating the ignorant. I presume, poor fellow! he has forgotten his promise, for I understand his mind is diseased. In short, he is deranged, out of his head, luny, crazy, Tom's-a-cold. Well, well, I'm glad I'm in my right mind; I don't pretend to be Napoleon, or old Mother Hubbard, or the Wandering Jew, but I am—did I tell you?—Faustus, Doctor Fanstus. Some learned idiots have spelled my name Fust and others Faust, neither of which is correct; but it is Faustus, sir, Doctor Faustus, and—the devil.
                     "Ha! ha! I am a bibliomaniac; I have a rage for books; I printed the first book—I shall print the last. The Bible was the first book—the Judgment Roll will be the last. When Gabriel's trump shall be blown, then will I ask for copy. Hark! do you not hear it? No, no alas! it is the only dinner-horn. Come, it is Friday, dine with me and eat ducks and olives; and we dined."
                     Thereupon, the Professor, thrusting the manuscript into his pocket, turned to the table near him, cut into the cold duck before him, seized a half-dozen stuffed olives off the dish, and gave the Parson and myself to understand, by his actions, if not by words, that it would be a good plan for us to follow his example, which we incontinently did.
                  
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XIX.
                  THE PARSON'S SPANISH SERMON.
                  "MY friends," said the Parson as we shoved our chairs back from the supper-table, the other evening, "you have listened for two or three meetings past, with a degree of patience which has scarcely been equaled since the time of the lamented Job, to a certain paper purporting to be an original communication from an insane individual who thought himself to be Dr. Faustus. My own opinion is that it originated solely in the brain of our worthy, though eccentric friend, the Professor." Here the Parson was interrupted by cries of "Order" proceeding from the ladies around the table.
                  The Parson, slightly embarrased by this demonstration, thrust his spectacles upon his forehead, and placed another pair on the bridge of his nose. Then bowing gravely to the ladies, he continued: "While I sympathize sincerely with the Professor in his evidently diseased state of mind, I most earnestly deny that the paper he read before us was a proper one for any person to have listened to; I have, however, a paper"—and here the Parson brought forth from hs side-pocket a formidable roll of manuscript—"to which no one who listens can possibly find any fault."
                  "I presume," said the Professor, "that it is one of your most ancient sermons."
                  "It is a sermon," replied the Parson, "which I have never preached save in my Spanish Castle, and which, I fear, I never shall elsewhere. In fact, it is more a reverie than a sermon, and I doubt if I shall ever live to realize any of the experiences therein set forth. Without more preface, I will now give you my
                  
                     SPANISH SERMON.
                     "Being an unmarried man, I indulge in many a twilight revery of that which might have been. I do not say that I am dissatisfied with my present life, or that I would in any way seek to alter it; but sometimes, seated in my study, the loneliness of my bachelor life confronts me, and, letting my thoughts wander where fancy leads them, I find myself living over again the days of long ago.
                     "Now, on this chill winter might, I am cosily seated in my easiest chair, my feet incased in a pair of velvet slippers, the gift of a fair friend." Here the Parson's hearers looked at Miss Kate, who only turned her eyes pensively upon the table-cloth. "It is dusk, and out of doors the shadows are gathering. They fall on the mountains and hills and ice-bound river, and by and by will gently and silently veil them from sight. The night is cold and clear, and the wind whistles fiercely through the leafless branches of the trees, and moans mournfully around the corners of the parsonage; but within, where I am, it is warm and summer-like. Flowers bloom beside me, and the atmosphere is heavy with their perfume. I turn my chair from the window, out of which I have been gazing, toward the open stove, and, placing my feet on the polished hearth, prepare my mind for reverie.
                     "I hum to myself the melody of a song,—a song my fair friend sings,—fold my arms, turn my face upward till I catch sight of a pale pink light on the ceiling,—the reflection of the blazing coals,—and yield myself to idel dreamings.
                     "Idle dreamings, did I say? No,not idle; for whatever attunes the heart of man to thoughts of gentleness, whether it be a mother's prayer, a sister's smile, or a loved one's caress,—a midnight dream or a twilight fancy,—cannot be idle. I know that these dreamings make me a better man. I am more disposed, when I wake from them, to look kindlier on my fellows, and to feel that we are all the children of one shepherd and the sheep of one fold; while a love for all pure and beautiful things fills my heart.
                     "Are they then idle dreamings? I ask you, gentle mothers; you, fair sisters; you, beloved friends. No, you answer; and, with the approval of such as you, I heed not the opinions of stern, grave men, scorners of the heart's emotions; but turn confidently to my twilight musings.
                     "It is like the dawn of love, I say, this light upon the ceiling, pale and scarcely seen,—for the darkness had not yet fallen out of doors, and the snow on the ground reflected the lingering twilight,—but it will grow larger and brighter as the night comes on, assuming a warmer and rosier tint, and lighting up my library with a cheerful glow.
                     "Thus is it with love, I mused; at first it is scarcely perceptible—a mere glance of the eye; then a smile, perhaps; next a pressure of the hand, then a kiss follows, and at last a mingling of heart with heart. Thus gently did my reverie divide itself, till I exclaimed, turning my eyes from the ceiling, and peering into the fire—First:
                  
                  
                     A GLANCE OF THE EYE.
                     Here the Professor interrupted the Parson to say that, if it were all the same to the company, he would like to be excused from listening to any more of such namby-pamby twaddle, and would go home. His desire being granted, the Professor took his hat and departed.
                     The Parson, piously crossing himself to keep down his anger at the indignity cast upon him, proceeded:—
                     "There is much in a glance of the eye—more than most persons are able to discern; hate, scorn, indifference, pity, friendship, affection, are all born of a glance. Who has not seen a black eye flashing with anger, or a hazel one dancing with mirth? a blue eye tearful with sorrow, or a gray one beaming with love? What so sweet to memory—so enshrined in the holiest recess of the heart—as the parting look of a mother? The infant in the cradle marks her gentle smile; the boy, leaving for school, carries it with him; the maiden at the altar, as she plights her troth, finds the tear-dimmed eye of her mother turned upon her. And the young man going forth into the cold world is blessed with her farewell glance; through life it hovers around him; it comes upon him amid the bustling crowd of the street and in the silence of his chamber; it parts the curtains at his bedside, and drives the shadows from his daily path. The glance of a sister's eye is much, and a mother's eye is more; but what shall count that which tells of the dawn of love? We scarcely see it ere it is past, and no place, no time, but can yield it birth. It is like the first beam of the morning sun turned upon the bud, warming it into the perfect flower.
                     "I am musing now of a pleasant face seen many years ago—a face I had long carelessly looked upon—a mild, sweet face, though lacking great beauty. I knew her good and kind, more amiable and less selfish than those about her. I catch the sound for her voice in a distant part of the house, though others hear it not, and am straightway silent; though why I cannot tell. I listen, unaware even that I am doing so, for her coming, with a degree of interest that puzzles me, since when she is by I scarcely give heed to her presence. It is to some one lese I turn; yet, if she be absent, I forget to talk, my laughter is hushed, and I lose myself in thought. Still I have no idea that she is more to me, or even so much, as some others; and yet I find myself dreaming of her, and arranging a bouquet for her, which I give to another. I laugh and chat gayly with her companions when she is near, but alone with her I am silent and sad. So it goes on, day after day, week after week, till I leave her for a few days. A brief and cold farewell, and we are parted. I think of her often, very often, oftener than any one else, in the days I am separated from her, and I draw comparisons at night before I sleep—I lie awake for hours—between her and those about her, much to their disadvantage; yet for all this I have no idea that I love her.
                     "At last there comes a day—a bright day that, a golden day for me—when, returning to her home, not alone, but with her sister beside me, I see her, though she sees me not, through the window of the car that has borne us onward, awaiting our arrival. There is a look of expectation on her face as she watches the passengers pass out; one, two, half-a-dozen, step upon the platform, but we come not; something detains us—a stray parasol or a forgotten book, perhaps; all is silent, no sound of rustling skirts, no quick step falls on her ears; her countenance changes, a look of disappointment creeps over her face, and she turns slowly aside, perhaps to hide a tear. But the sound of footsteps as we move forward attracts her attention. She turns quickly toward us, the expectant look is once more aroused, hope stirs her breast, a gleam of joyousness spreads over her countenance, and the glances that speed between us whisper the dawn of love. Blushes suffuse her cheek, her neck, her bosom. I feel my heart beat as it never did before, and am very, very happy.
                     "We are both dull that afternoon, she and I, so far as language goes, though we are reading each other's thoughts through the eyes, 'receiving fair, speechless messages.' Through the evening I wonder—for we had barely spoken to each other after our first greeting—whether I was not deceived, and that the glance I so treasured in my heart was not, after all, despite my fervent wishes, given more unto her sister than to myself; but the look of tenderness and love which unconsciously falls from her eyes when I take her hand in mine to bid her good-night goes far to reassure my drooping heart. I find a tear in my eyes—a tear of joy, not of sorrow—as I turn my gaze again unto the ceiling. I dash it carelessly from me, for I would not have a pleasant memory of a hope that came to naught stir my heart too deeply."
                     Here, much against the wishes of the fair ones around the table, the Parson closed his manuscript, promising another portion of it—The Smile on the Lips—at the following meeting.
                  
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XX.
                  THE PARSON CONTINUETH HIS SERMON.
                  "MY sermon," said the Parson, gravely wiping his spectacles, "is, I am aware, scarcely what you might expect to hear from so sedate and old-fashioned a person a myself; but remember it was written years ago, when I was young man, and when—although you, looking at my gray beard and wrinkled brow, may wonder at it now—I was as romantic a lover as ever built castles in the air, or erected chateaux in Spain. The form may be bent, and the head become grizzled by age, but the heart, if it be an honest and true one, can never be otherwise than young. And it seems to me, as I recall these half-forgotten memories, that I am renewing my youth, and am going back to the days of long ago."
                  Here the widow White and my sister exchanged glances, and then turned their eyes furtively toward Miss Kate, who, however, with demure look, was evidently giving her entire attention to the selection of an orange from the dish before her.
                  The Professor, however, somewhat unnecessarily and sneeringly remarked that, until the Parson dyed his beard and put a wig on his head, he would never look any younger than he now did; and even then, he continued, every young girl—yes, and elderly one, too—in his congregation would see through the disguise.
                  To this the Parson replied, that when he took to such devices to renew his youth he would be willing to have the cheat discovered.
                  And then, unrolling his manuscript, he proceeded to read the continuation of his—
                  
                     SPANISH SERMON.
                     "The twilight out of doors has faded, darkness has gathered around, and night has come. The wind has also ceased, and I no longer hear its sad or fierce murmurs. The air, too, has grown chillier, so I nestle more deeply into my cozy chair, and look upward.
                     "There is a rosier tinge in the light upon the ceiling; it is broader and brighter, too, than at first, and in this particular, muse I, does it resemble love. Love grows day by day, filling the heart with brighter, warmer feelings. It does not, as some would have us believe, expand to its full glory in a second; but little by little, more and more, it increases. Some new and amiable trait of character of the beloved one will suddenly appear; a smile, instead of a frown, given to a querulous child; a silver mite dropped into the open palm of a suppliant; a kind word for the sad-hearted; a gentle smoothing of the pillow for the sick, or a firm hand put forth to assist the old and infirm. Small things these, perhaps, in themselves, but great when placed in the balance that weighs hearts; and that sweet trait, hitherto unknown, will make our bosom to throb with joy, and we will feel our love for the dear one increased by it.
                     "And so, I said, the glance glides imperceptibly into—
                  
                  
                     THE SMILE ON THE LIPS.
                     "Who that has ever looked upon one of Raphael's Madonnas but has marked the loving smile that plays about her mouth? There it is—there it will ever remain—the sweetest expression of her face—the smile of a mother over her infant boy! Who that has seen Sir Thomas Lawrence's portraits but has been attracted toward them by the coquettish smiles that hover over them? Who that knows the charming portraits of our own Le Clear does not recognize the beautiful smiles that linger around their lips, lighting up the face, and casting a halo over the countenance? The smile of a loving face, says the poet, is better than splendor that fadeth quickly? And I am musing now, though many years have fled since then, of one sweet smile that on a summer evening broke upon me.
                     "I do not know why that smile should linger longer in my memory than any other! I have doubtless seen graver and more pensive smiles—smiles, too, of scorn and of anger—smiles which merely wreathed the lips, and smiles which deeply stirred the heart; yet the remembrance of them has passed away. But have I ever seen, I ask myself, a more loving, trusting smile than that which moved the depths of my soul that tranquil eve? I pause. I do not remember that I ever have. I cannot recall what I had said that called forth that smile; perhaps I had been telling a pleasant tale, or whispering a sweet dream; but whatever it was I have now forgotten it. It came across the calmness of her face like gold and crimson clouds at sunset across a beautiful sky.
                     "I muse of that evening of summer, when the moon is shining above us,—my fair friend and I,—and we are rambling by its light along a pleasant path. The leaves of the old elm-trees that stood by the wayside are tremulous, though no breeze stirs them. Yet do they seem murmuring among themselves love-tales wafted through the still, warm air from the tall pines on a neighboring hilltop; the chirp of crickets comes up from the tangled grass of the wayside; the songs of katydids—for autumn is drawing near—are heard on our path, and afar in the meadow the tree-toads are moaning plaintively.
                     "But little of this do I heed. I feel the soft pressure of an arm. I catch the bright glance of an eye; a breath falls on my cheek; and a fair face is turned upward to mine. I am striving to read that face; I would know the thoughts passing through her mind. Are any loving ones given to me! But the moon glides so coquettishly from cloud to cloud that I cannot see the expression long enough to tell. At length we stop, and turn to retrace our steps, just as the moon emerges from behind a heavy cloud, and my gaze is fixed on her face to mark the smile she gives me; and that smile, so fond, so true, tells me as clearly as words could express that I am beloved.
                     "I care no longer, now, what manner of night it is; the moon may cast its light on our way, or hide beneath the flying clouds; for all is bright before me, and that smile of my sweet friend has brought a light to my heart fairer and brighter than ever moon can shed. But yet—ah! that 'but yet,' how it passes into our fondest dreams—but yet arises the fear, like the shadow of the cloud on the earth, that my hopes but mock themselves with vain imaginings, and I strive, though all in vain, alas! to drive them from me. But sleep, gentle sleep, brings me glad tidings, and my dreams that night are very pleasant, for an angel in the form of a woman comes in the stillness and smiles above my couch.
                     "On the morrow the remembrance of that smile bears with it a joyous hope—a hope that she may one day, in that golden future to which we all look forward, be my wife. Youth is ever hopeful, and I thank Heaven that it is. Hope is the polar star by which we guide our wandering footsteps safely on our way. It is the sheet-anchor which holds us steadfast against the adverse winds and currents that else might turn us from the right. It is the rainbow that follows the storms of life, and the Ida Lewis to our shipwrecked ambitions."
                     Here the Parson brought the second part of his sermon to a conclusion, much to the delight of the Professor, who stated that he had an article prepared, which, as it was not very late, he begged the privilege of reading.
                     The privilege was, however, denied to him; and, much affronted thereby, he took his hat and went home.
                  
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XXI.
                  THE PARSON IN THE MIDST OF HIS SERMON.
                  "HOW the sober old Parson," said Miss Kate, "can write such a pretty love story as he has, puzzles me."
                  The Parson, overhearing her, said: "Miss Kate, you must bear in mind that I wrote this sermon, which you are pleased to call a love story, many years ago, and that, though my hair has grown gray since then, and my forehead shows a few wrinkles, my heart is still young, and is as susceptible as ever it was to the tender passion. Without further talk, however, I will continue my—
                  
                     SPANISH SERMON.
                     "Dark night is out of doors, and the stars the beaming brightly in the heavens. The light upon the ceiling has grown broader, and a redder tinge is added to it; while it sheds a pleasant glow throughout the apartment like the light of the harvest moon. I rise from my seat, and bending a moment over the flowers, inhale their delicious perfume: the fragrance of orange-blossoms, hyacinths, and heliotropes is grateful to me, and soothes my mind once more to gentle fancies—fancies caught in the mesh of truth. Then, when I turn my eyes once more unto the cheerful light that plays upon the ceiling, I feel a thrill pass through my heart as when I first felt—
                  
                  
                     THE CLASP OF A SOFT HAND.
                     "While I muse and ponder there rises to my mind the glad memory of a night of long ago—a night in winter-time time, when she, my fair one, sat beside me. The burning brands on the hearth sparkle and blaze, and long streams of flame, like floating pennons, go roaring up the wide-mouthed chimney, telling, doubtless, to the frost and wind without how cozy and warm it is within. Until then the blustering wind had been contented to hide behind the stacks of chimneys, or comfort itself by moaning among the old pine-trees that rise beside the house; but now it rattles boldly at the casements, demanding entrance. It cannot penetrate within, for heavy folds of crimson curtains drape the windows.
                     "In the room itself stands an opened piano, with sheets of music strewn over it; a tall book-case, through the half-closed doors of which peep forth a goodly array of volumes; some old-fashioned chairs, with high backs and quaint carvings; a few choice painting on the walls; a round table, drawn up to the fire, on which are rare prints and pencil sketches, and open books, and a small basket filled with such articles as a maiden in her industry may require. Seated near the table, and beside each other, are my fair friend and myself. None other of the household are there to break our magic number, save, indeed, the old tortoise-shell cat which purs upon the soft rug near my slippered feet, and with half-shut eyes winks at the flickering blaze.
                     "She, this fairest friend of mine, with glossy silk and silver beads, is netting a purse. Who it is for she will not tell, and looks so strangely disconcerted when I question her, that, out of pity, I am fain to leave the secret with herself. But her younger brother, a black-eyed, mischievous boy of six years old, dares to play the traitor, and whispers slyly to me, 'It is for one whose name begins with B and ends with Y.' So straight I guess my cousin Benny; but 'No!' he claps his hands and shouts, ''tis not for him.' Of course I give it up, nor will the lad tell me more.
                     "The busy fingers of my friend are netting the purse, and I am reading aloud from an old book of chivalry and love. There are many portions I read that waken all the gentle passions of our souls. Occasionally a half-suppressed sigh reaches me, and, if I raise my eyes to hers, I note a dewy moisture there, or else a joyous passage will call forth a smile; and I, in my warm admiration, scarcely know which of the two brings greater beauty to her face—the sorrow or the joy. We speak few words that evening, I remember, for the book itself says all we wish; and as the hours go by, and the story ends, I close the volume, and for the time half believe the incidents narrated form a part of my own life. She, too, has laid aside her work, and sits gazing meditatively on the smouldering fire, tapping her little foot, just peeping out from under the hem of her dress, upon the soft rug—a fit accompaniment, so it seems to me, to the thoughts that fill her mind. The lamp is dimly burning now, and a twilight glimmer pervades the room.
                     "There is a ring on her finger which I all at once have a strong desire to examine. I have often seen it before; in truth, I placed it on her hand myself. It is simply a plain gold ring, and yet I wish to see it. I wonder why this is so, and I half decide to ask her for it. But no; the thought that I may hold it in my hand gives me no pleasure. From where I sit I see, it, though not distinctly; so I draw my chair nearer towards hers, as though unintentionally, picking up a pin from the floor as I do so. To be sure the pin proves to be nothing but a straw, a thread, or a bit of paper, but what of that? I pretend to stick it on her needle-book, and say nothing. My object is gained, and I am nearer to her by several inches than I was. Indeed, I almost touch her, yet still I do not ask her for the ring; but sit silently gazing now on her face, which to my eyes appears each day and hour to grow more beautiful, and now on her hand, where glistens the little golden band.
                     "It is a fair hand, I think—a dear, good hand—a cozy, plump, real flesh and blood little hand—a hand to toy with, a hand to squeeze on a sleigh-ride of a winter night inside of a muff, aye, or outside either; and, if it comes to that, a hand to kiss in summer-time on a moonlight ramble; a hand to wield an ivory fan; a dimpled little hand; a friendly little hand; a loving little hand; a hand to clasp before the altar; a hand on within to place a bridal ring; a wife's hand to rest trustingly within her husband's; a mother's hand, with which to part the clustering ringlets from her children's brows, as at the twilight hour they gather around her, listening to her loving voice telling them the story of little Samuel. Ah! that hand, I muse; will it ever be all this to me and mine!
                     "And while I muse and gaze, that little hand goes slyly into the ruffled pocket of her apron; and then I long to know what else beside the hand and ring is to be found therein. How quietly it rests in that bewitching little nest; it does not move a finger. I would give much to have her draw it forth, so that I may look again upon the ring. My desire to see it grows stronger; I can resist no longer, but place my chair close beside hers, so close that I disturb her reverie. She turns her bright eyes wonderingly to my face, filled with a fond, deep joy, and smiles one of her own dear smiles. She slowly withdraws her hand from the pocket, and directly it lies in the palm of mine.
                     "A blush, perhaps, crosses her face, and she half essays to withdraw her hand from my earnest pressure, but cannot. I inclose it for a moment now, as a kitten does when playing with a mouse; but as I find it sliding from me, I quickly regain it, and it rests passively in my clasp.
                     "I have forgotten all about the ring now; all as to what may be in the little pocket; all but that her hand is clasped in mine confidingly, trustingly, lovingly. I would I dared to tell her something—something I scarce know what—that I feel sure would ease my heart of that half pain, half joy that thrills it; but I dare not, and only thoughts fill, as they pass, Time's golden minutes.
                     "But the sound of merry sleigh-bells out of doors, and shouts of joyous laughter, mingling with the noise of happy voices, break on my ears. One warm, earnest clasp of my hand; a soft, gentle pressure in return that sends the blood bounding through my veins; and the table is between us, the lamp turned up, the fire sparkling with the quick stirring I give it, the book, opening of its own accord, is in my hands, when her brother bounds into the room; others follow, and but for the heightened color and brightened eyes, we two, my friend and I, are as they left us. There are grave smiles upon the father's face, a searching glance in the mother's eyes, and some foolish jesting by the bachelor uncle at our evidently studied composure; but that is all.
                  
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXII.
                  THE PARSON PREACHES AS USUAL.
                  "MY sermon," said the Parson, in a slightly apologetic tone, "is drawing to a close, and yet I hope, notwithstanding its length, it has found some admirers among my friends around the table." Miss Kate ventured to declare that she, if no one else, liked it; and her mother said it touched long-forgotten chords in her heart. My sister only sighed; the Professor said, "Pooh! pooh!" and I puffed at my cigar. The Parson, without saying a word, unrolled his manuscript, and read as follows:—
                  "I turn my gaze once more unto the ceiling. The rosy light still exists; but there is a difference in its appearance. It does not beam as steadily as before; but seems to waver, as if uncertain whether to remain or disappear: one moment it is brighter than ever, and the next it fades almost to a shadow. The perfume of the flowers, though, has increased, for the jessamine is sending out its sweetest odor. The night is very still, and the stars look coldly down from the clear heavens. Beyond the eastern hills the moon is slowly rising, and already the distant mountains in the west are slumbering in its rays. Far off, on the ice-bound river, I see, dimly, horses with sleighs, and swift skaters gliding to and fro; but I have no desire to leave my quiet retreat nor my pleasant musings; so, casting a new supply of coals on the fire, I nestle within the wide arms of my easy-chair an let my reverie go on.
                  
                     
                     FIRST LOVE.
                     "Love, I say, like a fire, unless replenished with fresh fuel, will burn itself out. A look from those we love, or a written word when separated, little attentions to one another's wishes, shown in some trifling act of kindness, are all needful to keep the fire of love alive. Without these, however small they may be, love could not exist; and here for a time I grow philosophical, and while the fresh-spread coals are igniting—for there's no bright light on the wall now, only a faint and flickering gleam, a trembling memory, as it were, of what has been—I watch soberly the blue blaze making its silent way, and my thoughts grow grave and in keeping with it.
                     "Every soul, I say to myself, my find a heaven in some other soul. In each is implanted a feeling known as love. Nature gave to us love as a fulfillment of all our wants. Love is never dormant; it always lives. So long as the heart beats, love exists in one form or another. When no love remains, the heart perishes. A heart utterly without love is an anomaly. At certain periods of our lives the love within our breasts concentrates itself upon some one person, who from that moment becomes a being isolated far above all others; from that moment we worship an ideal, a fictitious being, a something which is not, yet which we believe to be reality—a spirit only of our brain. We clothe her from out of the store-house of our imagination in the most beautiful and costly robes that ever mortal wore. In our sight she is more than lovely, though others say she is plain; they find in her a resemblance to her kin, but we see only a likeness to the beautiful things around us: to the rainbows of heaven, the clouds at sunset, the flowers of the garden, or the tinted shells of the sea. She is a living melody, an angel's whisper, a saint's prayer. Whoever or whatever is sanctified by her presence beomes dear to us. The mother who bore her, the father who smiles upon her, the brothers who seek advice of her, and the sisters who go to her for comfort, all have a place in our hearts. She has grown to be in our eyes something almost holy, whom we are ready to worship, and yet know not why. We cannot approach her without feeling that a swift stream separates us, which we in vain essay to cross. There is an immense gulf between us. We are dumb, perhaps deaf, when she is by; but never blind. When she looks upon us we blush; when she takes our hand we tremble. The fall of her foot makes our heart beat, ad the tones of her voice ring like music in our ears. We cannot pass a day without seeing her; yet a word, a smile, a glance from her so fills our heart with happiness that it suffices until the sun next rises. We perceive beauty where we never beheld it before, and become half painter, half poet, and all lover. We grow childlike and trustful, and become better and stronger in the right before the light of her superior simplicity and goodness.
                     "This is the first love of the youthful heart. When this flood has passed, we have more rationality, though still an ideal. After marriage, the soul, craving greater happiness, detects incongruities and defects in the other not perceived before. This causes astonishment,—unpleasant thoughts; words follow, and pain ensues. The husband finds that his ideal has fled. Here he wavers; his regard little by little quits the shadow, and finally attaches itself to the substance. His love has changed, has become more subdued and quiet in its expression, and better fits him to encounter the rude world without and enjoy his own home within. As life glides on, each learns to know the other's strength and weakness better, and yielding both somewhat they grow to be one mind.
                     "Like two component parts, which of themselves refuse to mingle, yet when a third is added make but one; so man and wife ofttimes, through foolish pride, encasing up their thoughts each from the other, would on life's journey pass, even side by side, not knowing all the love—the boundless love—that fills the other's heart almost to breaking; but wrapt up in self, until between them comes a little child. His presence bursts the foolish barrier down, and makes the wailing mother twofold glad, for she has found a son and husband, too: from that day's hour their hearts and lives are one."
                  
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXIII.
                  THE PARSON GROWETH TEDIOUS.
                  "CHRISTMAS," said the Parson, "is coming; but before it reaches us I hope to have finished this long Spanish sermon of mine."
                  "Amen!" said the Professor.
                  "Not but that," said the Parson, paying no attention to the Professor's interruption, "I think you have been interested in it, especially Miss Kate there,"—and the Parson looked tenderly toward her,—"but because it is time that we should take to 'fresh fields and pastures new,' and give an opportunity for others to present a story or poem."
                  "That's so," said the Professor; "here you've held the floor with your interminable story,—sentimental and frothy at that,—and we have been obliged to either listen to it or go to sleep. I confess I have slept most of the time, and I presume others have."
                  Here the Professor was interrupted by loud cries of "No!" from the ladies; but I supported the Professor, and owned up to having once or twice nodded during the Parson's reading.
                  "And as he is not yet through," I continued, "there is no telling what may happen to me before he finishes."
                  The Professor looked at me encouragingly, Miss Kate deprecatingly, and the Parson more in sorrow than in anger. But without further parley he continued as follows:—
                  "Once more the light is gleaming on the ceiling, and, as I turn mine eyes upon it, it seems to grow brighter and broader. It dances here and there—wandering to and fro—advancing and retreating. The broken waves of light, as at last they blend softly together, seem like wayward maidens, wishing, yet fearing to receive from their lovers, the first—
                  
                     KISS OF LOVE.
                     "The scene is changed. It is spring-time; and the noises of the city fall muffled on my ears. I am seated in a cheerful room, and in the wide-spreading chair beside me half reclines that fair friend of mine,—fairer now than ever, for illness has paled her rosy cheek, and whitened her dainty little hand. It is thinner, too, and as it lies in my own—unresistingly, now—I feel the ring I gave her slip easily along her finger.
                     "Weary days and weeks of sickness have been hers,—days when her soul hovered between life and death; the sun rose and set, and thrice it rose and set ere hope broke through the darkness. During those long days of woe—woe to me, unconsciousness to her—I scarcely saw her; once, indeed, I rose in the night and stole quietly to her chamber. I stood long in the doorway gazing into the sick room—for it was a sacred spot to me, where I had never dared to venture—uncertain whether to enter or not. I could see by the dim light from the night-lamp burning in one corner the mirrored dressing-table, before which she in her loveliness had often stood; the very ivory that had parted her flowing ringlets lay upon it, and the bit of ruffle near by, held together by a small pearl cross, had twined around her throat. The miniature bookcase, in a niche between the curtained windows, held my gifts to her; the writing-desk on which she had penned such graceful letters—breathing no word of love 'tis true, but filled with glowing thoughts, and kindest sentiments for me alone; those crayon sketches upon the walls, drawn by her own fair hands: a vase of drooping flowers, —flowers I had gathered and sent her in the morning when the dew was still on them; the embroidered ottoman and chairs; the little silk slippers just at the foot of the bed, and all the nameless charms that decorate a maiden's chamber, were seen and noted by me almost in a single glance.
                     "Her mother, worn with ceaseless watching, had fallen asleep in her chair beside the bed, and only the dull ticking of the watch on the mantel broke the silence. Strange shadows, like the shade of angels' wings, rested on the walls and ceiling, and a feeling of awe, despite my efforts to the contrary, stole over me. Here, I thought, in this chamber, sacred to her alone, has she sung and prayed, slept and dreamed. Here she looked into the secret recesses of her breast; here she wept over her maiden griefs and rejoiced over her maiden happiness. Here, too, she nurtured her maiden hopes; and my bold heart dared to ask what these hopes might be. No profane eye had ever ventured to gaze on her unadorned loveliness, else had its sight been turned to darkness; and though I deemed my love for her was as pure and unsullied in its nature as mortal's love can be, I paused, nor heedlessly would venture into her sleeping presence. But the desire to once more look upon her before death could rob me of the power so to do, while yet life on earth was hers, overcame all scruples, and I entered.
                     "With cautious steps I gain the bedside, and gaze on the dear face before me, as white almost as the pillow on which it rests. She is sleeping calmly, but so deeply that I can scarcely hear her breathing; one arm lies across her bosom, the other rests on the coverlet beside me. I gently clasp her hand in mine, yet feel no pressure in return. I even stoop and kiss the parched lips and burning brow, yet she knows it not. I think a smile, however, passes for an instant across her pale face, and the lips half part, as though she felt the kiss and would return it. A tear falls on her cheek. I brush it carefully away, and, with one look, leave her in the keeping of Heaven.
                     "I sit long after I gain my own room: daylight finds me wakeful, thinking of her in all her purity and goodness; what she has already been to me, and what she may be, if it please God to spare her life, in the future. I feel that I have become a better man since the day we first met, and have grown stronger in my knowledge and pursuit of the right. And as I mused, from my inner heart went up a silent prayer—an earnest, humble, tearful prayer—such as I prayed when, in the days of long ago, I kneeled, a child in spirit as in years, beside my little bed, a mother's pleading voice leading me on. Such a prayer as—I regret to own it—I had not uttered years on years before. I prayed that Heaven in its great mercy would not take my darling from me, but leave her yet awhile to teach me, by her own pure words and innocent life, the way to Him. And He was very merciful, pitying my human weakness and granting my request. From that hour hope revived, and as I watched her day by day regain her wonted strength and health I ceased not to acknowledge the goodness and the power of the Lord.
                     "And now, as I still sit, with her dear hand in mine this day in spring, within the sunlit room, I can no longer refrain from telling her the story of my heart. I feel she knows it already, better, indeed, than I can tell it to her; for every look and smile she gives to me speaks of confidence and trust; and yet, till I in so many words shall tell her of my love, and win from her a like avowal, I cannot believe that she is mine alone. For what, I ask myself, is there is me that she should love? I, whose whole life has thus far been an idle dream. whose heart has been a wayward, stubborn heart, ever arrayed against the truth, ever comporting with the false! a wandering, inconstant heart, pursuing each fair butterfly that danced across my path! What can I have in common with one so pure, so good, so far above me in innocence and truth? I ask myself, with burning brow, will she indeed venture her hope of happiness for life upon my promised words to cheer, sustain, and love her; to be to her more than father or mother—the all in all, in short, through this her life? One look into her face, one pressure of her hand, and confidence both in myself and her comes back, like the flood after the ebb, and I feel that with her beside me neither my heart nor steps will falter, but remain true and steadfast unto the end. And then and there I bare the secrets of my heart unto her. I tell her all the story of my life—what I have been, and what I fain would be; that she, and she alone, has wrought a change in me that, whether come weal or woe, will never be forgotten; and as I end, and ask her for that gift—a costlier gift than all the world could offer—her woman's heart, I feel the hand I clasp press closer to my own, and in a low, trembling tongue, I learn that she is mine.
                     "My arm is round her now, my lips are pressed to hers; and in that first, deep, tremulous kiss I feel that existence here is not all joyless, and that there can be a heaven in life as well as after death.
                     "Joy such as ours, I whisper to her, should not be left to silence. Music alone can be its fit interpreter, and by the chords of song can our two hearts be twined immutably together.
                     "At my bidding she runs her white fingers over the ivory keys of her piano-forte, and as her voice rises in song the bloom on her cheeks, gone for so many weeks, returns, and her voice, always sweet, but feeble and faltering at first, grows full and tender, and soon in united harmony our voices fill the room and blend together as if one.
                     "Even now, when years have passed, and all the hopes and dreams I had that night have turned to dust, I find myself often at twilight, with tear-dimmed eyes and trembling voice, murmuring that old and antique song."
                     
                     Miss Kate expressed her delight with the reading by saying, as the Parson rolled up his manuscript, that it was a most charming story, and she hoped it would end well.
                     To which the Professor remarked, snarlingly, that as it had neither begun well nor sustained itself well, he did not see how it possibly could end well.
                  
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXIV.
                  THE PARSON CONCLUDETH HIS DISCOURSE.
                  "TO-NIGHT," said the Parson, as he unrolled his manuscript, "will see the conclusion of my idle reverie."
                  "What a pity," said my sister, "that Alcibiades has not been here to listen to it. To-morrow night, being Christmas Eve, he will be with us, and remain until after the holidays."
                  "And I," said the Professor, "will show him while here some pretty anatomical specimens—one, the preserved heart of an old parson."
                  The Parson gave no heed to these words of the Professor, but read as follows:—
                  "The light upon the ceiling is glowing brightly now, and the noonday sun of happiness is shining in my heart; no longer does the light waver and sway as last it did, but steadily beams, glowing full and cheerful. The moon, too, is floating calmly in the heavens, shedding its soft, refulgent light on the earth; the glimmer of the stars pales before its greater beams, even as the loves of our youth fade before the stronger and deeper emotions of our manhood.
                  
                     THE LOVES OF LONG AGO.
                     "As my thoughts go back to the loves of my boyhood, fair pictures that adorn the walls of memory's cabinet pass silently before me. Among them is one of sunny hill-sides, over which are scattered groups of gypsy-hatted maidens, with rosy cheeks and clustering ringlets, hand in hand with sunburnt school-boys, picking red, ripe strawberries from amidst their green leaves. Apart from the others, within the shadow of a leafy elm, sit two—one a lass of thirteen, the other a lad perhaps a year or two older. With one hand clasped in his, and her head resting on his shoulder, in the full trustfulness of childhood, she sleeps; he ever and anon parts the soft, flaxen hair from off her calm, white brow, and softly lays against it his own glowing cheek. She is dreaming; and he, too, is dreaming. She dreams of being an angel, with rustling wings and golden hair, in the spirit land; he of one day, in the golden future, having just such a maiden for his wife; and, boy though he be, he sees afar off a quiet home, wherein is a sunny face, a loving heart, a gentle voice, and a joyous smile. Her dream, alas! is already realized—his is drawing near.
                     "Other pictures crowd in swift succession through my mind, bearing with them visions of fair faces peering from amid glossy ringlets, and bright eyes and sunny smiles, and low, fond voices mingle with them as they pass; but, best of all, and oftenest, comes one face, fairer and dearer to me than all the others, the face of my sweet friend whose heart I hold in keeping.
                     "As my thoughts return to the present, leaving my childhood hopes behind me, I turn once more to that glorious light upon the ceiling, beaming and warm, even as my heart is glowing with its fullness of love and happiness. Again, in my reverie, I stand before the altar in the old stone church bowered amid the trees, as on that bright autumnal morning when she, in all her youth and trustfulness and beauty, gave me the blessed right to call her wife. Again I listen to the voice of the white-haired pastor as he reads aloud the holy service from the book of prayers; again the 'Wilt thou?' asked is followed by the calm 'I will;' again the ring is placed upon her finger; again the sacred benediction falls and the marriage kiss is given and returned, and while the pealing organ sounds a joyous anthem, I lead her forth—that fair young bride of mine—from amid the throng of relatives and friends that cling about her; and with tears, smiles, and kisses, mingled with prayers and congratulations, we leave them all behind. And she and I, from that hour onward, are all the world to each other.
                     "A manly pride pervades my breast; grand thoughts and great resolves of what, for her sake, I will be, go throbbing through my brain. The cares and troubles of life shall be as mist in my path. Everything before my determined and earnest purpose shall sway to my desires. I will so live, I say, that she shall never regret having placed her life's happiness in my keeping. I have already learned to look with kindness upon all men, and my heart is filled with charity. I do not turn coldly now and hasten on, as I used to, from the barefooted girls who sweep the crossings of the streets, but stop to press into their open palms my mite. Poor girls! I think there may be in their hearts one or more of the gentle traits, only wanting kindness to call it forth, which makes me love my fair young bride. I do not scorn now, as once I did, even the poor lost one, whose nightly path I chance to cross—for who can tell, I ask myself, how pure and good she may once have been; as innocent, perhaps, as she to whom I hasten. So all through life my love is ever near me, to direct and keep my wandering footsteps in the paths of virtue.
                     "How much truth mingles with the fiction of my twilight reverie I may not tell, for a gentle form is beside me, a hand is placed on my shoulder, bright eyes are looking into mine, and a voice whispers in my ear, 'Beware! let not the public read your soul too clearly; render not up the warmest secrets of your heart; keep something back, deep hidden in your breast for me alone to read.'
                     "And so I dare go on no further. I could tell, if I so chose, of joys most pure and holy; of meetings when kisses winged their way to lips, as swallows to their nests; of partings when hearts rocked like ships upon a stormy sea; of months and years brimming with happiness that came between; of letters that only half-filled up dark gaps of absence, some fraught with joy, and some with sorrow winged; of a joyous home, made so by a loving wife, and not a wife alone, but also by fair childhood's prattle.
                     "Children three are circling round my knees; their merry voices mingle with the soft entreaties of their mother that I will join their harmless revelry. As I do so my eyes rest fondly on them all, and I thank Heaven that it has granted me such great and priceless blessing. My hand is clasped in hers and my reverie is ended."
                     "And to think," said the Parson, as he folded his manuscript, "that all this is, after all, only an old man's dreaming. For me there will never be wife or children; only in reveries and dreams can they be mine."
                     "Don't be so certain of that," my sister said; "I expect to see you yet surrounded by wife and children."
                     "No," said the Parson, sorrowfully, repeating Charles Lamb's words; "'the children of Alice call Bartram father.'"
                  
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXV.
                  THE PROFESSOR'S STRANGE STORY.
                  THE Professor, not to be outdone by the Parson in the matter of story-telling, took the earliest opportunity of reading to us from his professional note-book the following strange story, entitled—
                  
                     DROWNED IN A PITCHER.
                     "It was not a large pitcher. Probably it would have contained two quarts of most any liquid—say milk, wine, vinegar, or water; yet I know that it would not hold—possibly because it could not—two quarts of new ale, with its complement of foam; for, invariably, the foam over-ran the pitcher and rolled, in white flakes, down its outer side. This, however, was not so much the fault of the pitcher as that of the ale. The pitcher itself was a curious and strange one; it was neither earthen, nor china, nor glass, nor pewter, nor silver,—of one or the other of which materials pitchers are usually made,—but it was of wood. In shape it in no particular could be called handsome; on the contrary, it was as uncomely a pitcher as was ever seen, being wide-mouthed, big-bellied, and shallow. It looked as if, in former days, it might have been a huge soup-plate, which, by some convulsion incident to the nature of plates and their fraternity, had suddenly been cramped together, supplied against its will with a surreptitious handle, and thereupon dubbed a pitcher. Of course it possessed a history, a remarkable history indeed; one that, together with certain curious incidents thereby connected, I am about to relate.
                     
                     "It may be remembered by some of you that in 1835, a few days after the great fire, a brutal murder was committed in the lower part of the city, by a sailor known as Dirck the harpooner, an athlete in form and a savage in temper. The victim was one of his boon companions, his equal in ignorance, depravity, and ferocity of disposition, but not in animal strength and activity. At the time of the rencontre both parties were under the influence of liquor. The murder took place at a low dance-house, situated in an unwholesome part of the city, and arose out of a quarrel in relation to a woman. Suddenly Dirck, 'to end the row,' as he himself afterward expressed it, grappled his companion, and, after a brief struggle, succeeded in throwing him across a bench, when, drawing a knife from the sheath that hung at his belt, with one stroke he nearly severed the head of his victim from the body. The murderer was immediately arrested, shortly afterward tried, condemned to be hung, and, as many believe, expiated, a few weeks thereafter, his offense upon the scaffold. This, however, was not the case, and from this point the strange narrative I am about to relate may be said to commence.
                     "At this period of time certain curious experiments, of a chemical and electrical character, were being made by certain well-known savants, and it was whispered, in scientific circles, that wonderful discoveries, of a nature to greatly benefit the human race, would be the result. The exact type, however, of these experiments, was kept a profound secret by the members of the medical profession engaged in instituting them; though some persons, who pretended to have an inkling of the secret, went so far as to aver that the results, if successful, would entirely destroy the business of undertakers and grave-diggers; that the sublime burial-service of the Christian Church would hence-forth remain an unobserved rite, and that in fact the millennium would straightway commence. Of course these were mere rumors, and had no foundation in truth.
                     "A short time previous to the day designated for the execution of the murderer, a secret deputation from the medical society of this city waited upon the governor at Albany. The result of this interview was that his excellency—who was a friend to science as well as a man of great humanity—consented to the committee taking possession of Dirck for the purpose of experimenting upon him, provided they would furnish a subject to personify the prisoner, and be hung in his stead in accordance with the just requirements of the law, and for the satisfaction of the populace, to whom an execution was a most pleasurable excitement. To fulfill this obligation the committee pledged themselves, and, in fact, substituted, at the appointed time, a dead body from their dissecting room, which resembled in its general appearance the condemned; and, when clad in his habiliments, readily passed for him.
                     "The newspapers of the day, in giving details of the execution, mentioned that, apparently, the fear of death had so blanched the murderer's face as to give him the appearance of a corpse; that his eyes seemed set; that his looks were extremely ghastly, and so weak was he that the support of the sheriff and deputy was required to keep him from falling, and they actually were obliged to carry him up the steps of the scaffold. The papers also noticed, as being singular, that a man of such full health and great strength as Dirck possessed, should have struggled so slightly; and although the medical men present declared that life, as indicated by the pulse, was not extinct under twenty minutes after the drop fell, yet, to the spectators, who judged only from the outward appearance of the body, death seemingly was instantaneous.
                     "As for Dirck himself, he was secretly removed, during the night previous to the day appointed for his execution, to an apartment in the medical college, and the dead body which was to represent him placed in the cell he had occupied. Of course the sheriff, and his deputies who were engaged in the transaction, were sworn to secresy; and so well has the secret been kept that up to the present time not the slightest suspicion has ever arisen to indicate that 'Dirck the harpooner,' was not executed in accordance with his sentence. It is for me, however, to reveal the truth, and narrate the history of the after-life of the murderer.
                  
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXVI.
                  THE PROFESSOR ENDS HIS STORY.
                  THE Professor, at our next social gathering, took the floor, and, after a few introductory remarks, wherein he spoke of the wonders that science had wrought, and was daily revealing to us, he proceeded to read the conclusion of the story of "Dirck, the harpooner," vouching for its truthfulness in every particular.
                  
                     DROWNED IN A PITCHER.
                     "When Dirck was first placed in the apartment which thenceforth was his prison, he was a strong, healthy man, fully six feet in height, and weighed nearly two hundred pounds. He was in the possession of all his faculties; had complete use of his limbs, and willful, revengeful, and passionate in his temper. In short, he possessed every evil trait of humanity, without a single redeeming quality. From the date of his entrance into prison, until his removal,—a period of five years,—he was made the subject of various experiments of a chemical and electrical character, the exact nature of which, however, I am under obligations not to reveal. It is my purpose simply and briefly to describe some of the phases of life through which Dirck passed during the period of his incarceration. His food the first three years consisted of bread and water, with the addition, once a week, in summer, of a small head of lettuce, which, in winter, was substituted by a roasted potato. During the two succeeding, however, he was allowed broths and soups ad libitum.
                     
                     "Although immediately subjected to a series of curious experiments, yet for the first six months very little change was observable in his condition. He would remain for hours in a corner, coiled up like a dog, without speaking or moving, and seemingly taking no notice of anything about him. Towards the close, however, of the year, it was thought that his ferociousness of disposition was materially subdued; his manners appeared less rude, and a higher intelligence beamed in his countenance. About this time he employed himself in carving, with a dull knife, in a rough, unskillful manner, from a block of wood, the pitcher which gives the title to this sketch. He worked unweariedly at this unpromising subject, and in the end produced one of the most fantastic and singular looking pitchers ever made. After its completion he began to read books, and took special interest in such as related to history and travel. He studied, too, many modern languages, and in a short time acquired fluency in speaking French, Spanish, German, and Italian. He became proficient in drawing, painting, music, and mathematics, and, in fine, was regarded as a prodigy of learning. His personal appearance, too, had entirely changed. He was no longer a rude, animal-looking being; but was refined and gentlemanly in his appearance and bearing. These results had been effected solely, it was believed, through certain electrical and chemical experiments, acting upon the brain, while the subject was unconscious and under the influence of chloroform. At the end of the third year so complete was the change, that the brutal and fiendish character of the man had entirely vanished, or rather had been converted into the noblest of qualities. This wonderful transformation, so ably and secretly accomplished, was on the point of being made public; and already steps had been taken to obtain from the governor a pardon for the criminal who, by the aid of science, had been raised from an abyss of depravity and ignorance seldom equaled, to the height of morality and knowledge.
                     "Just previous to this time, however, the man began to complain of slight pains in his head, which daily increased in power and duration, until finally an examination revealed the fact that a tumor was forming on the top of his cranium, and that the skull was perforated in several places. In a few days thereafter sundry dry excrescences of a fungus character made their appearance on is head. These fungi were shaped like passion-flowers, and grew with great rapidity.
                     "There was something so curious and interesting withal, in this, that the savants having him in charge decided to keep the history of his case a while longer from the public, that they might the better study this new phase in their subject. On the removal of these fungi, others, within a few hours, sprung up in their place, and in less than a month from the appearance of the first, the man was covered with them from head to feet. No less than two hundred and fifty-six were removed in a single day. The result, as might be expected, was that the man's strength, both of body and mind, failed him; and though he suffered little or no pain, it was evident that, unless this tax upon his vital powers was stopped, his life would soon terminate. From the first he was obliged, through weakness, to keep his bed, and it was not until the end of six months that it was noticed the patient had not only lost flesh, but was actually dwindling in stature. This was something so marvelous as to excite among the members of the medical profession, cognizant of the case, great interest. An immediate examination of the subject took place, presided over by Drs. Mott, Frances, and other well known surgeons and physicians, when it was ascertained beyond a doubt that the patient was nearly fourteen inches shorter than he was before this terrible scourge fell upon him. The bones of his body, too, were greatly softened, and could be bent in any direction. The body did not seem to shrink or shrivel, but to be consumed; the entire substance stance and life passing out through the deadly upas-trees which formed and fell off from him with marvelous rapidity.
                     "The close of the fourth year of the man's imprisonment found him entirely helpless. His mind was nearly gone, and his sight, hearing, and power of speech greatly impaired. His teeth and hair fell out, and his body in its proportions were no greater than those of a lad of ten years. He scarcely, for days at a time, spoke; but moaned and sobbed most piteously. He was entirely helpless and dependent on his nurse. At the end of the next six months, there remained little of the great, strong man, who had been made the subject of the curious and—shall I say it?—useless experiments. He lay now, like an infant, passive and feeble. Still the upas-trees grew, fell away, and were succeeded by others. Day by day life became feebler, the pulse was weaker, and silently, slowly, and in a mysterious manner, his existence ebbed away.
                     No one has ever witnessed the process of the formation of man, and no one will ever again, perhaps, look upon his departure from earth by the marvelous mode which characterized this of Dirck.
                     "One night, nearly five years after that on which he was brought to his prison, his nurse—as these respectable persons usually do—fell asleep in her chair. The fire in the grate filled the room with a dim and lurid light. Strange shadows flickered upon the walls and ceilings. Mysterious murmurs crept through the apartment. The wind wailed fearfully out of doors, and the frozen sleet rattled against the window frames. But all these sights and sounds failed to arouse the nurse, who slept on, unconscious of her charge on the floor at her side, and between her and the bed, where lay all that remained of Dirck the harpooner, stood the wooden pitcher he had wrought, half filled with one of those sweet, but strong whiskey-punches that nurses delight in imbibing. Suddenly a blast of wind shook the house to its foundation, the bed rocked to and fro, and, as if moved by a mortal hand, Dirck slid from the pillow and dropped without a struggle into the pitcher. A feeble cry arose, and then the punch settled down over his head, and Dirck was drowned. The next morning the pitcher was found to contain only a cluster of passion-flowers, and these were all that existed to prove that the murderer had met his fate by being drowned in a pitcher.
                  
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XXVII.
                  CHRISTMAS TIMES.
                  CHRISTMAS has come! Christmas, with its holy observances, its merry-makings, and its kindly greetings; Christmas, with its gifts, its evergreens, its roast turkeys, plum-puddings, and mince-pies; Christmas, when the children hang up their stockings and gather around the Christmas-tree; Christmas, when schools are closed, and teachers as well as scholars, freed from labor and study, rejoice in a brief holiday; Christmas, wherein was proclaimed, "Peace on earth, good-will towards men."
                  Something like this was the tenor of the Parson's sermon on Christmas morning. And it was listened to with becoming attention by the large congregation which was assembled to hear it. Even the Professor not only failed to sneer at it, but went so far in his admiration of it as to compliment the Parson at the dinner-table upon it. Nor was the dinner less successful than the sermon. Indeed, the Professor was quite at a loss to decide which he liked the more, and confessed that, next to a good sermon, he liked a good dinner. The good sermon fed his soul, and the good dinner his body; and it was equally necessary to enable one to live properly and enjoy life that soul and body should be duly nourished.
                  Turning to Alcibiades, home for the holidays, he asked which he preferred, to which the young man very honestly replied—the dinner. Sermons he heard plenty of at school; but never there did he get so good a dinner as the one he was eating; and it was a good dinner, and all about the table enjoyed it.
                  Miss Kate said 'twas better even than— 
                        "The dainty chicken, snow-white bread,"—
                      on which— 
                        
                           "They feasted, with no grace but song,
                           In summer, when the days were long."
                        
                      And her mother complimented my sister so highly on it that she quite outdid the Professor's eulogy on the Parson's sermon. In fact, all around the board seemed to have become a mutual admiration society, and every one said to every one else, "How charming you are."
                  It was left, though, for me to create a new sensation among my guests, and it was done simply by my proposing "The health of the coming bride and groom." Perhaps none were more surprised than the parties interested at this toast. They had endeavored to keep it secret, but somehow I had discovered it. After a moment's pause the Professor and the Parson both rose to respond. Each bowed to the other across the table, but neither seemed inclined to resign in favor of the other. The consequence was that each at the same moment began to speak, and said in reply, "It is with feelings of surprise that I find myself called on to reply to the sentiment just given"—
                  At this point both stopped and looked at each other, as much as to say, "Sir, by what right do you attempt to reply to this toast?" and then, without uttering a word, turned to me.
                  "It seems," I said, "that I made a slight mistake in the sentiment I proposed, or, rather, that I did not make it sufficiently full. Allow me, therefore, to amend and enlarge it: "The health of the coming brides and grooms—the Professor and my sister, the Parson and Miss Kate."
                  Such another scene of handshaking among the gentlemen and kissing among the ladies as then ensued can be imagined but not described.
                  
                  After the excitement had somewhat abated, the Professor said he had an amendment to the toast to propose, namely, that among the brides and grooms should be included the names of Mrs. White and Mr. Atwood.
                  "So far," I replied, "as I was concerned, I could, of course, have no objection, and would deem it an honor to be enrolled in their list of martyrs; but in Mrs. White's behalf I solemnly and earnestly protested against any such proceedings. She was a lady of years and experience; and though in the kindness of her nature she might consent to accept and marry such a one as I,—taking me, as it were, out of pity for my lonely and forlorn condition,—she should not, if I knew myself, and I believed I did, be forced by the persistence of friends advocating it into such an undesirable and unfortunate connection. Enough, my friends, is as good as a feast; too many weddings might prove a surfeit. Be therefore contented with what the gods have allotted you, nor seek to force into your charmed circle those who would rather remain outside. Besides," I continued, "Alcibiades here, the only disconsolate one apparently among us, needs me to keep him company yet a while longer."
                  To which Alcibiades nodded approvingly.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXVIII.
                  A DOUBLE WEDDING.
                  IT was a bright, frosty morning; the snow, fallen during the night, rested, pure and white, on the earth. From the eaves of houses and barns the pendent icicles glistened in the sunlight, and the leafless branches of the trees were clothed with wreaths of snow, making them look more picturesque than even when, in the spring-time, they are covered with blossoms and tender green leaves. The sleighs, on their way to the railroad station with city-bound passengers wrapped in fur robes, glided swiftly along; the horses scattered the snow on either hand, while the silver bells upon them jingled merrily, and in unison with the bell ringing a wedding peal from the old church-tower.
                  Indeed, it was a day seemingly made expressly for people to get married on. I question, however, whether in real love matches the season or the weather has much to do with the cheerfulness of the occasion. Lovers find their enjoyment among themselves; they are all the world to each other, and whether it rain ro shine, snow or blow, matters to them very little.
                  It is not for me to reveal how the Parson and the Professor passed their last hours of single blessedness. In good sooth I cannot tell, for not intending to be married myself, I retired from the room where they were enjoying themselves with their pipes and stories shortly after midnight, leaving them to follow my example whenever they saw proper. Whether they went to bed at all or not, I do not know; but, at all events, I am free to declare that when I entered the breakfast-room the following morning I found them both seated at the same table, where I had left them the night before. Instead, however, of pipes and mugs of ale being before them, they were enjoying quail on toast and cups of Mocha coffee. There was an air, too, of youthfulness about them, which I had not seen before in connection with them for at least a score of years. The Parson, while he held fast to his clerical suit of black, lightened it up with a white rose-bud and a sprig of geranium in the button-hole of his coat.
                  The Professor, although not a lily of the valley, was, nevertheless, I will venture to say, arrayed even superior to Solomon in all his glory: a white silk waistcoat, a blue coat with gilt buttons, delicate pearl-colored trousers, a white neck-tie, yellow tea-rose colored gloves, patent-leather boots, and a Parisian hat crowning his ambrosial locks, completed the portrait of one, the like of whom, as bridegroom, the village church had never before seen walk up its aisle.
                  Of the brides I need only state that in their outward adornment they were most tastefully and appropriately arrayed. My sister, I thought, was somewhat sad; but Miss Kate was as lively and merry as young brides generally are.
                  The church was robed in its Christmas greens, and looked as cozy and comfortable as ever a village church looked. Long before the hour appointed for the ceremony every part of the edifice, except a few pews in the front of the altar reserved for the friends of the brides and grooms, was filled with an anxious and curious audience, desirous of witnessing this double marriage.
                  The Parson was first married, the Professor and my sister being seated during the ceremony in a pew near by. The Professor, I must say, conducted himself during the first ceremony in a manner not altogether proper for the occasion. Among other incongruities in his behavior he persisted—in a quiet way it is true—in repeating the service after the Parson, "just to get," as he whispered to me, "the hang of the confounded thing."
                  Then, after the Parson had been made a married man, and he and his wife had received the congratulations of their immediate friends, he disappeared into the vestry room, from whence he soon emerged in his clerical robes, and proceeded to join in holy wedlock the Professor and my sister.
                  "Not," he said, "that I do not think the marriage would be equally binding if performed by the Parson's friend; but I wish to be married by one whom I have known so long, and esteem so highly, as I do my friend and sometimes opponent, the Reverend Benjamin Bacon."
                  After the two weddings had been solemnized, and the church was once more deserted by the cheerful throng which had filled it; when the sexton had drawn down the shades, and turned his key on the outward door; when the old church was left alone, and all that seemed of life, save the dim light that struggled feebly through the crevices about the windows, had disappeared; when the sound of voices was hushed within, and only the echoes of foot-steps that had been were heard, as they nestled hurriedly into the dark corners and secret recesses of the church; then the organ looked grimly down on the pulpit, and the pulpit, in turn, gazed upon the pews, and the pews stood in blank amazement gazing at the ceiling, which looked down on all sadly and darkly and silently.
                  And I thought how often this old church had beheld the young mother, bearing in her arms her new-born babe, pass up the aisle, proud of the infant whom she was about, through the rite of baptism, to give into the arms of the Church of Christ. And, moreover, how years would go by, and then, some sunny day, this child, become a woman, would pass down the aisle again, leaning on the arm of a strong, brave man, who would promise, as the Parson and the Professor had just done, to love and keep her as his wife until death should them part. And still years would go by, and children would walk with her down the aisle, and, seated beside her, would listen to the teachings of the good man who, years before, had baptized and married her. And once again, and for the last time, I thought, would she pass down the aisle, borne by friends who had known and loved her during life, and who in death did not desert her. And after this her place would be vacant, her seat remain unfilled, and the bowed heads, the tearful eyes, and the sad looks of those who remained, would tell more plainly than words that she was gone.
                  Such thoughts as these filled my mind while I lingered in the old churchyard, after the wedding, and it was not until the sun went streaming in through an unclosed eastern window that the ceiling forgot its gloom, the pews cast of their shadows, and the pulpit even grew bright, and my heart became light and joyous, that I was willing to join the bridal party at the breakfast-table.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXIX.
                  THE CURTAIN FALLS.
                  THE old year is dying. The antique clock in the corner, which for more than a century has marked the time as it went by, is ticking off the minutes of the last hour of 1869. Alcibiades and myself are alone. He, seated on one side of the fire-place, watching the ascending flames, is building beautiful castles in the air, which, perhaps, may be realized by him in the future; while I, gazing thoughtfully at the dead ashes on the hearth, with my mind wandering far back into the past, see only ruins and desolation. His joys are yet to come; mine are fast fading away.
                  The Parson and the Professor have, with their respective brides, each gone separate ways on their bridal tours. The former has sought the sunny South, where oranges and lemons are growing; while the latter has gone North into the land of icebergs and snow.
                  Alcibiades, already forgetting his first love, Miss Kate, is dreaming of another, who to-day, for the first time, crossed his path. She is a fair, blue-eyed girl, and reminds me of that early love of mine who twenty years ago told me she could never, so long as her father lived, be mine.
                  Strange it is that to-day I should read, in a newspaper a month old, the death of that man who stood between me and—paradise. Stranger yet that now, as I sit here, I should feel that she is near me; that, ere many hours have passed, I shall clasp her to my breast and call her mine. Is it, though, only a dream—a fancy? No, even now I hear her footsteps, and, when the door opens, I shall see her standing, statue-like, before me.
                  Can it be that I shall yet have in my possession the heart that twenty golden years ago slipped through my fingers? Nor years, nor absence, nor age, can destroy true love. Time may bring wrinkles, and gray hairs, and faltering steps; but it cannot shrivel the heart, nor sever the chords of affection.
                  I hear the rustling of her gown as down the passageway she comes, and "Lo! my darling one."
                  
                     POSTSCRIPT BY ALCIBIADES.
                     A most singular circumstance happened to my Uncle Frank Atwood last night. He and I were seated before the fire, smoking our cigars,—and he, in addition, with a glass of hot punch before him,—when suddenly rising and going toward the door leading into the hall, which he opened, he exclaimed, "Heavens! my darling one!" and immediately fell upon the floor senseless.
                     I rushed forward, but could discover no one, and straightway turned my attention to my uncle, whom I placed upon the lounge, and sent off the servant for our nearest neighbor, Mrs. White, who though she had gone to bed, soon made her appearance, slightly en deshabille, it must be confessed, and directed that my uncle, without delay, be placed in bed, with bottles of hot water at his feet, a mustard plaster on his chest, and that a quart of steaming boneset tea be administered to him every half-hour during the night; and, as this last prescription was most important, she herself would stay and attend to giving it to him.
                     The doctor, when he arrived, approved of Mrs. White's course, but added that a few leeches applied to his temples would do him no harm. He likewise advised shaving his head; but when I took off his wig, and showed how bald it was already, he said there was, after all, no necessity for it.
                     Mrs. White said as she was to sit up with and watch him, it might be as well, for her protection, to put him into a strait-jacket. But as he was unconscious, and perfectly harmless, I opposed it, and would not permit it, saying, "I did not think that in his present condition he could possibly do any harm to Mrs. White, and neither did I believe he would care to do any."
                     Mrs. White replied that in these days there was no telling what men would do; but still, if I were going to be near her all night she would run the risk.
                     This being happily settled, I went to bed, leaving my uncle in Mrs. White's charge. Just before morning I went into my uncle's room, and discovered Mrs. White sound asleep in her chair, and my uncle wide awake, sitting up in bed, gazing at her.
                     On seeing me he beckoned me to approach, and, pointing to Mrs. White, whispered, "What the deuce does this mean? Why is that woman in my room? Take her out."
                     But perceiving that she was fast asleep he took up his bedclothes and walked gingerly out himself.
                     Then, being in my room, I explained to him that he had been taken the night before with a sudden attack of—and not knowing exactly what it was I paused to consider—when he filled up the hiatus by saying, "Hot whiskey-punch." And as he only complains of a severe headache to-day, I think, in all probability, his explanation is the correct one.
                     When Mrs. White awoke, which was not until late in the morning, she was quite annoyed to find her patient gone, and to learn, moreover, he was out taking a walk.
                     So she went home, en deshabille as she had come, and resuming her widow's weeds, was heard to say that, though I, Alcibiades, was sowing my WILD OATS, my uncle, Francis Atwood, Esquire, was not yet ready to gather his APPLE-BLOSSOMS.
                  
               
            
            
               
               AROUND-THE MAHOGANY.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Little fear we
                           Weather without,
                           Sheltered about
                           The mahogany tree."
                        
                     
                     THACKERAY.
                  
               
               
                  
                  PEACHES AND CREAM FOR TWO.
                  WE drew around the tea-table,—my wife and I. Tea, save in the summer time, when I take my month's vacation, is almost an obsolete meal with me; for the hour—six o'clock—wherein it is proper for it to be partaken, is usually devoted by me to dinner. After being all day in town, with just a chance to run into Delmonico's for a sandwich or a tart at noon, six o'clock finds me, with the vesper-bell from the college sounding in my ears, as I reach my cottage-home in the country, possessed of an appetite which demands more than the simple tea, which, in the days of my boyhood, with dinner at noon, was all-sufficient for my wants.
                  Having, however, a regard for the habits of early life, my wife and I, in these idle vacation days, take our dinner at the primitive hour of half-past twelve, and so are enabled to enjoy our cups of Oojee tea, with the accompanying light biscuits and fresh butter, sponge-cake, and peaches and cream, with exemplary zest, in the good old-fashioned way.
                  Tea is the most social, too, of all meals. At breakfast the thoughts of the duties of the day often interfere with our proper enjoyment of the same; while dinner is a business that nature regards as a most important affair, not to be slighted or hastened, but treated with the attention and observance which it so eminently deserves. Tea is the only meal which may be dallied over. Then the labor of the day is done, and as we stir the sugar in our cups, we may fearlessly laugh and chat and be merry. The tea-cup is your true gossip's bowl, and next to the ancient wassail-bowl, merits the encomiums of all gentle-folks. The tea-table is the most proper, too, of any for the display of flowers; still, a shallow dish, filled simply with nasturtiums and morning-glories, looks well on the breakfast-table. On the dinner-table, however, with the steams of hot dishes mingling with their perfume, flowers, unless indeed, they come in with the dessert, are extremely out of place; but on the tea-table a vase containing a few roses or sweet-peas, "on tip-toe for a flight," as the poet hath it, or other flowers of mild odors, is an elegant and appropriate ornament.
                  I said something very like the above to the lovely woman who, for many years, has honored me by sitting opposite to me at table, pouring out my coffee in the morning and my tea at evening with a cheerfulness and punctuality creditable alike to her good taste and her kindness of heart.
                  She acquiesced with a smile in all I said, but reminded me that my tea was getting cold, and my peaches and cream remained untasted.
                  "Peaches and cream, my dear," I said, taking a spoonful or two of them, "form a repast fit for a poet; and if there be one dish more than another which I like, it is peaches and cream. Indeed, nothing can be better."
                  "I think," said my wife, blushing ever so slightly, "that in the days of our courtship your preference was for strawberries and cream."
                  "Starwberries and cream, my dear," I replied, "is exceedingly proper food for lovers; but for matrons and graybeards, peaches and cream is better."
                  My wife said that she didn't see why.
                  "Well, the only reason I can give at present is," I answered, "that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush; here are your peaches and cream; but where are your strawberries? Besides, I always had a weakness for peaches. They have ever had an attraction for me which no other fruit possesses. In my earliest years when I was the wickedest boy in my native town, I was more given to the rifling of peach-trees than of any other trees which flourished in the grounds of my neighbors. I remember I used to take much satisfaction in walking through the peach orchards, even in the spring-time, when the trees were only covered with pink blossoms, for I enjoyed, by anticipation, the rich harvest which the summer would yield. True, too, I took delight in looking at the beauty of the blossoms; and in listening to the ceaseless murmur of the bees extracting honey from them, and in hearing the song of the robin, hidden from sight amidst their pink clusters.
                  "Even dried peaches in the winter time had a relish for me which dried apples or plums never possessed; and the tarts the pastry-cook made of them were in my school-days much sought after."
                  "And I remember," said my wife, "that when we were first married my brandied peaches, which I kept in a store-room off from your library, were also much sought after by some one, and disappeared in a most mysterious and rapid manner. I know you laid their disappearance to the little black boy, but I have always had doubts as to whether he took them."
                  "Nonsense!" I exclaimed. "But I confess I life brandied peaches very much, and I trust you will not neglect to put a jar or two of them down. Brandy I know is dear, but don't let the price stand in the way of your fulfilling my request."
                  "O, for that matter," said my wife, "good whiskey will answer quite as well. Take"—and here her housewifely qualities triumphed over every other consideration, while, with commendable zeal, she spoke as follows: "take," she repeated, when she found she had gained my attention, "a pound of sugar for every two pounds of peaches. Select the best fruit, large and plump, and take off their skins by dipping them into hot water, when with a napkin they will easily rub off. Boil your sugar until it is ready to candy. Then take the kettle off of the fire, and pour upon the sirup as much brandy or whiskey as will serve when united with the sirup to cover the peaches which you have already placed in the jar to receive them. Pour the liquid while still warm over the peaches, and close and seal the jar."
                  "Excellent," I said. "Now, how about preserved peaches?"
                  "To preserve peaches," said my wife, becoming more interested as she proceeded, "first rub off the skins. Halve or slice them, take out the stones, weigh them"—
                  "What—the stones?" I asked.
                  My wife deigned no reply.
                  "To one pound of fruit," she continued, "add half a pound of sugar"—
                  "That is just the proportion," I interrupted, "that you use in brandying them."
                  "No," said the excellent woman, "that was one pound of sugar to two pounds of fruit."
                  "Well, what is the difference?" I asked.
                  "Why the difference between half a pound and one pound," she replied, and so, without waiting for me to reply, she went on. "Cook them a little, till the sugar is well dissolved and the fruit heated through. Skim it well, fill your jars, and seal securely. The 'Morris Whites' are the best peaches for preserving."
                  "A capital recipe, my dear; and now observe," I said, "how the topaz and ruby tints of these sliced peaches blend into each other, for all the world like the color on the cheek of a brunette. Notice, too, how naturally the cream, aided by the granules of white sugar, unites with the sweet juices of the peach. Cream, yellow and thick, but not clotted, is the proper element to pour over the slices of ripe peaches. Milk, even of the best, is scarcely rich enough, and the city mixture under that name—to which the cow with one arm that produces what callow classical students call aqua pumpaginis contributes largely—should be rigidly kept from contaminating the luscious fruit."
                  "I suppose," said my wife, with a sorrowful look turned cityward, "that there are people in the town who cannot get cream, and who, indeed, scarcely know it except by name."
                  "I suppose so," I said.
                  "People," she continued, "who have no milk-maids, as you and I have, who at early dawn and dewy eve come tripping over the meadows, or rather over the grass, at Madison Square, with pails brimming with milk both pure and creamy."
                  "I presume so," I said, dolefully.
                  "But if they have never known," she added, her countenance brightening as she spoke, "what cream is, why then, of course, they can never miss it."
                  "That's so! Why, you are a philosopher, my dear," I said, admiringly.
                  "I had rather be a poet," she replied.
                  "Well, poets are not bad creatures," I said. "They have spoken well of the peach. And there was one poet—I've forgotten who, though I think it was Thomson—of whom it is recorded that he was accustomed to walk in his garden of an afternoon with his hands stuffed into his pockets, and taking a position beneath a peach-tree, lazily eat from the pendent branches the sunny side of the fruit which hung temptingly before his lips."
                  "He must have been a perfect epicure," said my wife, "and extravagant withal."
                  "He was so," I answered. "Poets have ever been partial to peaches, and have seldom failed to give them their meed of praise. Thomson, in 'The Seasons,' speaks of 'the downy peach;' and Walter Savage Landor, in his 'Last Fruit off an Old Tree,' sings,— 
                        
                           "'Bring me a cool alcove, the grape uncrushed,
                           The peach of pulpy cheek and down mature,
                           Where every voice, but bird's or child's, is hushed,
                           And every thought, like the brook nigh, runs pure.'
                        
                      That young Scotch poet, David Gray, who died ere he had fulfilled the promise of his youth, speaks of— 
                        
                           "'The goldening peach on the orchard wall,
                           Soft feeding in the sun.'
                        
                      Cowley, in his 'Thoughts on a Garden,' referring to the process of grafting, says:— 
                        
                           "'We nowhere art do so triumphant see
                           As when it grafts or buds the tree:
                           It does the savage hawthorn teach
                           To bear the medlar and the peach:
                           And bids the rustic plum to rear
                           A noble trunk, and be a pear.'
                        
                      From this we see that the peach was grafted upon the hawthorn, but I doubt exceedingly whether the fruit amounted to much. Leigh Hunt babbles of the peach in this tailor-like way: 'The peach, whose handsome velvet coat strips off so finely:' and again, in his 'Story of Vertumnus and Pomona,' printed in his 'Indicator and Companion,' he makes an old woman say to and of the fair Pomona, 'And so my lady is mighty curious in plants and apples, they tell me, and quite a gardener, love her! and rears me cart-loads of peaches. Why, her face is a peach, or I should like to know what is. But it didn't come of itself neither. No, no; for that matter there were peaches before it; and Eve didn't live alone, I warrant me, or we should have not peaches now, for all her gardening.'
                  "One might infer from this that Leigh Hunt believed it was a peach instead of an apple that Eve ate in the Garden of Eden. And for my part I seriously incline to that opinion; and think that after the woman had eaten the pulp of the fruit she handed the stone to Adam, and he, poor man, in attempting to swallow it got it lodged in his throat, where, under the common but erroneous name of Adam's apple, it remains to this day. It is preposterous to presume that Adam was so great an idiot as to attempt to swallow an apple, whereas it is not difficult to imagine that his disturbed conscience might drive him to seek to dispose of this smaller evidence of his disobedience in this way."
                  My wife said tut! tut! to this, and declared that she was very glad the children were not present to hear me express such unorthodox views.
                  "At all events," I said, "peaches are about as old a fruit as is known, and there is no reason to believe that they did not grown in Eden. Besides it is a much more tempting-looking fruit than the apple, and ought, per se, to have been selected in preference. Indeed it grew in Persia ages ago, and the Latin name Persica plainly indicates its origin.
                  "Tradition says that the peach was poisonous, but lost its deadly effects by being transplanted. Now, if it was the peach instead of the apple which was eaten by our first parents, its deadly effects can well be said to be felt to this day. Perhaps the peachy odor of prussic acid may have originated this libel of deadliness on the peach, though it is true that poison may be extracted from the kernel. All medical authorities nowadays, however, attest the healthfulness of the peach, and even so long ago as when Sir T. Elyot wrote 'The Castel of Helth' the peach, as compared with other fruits, was thus spoken of: 'They doo lesse harme, and doo make better iuyce in the body, for they are not soo sone corrupted being eaten.'
                  "Ben Jonson, in his description of Penshurst, the family-seat of the Sydneys, thus alludes to the peach:— 
                        
                           "'Thou hast thy orchard fruit, thy garden flowers,
                           Fresh as the air, and new as are the hours.
                           The blushing apricot and woolly peach
                           Hang on thy walls, that every child may reach.'
                        
                     
                  
                  
                  "It used to be the fashion to train peach-trees against a wall with a southern exposure, very much as grape-vines are trained—this explains the last line of the stanza. In some hot-houses peaches, nectarines,—which are really peaches proper,—and apricots are thus cultivated.
                  "A French savant has recently laid before the Academy of Sciences, the results of experiment with the electric current in the ripening of fruits. Some peaches, apples, and pears have been fully ripened under the influence of the fluid, while the other fruit on the same trees remained far from ripe. From this fact we may assume that it will not be long before the fruits of the tropics will be produced in perfection by electrifying them, as well in a northern as in a southern clime.
                  "The ancient Romans liked peaches, and paid high prices for them. An old English writer states that for a couple of Persian peaches a Roman would give a score of pounds; which, at the present rate of gold with us, would be about seventy-five dollars apiece in greenbacks. Of course these peaches must have been perfect ones, plump and round, and of a good size, the pink blending beautifully with the white on their cheeks, and free from fleck or speck: no worms had been born and bred in their hearts, nor had the dandy-waisted wasp—and the only good trait I know of wasps is that they are partial to peaches—stung them with his poisoned dart. They must have been indeed such peaches as poor Charles Fenno Hoffman would have used in concocting his favorite drink, and which, in his Anacreontic song, 'The Origin of Mint-Juleps,' he has happily expressed in this stanza:— 
                        
                           "'Pomona, whose choicest fruits on the board
                           Were scattered profusely in every one's reach,
                           When called on a tribute to cull from the hoard,
                           Expressed the mild juice of the delicate peach.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "Where in the world," exclaimed my wife, arching her eyebrows in surprise, as I paused to take breath, "did you gain all this information? Why, you're a perfect encyclopædia."
                  "Of course I am," I replied, with a modest air. "And now I'll thank you for another saucer of peaches and cream."
                  "Another?" she asked, with surprise, seeing that I had already eaten two.
                  "Yes," I answered; "and the highest praise I can award to peaches and cream is, that it is never necessary to have an appetite to appreciate them. They are ever grateful to the palate, and with the last, as with the first spoonful, we are ready to exclaim, 'That was delicious!'"
               
               
                  
                  APPLE-DUMPLINGS, WITH SAUCE.
                  "WHAT the plum-pudding is to Old England," I said to my wife, at the same time loosening a button or two of my waistcoat, "the apple-dumpling," looking complacently down upon one lying, fragrant and steaming, on the plate before me, "is to New England. It is the mainstay, as a sailor might say, of the dessert. Indeed, it is not impossible to make with it an entire dinner. It bears no likeness to the flummery and 'pretty little tiny kickshaws' of French extraction, which please the palate of your dainty boarding-school Miss; but it is a right down honest, earnest, thumping sort of a dish, which our grandmothers, in the good old times, were not ashamed to place before a hungry man. Without possessing the richness, indigestibility, and costliness of the plum-pudding, it is quite as satisfying to the appetite, and much more healthful. Besides, it has the reputation of being a national dish, and as such merits our heartiest support. It was not known in England, as I have been assured by very good authorities—Peter Pindar to the contrary notwithstanding—until after the Revolutionary War; and the story of the first time the Britishers partook of it, as recorded in the veritable History of the Island of Nantucket, written by one of the Coffins, is well worth recounting. I remember having heard my great-grandfather relate it many years ago, and I was impressed by its air of truthfulness, and, regretting that the history wherein it was contained had never been published, I resolved, if ever the opportunity offered of putting it in print, I would do so."
                  "Which resolution," said my wife, "I think you must have forgotten as quickly as you seem to have forgotten the dumpling before you."
                  "Good gracious!" I exclaimed, "I wouldn't forget my dumpling for anything; but do you know that cold dumplings are very good, and that frozen ones when warmed over are delicious? In Nantucket, as I have heard my grandmother say, the thrifty housewives of that sandy little island used to cook up hundreds of them in the fall, as they did their mince-pies and dough-nuts, and store them away for use during the winter."
                  "That is a likely story," said my wife.
                  "It is only the beginning of a story," I replied; "wait until I've finished this dumpling, and then you shall hear it." Whereupon I set to with a will, and soon had put the dumpling where all good apple-dumplings like to go. Then turning toward my wife, I said: "It was during one of the latter years of the War of the Revolution, in the month of December, that a British frigate appeared off the coast of Nantucket; and after going through various nautical maneuvers of a mysterious character, opened her ports, run out her guns, and proceeded to cannonade the island. This was great fun tot he Britishers, but it was death to the islanders, who, from under the broad brims of their hats, saw their fairest sand-hills disappearing before the deadly fire of the foe. Being of a peaceful disposition, and not given to wrangling an quarreling with one another, they submitted for a long time to the lion's growling and fighting without returning the compliment by barking and biting. But at last, when patience had ceased to be a virtue, they drew forth from its hiding-place under the meeting-house the sole cannon the island possessed. This cannon had never since it came into their possession been used for war purposes; but had been employed solely to 'greet the coming, speed the parting' ship. So a few of the less straight-laced and conscientious of the peace-professing community—young men—but no braver than their elders, opened with the gun upon the enemy. So long as their shot lasted they did a good business; knocking many a stalwart Britisher on the decks of the frigate into a cocked-hat, making kindling-wood of its spars, turning its sails into fishing-nets, and its hull into a riddled target. But when the cannon-balls had all been used—they only kept a few on hand for the purpose of weighting a body with when they sent it to Davy Jones' locker—they were in a sad plight. There was the 'deil,' as Burns calls him, to pay, and no pitch hot; and great tribulation was over all the island. The old men and old women who had winked at the warlike proceedings, and inwardly approved of them, now turned up their eyes, and shook their heads, and wagged their beards—at least those did who had beards to wag—as much as to say that they had foreseen this discomfiture from the first, and that it would have been much better to have held fast to their peace principles. Not so, however, with the young men and the young women. They put their heads together under the sun-bonnets of the latter—in those days they wore sun-bonnets all the year round—and consulted with one another. The result was that immediately thereafter every woman hastened home, but quickly returned with baskets laden with—what do you think?"
                  "Cannon-balls," my wife answered.
                  "No," I said, "apple-dumplings frozen hard. And straightway the young men began to fire them at the enemy. They fell upon the decks of that fated vessel 'thick as leaves in Vallambrosa,' and where they struck a man fair they plastered him all over—for, of course, the heat of the consuming powder thawed them as they passed through the air. The enemy didn't know what to make of these strange missiles, and thinking them to be some kind of infernal machines, got frightened and retreated between decks, whence they still kept up a steady fire on the island.
                  "Just at this juncture the captain of the frigate, while taking an observation through an open port, received a dumpling plump in his mouth, and instead of knocking his head off, as it should have done, it went smoothly down his throat. When the captain recovered from the shock—which he did after a moment—of swallowing a dumpling, with gunpowder sauce, in so unceremonious a way, and getting at the same instant the savory flavor of the dumpling on his palate, he exclaimed, while his face radiated with innumerable smiles, 'Plum-pudding, by Heavens! or the next thing to it!' Of course, this wonderful discovery was soon noised all over the vessel, and the result was that at every port-hole there was a lot of grinning heads, with open mouths, displayed, ready to catch the first shot that came along. Discipline was entirely at an end, the guns remained inactive, and from the captain to the cabin-boy every one on board was waiting for his dessert to be sent him from the shore.
                  "Taking advantage of this state of things, and 'guessing' the cause, Long Tom Coffin, who chanced to be at home that day,—having returned from a four years' cruise after whales in the Pacific the night before,—collecting a boat's crew, put off quietly from the shore, gained the larboard side of the vessel, boarded her, and before any one on the frigate knew what had happened every mother's son of them was a prisoner. And it was through them, when they went home, after the close of the war,—some of them married on the island the best apple-dumpling makers of whom it could boast,—that this admirable dish became known to the housewives of England."
                  "That's a pretty good story," said my wife.
                  "Yes," I replied, "and its chief merit lies in its truth."
                  "It strikes me that it lies there if anywhere," said my wife, somewhat pointedly, I thought.
                  "Well, ever since then," I said, "Nantucket has been celebrated for three things: namely, its apple-dumplings, its fish chowder, and its corn-puddings.
                  
                  "Each," said my wife, "a most excellent dish in its way."
                  "Next to an apple-dumpling," I said, "I like an apple-tart. It was Sir Walter Scott, I think, who remarked that the eating of apple-tarts was no inelegant accomplishment. In these days, when everybody wears moustaches, it requires a good deal of skill to eat an apple-tart without soiling one's moustache."
                  "The best apples for tarts," said my wife, "are crab-apples, cooked whole, and with the stems still adhering to them. Two or three, with a spoonful or so of jellied sirup, placed on a nicely baked cake of flaky puff paste, form a most delicious tart."
                  "I think, on reflection," I said, "that I like, better than tarts, the apple-pies such as my mother used to make, baked in deep dishes, in a brick oven for hours, until the fruit within them—uncooked apples sliced, plentifully sugared and spiced—was of a deep red color."
                  "The last dumpling-story of which I have heard, though," I said, "is a German, somewhere 'out West,' who has what he calls a 'dumpling clock' in his window. On its top is a fat and jolly-looking Teuton, who holds a fork in his hand. By an ingenious contrivance the fork, at the end of each minute, dips into a dish of dumplings, and carries one of them to the mouth of the Teuton, who swallows it with a choking gurgle and a queer motion of his glass eyes."
                  My wife simply said "O!" to this, and looked up at the cuckoo clock over my head, to see if the bird, which just then came out, was following the Teuton's example.
                  "Yes," said my wife, "apple-pies are good, but, pray, how do you like apple-puddings?"
                  "Well," I replied, "the hollow, as it is called, and rolled, are both excellent; but the great trouble with the pudding is, that you never know when you have eaten enough. They are like the turkey, of which a noted gourmand said that it was too much for one and not enough for two; now the dumpling is usually enough for one, however insufficient it may be for two."
                  "As to that," said my wife, "everything depends on the size."
                  "Yes," I replied, "and the appetite of the eater. Dumplings made from the large bough or pound apple, or the lady-apple—neither of which should never be used—would be equally out of taste. Lady-apples, indeed, are only fit to hang on Christmas-trees, or to set off, with their red and white cheeks, a supper-table. Placed among grapes or amidst other apples, they gain a fresh beauty by the contrast. I remember once going through a small orchard of this fruit, when the trees were covered with them and the air was aromatic with their breath. It was almost as pretty a sight as is an orchard in full bloom with its pink and white blossoms, contrasting with the fresh, delicate green of the grapes. Gignoux, the artist, in some of his early spring pictures has depicted this effect very happily. The best apples for eating are, to my taste, the greening, the pippin, and the Spitzenberg; this last is the king of apples, is as sound as steel, and will keep forever. The saying, that an apple that ripens late keeps long, is exemplified in the Spitzenberg. The true Spitzenberg is, however, quite scarce, and it is only now and then that I come across any. Sweet apples, baked in an oven, or roasted before the fire, and eaten with fresh milk, or cream, are not an unpalatable dish—especially in the country—at tea, on a summer afternoon. If one lives in the country, and is young, and is full of life and spirits, one can have no healthier or happier labor than can be found in gathering apples; shaking them from the trees, heaping them together on the ground, and then when the staid oxen, drawing the broad-wheeled cart comes round to the pile one has made, measuring them off by the bushel and turning them into the open box of the cart, or into barrels, and riding with them to the barn or store-house prepared to receive them. Then in the winter season, if still you are young and merry, as you ought to be,—no matter how many years have rolled over your head,—you will take delight in going to the applebee, where you help, to a certain extent, in paring the apples for drying, and, after supper, have a good time dancing, and playing at forfeits, and making love to the little girl who sits by your side; and then that ride home in the moonlight, over the crackling snow, in the cutter! You're not alone, though. O no, there's some one with you, and you're very careful of that some one, and tuck the buffalo-robes snugly in about her, and even put your arm around her waist to keep her from falling out of the sleigh. You neither of you talk much, but you both think it all out, and say to yourselves, 'How pleasant it would be to ride in this way through life together!' But the ride too soon comes to an end, and though you may snatch a kiss from her, and get a pressure of her hand in return, as you part with her in the porch, and may go home and dream all manner of sweet dreams about her, you will wake in the morning too often with the consciousness, alas! that something will arise between you two that will prevent you from ever taking the journey of life together. Our early life, fortunately, is filled with many just such pleasant episodes, and when in after years we think them over, and wonder what has become of this one and of that one, whom we loved in the heyday of our youth, we don't recall them to mind with regret, grieving that we lost them, since we find so much to love and to care for in those who are around us, that we are fain to say our lines have fallen to us in pleasant places."
                  My wife, who had been idly playing with her napkin-ring while I spake, musing of something I knew not of, as I paused, looked up, and smiled.
                  "Bryant, my dear," I said, when I found she had recovered consciousness, "in his 'Planting of the Apple-tree,' says:—
                        
                           "'And when, above this apple-tree,
                           The winter stars are quivering bright,
                           And winds go howling through the night,
                           Girls, whose young eyes o'erflow with mirth,
                           Shall peel its fruit by cottage-hearth.'
                        
                     
                  
                  "Returning, however, to our original topic, the apple-dumpling, let me quote the opening stanza of some verses, descriptive of the making of an apple-dumpling, by one of our latter-day poets:— 
                        
                           "'I hail, at every season of the year,
                           The apple-dumpling as the best of cheer:
                           First of its kind—no housewife e'er has made,
                           In puddings, pies, tarts, sauce, or marmalade,
                           A dish that will at all compare with this;
                           To me 'tis sweeter far than woman's kiss.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "Some crabbed old bachelor, I'll be bound," said my wife, "wrote that, and if his life is as bad as his poetry no woman will regret his preference for apple-dumplings."
                  "He must have been," I remarked, "a near neighbor of the old parson who refused to say 'grace' at a dinner to which he was invited because there were no apple-dumplings on the board. This festive parson was worse than Lord Dudley, who was so fond of apple-pie that he could not dine comfortably without it. On one occasion, it is related of him, at a grand dinner he missed his favorite dish, and was heard to exclaim, sotto voce, 'God bless my soul, no apple-pie!' In conclusion of my chat, let me quote those old and not unfamiliar lines by Peter Pindar, entitled, 'The Apple-dumplings and the King,' the king—no other than George the First, I believe—after a day's hunt entered, through curiosity, a rude cot,— 
                        
                           'Where sat a poor old woman and her pot.
                        
                        
                           'The wrinkled, blear-eyed, good old granny,
                           In this same cot, illum'd by many a cranny,
                           Had finished apple-dumplings for her pot.
                           In tempting row the naked dumplings lay,
                           When lo! the monarch, in his usual way,
                           Like lightning spoke, "What's this? what's this? what? what?"
                        
                        
                        
                           'Then taking up a dumpling in his hand,
                           His eyes with admiration did expand—
                           And oft did majesty the dumplings grapple.
                           "'Tis monstrous, monstrous hard, indeed," he cry'd;
                           "What makes it, pray, so hard?" The dame reply'd,
                           Low curt'sying, "Please your majesty, the apple."
                        
                        
                           '"Very astonishing indeed! strange thing!"
                           (Turning the dumpling round) rejoined the king.
                           "'Tis most extraordinary, then, all this is—
                           It beats Pinetti's conjuring all to pieces—
                           Strange I should never of a dumpling dream.
                           But, goody, tell me where, where, where's the seam?"
                        
                        
                           '"Sire, there's no seam," quoth she, "I never knew
                           That folks did apple-dumplings sew."
                           "No!" cry'd the staring monarch with a grin,
                           "Then how the devil got the apple in?"
                        
                      And now, my dear," I said, "just one word by way of post-script—and the P. S., remember, oftentimes contains the gist of the matter. Listen:—
                  "An apple-dumpling depends for its success on the SAUCE. Pour over it a hot sauce, with a glass of wine of brandy therin, and the gods, who devour it are appeased."
               
               
                  A BASKET OF STRAWBERRIES.
                  "IT is a good many years, my dear," I said to my wife, as together we walked down the lane in the twilight, "since, in the lush days of my youth, I went a-strawberrying. The little girl I went with is lying under the violets, and the fingers that picked the berries, the stains of which were so deep I could not kiss them off, long ago mouldered into dust. The basket she used, empty and discolored with the juices of the berries it contained, is carefully put away and kept as a slight, though sufficient memorial of those happy days. What that young maiden, had she lived to be a woman, might, in after-years, have been to me I cannot tell; I only know that she was very, very dear to me in those early summer days, and that I have never been a-berrying with any one since then."
                  My wife leaned softly on my arm, and for a few moments we walked on in silence.
                  "It is a trifle late in the season to pick strawberries, but even now ''tis sweet,'" and I turned the fallen leaves from off the vines with my cane, "as Montgomery says in his 'Walk in Spring,'— 
                        
                           'To greet,
                           The strawberry creeping at our feet.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "It is so," my wife answered, "and when their white blossoms look up at you with dewy eyes, as if begging you not to tread upon them, or, later in the year, you spy the red berry playing at hide-and-seek amidst the green leaves, it is still sweeter. There was a pretty little poem in a recent number of 'Our Young Folks,' that told how,— 
                        
                           'Little Pearl Honeydew, six years old,
                           From her bright ear parted the curls of gold,
                           
                           And laid her head on the strawberry bed,
                           To hear what the red-cheeked berries said.
                        
                        
                           'Their cheeks were blushing, their breath was sweet,
                           She could almost hear their little hearts beat;
                           And the tiniest lisping, whispering sound
                           That ever you heard, came up from the ground.
                        
                        
                           '"Little friends," she said, "I wish I knew
                           How it is you thrive on sun and dew!"
                        
                      And this is part of the story the berries told to little Pearl Honeydew, six years old. 
                        
                           '"When the swallows fly home to the old brown shed,
                           And the robins build on the bough overhead,

                           You would surely take pity and eat us yourself!"'
                        
                     
                  
                  "Strawberries, my dear," I said, "are as old as the hills. I don't believe there was ever a hill made whereon the strawberry did not grow."
                  "I don't know about that," my wife said.
                  "Of course you don't," I replied, "and consequently you cannot deny it. The fact is that strawberries have strayed from the Garden of Eden all over the world: and it is from this very circumstance that they derive their name. The best authorities say that it comes from the straying, spreading nature of its growth, and we find that the word straw, an active verb, mean to strew, to scatter. Others, however, declare that they owe their name to the practice of placing straw under the stems of the plants to keep the fruit from being soiled by contact with the earth. But that in my opinion is sheer nonsense, and to accept it one must admit that the strawberry had no name until the gardeners undertook its cultivation."
                  "Which would be preposterous," said my wife.
                  "Most certainly," I replied. "But Mr. Phillips, whoever he may be, thinks that the name came from a still older practice, namely: 'that among children, of threading the wild berries upon straws of grass.' He says, declares our authority, 'that this is still a custom in parts of England where strawberries abound, and that so many straws of berries are sold for a penny.'"
                  "That, certainly," said my wife, "is a much prettier, as well as a more primitive and rustic interpretation of its derivation."
                  "The botanical name," I continued, "is Fragaria, and the Italians call it Fragola—fragrant."
                  "Than which," chimed in my wife," "nothing can be better; "for they are as fragrant as a bunch of posies, and as beautiful to look at."
                  "Yes," I added, "and they are delicious to eat. I scarcely know whether I like them best, when I gather them from the vines, and eat them one by one—for then each beery yields its individual flavor; and let me tell you that there is as much character in a strawberry as there is in a human being."—
                  "O!" exclaimed my wife.
                  "Or," I went on, paying no attention to her interruption, "when heaped together in a saucer, with sugar sprinkled over them, and, if you like, smothered in cream"—
                  My wife said she did like—
                  "They remind me of a lovely maiden on her bridal couch."
                  "My dear!" said my wife, reprovingly.
                  "Well," I replied, "one can't admire or praise the strawberry too highly. According to Brillat-Savarin, the strawberry was introuduced into Rome from the valleys of Mount Ida. And there was an Italian poet—I get my information from Leigh Hunt—a Jesuit, and a very honest man, too, who wrote a poem in two cantos, containing upward of nine hundred lines, ending in the following bridal climax—he has been apostrophizing two young friends of his, newly married—and this is the blessing with which he concludes:— 
                        
                           "'Around this loving pair may joy serene
                           On wings of balm forever wind and play;
                           And laughing Health her roses shake between,
                           Making their life one long sweet, flowery way!
                           May bliss, true bliss, pure, self-possessed of mien,
                           Be absent from their side, no, not a day!
                           In short, to sum up all that earth can prize,
                           
                              May they have sugar to their strawberries!'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "Many a young couple," said my wife, looking thoughtfully upon the ground, "who embarked on the sea of matrimony, expecting to have sugar, and even cream, with their strawberries, have been grievously disappointed."
                  "Yes," I said, "their strawberries have been sour, their peaches have been bitter, and their cherries have moulded in the mouth."
                  "I never heard before," said my wife, "of cherries, or indeed any fruit, moulding in the mouth."
                  "There are probably, my dear," I said, "a great many other things of which you have never heard, and, for that matter, never will hear. But what says this Italian poet further: 'They must hide themselves,' he declares—'put on their veils; to wit of sugar.' 'Strawberries and sugar were to him,' as our genial gossip has it, 'what sack and sugar was to Falstaff—the indispensable companions, the sovereign remedy for all evil, the climax of good.' Throwing physic to the dogs, he says:— 
                        
                           'For my part, I confess I fairly swill
                           And stuff myself with strawberries; and abuse
                           The doctors all the while, draught, powder, pill;
                           Give me a glut of strawberries; and, lo!
                           Sweet through my blood, and very bones, they go.'
                        
                      All authorities speak of strawberries as healthful and medicinal. Fontenelle attributed his longevity to them, in consequence of their having regularly cooled a fever which he had every spring, and he used to say: 'If I can but reach the season of strawberries.' Hoffman says they 'cured even consumptions;' and Linnæus declares that, by eating plentifully of them, he kept himself free from the gout, which strikes me as being a capital remedy."
                  "And one," said my wife, "which I would not object to follow myself."
                  "I was not aware before that you were troubled with that complaint," I said.
                  "Nor am I," she replied; "but can't I take the remedy without having the disease?"
                  "Yes, if you wish to ward it off," I said, "of course. Even their leaves are wholesome, and we read in Sir John Suckling's tragedy of 'Brennoralt' of their preciousness. In his portrait of a beautiful girl he says:— 
                        
                           'Eyes full and quick,
                           With breath as sweet as double violets,
                           And wholesome as dying leaves of strawberries.'
                        
                      When I brought home, not long since, a pottle of strawberries"—
                  
                  "Why," my wife interrupted me, "you never brought home a bottle of strawberries in your life."
                  "I said pottle not bottle," I replied.
                  "What in the world is a pottle?"
                  "A pottle," I answered, willing to display my little learning, "is a small, cone-shaped basket, made especially for holding berries. The word is not in common use here, but it is well known in England, and Leigh Hunt employs it familiarly in his writings. He thinks, too, that 'no other sort of basket would do as well for them,' and gives as a reason that 'it carries well; it lies on your arm like a length of freshness; then there is the covering of leaves, and beneath them, fresh, and fragrant, and red, lie the berries—the best, it is to be feared, at the top.' We see from this that the Yankee vendors of berries are not alone in their attempts at cheating; but that the English hucksters are equally tricky. Well, as I was about to say, if you had not interrupted me, when I brought home that pottle of strawberries you were not very well—indeed you were quite ill; but after eating of them, you immediately grew better. Ah, there is undoubtedly a virtue in strawberries greater than that which dwells in blue-pills."
                  "I hope so," said my wife.
                  "One of the best things, too, about a strawberry is," I said, "that it is never necessary to make two bites at it; though, to be sure, if that gentleman of Newark, who declares that he can, with cultivation, raise strawberries as large as pine-apples, should succeed in his attempts, we might make one berry go around a tea-table. He wants twenty years to do it in, however, and as he may die in the meanwhile, it is hardly worth our while to count as yet on his success. I confess I would rather not see the feat accomplished; for where then would be the 'little red mouthful of strawberry' of which the poet speaks? No, there is a grossness in the idea which the lovers of strawberries should not tolerate. The smallest berries, as a rule, are the highest in flavor; nothing in the way of deliciousness can exceed that of the small berry that grows wild on the hill-sides, and you will find, almost invariably, that the cultivated berry loses in flavor as it gains in size. Who, too, with strawberries so large, would think of sending a dish of them, or even one, as a gift to his lady-love? One might as well send a cabbage, or a pumpkin,—at least if size has anything to do with it. And do you for a moment think that Sir Philip Sidney, the knight sans peur, sans reproche, would, as he has in his 'Arcadia,' have made Amphialus send to Philoclea strawberries, if they were otherwise than they are? He says: 'Thus the first strawberries he could find were ever, in a clean-washt dish, sent to Philoclea.'"
                  "And it was most proper," my wife said, "that the dish should be washed clean."
                  "It was so," I answered; "but let me remark that strawberries themselves should never be washed. Water carries off their best juices, and robs them of their finest flavor. If you have no confidence in the cleanliness of the hands of the picker, you had better leave the strawberries untasted. Even those one buys in the streets from the licensed venders, should not suffer such desecration. There is something, too, in the cry of these berry-sellers, as it falls upon our ears in the mid-afternoon of a day in June, with its long drawn-out utterance of 'Straw-b-e-r-r-i-e-s,' which, though rude, is not unmusical, and is full of suggestive fancies. Still, we shall wait long before we hear in Broadway, as the Howadji heard in Cairo,—'Spring-blush of the hill-sides, O strawberries!' or, 'Breast-buds of Venus, O milk!' No, not, as he truly adds, until milkmen are turbaned, and berry-women ballooned. Picking strawberries is not an arduous task, especially if you are young, and have one you love beside you. Three together are often one too many; and Spenser, in 'The Faerie Queene,' seems to have been aware of this when he wrote,—
                     
                        
                           'One day, as they all three together went
                           To the greene wood to gather strawberries
                           There chaunst to them a dangerous accident.'
                        
                      Of course no accident would have chanced to them if there had been but two in company."
                  "I don't see that," said my wife, inquiringly.
                  "Of course you don't," I replied; "I didn't think you would. We may presume that that unfortunate lady Desdemona was a berry-picker, for does not the wicked Iago ask Othello: 'Tell me but this: Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief, spotted with strawberries, in your wife's hand?' Other poets, though, than Spenser have written about picking berries. Our friend Stedman, in his 'Battle of Monmouth,' has sung charmingly about it. Hearken:— 
                        
                           'The strawberry vines lie in the sun,
                           Their myriad tendrils twined as one;
                           Spread like a carpet of richest dyes,
                           The strawberry field in sunshine lies.
                           Each timorous berry blushing red
                           Has folded the leaves above her head,
                           The dark, green curtains gemmed with dew;
                           But each blushful berry, peering through,
                           Shows like a flock of the underthread—
                           The crimson woof of a downy cloth
                           Where the elves may kneel and plight their troth.
                           Run through the rustling vines, to show
                           Each picker an even space to go,
                           Leaders of twinkling cord divide
                           The field in lanes from side to side:
                           And here and there, with patient care,
                           Lifting the leafage everywhere,
                           Rural maidens and mothers dot
                           The velvet of the strawberry-plot:
                           Fair and freckled, old and young,
                           With baskets at their girdles hung,
                           Searching the plants with no rude haste—
                           Lest berries should hang unpicked, and waste,
                           Of the pulpy, odorous, hidden quest,
                           First gift of the fruity months, and best.
                           From the workers a maiden parts:
                           The baskets at her waistband shine
                           With berries that look like bleeding hearts
                           Of a hundred lovers at her shrine:
                           No Eastern girl was girdled so well
                           With silken belt and silvery bell.
                           
                           But on, with a sister's smile, she moves
                           Into the darkness of the groves,
                           And deftly, daintily, one by one,
                           Shelters her baskets from the sun
                           Under the net-work, fresh and cool,
                           Of lily-leaves from the crystal pool.'
                        
                      I wish, my dear, that for your sake I could remember it all; but you will gather, even from these detached passages, something approaching to the charming picture of the strawberry-pickers which the poet has drawn; and in the song they sing while at labor, he says,— 
                        
                           'Here, where the whitest blossoms blow,
                           The reddest and ripest berries grow.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "It is, indeed," said my wife, "a charming picture, and almost makes me wish that I were a 'fair' and 'young' berry-picker."
                  "It is better as it is, my dear," I answered, "although like Halleck's Fanny, 'you were younger once than you are now,' but never fairer in my eyes than you are at present."
                  "Flatterer!" my wife exclaimed.
                  "Indeed, my dear, not so. I am sure I could, like Fletcher, in the 'Faithful Shepherdess,' when he makes his hero, in speaking of strawberries, pay a compliment to his love, address you thus:— 
                        
                           'See how well the lusty time
                           Hath decked their rising cheeks in red,
                           Such as on your lips is spread:
                           These are berries for a queen.'
                        
                      Alice Cary, in her pleasant ballad of 'Hagen Walder,' makes him wish— 
                        
                           'That he were
                           A market-lad in the town,
                           
                           'With bowls of bright red strawberries
                           Shining on his stall,

                           Would come and buy them all.

                           Into realities.

                           Sitting in a row.'
                        
                      And now, my dear, tell me something about strawberries,—how to preserve them,—how to make strawberry short-cake."
                  My wife being very willing to inform me, spoke as follows: "To preserve strawberries, to one pound of fruit put a pound of white sugar; boil them five minutes, skim them and put them into your jars, and seal."
                  "Simple and sweet," I said. "Now for your short-cake."
                  "First make your short-cake," she said, "cutting it as large as a dining-plate; then bake it; open it while hot, and butter each half well; spread strawberries upon the lower half, sprinkle them thickly with sugar; lay the upper half on, and butter the upper side; cover it with strawberries, finishing it nicely with white sugar, and eat it while warm."
                  "Capital!" I said. "I think I'll have one when we go home."
                  "There are no strawberries," said my wife, plaintively.
                  "I am sorry for it," I answered; "but we will plant some—it is just coming on September—and then next season we shall have plenty. Let me recall to mind what old Tusser says in his September's 'Husbandry':—
                        
                           'Wife, into thy garden and set me a plot
                           Of strawberry roots, of the best to be got:
                           Such growing abroad, among thorns in the wood,
                           Well chosen and picked, prove excellent good.'
                        
                      And again:— 
                        
                           'The barberry, respis, and gooseberry too,
                           Look now to be planted as other things do;
                           The gooseberry, respis, and roses, all three,
                           With strawberries under them, truly agree.'
                        
                      Further on the gives this advice in his verses for December:— 
                        
                           'If frost do continue, take this for a law,
                           The strawberries look to be covered with straw
                           Laid over, trim, upon crotchets and bows,
                           And after uncovered, as weather allows.'
                        
                      And now, wife, let us turn our steps homeward, for the twilight is fading, and it will be dark before ewe reach the house."
                  "Do you know," asked my wife, "that with all your talk about strawberries, you have said nothing concerning the white strawberry?"
                  "I had forgotten it," I answered, "and though it is fair to look at, it lacks the flavor and juiciness of the red. I regard it as an anomaly among strawberries, and think it bears very much the relation to its red kindred that white crows, white mice, and albinos do to their kind."
                  "In my eyes," said my wife, "it is the bride of the strawberries; fair and delicate as a young maiden among matrons, a lily among roses, a morning in May as compared to a noontide in August. Any one can realize the lusciousness of a red strawberry; but only the most sensitive and cultivated taste can understand and appreciate the superior flavor of the white berry."
                  "You may be correct in what you say," I replied, "but I doubt if I shall live long enough to enable me to cultivate my taste up to the standard requisite for such appreciation. And when I die my love, and am buried, I hope there will grow upon my grave only red strawberries; so that children, as they gather them, will say: 'He must have been a good man, or else so nice a fruit as the strawberry would not have grown so freely above him.' And I would like, too, to have a raspberry bush planted at my grave's head, and a blackberry at its foot."
                  My wife answered only by a little sigh, as she pressed closer to my side, and we walked on in silence.
                  I broke it at last by saying, in the words of Dr. Boteler, as quoted by simple-hearted old Izaak Walton: "Doubtless God could have made a better berry [than the strawberry], but doubtless God never did."
               
               
                  A REGAL DESSERT.
                  ON the wall fronting my accustomed place at the table, in the dining-room, there hangs, inclosed in a richly carved walnut frame, a fruit-piece that few who look at regard as other than an exquisite oil painting, but which in reality is no more than a chromograph; a chromo, though, so skillfully executed as to deceive all but the most experienced judges. The bunches of purple and white grapes, translucent and full almost to bursting with the blood of the vine; the peach, just touched with a roseate flush, suggestive of delicacy of flavor; the plums, with their smooth, green skins tinted a tender pink where, bursting open with excess of juiciness, they reveal the yellow pulp beneath, and on one of which a dainty hornet, a connoisseur in sweet, is regaling himself; the filberts, with their brown shells, or still inclosed in their frizzled and bearded coverings; the dark stems of the grapes, with their green leaves and curling tendrils spreading like a crown above the fruit, and the slender glass, filled with amber-colored wine, and reflecting on its round form the sash of a neighboring window, make up a truly regal picture.
                  "How solidly, too, and yet delicately," I said to my wife, as, leaning my elbows on the table and resting my chin on my hands, I looked, while we lingered over the nuts and the wine on the mahogany, across to this tempting picture, "the white marble slab is painted, conveying as correctly the idea of weight as the fruits do that of size and color."
                  "And to whom," asked my wife, "are we indebted for this charming fruit-piece?"
                  
                  "If you mean," I replied, "who is the artist, the painter of the original picture, I answer his name is Preyer, a disciple of the famous Dusseldorf school, a child in stature, but a master in his art."
                  "And did he send it to us?" my wife asked.
                  My wife invariably says us, when the subject that calls it forth is of a pleasant nature, but you when there is aught disagreeable connected with it.
                  "No," I replied, "not exactly; we are indebted to our friend Knœdler, of Goupil's, for it, and when he placed it before me, he said, 'Hang it in your dining-room, so that your dinner may never be without a regal dessert.' But with it he placed something more than even a regal dessert; a love poem which I learned in my youth, and had more than half forgotten, comes freshly again to memory as I look on those glowing colors. I recall the day when, O! so many, many years ago, with one of my sweethearts"—
                  "I would like," said my wife, interrupting me, "to know how many sweethearts you had in your youth."
                  "That, my dear," I replied, "you will never know. They were— 
                        
                           'Thick as autumnal leaves that strew the brooks
                           In Vallambrosa.'
                        
                      I doubt even if I can recall them all; but they were very precious while they lasted, and belonged to those beautiful things which, as Stoddard says,— 
                        
                           'Followed youth, with flying feet,
                           And will never come again.'
                        
                      But, as I was saying, this fruit-piece recalls the day when, with Alice—was her name Alice, though?"
                  "I'm sure I don't know," my wife said, rather tartly.
                  "No," I continued, giving no heed to her interruption, "'twas not Alice, but Madge; I remember that Alice was a blonde, my dear, with golden hair, and Madge was brunette with raven curls."
                  "What do I care," said my wife, "for the color of their hair?"
                  "Why, nothing," I replied; "yes, this fruit-piece recalls the day when Madge and I went into the garden attached to an old country-house, and made love to each other, seated under a vine-covered arbor. The grapes, the peaches, the plums, and even the hazel-nuts which grew in the garden and which we had gathered, were spread on the table before us, nor was a glass of wine lacking to complete the picture; and looking on this piece I fancy the olden time is back again, and that the grapes we so long ago plucked together have never been eaten, nor have dried upon their stems, but still remain plump and juicy; the plums we gathered are equally fresh, and the wine we poured still sparkles in the glass."
                  "It must be very old by this time," said my wife, "and from having been so long exposed to the air must have greatly lost its perfume and its flavor."
                  "No, my dear," I replied, "the wine I mean is an immortal wine that never suffers change, and the fruit to which I refer is a fruit that never decays; the wine is the nectar of love, and the fruit is the fruit of wisdom."
                  "I do not think," said my wife, looking inquiringly into my face, "that, after all, I clearly understand you."
                  "I am not surprised," I replied, "to hear you say so, for there are more things in heaven and earth, my dear, than are dreamed of in your philosophy."
                  Whereupon my wife was silent for at least five minutes, while I devoted myself to the fruit on the table.
                  "Do you know," I asked, breaking the silence, "who was the first wine-maker?"
                  My wife said that she thought Noah was probably the first, as it was recorded in Holy Writ that he planted a vineyard, and drank of the wine.
                  "No," I answered; "according to Milton it was Eve; for in his account of Eve's repast for the angel-guest, we read,—
                     
                        
                           'Fruit of all kinds, in coat
                           Rough, or smooth rind, or bearded husk, or shell,
                           She gathers tribute large, and on the board
                           Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink, the grape
                           
                           
                              She crushes, inoffensive must, and meathes
                           From many a berry; and from sweet kernels pressed
                           She tempers dulcet creams.'
                        
                      All Christendom, too, knows how our Saviour, at the marriage feast in Cana of Galilee, turned the water into wine. And mythology relates that Bacchus first taught the culture of the vine, and invented the use of wine. Anacreon, who wrote most charmingly, not only about wine, but love and flowers, was a grower of vines, and, if not a maker, at least was a drinker of wine. It is said that he lived to a ripe old age, and was then choked to death with a grape stone."
                  "Which is a little too allegorical," said my wife, "to be probable."
                  "Many of the poets," I said, "have walked in their singing robes through gardens and vineyards, and it was Andrew Marvell, I think, who wrote,— 
                        
                           'What wondrous life is that to lead!
                           Ripe apples drop about my head;
                           The luscious clusters of the vine
                           Upon my mouth do crush to wine;
                           The nectarine and curious peach
                           Into my hands themselves do reach.'
                        
                      Milton, knowing the wondering propensities of the vine, speaks of it as the 'gadding vine,' and in later times dear old Barry Cornwall opes his tuneful throat in this wise:— 
                        
                           'Sing, who sings
                           To her who weareth an hundred rings!
                           Ah! who is this lady fine?
                           The vine, boys, the vine,
                           The mother of mighty wine.
                           A roamer is she, o'er land and sea,
                           And sometimes very good company.'
                        
                      And it has the true Anacreontic flavor. A lively pleasantry antry mingled with a dash of excess. A Grecian poet and epicure represents his cook as boasting of the fine feast he could place before his master, and among the various dishes enumerated we find,— 
                        
                           'Honeycombs and juicy grapes,
                           Figs and cheese-cakes, apples, pears,
                           Cornels and the red pomegranate,
                           Poppies, creeping thyme, and parsley,
                           Peaches, olives plums, and raisins.
                           
                           And to wash all these dainties down,
                           There's wine, both native and imported,
                           White and red, and sweet and acid,
                           Still or effervescent.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "It does not seem to me," said my wife, "that poppies could be made into an agreeable dish."
                  "They were probably only employed as a seasoning, like thyme and parsley, to certain dishes."
                  "Ah!" my wife replied, "that may be. Do you know," she continued, "of what country the grape is a native?"
                  "Of Asia, I believe," I answered, "at least the earliest accounts of it ascribe it to that region; but it is also known to have been growing in a wild state in this country long before the white man landed on its shores. The common frost grape of New England, as it is called, is undoubtedly indigenous to the soil, and the scuppernong of North Carolina and a large purple grape of California are also of native origin. There is a story told of a monster grapevine, growing near Santa Barbara, on the Pacific coast, that runs, according to our authority, somewhat in this way: A Spanish girl, having ridden her mule a day's journey with a grape cane for a switch, took a fancy, on her arrival home, to stick it into the ground and see if it would grow. It did grow, and was allowed to extend itself, without pruning. A few years ago, when she had attained a green old age, and the vine covered an acre of ground, a petition in her behalf was presented to Congress, and secured the passage of an act confirming to her the title to a quarter section of public land on which it stood. The annual yield was then put at eight thousand pounds; and, according to a recent visitor, the crop now upon it is estimated at ten thousand pounds. Edwin James, in his 'Expedition to the Rocky Mountains, 'speaks of a wild vineyard which he encountered, extending for miles along the fertile valley through which he was passing, and covering hundreds of acres on either side, the vines of which were so loaded with grapes as to bend down the trees to which they clung and almost to give a coloring to the landscape. The fruit he declares to be incomparably finer than that of any native or exotic grape which he had met."
                  "Such a vineyard as that," said my wife, holding a cluster of Catawbas before me, "must have been worth seeing, and far more picturesque than the cultivated vineyards of Italy."
                  "And to think," I said, "that these tons of grapes went to waste, and no tuns of wine therefrom were made! How old Friar Claus in Longfellow's 'Golden Legend' would have wrung his hands and wept over this unavoidable loss. You remember his words, as he goes down into the convent cellar to fill his empty flasks:— 
                        
                           'I always enter this sacred place
                           With a thoughtful, solemn, and reverent face,
                           Pausing long enough on each stair
                           To breathe an ejaculatory prayer,
                           And a benediction on the vines
                           That produce these various sort of wines.'
                        
                      Nor has the poet neglected the vines and the wines of this country; for has he not written a poem in praise of the Catawba wine, and of the vines that gorw— 
                        'On the bank of the beautiful river.'
                      And a lesser poet has sung of the vines and wines of California—a country destined to become the largest wine-producing portion of the world—in these words:— 
                        
                           'Far out in the West,
                           In the sunshine rest,
                           Beside Pacific's brine,
                           The vineyards fair,
                           Whose grapes so rare
                           Pour out a nectar fine.'
                        
                      It is said that a gourmet, par excellence, can tell in what latitude and country a grape has ripened, from which the wine that he sips is made. But enough, for the present, of wines.
                  "Let us recall a few more passages from the poets on the subject of grapes and the other fruit that make up our regal dessert."
                  "And while you are talking," said my wife, "I will eat; and this reminds me," she continued, "of the lines you addressed to me, commencing,— 
                        
                           'Come, O, come! my well beloved,
                           With me to that sunny clime,
                           Where the purple grapes are blushing
                           'Midst the olive and the lime.
                        
                        
                           'There, among the merry viners,
                           In the vineyards, as we walk,
                           Grapes in large and luscious clusters
                           I will eat while you may talk.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "Thank you," I said, "for remembering them, and on this occasion I will be satisfied to talk, while you listen and eat. Fletcher it was, I think, in his 'Faithful Shepherdess,' who said,— 
                        
                           Here be grapes whose lusty blood
                           Is the learned poet's good;
                           Sweeter yet did never crown
                           The head of Bacchus; nuts more brown
                           Than the squirrel's teeth that crack them;
                           Deign, O fairest fiar! to take them.'
                        
                      And Shakespeare, in the 'Midsummer Night's Dream,' makes Titania command the fairies to feed Bottom with— 
                        
                           'Apricocks and dewberries,
                           With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "And a very dainty dessert it was, too," said my wife, "to place before him."
                  
                  "It was so," I answered. "Pope was contented to place before his friends— 
                        'Grapes long lingering on my only wall.'
                      Gray evidently had this hospitality of his brother poet in his mind when he wrote, in his epistle to the Earl of Burlington, entitled a 'Journey of Exeter,'— 
                        
                           'While you, my lord, bid stately piles ascend,
                           Or in your Chiswick bowers enjoy your friend,
                           Where Pope unloads the boughs within his reach,
                           The purple vine, blue plum, and blushing peach,
                           I journey far.'
                        
                      Thomson, too, knew how to get up a regal dessert, and in his 'Seasons' he presents us with the following toothsome bill of fare:— 
                        
                           'Here as I steal along the sunny wall,
                           Where autumn basks, with fruit expurpled deep,
                           My pleasing theme continual prompts my thought;
                           Presents the downy peach, the shining plum,
                           The ruddy, fragrant nectarine, and dark,
                           Beneath his ample leaf, the luscious fig.
                           The vine, too, here her curling tendrils shoots,
                           Hangs out her clusters growing to the south,
                           And scarcely wishes for a warmer sky.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "I am not certain," said my wife, "but that, after all, the garden is the most proper place wherein to enjoy a fruit-dessert. You can gather it there fresh from the vines and the trees, and gliding into a summer-house or under an arbor, with your corbeille heaped with ripe fruit, you my sit and eat, while the summer hours, marked by the sun-dial on the neighboring grass-plot, move lazily along."
                  "Do you know, my dear," I asked, "that your connecting a sun-dial with lazy hours is very good? It has often occurred to me that since the introduction of clocks, and especially Yankee clocks, into the world's economy, time has moved much more rapidly that it did when the shadow on the dial, and the sand in the hour-glass, were the only recorders of its flight. But I think now it has as much as it can do to keep up with the minute-hand of some of our Yankee-made clocks and watches. A dial of flowers, too, is a pretty thing with which to surround your corbeille, or basket, as I would have said. Yes, under the arbor, or in the summer-house, is a better place to partake of fruit than around the mahogany. But there are objections to an arbor, as I know from experience, and years ago, while writing to Madge a series of 'summer letters' from 'under the arbor,' my pen slipped into the following rhyme:— 
                        
                           'Under the vine-clad arbor, Madge,
                           I sit and write to thee,
                           With one eye on my paper, Madge,
                           And one in neighboring tree;
                           For there are wasps and spiders about, Madge
                           And they sting and worry me.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "Which was not to be wondered at," said my wife, "for though you may take a book and fruit into an arbor, and therein read the one and eat the other, yet it is not, in my opinion, the proper place either to write or sew in."
                  And I think you are correct," I said. "One should no more write or sew in an arbor than one should in a market, where, however, one might stand and eat fruit all the day long. Howadji, if you remember, in his 'Nile Notes,' speaking of the market-places of the East, says, in effect, that could he have understood the language of Haroun Alraschid, he would have distinguished, in what was a mere Babel jargon to his ears, in the cries of the licensed venders of Cairo, 'sycamore figs and grapes,' meaning that said figs were offered, and the sweetness of sense and sound that 'grape' hath, was only a bait for the attention. And now, my dear," I continued, "another bunch of grapes,—some Isabellas this time, if you please."
                  "Alas!" said my wife, "there are no grapes here. I have eaten them all; what a pity!"
                  "Ah, yes," I exclaimed, "but, never mind, I dare say they were sour; and it isn't the first time that I have lost my Isabellas. I knew a fair maiden of that name once, but—well, I suppose, as the poet says,— 
                        
                           'There are gains for all our losses,
                           There are balms for all our pains;
                           But'—
                        
                      You see even the poet hath a 'but', my dear,— 
                        
                           'But when youth, the dream, departs,
                           It takes something from our hearts,
                           And it never comes again.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "Ah! I perceive," exclaimed my wife, "it is the old fable again exemplified of the fox and the grapes."
                  "Perhaps it was," I replied, looking the least bit thoughtful, "but there is a satisfaction in knowing that though their father ate of sour grapes, the children's teeth were not set on edge, thereby disproving a certain proverb used by the prophet Ezekiel, and, besides, as Belle was worth, in the cant parlance of the day, a plum,—if not in money, at least in virtues and beauty,—it always seemed a pity to me that I lost her. Speaking of plums reminds me that, as there are a few left in the dish, I will take one."
                  "What kind," asked my wife, "will you have? a greengage, like those in the picture, or a red-gage, or an egg plum, yellow as gold, or a magnum-bonum, as red and glowing as a carbuncle?"
                  "Ah!" I answered, "magnum-bonum for me, and one not too ripe, or else it will have lost its delicious acidity, and become altogether too luscious. There is a gage, too, the sugar-gage, small, round, and juicy, a veritable bag full of honey, such as the bees of Mount Hybla might have produced, that leaves the sweetest of savors in the mouth, which you may also give me. Ah! I have a great liking for the plum, whether it be fresh or dried. Shakespeare, you may remember, makes Slender say that he fought with a master of fence ( three veneys for a dish of stewed prunes), and though I inclined to think he lost, yet for all that, I regard stewed prunes, especially when fresh plums are not to be obtained, as an agreeable dish for the tea-table. The plum, though, according to Dr. Doran, whether of Africa or Asia, from Egypt or Damascus, has been more fatal to health, if not to life, than any other of the stone-fruits. Pliny regretted their propagation in Italy because of their unhealthfulness. But my experience in their eating has never shown them to be at all unhealthy; for I have spent many a day, on and under the branches of the plum-trees, literally filling myself with their fruit. Peaches, though, referring to my same authority, are most healthful, and the Chinese say of them, that they produce eternity of life, and prevent corruption until the end of the world."
                  "If this were so," said my wife, "I should think that the peach would be even more appreciated than it is."
                  "for my part," I replied, "I am glad this fact—if fact it be—is not generally known, for if it were there would be a scarcity of peaches in the market, and those that did find their way thither would be held at enormously high prices. No one but rich people would get peaches then, and poets, and lazy bodies like myself, would stand no chance of a taste. In these days, however, peaches can be eaten by everybody, and at all times, in their season. The more indolent the person is before whom they may be placed, the more likely he is to enjoy and appreciate them. A poem like Tennyson's 'Gardener's Daughter,' and a ripe peach on a warm summer day, under the shadowy trees and beside a running brook, go well together. And now, my dear, with a handful of nuts—they are not, to be sure (for they were only hazel-nuts gathered in the neighboring woods), equal to the pecans which our friend Harry Flash sent us last year from Texas—and another glass of wine, and I will bring my regal dessert to a close."
                  "You should do with these nuts," said my wife, helping me to them, "what the old broken-down Spanish hidalgo, our neighbor, does when he eats our native chestnuts."
                  "What is that?" I asked.
                  
                  "Why, put on your spectacles," she replied, "and then you will be able to imagine these hazel-nuts are pecans; even as he, by the magnifying power of his glasses, cheats himself into the belief that he is partaking of the large and regal-like chestnuts that grow on the banks of the Guadalquivir in his native land, instead of those which grow along the borders of our less classic Bronx."
                  "Not a bad idea," I replied. "But a better way for the old gentleman to do would be to graft, as has been successfully accomplished, our native chestnut with cuttings from the Spanish or Italian trees. The fruit is not quite as large as its trans-Atlantic kin, but possesses a finer flavor. Nuts, though, have not received the meed of praise they merit. They are all highly respectable—with the exception of the peanut, which delves in the earth like a mole, and is eaten chiefly by newsboys and boot-blacks, in the pits of theatres—and hold their heads high in the air as a rule, until they ripen, when they fall to the ground. Then, to, what fun there is in going a nutting! What real enjoyment there is in gathering a hoard of nuts—walnuts, chestnuts, butternuts, hickory, hazel, and even beechnuts, for the winter's use. But this is a theme on which I might enlarge until even you, my dear, would fall asleep from weariness, so I will keep my 'say' about it to myself until another occasion. There is no doubt but that the rather apocryphal satyrs of the forests were accustomed to gather armful of filberts, to say nothing of other nuts, to bestow upon the wood-nymphs whom they wooed; and no one can question the fact that squirrels and school-boys have, from time immemorable, diligently exercised the same courtesy. The Emperor Nero, it is said, did all he could to put hazel-nuts in good company. Dr. Doran relates that he was wont to go incog. to the upper gallery of the theatre, and take delight in pelting the bald head of the Prætor who sat below with them. That official knew the offender, and was rewarded for bearing the attack good-humoredly humoredly. Of course filberts were in fashion during Nero's reign; though chestnuts, for some undiscovered reason, were equally unfashionable, and much disliked by the patricians. Shakespeare, who never let a good simile slip him, makes use of the hazel in the 'Taming of the Shrew,' wherein Petruchio compliments Katharine in this wise:— 
                        
                           'Kate, like the hazel twig,
                           Is straight and slender; and as brown in hue
                           As hazel-nuts, and sweeter than the kernels.'
                        
                     
                  
                  "The French present you with a little dessert, at the close of dinner, under the odd title of 'Les Quatre Mendiants'—The Four Beggars; and at the annual dinner of the Officers' Union, that I attended the other day, this dish appeared on the menu; it consists of a handful of fruits and nuts, and a glass of wine; and a recent writer, in speaking of it, says that he once found on the back of a wine-list in a café in the Palais Royal some quaint verses, which he translated thus:—

                                 Handfuls of stolen fruit, and sang for glee.

                  I think I heard, though I will not be certain, my wife whisper very softly, as if to herself, a gracious Amen to this toast.
               
               
                  OUR CHRISTMAS DINNER.
                  IF there can be a day in the year better than all the others, it must be," I said, as my wife and little ones, home for the holidays, trifled over the walnuts and apples, the oranges and pears, that brought up the rear of our festive dinner, "this, which commemorates the birth of our Saviour."
                  Thereupon the cuckoo, from its nest in the clock above my head, came out and merrily sung its note, uttering, as distinctly as ever bird could, the word "Christmas! Christmas! Christmas!" repeating it three times, so that we all looked up at the cuckoo—who still remained perched outside—in amazement, as if a miracle had been wrought; nor was this feeling lessened when we discovered that the position, neither of the minute nor hour hand, made it incumbent on the cuckoo to proclaim that it was three o'clock. To speak the truth, it was nearer six than any other hour, and yet it lacked full twenty minutes or being that.
                  "This, certainly, is a strange proceeding on the part of the cuckoo," I said.
                  "It is so," my wife replied; "nor can I understand it."
                  "It is something marvelous, at least," I said.
                  "If not miraculous," added my wife. Here the children opened wide their eyes, and gazed on the bird with something akin to fear. But the ten-year oldling exclaimed, "I guess Santa Claus has took possession of the cuckoo."
                  
                     Took possession is good," I replied, "and I wouldn't wonder if such an occurrence had taken place. Santa Claus is up to all manner of jokes on this day, and I once knew him to come to a Christmas dinner served up in an immense mince-pie, and when the pie was opened he stepped forth, as lively and merry as song and story proclaim him to be, and distributed sugar-plums and toys to all the children around the board."
                  "When and where, if you please, papa," asked inquisitive sixteen, "did this happen?"
                  "O! long ago," I replied; "when I was a little boy, or a girl—I've forgotten which—and lived in Utopia."
                  "O! pshaw! papa," she said, "you know you never could have been a little girl, and I don't believe you ever lived in Utopia."
                  "Don't be too certain on either point, young miss," I continued; "for, if your mother and myself, as good authority declares us to be, are one, I don't know why I couldn't have been a little girl when I dwelt in Utopia."
                  "Nonsense!" exclaimed my wife.
                  "But, papa, you never dwelt there," persisted the incorrigible miss.
                  "My child," I said, "I dwell there now more than half of my time; when you and your mother think I am sleeping quietly in my bed at night, I am far off in Utopia; when you presume me to be on the cars going to or from the city, I am very often attending to the cultivation of my beautiful estates in Utopia; when you imagine me to be employed in the drudgery of adding endless columns of figures in Uncle Samuel's granite counting-house in Wall Street, I am almost invariably engaged in poring over elegant books, illustrated by the most skillful of artists, looking at paintings and marbles, or selecting the most precious of pearls and diamonds and ornaments of gold in Utopia."
                  "None of which, alas!" sighed my wife, "you ever bring home to me."
                  "But I bring you something better than these," I answered: "a true and a loving heart, which is more than silver or gold or precious stones."
                  Here the cuckoo sang, "True heart! true heart! true heart!" and my wife smiled and was silent.
                  "That is a good and a cheerful cuckoo," I said, approvingly, "and should be treated to a slice of mince-pie."
                  "And can I have another slice, too, papa, to cat with the cuckoo?" asked the four-year old chap.
                  "Goodness!" I exclaimed, "do you wish to eat your dinner over again?"
                  "Only the pie part of it, papa; just a tiny little piece."
                  "Well," I said, "if your mother has no objection, I will consent."
                  But "mother" disapproved, and the little one returned to the interesting occupation of sucking an orange.
                  "How people got along in the world," said my wife, "before Christmases were celebrated, has always been a wonder to me; I think they must have had very dull times."
                  "Not necessarily," I replied. "Indeed, the truth is, that our Christmas holidays were kept by the pagans as commemorative days, and after the establishment of Christianity, its early teachers sought to purify and adapt them to the requirements of the new religion. Among all nations and in all periods, the time of the winter solstice has been reserved as a season of rejoicing. The Roman Saturnalia, which occurred at this period, were kept with great rejoicings, and master and slave alike exercised the most unbounded liberty of speech and action. To the hymns sung in honor of Saturn, we may trace our Christmas carols, while gifts, as now, passed between friends and lovers. The northern nations of Europe, of antiquity, too, celebrated a festival, at this period of the year, to the god Thor, under the title of Yule, or Iol, from which feast old England obtained her yule-log. Sir Walter Scott informs us how,— 
                        
                           'The savage Dane,
                           At Iol, more deep the mead did drain;
                           And gorged upon the half-dressed steer,
                           Caroused in sea of sable beer,' etc.
                        
                     
                      The Knights of the Round Table understood much better than the followers of Odin, what constituted a Christmas dinner; according to Whistlecraft,— 
                        
                           'They served up salmon, venison, and wild boars
                           By hundreds, and by dozens, and by scores.
                           Hogsheads of honey, kilderkins of mustard,
                           Muttons, and fatted beeves, and bacon swine;
                           Herons and bitterns, peacocks, swan, and bustard,
                           Seal, mallard, pigeons, widgeons, and, in fine,
                           Plum-puddings, pancakes, apple-pies, and custard.
                           And therewithal they drank good Gascon wine,
                           With mead, and ale, and cider of their own;
                           for porter, punch, and negus were not known.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "Nor," said my wife sympathizingly, "were turkeys, I presume, since they are not enumerated."
                  "No," I answered, "poor old knights, they were unacquainted with that excellent bird; but the peacock and swan were not such bad substitutes after all. Even old England knew nothing of the turkey, nor is his name introduced in any of the ancient Christmas ballads. The boar's head, the royal sirloin of beef, the choice capon, and the fatted goose, have been sung since the days of William the Conqueror; but the only allusion to the turkey in verse, that I can recollect, that bears the marks of age, is contained in these lines:— 
                        
                           'If you would send up the brawner's head,
                           Sweet rosemary and bays around it spread;
                           His foaming tusks let some large pippin grace,
                           Or 'midst these thundering spears an orange place;
                            Sack, and the well-spiced hippocras, the wine,
                           Wassail, the bowl with ancient ribbons fine,
                           Pooridge with plums, and turkeys, with the chine.'
                        
                      To come down to more modern days, Tom Hood, in his verses entitled 'Epicurean Reminiscences,' sings:— 
                        
                           ''Twas at Christmas, I think, that I met with Miss Chase,
                           Yes, for Morris had asked me to dine;
                           And I thought I had never beheld such a face,
                           Or so noble a turkey and chine.'
                        
                      And a lesser than Hood, a Barber by name, and a poet by profession, writes of 'The Festive Turkey' in this wise:—
                        
                           'Bird of the banquet! what to thee
                           Are all the birds of melody?
                           Thy 'merry thought' far more I love
                           Than merriest music of the grove,
                           And in thy 'gobble,' deep and clear,
                           The gourmand's Shibboleth I hear!'
                        
                      Yes, my dear, it is truly the bird of the banquet, and the one we had to-day. with its brown breast filled with a dressing of oysters and pecan-nuts, and its less honored extremity—though it ought to be the more sacred, for isn't the 'Pope's nose' in its vicinity, stuffed with a bread dressing, seasoned with sweet marjoram, and enriched with a handful of mushrooms previously stewed in wine—was a dish fit for the gods of Olympus, the Nine Muses, or the Three Graces."
                  "I think," said my wife, "that it was more fitted for us and our children than for the great personages of whom you speak. At least we enjoyed it, and they did not."
                  "And I had the wish-bone," said the girl of eight years.
                  "And I the drumsticks," chimed in the boy of four.
                  "I would like to know," asked our eldest miss, "why the turkey is named turkey."
                  "Because," I replied, "our English cousins gave it to him from a mistaken idea that he came from Turkey, instead of being a native, as he is, of this country. A Christmas dinner would hardly be complete without a game or chicken pie, such as we had to-day. It is a most savory dish, and, if properly made, is deserving of all the encomiums which poets and others have said in its favor. George Wither, in his poem on 'Christmas,' most aptly sings:— 
                        
                           'Now all our neighbors; chimneys smoke,
                           And Christmas blocks are burning;
                           Their ovens they with baked meats choke,
                           And all their spits are turning.
                           Without the door let sorrow lie;
                           And if for cold it hap to die,
                           We'll bury 't in a Christmas pie,
                           And evermore be merry.'
                        
                     
                      You know, even the youngest of the little ones around the table, the nursery rhymes that tell of the— 
                        
                           'Four-and-twenty blackbirds
                           Baked in a pie;'
                        
                      but all may not be aware that a usual dish at Queen Elizabeth's table, on state occasions, was a large pie, from which, when opened, flew a cover of birds that, lighting in various parts of the dining-room, used to sing sweetly while the dinner was being eaten."
                  "That really was very nice," said my wife, "and almost equal to the singing of our cuckoo."
                  Whereupon the cuckoo, hearing itself spoken of, immediately broke forth with: "'Twas so! 'twas so! 'twas so!"
                  Which made the children laugh immoderately.
                  "And this reminds me of another famous pie, only equaled by the one I spoke of a few minutes ago, wherein Santa Claus was entombed; and this was one which, at an entertainment given by the Duke of Buckingham to Charles and Henrietta, when cut, released from beneath its rich crust, the dwarf Geoffrey Hudson, who ever after remained attached to the queen's household. Another magnificent Christmas pie—and one that could be eaten—which is more than can be said for the blackbird and dwarf pies, was made in 1769—just years ago—for Sir Henry Grey, Bart., which was composed of two bushels of flour, twenty pounds of butter, four geese, two turkeys, two rabbits, four wild ducks, two woodcocks, six snipes and four partridges, two neats' tongues, two curlews, seven blackbirds, and six pigeons. It was nearly nine feet in circumference, weighed twelve stone, and required two men to present it to table."
                  "That," said my wife, "was a pie worth having, and would have lasted a small family the year round."
                  "The mince-pie is another indispensable dish at the Christmas board, and, if one be descended of New England stock, as you, my dear, are, a pumpkin pie is equally requisite uisite. The mince-pies you make are beyond praise: words are inadequate to represent them properly. The poet who wrote the 'Ode to the "Mince-pie,"' in Hone's Year Book, must have eaten such a pie as yours, for he speaks 'as if to the manner born,' and with artistic taste. Listen:— 
                        
                           'Happy are they, thrice happy, who possess
                           The art to mix thy sweets with due address:
                           Delight in pastry, temper well the crust,
                           And hold the rolling pin a sacred trust.
                           Where shall the cook discern so sure a way
                           To give mince-pies a universal sway?
                           For when the sweets, combined with happy skill,
                           The light puff paste with meat delicious fill,
                           Like Albion's rich plum-pudding, famous grown,
                           The mince-pie reigns in realms beyond his own.
                           Through foreign latitudes his power extends,
                           And only terminates where eating ends.
                           
                           Sovereign of cakes, all hail! nor then refuse
                           The cordial offering from an English muse,
                           Who pours the brandy in libation free,
                           And finds plum-pudding realized in thee.'
                        
                     
                  
                  "Thus much for the mince-pie, and now a word or two about tarts. All persons, I think, are partial to tarts of one kind or another, and much of this partiality is, doubtless, owing to the fact that a single individual, as a rule, can eat a tart without assistance, and there is a good deal of comfort to be derived from the fact that you can eat a whole pie alone by yourself. The name of one of the best known characters in juvenile history his familiar to all of us solely from the circumstance that he, alone and unassisted, devoured a Christmas pie. I of course refer to the distinguished little glutton known, probably, after he came to man's estate, as James Horner. When a boy, he was called Jack, and it was his habit, at Christmas time, to sit in a corner, where, in comparative seclusion, he partook of his Christmas pie; he even went so far, while devouring his feast, as to thrust this thumb into the ill-fated pie, and pull therefrom a magnificent plum, for which simple feat he was pleased to dub himself with the title of a brave boy."
                  "Which I never thought," my wife said, "that he was justified in doing."
                  "Nor I either," I answered; "and now for a few remarks concerning the vegetables of which we have been, and the fruits we are eating. First, the vegetables: mealy potatoes, more tempting to the honest taste than their golden-hued brethren of southern climes; beets red, and tender as the hearts of maidens; cauliflowers, the rose of cabbages, smothered with a creamy sauce; maccaroni au parmesan, browned, through careful exposure to the fire, till it rivals the sunburnt cheeks of Italian peasant girls; and celery, its white stalks surmounted by leave of green, that wave triumphantly above the dish of jellied cranberries,—suggestive to our friends of the Emerald Isle of the green above the red,—must not be passed over without mention. Neither should we neglect to drop a few tears, figuratively speaking, over the onions; and the fried parsnips, browned with a spoonful a syrup, commend themselves to my sweet tooth.
                  "Of pears, apples, and oranges, what can I say that has not already been better said by the poets?"
                  "Yes," exclaimed the youngest, "I know something,— 
                        
                           'Apples and oranges, two for a penny,
                           It makes a good scholar to count so many.'
                        
                      That's what I know."
                  "Yes," I replied, "and you, my little one, are the scholar who can do it. Thomson, moreover, has a good word to say about the apple and the pear. For instance,— 
                        
                           'Let us tread the maze
                           Of autumn, unconfined; and taste, revived,
                           The breath of orchard, big with bending fruit.
                           .   .   .   .   The juicy pear
                           Lies, in a soft profusion, scattered round.
                           And, falling frequent through the chilly night,
                           The fragrant cloves, the wide projected heaps
                           Of apples, which the lusty-handed year,
                           Innumerous, o'er the blushing orchard shakes.'
                        
                     
                  
                  "Observe, too, my dear, how the poets have employed the pear in complimenting beauty. First, Suckling, in his 'Ballad upon a Wedding,' sings thus charmingly:— 
                        
                           'Her cheeks, so rare a white was on,
                           No daisy bears comparison;
                           Who sees her is undone!
                           For streaks of red were mingled there,
                           Such as are on a Katharine pear,
                           The side that's next the sun.'
                        
                      And Allan Ramsey, in the 'Gentle Shepherd,' makes the lover praise his mistress in these words:— 
                        
                           'Her cheek sae ruddy, an' her een sae clear;
                           An' O! her mouth's like ony hinny pear.'
                        
                     
                  
                  "And now, my dear, let me crack a nut or two. We, of the Great Republic, are much more liberal with our walnuts than were the ancient kings of Persia with theirs. We allow every one to have—with small exception—free access to the giant forest trees that bear them, and many are the bushels of them I have gathered in the autumn from the forests, when a boy, and stowed them away in the garret of the old homestead, to be brought forth, with the apples and cider from the cellar for the pleasant gatherings around the blazing hearth in the long winter evenings. The Persian kings, though, if we may credit Dr. Doran—and he is good authority—were selfishly inclined, for no one but their most sacred majesties dared eat any; though one would think that even they would find it hard to digest al the walnuts the country produced.
                  "The same authority declares that it is averred that walnuts entered into the Mithridatic recipe against poison; and this, according to Pompey, was as follows: 'Pound, with care, two walnuts, two dried figs, twenty pounds of rice, and a grain of salt.' This mixture, with the addition of, say, one hundred grains quinine, I think, might be an excellent remedy for the fever and ague, if taken in sufficiently large doses, precipitated with gin or whiskey."
                  
                  "I should think it might prove," said my wife, seriously considering it, "a capital remedy. Nor will I forget it. And when we advertise our cottage for sale, we will state that a certain preventive for the fever and ague is guaranteed and included with the premises."
                  "If you will again fill my glass with wine," I said, smiling, "your will enable me thereby to precipitate my dinner. For, like Rabelais, if there be two things I dislike more than others, they are a full glass and an empty one; for I cannot see a full glass without desiring to empty it, nor look on an empty one without wishing to have it filled."
                  "If you followed up those desires closely," said my wife, "you would be likely to be"—
                  "I know I would," I said, interrupting her; "but, happily, glasses will get broken, and then one's desires and wishes in connection with them come to naught."
                  During the pause that ensued, I sipped my Christmas wine, and studied the figures woven into the damask cloth upon the table. Suddenly it occurred to me why these figures—the palm-leaf—were there, and I said to my wife that, in ancient times, before table-cloths were in vogue, it was the fashion to spread palm-leaves upon the table, whereon to place the food, and this custom, as the pattern of this cloth plainly shows, is adhered to even to this day.
                  My wife nodded her head approvingly.
                  "Another circumstance in relation to the palm," I continued, "which is interesting, is that the Christmas-tree, which has only been received among us during late years, was known in ancient Egypt, and was represented by the palm. Doubtless Antony and Cleopatra, when children, found gifts on its twelve branches (symbolical of the months of the year) during the festival of the Saturnalia."
                  "Which is curious enough," said my wife; "and when we remember that the palm is associated with one of the festivals of the Christian Church—Palm Sunday—which commemorates the entry of our Saviour into Jerusalem, it it still more interesting."
                  "My dear," I said, "the children have, one by one, deserted us, wearied by my long dissertation, for their games in the library; and, with the simple wish, to them and to us, after this Christmas feast, that,— 
                        
                           'May good digestion wait on appetite,
                           And health on both!'
                        
                      we will join them, and with story, song, and play, make their Christmas night, and ours, joyous, merry, and gay."
                  Whereupon the cuckoo sung a parting roundelay of Christmas day, "Merry and gay, merry and gay!" and retired to her nest.
                  And thus ended our Christmas dinner.
               
               
                  
                  OVER A MUG OF ALE.
                  IT was a night which more than any other in the calendar is dedicated to the partaking of cakes and ale. Shakespeare alludes to this night and its custom, when, it a certain play, he makes Sir Toby Belch ask, "Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?" And though we, with our New England proclivities, take more kindly to Thanks-giving Night, with its doughnuts and cider; there is, nevertheless, among us, a growing faith in the pleasantness of Twelfth Night with its legendary cakes and ale.
                  It was a chilly night out of doors, but my wife and I, seated before the blazing hearth, gave little heed to the blustering wind that swept around the corners of our home, evidently seeking to enter by the closely curtained windows, to warm itself at the wood fire burning in the chimney-corner. As it was it flirted and toyed with the smoke and flame, coaxing them up the wide flue, and whirling them, in fantastic dances, far-off above the roof-tree into mid-air. Every now and then, when a fiercer blast than usual whistled about the gables, a few live coals would be drawn upward, and, parting the window curtains, I could see them sailing along through the dark night, until they dropped down, one by one, upon the snow in the orchard. Once in a while, too, the jingle of sleigh-bells, mingled with shouts and merry laughter, reached our ears; but we envied not the pleasure-seekers abroad, and only drew up closer to the warm hearth, and stirred the fire with a poker, sending a stream of sparks flying up the chimney, which, doubtless, gladdened the eyes of the merry-makers in the sleighs.
                  My wife was engaged in the old-fashion employment of knitting a pair of mittens for our eldest boy at boarding-school, and I had been reading aloud to her from a volume of that dear old poet, Fitz-Greene Halleck, and among other poems that in "Fanny," commencing,— 
                        "There's a barrel of porter of Tammany Hall,"
                      familiar to all lovers of beer and ale.
                  After reading it I suggested to my wife that a mug of ale would not detract from the sociability of the evening.
                  "It would not, indeed," she replied, "and while you draw the ale, I will get a few cakes, flavored with caraway seeds, such as our grandmothers used to make, when they kept Twelfth Night in olden times."
                  "I am a little afraid, my dear," I said, "that the ale in our barrel is getting low, for I have drawn it with no sparing hand lately, and though, as old Tusser says,— 
                        
                           'Being well brewed, long kept it will last,
                           And drawing abide—if ye draw not too fast,'
                        
                      I think I may venture to draw another quart from its iron-bound, oaken staves, and still leave sufficient within it to last us through the month."
                  "Ale," I said, as I placed the foaming tankard on the table, after filling my wife's and my own glass, "is the most popular of libations: it is the most revivifying of all drinks to a thirsty soul, and the least trying of any to the well-soaked toper. Indeed, Morgan Odoherty, who, if we may credit our friend John Savage, had experience and great taste in such matters, distinctly states that 'The most grateful of all drinks to the waking drunkard, is cold small beer.' And, furthermore, he likens a beer-drinker's cheek to some of the finest species of apples— 
                        'The side that's next the sun.'
                      'Such a cheek,' he says, 'carries one black into the golden age, reminding one of Eve, Helen, and Atalanta.' In his opinion, claret, punch, and beer, will make a man an Adonis, and he winds up by saying: 'Give me the cheek of a beer-bibber, the calf of a punch-bibber, and the mouth of a claret-bibber.'"
                  "Neither of which excellences, my dear," my wife said, "even if thereby you never become an Adonis, do I wish you to attain."
                  "My dear," I replied, "if I had a little more 'cheek' than I have, and a little more 'mouth' to assist the 'cheek,' even if they came from beer and claret bibbings, I believe I would get along in life better than I do."
                  My wife simply shook her head.
                  "Poets, from time immemorable," I said, after a pause, during which I drained my glass, "have sung the praises of ale. The Norsemen used to drink ale out of the skulls of their enemies slain in battle; and the heroes desired no better reward after death than, in the Hall of Odin,— 
                        
                           'On a high raised throne,
                           Seated with gods, to quaff their ale.'
                        
                      In one of the Danish ballads, according to Mr. Savage, the mighty 'Thor of Asgard' goes, disguised as a maid, to the court of the Thusser King, and there— 
                        
                           'A whole ox-carcase the maid ate up,
                           Her loves and her bacon first;
                           And then twelve barrels of ale she drank,
                           
                           Before she could quench her thirst.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "Why, twelve barrels of ale," said my wife, "would last us a year."
                  "Indeed, they would," I replied, "and leave an extra barrel over for holiday-tapping. Chaucer, the father of English poetry, in his 'Canterbury Tales' written in 1395, or thereabouts, thus alludes to this beverage:— 
                        'Wel coude he knowe a draught of London ale.'
                      In 'Gammer Gurton's Needle, written in 1565, the old song by John Still appears, which is familiar to all readers, the chorus of which runs thus:—
                        
                           'Both back and side, go bare, go bare,
                           Both foot and hand go cold;
                           But, belly, God send thee good ale enough,
                           Whether it be new or old.'
                        
                      Another song ascribed to Bishop Still, and not so well known as this, is—
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              THE JUG OF ALE.
                              
                                 'As I was sitting one afternoon
                                 Of a pleasant day in the month of June,
                                 I heard a thrush sing down the vale,
                                 And the tune he sang was "the jug of ale,"
                                 And the tune he sang was the jug of ale.
                              
                              
                                 'The white sheet bleaches on the hedge,
                                 And it sets my wisdom teeth on edge;
                                 When dry with telling your peddler's tale,
                                 Your only comfort's jug of ale,
                                 Your only comfort's a jug of ale.
                              
                              
                                 'I jog along the footpath way,
                                 For a merry heart goes all the day;
                                 But at night, whoever may flout and rail
                                 I sit down with my friend, the jug of ale,
                                 With my good old friend, the jug of ale.
                              
                              
                                 'Whether the sweet or sour of the year,
                                 I tramp and tramp, though the gallows be near.
                                 O, while I've a shilling I will not fail
                                 To drown my cares in a jug of ale,
                                 Drown my cares in a jug of ale.'
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  It scarcely seems to me, however, that this song is as old as my authority would make out. Shakespeare, in 'The Winter's Tale,' makes Autolycus, that 'snapper-up of unconsidered trifles,' sing, as he trudges along the road near the shepherd's cottage, a song, the second stanza of which much resembles the second one in the 'Jug of Ale:'— 
                        
                           'The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,—
                           With, heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!
                           Doth set my prigging teeth on edge;
                           For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.'
                        
                     
                  
                  Farquhar, in his 'Beaux Stratagem,' in the scene between Boniface and Aimwell, makes the jolly host describe the brew on tap in these words:—
                     
                        
                           'Boniface.
                           Ale! 'Tis smooth as oil, sweet as milk, clear as amber, and strong as brandy. Sir, I have fed purely upon ale; I have eat my ale, drank my ale, and I always sleep upon ale. Now, sir, you shall see (filling a glass); your worship's health! Ha! delicious, delicious! fancy it Burgundy—only fancy it, and 'tis worth ten shillings a quart.
                        
                        
                           'Aimwell.
                           (Drinks.) 'Tis confounded strong.
                        
                        
                           'Boniface.
                           Strong! It must be so, or how should we be strong that drink it?'
                        
                      And of this very ale we are now drinking, a latter-day rhymer has sung, eulogizing it—no more, however, than it deserves:— 
                        
                           ''Twas but last week, Tom, on Sunday,
                           In Albany I met with Saxe;
                           Who doesn't care for Mrs. Grundy,
                           And always pays his income tax.
                        
                        
                           'And, as we walked that quaint Dutch city,
                           Seeing no children weak or pale,
                           He said—'twas rude, perhaps, but witty—
                           Their mother's milk is Aster ale.'
                        
                      But, to go back again to olden times. George Withers, in his 'Christmas,' says: Now justices feed poor men, who present them with capons— 
                        
                           'With good cheer,
                           And what they want they take in beer,
                           For Christmas comes but once a year,
                           And then they shall be merry.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "But after all," my wife said, "it seems to me that the poor men had to take whatever they wanted—though they might have preferred a slice of plum-pudding or a piece of mince-pie—in beer."
                  "Not at all," I replied, "it means that they were at liberty to take all the beer they wanted, besides being provided with other good cheer. The meaning would be clearer if the line read,— 
                        'And what they want they take of beer.'
                      instead of 'in beer.' Our English ancestors were partial to this good drink, and in the olden times it was more usual to see the hop-wine wreathing itself over the porch than it was to see the grape-vine, which now so generally occupies its place. Milton, who sung charmingly of the vine with 'curling tendrils and clustering grapes,' neglects to say a good word for the hop. I can forgive him, however, this slight, since he makes his rustics in 'L'Allegro' tell stories of Queen Mab and her troupe of fairies, over— 
                        'The spicy, nut-brown ale.'
                      Reverend Francis Fawkes's song—'The Brown Jug'—is one of the cleverest things of its kind in the language. It says,— 
                        
                           'This brown jug, that now foams with mild ale
                           (In which I now drink to sweet Nan of the vale).
                           Was once Toby Fillpot, a thirsty old soul
                           As e'er drank a bottle, or fathomed a bowl.'
                        
                      And, furthermore, it goes on to relate, how when— 
                        
                           'With a friend and a pipe puffing sorrow away,
                           And with honest old stingo was soaking his clay,
                           His breath-doors of life on a sudden were shut,
                           And he died full as big as a Dorchester butt.'
                        
                      After his body had lain in the ground long enough to resolve into clay, a potter very opportunely comes along, and, from— 
                        'Its covert so snug.'
                      he took— 
                        
                           'Part of fat Toby, and formed this brown jug—
                           Now scared to friendship, and mirth, and mild ale;
                           So here's to the lovely sweet Nan of the vale.'
                        
                     
                  
                  "Shakespeare, in the Induction to the 'Taming of the Shrew,' makes Christopher Sly, on his waking from his drunken sleep in the house of a lord, cry out,— 
                        'For God's sake, a pot of small ale.'
                      And, further on, to convince the persons present, and probably himself too, that he is not a lord he says,— 
                        'Ask Marian Hacket, the fat-ale wife of Wincot, if she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence on the score for Warwickshire ale, score me up for the lyingest knave in Christendom.'
                     
                      And, again, when satisfied that he is not only a lord, but has a lady for his wife, he exclaims:— 
                        
                           'Well, bring the lady hither to our sight;
                           And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "This quotation reminds me that I wish to ask you," my wife said, "what has become of the letter that Mr. Halleck wrote to you in acknowledgment of the Ale-Book you sent to him."
                  "Alas," I answered, "one who called himself my friend, J. C. D., borrowed it of me at the Century Club, to show to Miss 'Beulah' Evans, and he never, never gave it back."
                  "But he will?" interrupted my wife, inquiringly.
                  "He will," I said, with emphasis, "or else I'll borrow his beard for a masquerade, and never return it."
                  "Why, his beard isn't false," asked my wife, "is it?"
                  "Of course it is," I answered.
                  "What a pity!" my wife exclaimed.
                  "That his beard is false?" I inquired, "or that he retained my letter?"
                  "Both," replied my wife.
                  "Yes," I answered, "and now, my dear, a foaming glass to the poet's memory."
                  And me drank in silence.
                  "The kings and queens of yore," I said, after a pause, "were excellent ale-bibbers, and we read that Queen Elizabeth and her 'maids' breakfasted on beef and beer, or, as Tom Hood has it,— 
                        
                           'Good Queen Bess
                           Broke her fast with ale and beef,
                           Instead of toast and the Chinese leaf.'
                        
                      Charles the Second's habits were simple even in his prosperous days; but after the battle of Worcester it was still more so, and 'bread, cheese, small beer, and nothing else' sufficed him when concealed in the oak. Charles the Fifth, of Germany, however, was a great drinker: 'his morning draught was cold beer and plenty of it.' Even after his physician advised him to give up drinking, he still clung to his favorite tipple, until finally too much beer brought him to his bier. It is recorded, by Dr. Doran, of Frederick William of Prussia, that after the close of the war of 1806-9, the court-marshal asked what quantity of champagne he should order for his Majesty's cellar? 'None,' replied the king; 'I will drink neither champagne, nor any other wine, until all my subjects—even the very poorest—can afford to drink beer again.' Whether the king stuck to his resolution until his words came true, history has not recorded. It, though, the price of ale or beer was no higher than it was in the time of Henry the Third—a gallon of ale for a half-penny, in cities; and the same quantity for a farthing in the country—I can readily imagine that it was not long before the king's table was graced with still and sparkling wines."
                  "No wonder," my wife said, "With ale as cheap as that, that the people of those days nearly lived upon ale: why, it is almost as cheap as Croton water."
                  "Yes," I answered, "but I do not think that the publicans of those days could have lived on the profits of ale-selling, however fat the drinkers and sinners might have got. Perhaps some of them, though, turned parsons and preached on Sunday, thereby eking out a livelihood. For, if a parson may turn tapster, why may not a tapster become a parson?"
                  "But such a thing never happened?" my wife said, inquiringly.
                  "Indeed it has," I replied, "and in 'Table Traits' we read that 'in not very remote times, the parsonage-house at Langdale, England, was licensed as an ale-house, the living being too poor to allow the incumbent to make anything like one upon it for himself. The ale-cask became to the priest what the fruit of the Amrite tree was to the Thibetians—the spring of life.'
                  
                  "Other houses than parsonages," I continued, after a pause, during which I drained another mug of ale, "have been converted into tap-rooms. The poet Coleridge's house at Stowey, is a beer-shop. Here he wrote the 'Ode to the Nightingale,' with its— 
                        
                           'Jug, jug, jug,
                           And that low note more sweet than all,'—
                        
                      which lines the printer, by a curious though natural association of ideas, converted into— 
                        
                           'Jug, jug, jug,
                           And that low note more sweet than ale.'
                        
                     
                  
                  "There is an amusing story told in verse of a worthy parson, who, returning home at noon from church, where he had preached a sermon on the goodly manner in which Job and borne all the troubles sent upon him, and being somewhat thristy from his labors, called for a mug of ale. Unfortunately, the servant had left the spiggot open the last time he drew from the cask, and the ale had all run away. The parson was very angry thereat, and used words not seemly for one of the cloth to use. Whereupon his wife reminded him of the losses Job had known, and the patience with which he bore them.
                  'Zounds! madam, cried the parson, with an oath, Did Job e'er lose a barrel of such ale?'
                  "Of course he didn't: that straw on the camel's back was not laid upon Job, or else could we not now look up to him as having been the most patient of men."
                  "I don't know about that," my wife said; "Job suffered much more, in my opinion, them the loss of a barrel of ale would have entailed on him; besides, for aught we know, he may have lost one."
                  "Hardly," I replied, "else he could not have been ailing, as he was, all the time."
                  My wife failed to catch my meaning, and I went on: "Burns, perhaps, more than any other poet, has extolled John Barleycorn. He terms it the 'king o' grain,' and the draught made from it— 
                        
                           'Guid, auld Scotch drink,
                           Whether thro' wimpling worms thou jink,
                           Or, richly brown, ream o'er the brink,
                           In glorious faem.'
                        
                      In Tam O' Shanter— 
                        
                           'The night drave on wi' sangs and clatter;
                           And ay the ale was growing better,'
                        
                      before Tam was ready to start for home; and when at last he does venture forth, it is only through— 
                        'Inspiring, bold John Barleycorn,'
                      that he gains the courage that enables him to face the witches in Kirk Alloway According to our Scotch poet,— 
                        
                           'John Barleycorn was a hero bold,
                           Of noble enterprise;
                           For if you do but taste his blood,
                           'Twill make your courage rise.
                        
                        
                           'Twill make a man forget his woe;
                           'Twill heighten all his joy;
                           'Twill make the widow's heart to sing,
                           Tho' the tear were in her eye.'
                        
                     
                  
                  "Dean Nowell was the accidental inventor of bottled ale. He was out fishing one day, with a bottle of new ale at his side, when he was obliged to flee for his life—being under the displeasure of Queen Mary,—but first thrust his bottle of ale between the roots of a tree, where it remained, hidden from sight, until it was safe for him to return. Looking for his hidden bottle, he found it, and taking it from its hiding-place, the cork was accidentally driven from it, and a creamy fluid that rejoiced the palate of the Dean by its excellence, flowed therefrom. The good man ever thereafter was in the habit of hiding bottles of new ale between the roots of that sacred tree, and finding them therein after many days.
                  "Dean Nowell ahs the credit, moreover, of being 'the first church dignitary who laid the foundation of red noses among the clergy, by bringing bottled ale into use.'"
                  "As if," my wife exclaimed, "red noses came not otherwise than through quaffing bottled ale!"
                  "Peter Pindar," I said, paying no heed to her remark, "says:— 
                        
                           'Whene'er thou dost espy a nose,
                           That bright with many a ruby glows;
                           That nose thou may'st pronounce, nay, safely swear,
                           Is nursed on something better than small beer.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "I thought so," my wife said.
                  "Small beer, though," I said, "has been defined as 'an undrinkable drink,' which if it were placed on a cullender to let the water run out, would leave a residuum of—nothing. 'Upon the principle,' says Horace Smith, in 'The Tin Trumpet,' 'of lucus a non lucendo, it may be termed liquid bread, and the strength of corn. Small beer comes under the third category of the honest brewer who divided his infusions into three classes as well as glasses—strong-table, common-table, and lamen-table.'"
                  "That was not so bad," said my wife.
                  "But better is this interpretation of a misspelling by Theodore Hook," I added; "An illiterate vendor of the commodity wrote over his door, 'Bear sold Here.' 'He spells the word quite correctly,' said T. H., 'if he means to apprise us that the article is of his own Bruin!' Another little anecdote on the beer question, and I am done. 'What will be the best method of saving this small beer from depredation?' asked a lady of her butler. 'Placing a cask of strong beer at the side of it,' was the reply."
                  My wife smiled.
                  "And now," I added, "lest by excessive imbibing of strong, not small beer, I may come to get a red nose, I will divide with you all that remains in the tankard, wishing in conclusion that it may never be our lot to have— 
                        'Beer small as comfort, dead as charity.'"
                     
                  
               
            
            
               MUSIDORA AND MY SOUTHERN MAID.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "How happy could I be with either,
                           Were the other dear charmer away!"
                        
                     
                     MOORE.
                  
               
               
                  
                  UP AND DOWN BROADWAY.
                  IT is pleasant to lounge through Broadway of a sunny afternoon in February, when the ladies are abroad in all their glory. Then as we come in contact with beauty robed in velvets and brocades and satins, arrayed in laces and furs and the shawls of Cashmere, adorned with diamonds and pearls, and other precious stones, we believe in EI Dorados, and fancy Utopia is not a mystic land. We become filled with the idea that Broadway is an elongated Garden of Eden, built up with marble and granite fronted stores, and hotels, and palaces, and thronged with gay and happy Adams and Eves, wandering up and down its walks; or, if not a Garden of Eden, then a World's Fair, where all kinds of wonderful and costly things are being viewed by all sorts of brilliant people. We do not regard Broadway in this light at all times, however; it is only when the sky is blue, and the air is mild, and the pavements are comparatively clean and dry. But when the sky is clouded, and the atmosphere is chilly, and the pavements are dirty and wet, then indeed our opinion of this popular thoroughfare is greatly altered: but mind, we do not object to the crossings being a bit damp and untidy, just enough so to warrant a display of embroidered skirts and dainty little gaiters. It is refreshing at this time, too, to see a sunshade shade, or a fan coquettishly handled; they are highly suggestive of spring-time, and the flowering of lilacs in front yards or buttercups on hill-sides. We look upon the heavy omnibuses, the light carriages, the lumbering drays, the jaunty express-wagons, the unsightly hacks, the physicians' gigs, the bakers' carts, and the advertising vans that crowd the street, and we think about tunnels and aerial railways. We stop often in our walk, and look into shop windows. In imagination we eat bonbons and ices at Maillard's; we partake freely of luscious grapes and melting pears, and crack pecan and paradise nuts at Parmelee's; and we imbibe sparingly of golden-hued sherry and sparkling catawba at Felter's. We notice a pair of skates at the Berrians', and straightway we recall the days long past, when we glided over the frozen channel of the Hudson, the Catskills rising white before us in the distance, and Mount Merino, with its dark evergreens, pictured at our feet. We gaze long into print-sellers' windows, and feast our eyes upon costly paintings and proof engravings. We think that Knœdler of Goupil's must be a very fortunate man to have the memorable localities of England and France and Italy brought, as it were, to his very door, and come to the conclusion that would be foolish for him to travel abroad. We consider Schaus' store a very nice place, and the rare engravings and pictures displayed there subjects for much study. We revel in the gorgeous silks that are displayed in Hearn's windows, and try to imagine how the little girl whom we adore—and who, if but the course of true love for once runs smooth, we intend one day somewhere in the sunny future, to marry—would appear, half hidden in the folds of the pearl-colored brocade, or the white watered silk. The thought is an extremely tantalizing one, and for fear we may spend our entire month's salary on one of those tempting robes, we hasten on. We stop, however, at the Athenæum, where we luxuriate over the sight of rare and costly volumes; viewing them with an interest but a trifle short of the affection we entertain for the little girl down South. We recall to mind all the libraries of which we have ever known or read. We think of the "Astor," with its air of scholarly repose; of a private one in Boston, wherein is a vacant chair, an idle pen, and an unfinished history: suddenly the plate glass in the window seems blurred,—we can scarcely distinguish the titles of the volumes therein placed, and can only read upon one of them as we turn away, "Philip the Second, Volume, Third." We do not stop to gaze any more into the windows, but we walk sorrowfully up Broadway. We have sad thoughts now; and we ask ourselves if the unended history will ever be finished, and who of all our able writers would have the courage to take up that fallen pen? We fail to answer the question, and so, musing on life, its uncertainties, its vanities, and its griefs, we wander slowly homeward. Already the sunshine has vanished from Broadway; the shadows stretch across the street, and are creeping silently up the opposite buildings. The day is almost done, and the night is coming.
               
               
                  
                  MUSIDORA.
                  WE like to saunter through Broadway, when the three o'clock shadows fall upon the flagging, and to greet familiar faces as we pass along. We meet Musidora, ravishingly clad in velvet and lace, and wearing the most coquettish of little bonnets. We admire Musidora. Her papa has a silver mine in Golconda, and she possesses some magnificent diamonds. We were introduced to her at the artists' reception in Tenth Street, and had the pleasure of pointing out to her one of the finest pictures exhibited there. We met her afterwards at a party, and were rejoiced to find that she had not forgotten us. When we pass her in Broadway she recognizes and greets us with a smile. It is very pleasant to be smiled upon by Musidora, and it incites us to commence the erection of a little chateau in Spain as we walk along. Suddenly our chateau falls to the ground as we encounter, on the next block, a young gentleman in straw-colored kids, who we remember to have seen dancing with Musidora at the party. We are well aware that it is no affair of ours—for Musidora is nothing to us, nor are we anything to Musidora—yet we regard the young gentleman in straw-colored gloves with sentiments of a nature anything but affectionate. We are certain that he will soon overtake and walk with Musidora. As we pass over the raised platform, in front of Delmonico's hotel, we look around to observe if our surmise be correct. We find that it is; and the dancing youth is walking and talking with her. We are grieved because of it—though why we should be we cannot tell—and straightway resolve to forget Musidora and the fortunate individual in the straw-colored kids. We console ourselves with thinking of the little girl down South, whose eyes sparkle quite as brilliantly as do the diamonds on Musidora's bosom; whose smile is full as sweet, and whose voice is just as low and musical. We feel quite guilty that we have allowed, even for a moment, the affection we have for the little girl down South to be overshadowed by the admiration we entertain for the Juno-like Musidora. We seek to recall all the pretty sayings we have uttered to the little girl, and all the delicious verses we have written her; and then we remember that we have spoken no jolie sayings to Musidora, nor indited her any love poems: and this knowledge enables us to strike a balance in the little girl's favor, which we straightway do, and thereby set our scruples at rest. As we move slowly up Broadway, our eyes are attracted to the windows of a marchande de robes, wherein are displayed many things highly suggestive of domestic bliss. We are not certain that we can call these pretty little articles by their correct names, but we know for what class of humanity they are intended. We are certain that the dainty lace caps we see there can only fit the tiniest kind of heads; that the white robes, rich with needlework and lace, and the costly mantles, heavy with embroidery and fringe, are only intended for those beings, new to earth, who have not yet outlived their christening period. We wonder if the time will ever come when we shall hold in our arms anything clad in as charming a wardrobe. Such a realization, to us, seems far distant; but the thought that it may one day come to pass, startles us exceedingly. We incontinently leave the window, humming, as we go, the song of "Coming through the Rye." We stay our song, however, and our steps at the same moment, as we stop before Wiley and Halsted's, to look at the stereoscope pictures in their window. In an instant we are transported from New York to Italy, and are gazing upon the finest statuary which that land of art possesses; or, we are in England by Rydal water; or in Scotland, amidst "the banks and braes o' bonnie Doon;" or in the moon; or on the waves of the sea; or gathering birds'-nests or flowers or shells. We behold ghosts and witches and fairies; we see birds and animals and insects; we luxuriate in charming boudoirs, or climb rugged mountains, or float upon crystal lakes, or dive deep into mines. And the mines remind us of Golconda again and Musidora, and involuntarily we turn from the spot to encounter the bright eyes and the sweet smile of the queenly woman herself as, unattended by the straw-colored kids, she glides past. We give one sigh for the little girl down South, and the next moment we are walking beside Musidora, oblivious of the dear one among the orange groves, and fully convinced that Broadway is indeed a Garden of Eden.
               
               
                  ROSES AND ORANGE-BUDS.
                  WE like to visit picture-galleries, and dream the hours away before the delicious creations of artists; feasting our eyes on the rich coloring of gold and purple and carmine, that shed over the canvas a midsummer warmth. We are partial to pictures of sunsets, and mellow, autumnal afternoons, when the long shadows fall across green valleys, and the sunlight gleams athwart the water. We like, too, pictures illustrative of quite domestic life: when the twilight has fallen, but before the gas is lighted, or the shades dropped at the windows; while only the blazing coal in the open grate lights the apartment with a ruddy glow, and while the toddling wee things play and tumble on the Turkish rug before the fire, and roll oranges about in their pastime. We also like other interior views, such as we find at Goupil's gallery, wherein are depicted red-nosed burghers and long-haired students drinking Rhenish wines out of all flagons, shouting bacchanalian choruses in cabarets, or in wine-vaults, deep in the earth, lighted by flaring torches, and stored with tiers of ancient casks, containing the blood of grapes that ripened years and years ago. Many an afternoon have we lingered in this gallery, studying its peculiar school of painting, till we imagined we had well learned the beauties of all its pictures. We did not suppose that we could discover in Desdemona's face a sweeter expression than we had already seen; that the fairies playing amidst the lily-pads could appear lovelier than we know them to be; that the three angels in the adoration of the Magi could look more spiritual, or the wooing scenes move our hearts to feelings of greater tenderness or kindlier sympathy; but we learned, however, that they could, when one afternoon recently we found at the gallery the peerless Musidora. Why we should have gone there as we did, we cannot tell: certainly it was not for the purpose of looking at the pictures; they had become as olden stories to us, older than thrice-told tales; none of them were new—we had stood before each time and time again. It is in vain to attempt to explain the why or the wherefore; we only know that we went there, and that our eyes, as we entered, fell first on Musidora. What to us was the Greek slave, or the Martyrdom of Huss, or the Jobsiad, or any, indeed, of the pictures displayed there? We had eyes only for Musidora—thought only for her—admiration only for her. The moment we entered the gallery her glance fell on us; she smiled as she alone can smile; and when we stood beside her she gave us her hand, and said that she knew she should meet us there. How the touch of that ungloved, jeweled hand filled us with a strange delight! How foolishly proud we grew on the instant! How presumptuous! How daring! O Musidora, with your large blue eyes, with your enchanting smiles, and your full melodious voice, why will you come between us and the little girl down South? Why will you cast your northern roses into the scale against the orange-blossoms of the southern maid! We are drawn to you, Musidora, as the tide is drawn to the harvest-moon; we lack the power of resistance. There was a time when one bright star sparkled alone in our heart; but now, alas! the light of a full moon bathes us in splendor. Musidora, you will have much to answer for; you will be the cause of anguish to more than one heart ere we separate. Your diamonds, which you wear so proudly on your swelling bosom, will one day burn into your very soul; they flash brilliantly now in the sunlight; but by and by, when the night comes, they will be darkened. The orange-flowers in the southern groves are very sweet, Musidora, sweeter than the roses; but they bloom afar off, and their perfume, when it reaches us, is faint, fainter than the odor of the roses which grow around us in the garden-walks. Once it was not so; but then—then we had not met. As we gaze on the pictures they appear more beautiful than ever before. We feel that we could wander ceaselessly around the rooms, gazing on these painted canvases, if only accompanied by Musidora. We find much that is new and attractive in them which we never had previously seen, to point out for her appreciation. She is quick to perceive and admire them. She even discerns points of interest in them which had escaped our eyes. We converse on subjects connected with art; we discuss Pre-Raphaelism, and Ruskin and his late inaugural address, and the olden painters, Giorgione, Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese, and Leonardo da Vinci; and then, as a pause occurs, we suddenly discover that the light in the gallery is failing, that we two are quite alone, and that the hours of the afternoon are fled. So we go forth into Broadway, and almost in entire silence pass slowly along with the tide of humanity moving homeward. We encounter the young man in straw-colored kids, who danced with Musidora at the party, and his face expresses anything but pleasure at seeing us together. He bows, however, politely to Musidora, which act she acknowledges by smiling sweetly on him. We are indignant because she smiles, and look exceedingly vexed. She notices the injured air we wear, and divines the cause, for she laughs a most distracting little laugh, and says, "It was not wrong for me to smile on him, was it? Alas, poor young man! he is soon to be married; you surely are not vexed at me, are you?" Could we be vexed at Musidora? No! no! and though the sun is set, and the lights in the shop-windows are appearing, we seem to walk surrounded only by sunshine, and with the air filled with the fragrance of roses. As we are about to leave her at the door of the house of the gentleman who owns a silver mine in Golconda, she gives ua s red rose-bud which all the afternoon had been concealed—Heaven alone knows where—we dare not imagine—but which is warm and more fragrant than are rose-buds usually. So, pressing her dainty hand, we leave her. We walk on in a bewildered state of mind; we are troubled with all kinds of fancies, and, though awake, dream all manner of dreams. An hour afterwards we throw the bud, which we have kissed, away; we tread it under foot; we weep for very shame, and a sad upbraiding face—the face of the maiden down South—seems to look upon us wherever we go; but the scent of the rose-bud lingers around us still, nor can we recall the perfume of orange-flowers. In sadness we enter our lonely apartment. We strive to be cheerful. We stir, till it blazes, the bituminous coal in the grate. We murmur the melody of a song which we listened to, when—seated beside the little maiden in days past—we had blessed visions which were summed up in the one word "home." We seek to bring back these visions; we wish to see again the home that our imagination had so fondly pictured, wherein she was to preside as mistress; but alas! we seek in vain. We hear only Musidora's melodious voice; we see only the brownstone fronted mansion, in which she resides with her papa, the fortunate possessor of the silver mine in Golconda; while the home—the old-fashioned country house, shaded by palmettos—we fail to discover. We become, at last, quite desperate. We call Musidora naughty names. We wish we had never met her. We firmly resolve never to see her more. We will henceforth think solely fo the little girl down South, and will banish Musidora from our heart forever. We take out of a secret drawer a life-like miniature of the beloved one. We also bring forth a paquet of letters, tied together with a blue ribbon. They are not written by Musidora, but by the southern maid. We peruse them—as we have done many times before— carefully, admiringly, lovingly. In one of them we find an orange-flower—withered, but O, how fragrant!—that overpowers and scatters the scent of the rose-bud which so long had lingered around us. It is late, indeed, in the night before we go to rest; but our dreams are of orange-flowers of the South, and not of the Northern roses.
               
               
                  
                  NEW AND OLD LOVE.
                  WHEN I left Musidora, after looking at the diamonds in Tiffany's window, the afternoon was far advanced. I had walked with her up and down Broadway, besides trifling an hour or more over a charlotte de russe and a cup of chocolate at Maillard's. I had sunned myself in her presence: her smiles had fallen upon me, and her words had crept into my heart, till I was ready to forget the southern maid—my vows, my hopes, and the love I bore her. Musidora was in her most queenly and enchanting mood. She smiled upon me, as she alone can smile, till I wondered if heaven were made of smiles. She gave me her gloves to hold, and I carried them home with me. They are lying on the table before me. They appear to be very nice gloves; their color is—I think she called it "mode," but whatever it may be, it is very beautiful, and I think, I will order a silk waistcoat of the same shade. I have inflated these gloves with my breath, till they have looked as if Musidora's hands were in them, but when I attempted to clasp them how they shrunk in my grasp! I imagine that Musidora will some day elude me in the same way. It will be an exceedingly unpleasant and dark day for me when this little occurrence takes place. I do not think I could ever get used to these kind of things. I have had my little love-sorrows, and have managed to pass safely through them; but for all that, I cannot perceive that they grow lighter or less unendurable because of their frequency.
                  Musidora calls me her slave, her poet, her dreamer, and bids me, if I be her loyal knight, to write songs and twilight light reveries for her entertainment. But I cannot do the last, even for Musidora. I remember that years ago there was one—her form is in the graveyard now—who made a like request of me. The manuscript, unfinished, is lying with some old letters of hers in a corner of my desk. The ink is faded, and the writing is blotted with tears that fell from eyes that were dim and sorrowing. I fear to disturb that manuscript, lest the olden memories folded in its leaves should arise and accuse me of all manner of forgetfulness. I see before me now the pale, sweet face of my first love. She had soft, flaxen hair, and her forehead was low and white; and her eyes were blue—somewhat like Musidora's—and her voice was gentle and musical. I count upon my fingers the years that have passed since—well, since I wept for her—and I am surprised to find that they only number ten. Ten years? Alas! could I not keep her memory fresh in my heart for that brief period! Her memory? How many memories of southern maids and peerless Musidoras have entered my heart, lingered there a while, and vanished since then! I should not like to recall them all. I am not certain that I could, even if I tried. I cannot longer refrain from taking from its corner in my desk the unfinished manuscript. It is tied together with a crimson ribbon—she tied the know, and now for the first time, since she handed the package to me, ten years ago, do I unbind it. See, a note addressed to me, and written by her hand falls to the floor as I open it. To me it comes like a message from the spirit world. What have I to do with these dead loves! Take it away. I cannot, dare not, will not read it. Did I not shed tears over your grave, Alice? Did I not sorrow deeply and truly for your loss? Were not my days made bitter and my nights sleepless because of you? The wound your death caused in my breast was a sore one, but it is healed now. I have outlived the anguish your loss occasioned me. I have outlived the love I once bore you, and had almost forgotten that you ever dwelt on earth. But now—with this old note, never yet read by me, lying at my feet, and the sight of the familiar handwriting upon its face—the foolish wound reopens; the old sorrow is mind again, and long pent up tears burst forth once more. What is Musidora to me now? or even the southern maid? The years are rolled backward as a scroll. I am a boy again, with the down upon my checks and sunlight in my heart. I wander through pleasant valleys and climb green hill-sides, in company with Alice. I gather for her the earliest blossoms of spring. I fill her basket with the largest strawberries that grow. I tame for her rabbits an squirrels, so that they come at her call, and feed out of her hand, and I fill her cottage home with singing birds. At church I kneel beside her. I chant the psalms out of the same book. I enjoy, with her, every sermon that her father, the white-haired pastor, preaches, and I believe in her beauty, her purity, and her love for me, as I did in the years so long ago.
                  Then, taking up the note, I open and read it. It is brief, and runs thus: "Come, directly you receive this, to your Alice." I took at my watch—it is eight o'clock. I take my hat and go forth in quest of Alice. I wander through the streets. I encounter youth, beauty, and wealth; poverty, grief, and crime: but with none of these is Alice. I look through windows as I pass, into rooms bright with light and joyous with merry voices, but no Alice gladdens my sight. Disappointed and sorrowful, I turn into Union Park, and, seated on one of the benches, seek to unravel the mystery. It is very clear and simple to me now, but it perplexed me then. I knew that I had just received a note from Alice wishing me to come to her. I had forgotten the long years that had intervened since the note was written. I was oblivious of the present; I had wandered back into the past. Suddenly a clock in the neighborhood struck two; at the same moment a hand, gentle and light in its touch as a woman's, was laid on my shoulder. "It is Alice," I whispered; but the strong, manly voice that reached my ears, undeceived me. "Friend," it said, "you have sat here long enough; it is late, come, go home." The tone was kind, and in keeping with the touch, though it came from a policeman. Instantly the past vanished, the present returned, and I knew why it was that I could not find Alice, who was lying in a quiet country church-yard far away.
               
               
                  
                  MY FIRST LOVE.
                  I HAVE scarcely thought of Musidora for a week, and I have dreamed but once of my southern maid. I have been dwelling in the past. The sound of voices that are still has filled my ears. Hands mouldering in the dust have been clasped in mine. Bright eyes, long since darkened, have gazed upon me; and little feet, that are treading the paths which angels know, have walked beside me in my daily life. Yet I have gone up and down Broadway, been jostled by the crowd, and even passed Musidora without once desiring to join her, or turning my head to gaze after the peerless beauty. I can hardly realize the change that has come over me; and that her note—the note my dead Alice wrote ten years ago—should have wrought this, seems incredible. I recall, as if it were but yesterday, the night she died. It was in December, and I distinctly remember the sound of the wind, as it wailed around the corners of the house and moaned through the pine-trees beyond. Sometimes, when I am up among the mountains, late in the fall, I hear this same wind sobbing amidst the leafless branches of the forest. It possesses a tone peculiarly melancholy, filling my being with sadness, and sounding like a requiem for Alice. When she died, only her mother and I were present. It was just after midnight that, waking from an uneasy slumber, she said, "Mother, Alice is going home now; kiss me once more." Her mother kissed her. Then, turning to me, she said, as I bowed over her, "Darling, do not forget your spirit-bride—your hand—kiss me;" and, even as our lips met, she passed away. The wailing of the wind suddenly ceased. A mouse nibbled somewhere within the wainscot. A watch-dog barked in the distance, and immediately all was silent. After a pause, a strange voice—it was her mother's but, O! how changed—exclaimed, "The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord." Then another strange voice—it was mine—replied, "Amen." And then death dwelt in the chamber.
                  On Christmas Day, amidst falling snow, we buried Alice. I heard the frozen earth rattle upon her coffin: the sound it made was new to me, and filled me with terror. For months afterwards, my nightly dreams were fraught with like sounds. One, two, nearly three years passed away, and I had not forgotten my spirit-bride. I made monthly pilgrimages to the spot where she slept. I kept the sod above her rounded and green. I placed lilies of the valley at the grave's foot, and about the head-stone wild roses and sweetbriers. At last, when I had left the neighborhood, and could no longer go to look upon her grave, I grew gradually to forget her. Time swept her from my thoughts. I saw other maidens—who seemed as fair, as pure, as gentle, and as loving as Alice had been—whom I loved, and who, I thought, loved me.
                  With these my dreams of happiness returned, and though sunlight and shadows chased each other across my path as these maidens came and went, still life to me was no longer the dull, sorrowing task it had been. If I did not love any one of these as I had Alice, neither did I grieve so deeply at their loss, when they went their several ways—flirting or wedding—as I did when she died. Some of them forsook me, and these I quickly forgot. Others, whom I first neglected, shed a few tears, perhaps, and then laughed with a new lover, and forgot me. I do not believe that any hearts were broken, and I should be sorry to think that any were. And so, forgetful of the past, careless of the present, and heedless of the future—plucking orange-blossoms in the South, and gathering roses in the North—I wandered, unthinkingly, upon my way, until the night when, by sheer accident,—or was it destiny?—I discovered Alice's long-hidden note, which, seemingly, has turned the current of my life back into the olden channel that, for years, had been dry and lost even to memory. To-night as I sit in my room, I feel that Alice is beside me. I cannot see her, it is true, but I know she must be near. I hear—how clearly!—the music of a hymn that, in the twilight of summer Sundays, she and I used to sing together to her parents, seated in the porch of their vine-covered cottage. On the table near me is a package of her letters. They are filled with all manner of tender, loving words, the reading of which calls forth feelings that had lain dormant in my breast for years. I take one at random from the paquet, and open it. It is dated some months previous to her death. It reads:—
                  "I have missed you during the five long summer days that you have been up in the mountains, more than I care to let you know. How can you stay contentedly so long away from me? How can you remain alone so far in the forest? Are you not afraid? Do you know that I never go into the pine woods back of the house, by myself, without being terribly frightened? I am aware that it is very foolish in me, but positively I cannot help it. Of course I do not give way to my feelings, and run out into the sunshine, as I wish to do, but I actually stay there, sometimes for a quarter of an hour, and feel, of course, that there is a species of bravery evinced in my doing so. Only this morning, however, I thought I would walk there. And so, taking a book with me, I went. At first I quite enjoyed it. The aromatic fragrance the pines exhaled was more delicious to me than the patchouli Cousin Kate thinks so exquisite. I heard several woodpeckers tapping with their bills the trunks of the trees; and I think that I discovered an owl high up in one of the tallest pines, though I could not clearly decide whether it were one, or only a dead limb. Strangely enough, I did not see a single squirrel; but, now that I think of it, I suppose they are only to be found where acorns, or nuts, or something of the kind, grow.
                  "Well, after I had walked some distance, I sat down on an old log and endeavored to read, but I could not. It really appeared to me that the woods were full of shadows and spirits of some kind, I do not know what, I am sure, though you would be just wicked enough to say spirits of turpentine, but they were not such I am certain; and then the breeze, rising and falling in the trees, sounded so mournful that I just closed my book and run for home as fast as I could; of course I stayed there more than a quarter of an hour, though as I had no watch I cannot tell—perhaps it was longer. You would have laughed, I know, to have seen me running; my back comb came out, but I did not stop for it, and my hair all fell down upon my shoulders, and I never minded it a bit, but kept on running till I found myself once more in the dear old sunshine that comes down in the middle of the meadow. There I stopped, and laughed at myself for my fears. You know I am not in the least afraid when you are with me, and have passed hours there, and really enjoyed the dim light and the weird-like music the wind makes. When you return—and you'll come soon, won't you?—we will go to the pines and spend a whole day there, and I will show you the owl, if it be an owl, and has not flown away, and you shall find for me my comb. I shall send this to you by Old Joe, and I think you had better come back with him to-morrow, because he is such a foolish fellow that I am afraid he will get lost if he tries to return alone.'
                  I remember that I did go back with "Old Joe," and my coming, I am sure, made Alice very happy. The next day we went to the pines, and I found Alice's comb, but the owl turned out to be a dead and twisted branch. This was our last day together in the pines. We never went there afterwards, though we often walked in the middle of the meadow, where the "dear old sunshine" came down. Sweet Alice, your memory is dearer to me to-night than the love of either Musidora or my southern maid.
               
               
                  THE COMING OF SUMMER.
                  IT is almost summer now. The advancing month of roses is treading upon the departing skirts of May. Broadway is growing warmer each day, and its shady side is sought for with care. My southern maid writes to me that she will soon be coming north, while Musidora speaks vivaciously of an annual flight to the watering-places. I trust that the peerless one will have flitted before the damsel from the South arrives. I do not care to have them meet each other; and yet the meeting would be worth beholding. How the diamonds on Musidora's bosom would rise and fall! How the blue eyes would shoot forth scornful glances, and the delicate lips curl in disdain! How the stiff brocade would rustle as she swept forward to greet the southern stranger; and how chilling, yet formally polite, her words would be! And my little maid—with what a nonchalant air she would turn to meet Musidora, carelessly glancing at her through her curls, but how quickly she would falter beneath Musidora's gaze! How the orange-buds in her dark hair would seem ot pale before the glowing roses in Musidora's hand! How the warm heart beneath the silken corsage would flutter, and the Valenciennes lace, bordering the dainty chemisette, tremble! How the long lashes would slowly droop over the dark eyes, and damask blushes color the cheeks, and the pearly teeth show themselves through the quivering lips, until just as Musidora would be ready to exclaim to herself, "Silly child!" how that girlish, graceful form would rise up, as stately and queenly as even Musidora's, while the slippered feet which had been beating a cowardly measure would plant themselves firmly, the drooping lids would be quickly raised, and those full dark eyes would look into Musidora's face till the peerless one, blushing in spite of herself, would find to her own great surprise that the little girl from the South was reading her as readily as if she were a familiar page of music. But all this has not yet happened, and perhaps it never will. I hope that it will not.
                  It certainly is wonderful how often I encounter Musidora in my wanderings. Scarcely a sunny afternoon goes by that I do not somewhere meet her. Now it is on Broadway; then it is at Goupil's, or the National Academy, or at some matinée musicale: and these encounters are purely accidental, for we never make any appointments to meet. I went last week to the studio building, to look at the "Heart of the Andes," and I found Musidora alone and silent, seated before it apparently absorbed in the contemplation of its grandeur and beauty. She did not even turn to look on me as I entered. None of those sitting near would have thought that she had noticed my coming; but she had, and I knew it by the quick, nervous manner, unusual to her, with which she fluttered the pages of the "companion to the picture," which she held in her hand; besides, there was just the slightest vibration noticeable in the spray of diamonds bedded upon her bosom. Presently the pamphlet slid from her hand and fell upon the floor; then, and only then, she turned her head and looked at me in a way that clearly said, "See, my book has fallen at my feet; will you pick it up?" So I rose, and crossing the room, picked up the pamphlet, and seated myself beside her. Directly she asked how I knew that I was to find her there. I had no reply to make, save only that it was destiny that guided my steps. Then we talked about the picture, which we admired; and the black-walnut frame surrounding it, which we liked; and the scanty, green curtain hung upon the cornice, which we did not like. Somehow the green drapery reminded us of the delicate, emerald-tinted walls of a confectionery establishment on Broadway, where are produced such delicious creams and ices. "So refreshing," Musidora said, "to partake of in warm, summer-like days." And after one lingering glance at the picture, we departed, wending our steps slowly up Tenth Street towards Broadway. It was so cool and delightful at the saloon that we dallied away the remainder of the afternoon over cream and meringues, chatting all manner of pleasant gossip. I observed that the larger portion of the silks and laces present, as well as Musidora herself, chose "vanilla and strawberry." I asked Musidora why it was, and she answered that though she preferred the flavor of the vanilla, yet she "admired" the roseate hue of the strawberry. She called the former "prose," and the latter "poetry." For my part, as I watched Musidora making havoc with the strawberry cream, I fancied her an Oriental princess, partaking with a golden spoon of frozen pink chenille, prepared by a prince who loved her, disguised as a minstrel. When I told her this she smiled, and asked if I were the prince. I was tempted to say "Yes," but the thought of the little maid down South restrained me, and I replied gravely, "No; I think the prince is he who tore his gloves to bits at the Academy of Design." She blushed and shook her head; and though she moved her lips, no answer came.
                  Each afternoon now, I go, between four and five o'clock, with Musidora, to eat "pink chenille," and to look at the lovely faces—none lovelier than Musidora's, however—which gather at the saloon to discuss the fashions and partake of confectionery.
               
               
                  
                  FLITTING NORTHWARD.
                  THE peerless Musidora, gathering into an immense trunk her silken robes, her muslins, her laces, and all the charming paraphernalia of a woman's wardrobe, departed, with the unfolding of June's roses, upon her summer's round of travel. Her revered parent, the proprietor of the silver mine in Golconda, accompanied her. A little casket, containing diamonds and other precious stones set in gold, went with them. After her departure, Broadway, for a while, seemed robbed of its glory. Its sunny side fell into shadow, and its shady side grew dark as night. I became slightly misanthropic. I avoided places of amusement for two evenings. Then I sought for consolation at the opera. I knew that music had charms to soothe the savage breast; and I thought, moreover, that it might assuage the loneliness of mine. It did. I listened to the singing of Piccolomini, and the shadows were dispelled. I heard De Wilhorst, and the blue sky appeared. Parodi and Strakosch brought the sunshine, and when Cortesi came I had almost forgotten Musidora. I not only enjoyed the operas, but I experienced pleasure in looking at the array of charming women assembled to hear them. I beheld there Andalusian beauties, whose rounded arms were weighed down with heavy bands of gold; whose white shoulders gleamed through mantles of black and costly lace; and whose jeweled hands were skilled in the use of heart-shaped fans. I met Parisian demoiselles—arch, coquettish, and gay—robed in mode-colored satin and shrouded in a cloud of Valenciennes lace. I encountered English courtly dames—blondes, with white roses in their hair and pearls upon their brows, and who were clad in heavy brocades that rustled like the leaves on forest trees. I marked the beauty of the daughters of Italy, the liquid tones of their voices and the brilliancy of their complexions; I noticed young ladies from the country, bearing around them the fragrance of new-mown hay, sweet clover, and hepaticas—whose cheeks were stained with the juice of strawberries, and upon whose rounded bosoms reposed simple lilies of the valley. Though these opera beauties dazzled my eyes, they failed to touch my heart. And yet, after seeing them, I somehow forgot Musidora, and remembered once more my southern maid.
                  When, a week after Musidora's departure, I met the dancing youth, he appeared pleased to see me. "I am désolé," he said. "It seemed to me as if everybody went out of town when Musidora went. She was très charmante; and such a peerless creature!" Then he made a confidant of me, and confessed that he loved her; that he had actually buried himself, on her departure, for three whole days in the obscurity of his chamber, and had refused to be comforted. With the hope of overcoming his despondency, he had attended several sacred musical concerts, a meeting of the Hearth-stone Club, and an amateur theatrical performance. He had even gone down to Coney Island, where by a rigorous diet of clam-chowder, he had trusted to dispel the poignancy of his grief; but that had been of no avail, and he had returned to the city even more miserable than when he left it. He asked my advice as to what he should do. I thought that a series of evenings at Laura Keene's theatre, where the Sisters Gougenheim were playing, might be of service to him. Alas! he had been there, and although, while listening to "Adelaide and Joey," he had forgotten his troubles for a while, a cure was not effected. I confess I felt sorry for the youth, and as I, freed from the magnetism of Musidora's presence, dreamed no longer of her, I advised him to start immediately for West Point, where Musidora was sojourning. The effect my words wrought on him was magical. He cheered up on the instant. He would take the next train, but—and his brow clouded—he should have to wait for his trunks, which he had left at Coney Island, thinking, when he left there, that he might return; "but," he added, recovering his spirits, "I will just run into the most fashionable clothing establishment, purchase a few necessary garments, and be off, leaving my trunk to be sent on to me. "But, do you," he added, "think Musidora will be pleased to see me?" I told him certainly she would, and I believe she will; else why did she drop her handkerchief at the Academy? and why did she invariably blush when he appeared?
                  I might not have been so willing to advise Musidora's lover to seek her, were it not that my southern maid had actually arrived; that I had already walked with her up and down Broadway; that with her I had witnessed the fine acting of Cortesi; had listened to the Gougenheims; had wandered through the galleries in the National Academy of Design, and had heard her own sweet voice singing the very song which, on the first evening that I met her, six years ago, she sung, seated under the willows, down in the valley, to me and to her cousin Kate.
                  But not alone thoughts of my southern maid did her touching and simple melody recall. Another voice mingles with hers; another form stands before me, and hands—of which my maiden of the South has no knowledge—are clasped in mine with hers. Alice! my old, first dear love of long time ago, used to sing for me that same sweet song. The tears that dim my eyes, whenever the little maid from the land of magnolia blossoms breathes these words in music, spring from a deeper fount and from other causes than those of which she, in her childlike simplicity, dreams.
               
               
                  TOWN AND COUNTRY.
                  MUSIDORA, as I hear through the well-gloved youth, is flitting from place to place. At West Point she flirted desperately with the members of the graduating class of the Military Academy. Even the gallant commandant and his brother officers, it is said, were more or less interested in the peerless woman. She has drank of the waters at Saratoga, bathed in the ocean at Newport, fished at Lake George, climbed Mount Washington, danced at Sharon, sentimentalized at Trenton, and was rendered contemplative at Niagara. She has accomplished all this, and yet the season is not half gone. She is already sighing for new places and new faces. I think she will undertake the Adirondacks and Acadia before the summer is ended. Her cavalier, the dancing youth, writes me that a loan of a few hundred dollars would be acceptable to him. He has purchased a pair of cream-colored horses and a light carriage, which he has placed at Musidora's command, but the expense of keeping and transporting them from place to place, wherever Musidora goes, is defrayed by himself, and he really is surprised to find how much this costs him. He thinks, though that his love for the heiress of the silver mine in Golconda, and the loan he hopes to receive from me will enable him to get through the season in a becoming manner. I trust it will. As for my southern maid, she has been ruralizing for a few weeks in the country, on the banks of the Hudson, and within the shadow of the Catskills. She has not yet commenced the round of travel which her fashionable friends expect she will undertake. She has passed a very quiet life since the came North, and I think she has enjoyed it more than if she had been on the wing, like Musidora. She is employing her time very pleasantly, she says, in the charming spot where she is staying. The morning rambles in the woods, the afternoon drives over well-kept roads, and the moonlight sails on the river, are things she especially delights in. Even rainy days she is busy with matters which are of much interest to her. At such times, when I visit her, I find her with her cousins—two charming girls—surrounded with silks, and lawns, and laces, while her fingers are employed in making marvelously pretty and mysteriously bewitching garments, the like of which I have never seen, and which, the moment I make my appearance, vanish from sight. Of course this is most provoking, and it vexes me, but I do not let it be seen. By and by, however, when I take a book to read aloud, and am supposed to be deeply absorbed in it, these mysteriously-put-away articles are quietly produced, and unwittingly displayed before me. I never gaze upon them, however, but read on, unconscious of their presence. My little maid, at such times, arrayed in a simple-fashioned India-muslin, and plying her needle, is a charming picture to look upon, and I enjoy the sight exceedingly. But, for all this, I wish that the silks, and the lawns, and the laces, and the linens, and the cambrics were finished, though I understand that they will not be before September. I wish it were September now. I think there is no month in the year more pleasant. What a capital time it is for travelling! Perhaps I shall make a little tour then with my southern maid. I wonder if Musidora would be pleased to meet us! I confess I have doubts as to that.
                  Sometimes I spend a few days in the country with my southern maid, though the country itself is not to my liking. I prefer the city. I do not like to be aroused from my morning's sleep by the noise of crowing cocks and clucking hens, quacking ducks and cackling geese. I object seriously to listening to the lugubrious cry of young calves and the frenzied lowing of their mothers. I experience no pleasure in getting up of mornings to see the sun rise, not take delight in walking up hill and down vale, through long and tangled grasses, wet, very wet, with the last night's dew. A rainy day in the country is my especial abhorrence; there are no avenue rail-cars, no lines of omnibuses, no hackney-coaches running into the orchard where the harvest apples are ripening; or through the lanes, on either side of which the cherries are rosy red; or over the hills and far away, where the strawberries are blushing and hiding beneath their leaves. You can't obtain these specialities in the country of a rainy day, unless you are willing to undergo a shower-bath from the trees while gathering the apples and cherries, or a foot-bath while picking the berries. But in the city, whether it be rainy or not, you can always—in their season—obtain these luxuries at Washington Market, and in far better preservation and freshness than you can in the country. In the city you can always find a shady side, somewhere, to walk on. Between the Battery and Central Park there are greener spots than you can anywhere else discover. I know that there are plenty of black spots, too, but these exist, also, wherever man is to be found, whether in town or country. I am always glad, therefore to get away from the hot, exposed roads of the country, and return to the cool, shaded streets of the city. I see more wonderful and beautiful things displayed in the windows of Broadway, as I pass through it, after coming back, than I have seen in all the time of my absence. As I wend my course up Broadway, I notice a crowd of loungers around Goupil's windows, gazing upon the engravings and paintings there displayed. Prominent among the pictures is the "Descent from the Cross," after Rubens, by Van Bree, one of the most touching and wonderful delineations of the scene at Mount Calvary ever placed upon the canvas. Not far from this picture is "Columbus at Salamanca," the original by Professor Weir—a noble and effective historical work. There are also two originals by Feuchsel, an artist of the Dusseldorf school, who is at present a resident of this city, entitled "Moonrise on the Danube," and "Sunset on the Catskills." A "Pasturage," by Dupree, is a picture of rural life treated with the cool, silvery coloring which characterizes this clever artist's works, and that is so refreshing to look upon of a warm, sultry afternoon. If the adjoining window is less attractive to me, it at least is not less gay in point of coloring, and, perhaps, even more interesting to my southern maid. The black coats are clustered around Goupil's, but the crinolines gather about Stewart's. There, when I stopped the other day, with my magnolia blossom, she beheld fabrics which interested her more than the pictures. "Organdies, silks, and muslins," she said, "of the latest styles, as artistically displayed as if arranged by the hands of the artists whose paintings adorn the adjoining casement; bareges and lawns apparently as zephyr-like as the tinted clouds that float above the horizon at sunset."
                  As I was not able to gainsay this, I replied, "Certainly; and destined, Orange-bud, to wrap in their soft folds the graceful forms of southern beauties like yourself, and northern belles like Musidora."
               
               
                  MUSIDORA'S RETURN.
                  MUSIDORA has again made he appearance on Broadway. Only, however, on shopping purposes intent. She has not come back to town to stay. The season is not quite over in the country yet; but, having decided to change the base of the matrimonial operations from Schooley's Mountains, where she engaged in a series of brilliant flirtation skirmishes, for the past month, with a score of dashing young military officers, who have been summering it at the Heath House, but who have lately been recalled to their respective commands, she, before removing to her new headquarters at West Point, where she expects to avail herself of General Scott's able counsel, has resolved to pass the early September in town to recruit her demoralized wardrobe. Clambering over rocks, while blackberrying at Schooley's Mountains, is trying to laces, flounces, and gaiters, and Musidora, who goes into the country to enjoy herself out of doors, has so completely used up her summer dresses as to leave her with "nothing to wear and compelled her to draw upon the silver mine, which her father still owns in Golconda, for means to enable her to refit her exhausted wardrobe. Therefore it is that the peerless Musidora, one breathless day in August, came back to town, and was seen by me walking on the shady side of Broadway, with a silkened moustached youth, who sported a pair of new shoulder-straps, and carried a slender sword at his side. They went into Maillard's for an ice, and I followed them. The peerless one pretended that she did not see me, but whenever I caught her eye in the mirror, which was opposite, the long lashes drooped and the warm blood mounted to her cheek.
                  
                  When a man parts with a woman he really loves, in anger, and the fault is his, not hers, he is very likely to feel wonderfully penitent and tender-hearted toward her when they next meet. If, however, when he encounters her she is engaged in encouraging the advances of a rival, bestowing honeyed words and sweet smiles upon him, while he is utterly unconscious of being watched by one who deems be has a prior claim upon the affections of the siren, and therefore revels, as it were, in an elysium of love, showing it by his attentions and manners to her, the old lover is very apt to grow vindictive, and roll under his tongue, like sweet morsels, bitterest words of vengeance. Of course it would not be in good taste for him to utter these expressions aloud, so he keeps them smothered within his own breast, and contents himself with watching, as I did, the two objects of his anger.
                  What the silken moustached captain, who ought to have been with his regiment, could find to say of such an amusing character as to keep Musidora laughing as merrily as she did, during the hour they lingered over the marble slab at Maillard's, I cannot imagine. Possibly he was telling her of his adventures among the orange-blossom maidens of Richmond, where he had been a prisoner, or of his love escapades with the belles of Saratoga, whither he had gone after his release. Whatever the subjects were, she, at least, appeared to be amused. Appeared, I say, for I doubt if she were; and her laugh was, now that I recall it, rather hysterical than merry. I question, indeed, if a woman can be perfectly happy when an old lover sits within ten paces of her, watching her every movement as a cat would a mouse, and ready to spring upon her companion ni he should give him the least excuse for so doing.
                  I never knew Musidora to be so long before in disposing of an ice as she was that afternoon. It really seemed to me as if she would never eat the last spoonful. I found, for my part, when I went to pay the plump little black-eyed French woman who presides at the comptoir, that I had swallowed three ices, two plates of cake, and a sherry cobbler, whilst watching the two silly ones.
                  Of course, as I knew she would, when Musidora came to leave, she dropped behind the shoulder-straps a few steps, and as she passed me, stopped and whispered, "Naughty one! come and see me at nine this evening." And then she swept majestically down the aisle, and went out into Broadway again with her military friend. My eyes followed her until she disappeared, and then I took up her handkerchief, which she had carelessly dropped upon my knees, and thrust it into my bosom. It was scented with her favorite perfume,—lily of the valley,—though the stately carnation, with its spicy, intoxicating odor, would be a more appropriate perfume for the peerless one to use.
               
               
                  
                  MUSIDORA AND MY SOUTHERN LOVE.
                  FOR several months past I have avoided Musidora. When I have encountered her on Broadway of sunny afternoons, or on Sundays, in Fifth Avenue, as she came from church, I have simply greeted her with a formal bow, and passed on. As for her recognition of me, it was, apparently, of the feeblest and most frigid description. The slightest inclination of the head was all she outwardly accorded to me. The effort it cost her to accomplish this feat in the manner she desired was perfectly transparent to me. She seemed intuitively to be aware that I was approaching long before I met her, though she never once lifted her eyes to look for me; but I knew it by the greater dignity of her carriage, the queenly manner in which she carried her Juno-like head, the heightened color of her cheek, and the tone of her voice—raised nearly an octave higher than was natural—in addressing her companion, who not seldom proved to be her friend of the violet-colored kids. The last time I passed her on the avenue she did not deign to look at me, though she dropped at my feet, as I went by, a red rose-bud, which I picked up and carefully carried home. I placed the bud in a wine-glass, which I stood on a little stand at the head of my couch, and its fragrance exerted a powerful influence, keeping me awake the entire night. There must have been some kind of magnetism in the rose, for it acted like a charm on me. I forgot, during those hours of sleeplessness, that there was any other woman in the world than Musidora. She alone appeared to fill the universe. The clocks of the neighborhood, as they struck the hours, uttered her name. If I closed my eyes, in seemed as though a soft hand brushed back the hair from my forehead, and a warm breath (Musidora's) fell on my cheek. The air of my chamber was heavy with the perfume of the rose beside me.
                  For days thereafter, I strove in vain to dispel the enchantment Musidora had thrown around me. I cast the rose into the blazing grate, and saw it shrivel and consume in the fire. I experienced a pang of anguish as I watched it disappear, for it seemed almost as if it were a part of the peerless one herself—her heart, for instance. I could not overcome this feeling. It clung to me like a night-mare. Had I, through some mysterious and spiritual agency, unknowingly deprived Musidora of life? I asked myself this question many times without being able to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion. I perceived the absurdity of the idea, but had no power to dispel the illusion. The more I thought about it, with the incense of the rose filling the room, the stronger grew the impression that I was guilty of a crime. At last I went forth, resolved to learn whether Musidora were living or dead.
                  As I approached the residence of the gentleman—Musidora's papa—who owns a silver mine in Golconda, a carriage drove up to the door. My heart beat fast, for I thought it contained a physician, and that Musidora was ill or dying. The next moment a pair of little gaiter boots, surmounted by most exquisitely turned ankles, stepped from the carriage, passed daintily across the flagging, went up the marble steps and into the house. I do not know if the owner of those ankles observed me or not, for I never raised my eyes, though I returned to my rooms perfectly satisfied that Musidora was still a resident of this planet, and wore costly furs, and diamonds, and laces, and the most immaculate of ruffled underskirts.
                  But more than ever the thought of the peerless one possessed me. My chamber was filled with the perfume of the martyred rosebud. I could not expel it, though I placed some orange-flowers in the glass that had held the rose. It availed nothing—the rose overpowered the scent of the oranges. I sought to cast Musidora from my mind; I read a score of letters written by my southern maid; I placed her miniature on the table before me. I hummed her favorite songs; I recalled the hours I had passed beside her; I pinned a small pearl cross, which she had given me, on my cravat,—but all were useless; so I threw the orange-buds into the fire, returned the letters to my desk, and replaced the pearl cross within nits ebony box. Then I went where I knew I should meet Musidora, and I found her whirling in a waltz with the youth in the violet kids. It would have yielded me immeasurable satisfaction to have tripped up that young fellow, but I didn't do it; and it was, perhaps, as well that I did not. It would, doubtless, have caused a commotion, and the ball-room of the Metropolitan Hotel is not a desirable place for one. I do not know if Musidora noticed my entrance; but at all events, when she reached that part of the room where I was standing, she pleaded weariness, and was conducted by her partner to a chair me. When I approached her a few moments afterward, she appeared to be surprised to see me, and said she was not aware that I ever attended "hops."
                  "But that I hoped to meet you, Musidora," I answered "I should bot be here."
                  The color rose to her cheeks, though she answered not, and only signified, by rising and taking my arm, her desire to go from the ball-room. So we went into one of the parlors, where, half-hidden by the folds of a window curtain, we talked a deal of gossip, and I uttered some things which it would not have pleased my southern maid to hear. My orange-blossom was far away, I thought; not was I prepared to encounter, just as I was leaving the room with Musidora, the very maiden who, of all others, I at that moment the least desired to meet. Although the two had never before met, each instinctively knew the other, and there was an unnatural formality in their greeting when I introduced them, which, under most any other circumstances, would have amused me. As it was, however, I felt as if surrounded by bomb-shells, the immediate explosion of which was imminent. Even old black "mammy," who always accompanies her young mistress wherever she goes, looked daggers at me and bayonets at Musidora. Most fortunately, at this moment the youth the violet kids made his appearance, and claiming Musidora's hand for the next dance, led her away.
                  Conducting my southern maid to a sofa—not the one, however, still warm with the memory of Musidora—and seating myself beside her, I prepared to listen to words of upbraiding; but none were uttered. She simply said that her unexpected arrival had, perhaps, disturbed a pleasant tête-à-tête. But I assured her the meeting was almost accidental, and that it had been several months since I had before spoken to Musidora.
                  Then I narrated to my little maid the story of the enchantment to which I had been subjected. How I had been magnetized, as it were, by the perfume of the rose; how I had cast it into the fire, and felt that in thus doing I had destroyed Musidora; but I said nothing—for why should I?—of my throwing the orange-buds into the fire, nor of the glimpse I had of gaiter boots and rounded ankles.
                  My southern maid said little in reply, but she looked as if her happiness and mind were running fearful risks. But in her presence I feel safe, nor have any thought for Musidora. I watched her, with my southern maid clinging to my arm, whirling in the waltz, and I wondered why I should for a single moment have risked my happiness, by thinking of her otherwise than as a proud, cold-hearted dame, who gloried in her diamonds and her beauty.
                  "Ah," I said, "the roses of the North, my little one, fade before the orange-flowers of the South."

                  THE UNION YOUNG LADY.
                  THE "Union" young lady is generally the descendant of a Revolutionary hero. Possibly her great-grandsire was one of the singers of the Declaration of Independence. At all events, patriotic blood runs in her veins, and a love of country fills her breast. Her father, who is a little past his prime, and therefore unable to shoulder to musket, is not unusually the chairman of a war committee, and has the reputation of making speeches which breathe the very spirit of true patriotism. She has brothers in the Union army, besides a "cousin," who is a staff officer, and whose name has been favorably mentioned in the dispatches of his commanding general. To say that she is attached to her "cousin," would not be libeling her affections. This attachment has existed between them for a number of years, and will probably he consummated by marriage. She reads aloud the daily newspapers, at the breakfast-table, to her father, as she pours out for him his coffee. It is to the war news she first turns. After there has been a battle, she glances silently over the list of killed and wounded before beginning to read. As long as she does not see his name in it, she manages, although her eyes may be dim with tears, to read in a manner satisfactory to her father, the account of the battle. She is a brave girl, although she sometimes cannot refrain from weeping over the records of suffering which the papers contain.
                  
                  For her cousin's sake, she is learning army phrases, and employs them on all possible occasions. During the summer she took her "ration" of ice-cream regularly each evening at Maillard's. She "goes into camp" when she visits the Central Park Saturday afternoons to hear the "band" play, and retires in good order to her "quarters," in her father's house, when the "review" in the park is over.
                  She calls the habitués of Broadway the "army of occupation," and declares that they are ever "marching and countermarching, without advancing their lines." Her letters addressed to her cousin, she terms "special orders," and numbers each as she "issues" it. She thinks seriously of publishing "proclamation" freeing her train of admirers from longer paying their addresses to her. She talks about raising an Amazonian regiment, and says of every tall woman whom she encounters, "what a splendid grenadier she would make." She is much given to visiting the soldiers in the hospitals, and carries a little basket on her arm, containing farina and wine jelly, carefully covered with a damask napkin. She would like to be a nurse and imitate Florence Nightingale in deeds of charity; but her father wishes her to remain home and car for him, which deters her from offering her services to the Sanitary Commission.
                  One of her chief employments is making link. In the prosecution of this most worthy task, she seizes upon all the linen garments she can lay her hands on, and the result is that her father has several times found himself quite short of—shirts. Then, too, she makes countless rolls of bandages, for which purpose she buys sheeting by the piece, much to the annoyance of her father, who has to pay for it. Her "fancy work" is embroidering presentation flags for departing regiments, and quilting a "Union quilt," formed of red, white, and blue silk; but as she refuses to disclose the name of the happy individual who is destined to sleep under it, we will not seek to penetrate the secret.
                  The Union young lady crowds the mantel-pieces of her home with Roger's statuettes illustrative of camp life and others incident to the war. She also has a season ticket of Lang's picture, "The Reception of the Sixty-ninth Irish Regiment," now on exhibition. She has a photographic album, filled with portraits of Union generals, and three or four of the prominent Rebel leaders, the latter of which, to evince her dislike of them, she has placed upside down. She plays patriotic marches and quicksteps on her piano, and sings to its acompaniment patriotic songs. "The Flag of our Union" is her favorite, though she does not refuse to sing "Hail Columbia" and the "Star Spangled Banner." Although not an accomplished French scholar she has yet read in the original, Count de Gasparin's "L'Amérique devant l'Europe," and express herself as being well pleased with his style. Every fair day she raises with her own hands the "Stars and Stripes" on the flat-staff which she had planted in the court-yard of her residence, and quotes portions of Drake's "American Flag," as she flings it to the breeze.
                  She goes to the play, and applauds those passages which relate to putting down rebellions, or can be construed as bearing upon the times. She keeps fresh in her heart the memories of the gallant dead who have fallen in battle, and holds in peculiar reverence the names of Ellsworth, Winthrop, and O'Brien. She considers it her duty to witness the funeral pageants of all soldiers whose bodies are brought home for burial, and sends myrtle wreaths with which to deck their coffins. Without desiring to provoke argument, she yet at every opportunity expresses her belief in the practicability of "marching on Richmond" and taking it. Finally, to prove her devotion to the Union, she has pledged herself to united her destinies, at the close of the war, with those of her cousin's, and thus "go in for Union to a man."
               
               
                  
                  FIFTH AVENUE BEAUTY.
                  THE Fifth Avenue beauty is generally an exotic. She is seldom to the Avenue born, but is transplanted from one of the side-streets in early life. She may have been regarded as a native violet in her infancy, when she lived in the red brick house, with its green Venetian blinds; but, under the plate-glass of the brown-stone front, where she now dwells, she has expanded into a japonica. Like that flower, too, she is fair to look upon; but it is a waxen kind of fairness which soon fades. As a usual thing, her health is delicate; yet she endures, night after night, when the season is gay, such dissipations as would ruin many a stronger constitution than she possesses. She is always pale, and blue veins show their tracery on her temples. Her hands are semi-transparent, and her fingers slim and tapering. The shape of her nails is in the highest degree aristocratic; or, at least it ought to be. The mantua-maker has much to do with getting up her figure, and the individual who deals in cosmetics is responsible for her complexion.
                  In the childish years, a bonne—sometimes her name is Natalie, sometimes Bridget—who wears a white cap and has little ruffled pockets in her apron, guides her steps and feeds her on sweet chocolate. Her girlhood is indulged in the luxury of a French governess, who reads French novels of a—well, of a trashy character, and teaches her pupil all sorts of toilet mysteries.
                  She finishes her education at a fashionable boarding-school, where she learns every necessary accomplishment, and then "comes out" at a ball, given in honor of her attaining her "happiest birthday." She falls in love, on this occasion only, with several very nice young men, whom she forgets in the course of the season.
                  Her father, who has an office in Wall Street, speculates in stocks, and is "well up" in Coupons, Fives, Sixes, and Demand Notes. He is interested in a silver mine in Golconda, and is always "getting a bill through the House," which is certain, when passed, to prove of immense benefit to him. The Beauty, knowing his great resources, draws largely upon the contents of his pocket-book, to enable her to make a sensation in the world. She delights in costly silks, velvets, and laces, and thinks it the "proper thing" to have a full set of laces, which is a fac-simile of the worn by her Royal Highness the Princess Adeline at her marriage. It is a much more proper thing for her to be able to say that her lace collar, yellow and smoky as it looks, did once actually belong to the late Empress of Austria. Delcroix, who deals in these articles, answers for its genuineness. She is also extravagant in the matter of shawls, scarfs, and handkerchiefs, and the "marble palace merchant" is constantly sending out, on her account, special orders to India for shawls, to Rome for scarfs, and to Paris for mouchoirs.
                  
                  The jewelry store of Tiffinani is especially patronized by her, and our Wall Street friend often makes over the yearly proceeds of his Golconda mine, in solid ingots, to pay for the Beauty's purchases. Diamonds are her failing. They sparkle on her fingers, her arms, he brow, and amidst her hair; they are pendent from her ears, and rise and fall upon her swelling bosom. At the ball give to the Prince of Wales she wore them for the first time on her stain slippers, and thereby set off her dainty feet and tapering ankles to great advantage. She does not thus dazzle the weak eyes of dancing men, except on rare occasions; but when she does there are those who prize these slippers more than the prince in the fairy story did the ones which Cinderella wore. She dances the German with much spirit, although she prefers to it, or any dance indeed, a quiet tête-à-tête, on a moonlighted balcony, with a gallant Romeo. At present staff officers are in favor. She likes to converse about books and pictures, and thinks poets and painters "nice people to know." She affects the Italian opera, where "Golconda" has a private box, and talks charmingly of Verdi, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, and their compositions. She plays Hebrew melodies languidly on the harp, and drops, like pearls, patriotic airs from her Erard. Gottschalk is her musical adoration, and Susini her operatic king.
                  Sexton Brown is the first to greet her both at church and at parties. Her prayer-book is bound in "Gothic style," and the rubric is printed in red. It is also illuminated. She observes all the holy days with scrupulous fidelity, yet sometimes cannot avoid wishing that the forty days of Lent might be cut down to half the number. She pins her "camel's hair" with a diamond cross, and has conscientious scruples in regard to attending St. George's. If, on the other hand, she is a "Dissenter," she utterly ignores all saints and holy days, and even the Lenten time; but takes kindly to Thanksgiving and Fast days, if appointed by the governor.
                  The Beauty likes to ride in her carriage, with driver and footman in livery, and with horses wearing gold-mounted harness, to attract, by her display of furs in winter, and costly laces in summer, the attention of promenaders and equestrians. The Central Park is her choicest drive, and late in the afternoon the fashionable hour for going there. She is in her element when, reclining in her carriage, she has half a dozen cavaliers on horseback, vying with each other in paying her attentions as they ride beside her, and complimenting her upon her own beauty, and the elegance of her "turn-out."
                  She reads "Les Misérables" in the original, while her French maid combs her back hair, looking over her mistress' shoulder all the while, and quite as much interested in the story. "Once a Month" is her æsthetic magazine, and the "Home Journal" her favorite weekly. Her library is chosen with an eye more, perhaps, to handsome bindings than to literary merit; but, nevertheless, many good books have crept into it, which she reads with due appreciation. She possesses a pretty gallery of pictures and statuary, and sometimes a small cabinet of shells and minerals. Her collection of bijouterie and articles of vertu is almost marvelous, and has evidently been gathered from every country in the world.
                  She likes flowers, and raises hyacinths and jonquils in water glasses in the winter season, and her admirers supply her with bouquets of rare and odorous flowers all the year round. She owns a King Charles spaniel, or an Italian greyhound, which is supplied with a silver collar to wear about its neck, a silver plate to eat from, and a chenille rug to sleep on. She pets him abominably, and usually kills him through mistaken kindness within a year. She goes out of the city in the summer, and visits all of the watering-places and fashionable summer resorts. She values Newport for its surf, Saratoga for its waters, and Schooley's Mountain for its breezes. She thinks it highly improper to return to town before the middle of October, and is rarely seen in Fifth Avenue earlier than that date. If circumstances compel her to come back before, she immures herself until that day within the walls of her "palatial mansion." She is partial to late suppers, and after attending the opera generally visits the Maison d'argent, or Delmonico's, where she partakes of English snipe or other game, and sips a glass of "golden wedding" champagne. She goes home in good spirits, and rises the next day at noon with a headache. Finally, she marries for love and money—especially the latter—and goes to Europe on her bridal tour. When, after a year or two, she comes back, she is received as a brilliant leader of fashion, and reigns with queenly grace for a few seasons, when she gracefully subsides into a matron, and, in time, comes out as a dowager with marriageable daughters.
               
               
                  
                  THE SECESSION FEMALE.
                  THE female Secessionist is not, necessarily, a Southerner either by birth or education. Indeed, the most violent of the class, those who regard the old Union with the greatest disfavor, are invariably from the North. These have married Southerners, and, as if the more thoroughly to prove their regard for the State of their adoption, never fail to bitterly denounce the State of their birth. They utterly repudiate pumpkin pies and Thanksgiving time, and heartily detest their quondam friends and neighbors, the tin peddlers, Abolitionists, and school-masters of Yankee land. These, too, are they who trample on the old flag, who flaunt their silk skirts at our soldiery, and snap their fingers at our brigadier-generals. They pretend, moreover that they would no longer eat New England apples, even if they could get them; but much prefer the oranges of the South both for pies and "sauce." They turn a cold shoulder upon Wenham ice, and will persist in believing that cotton is king. Some of them have, in the Northern army, fathers and brothers, upon whose heads, morning and evening, they call down curses instead of blessings. They have cast aside their industry and Puritanism, and taken kindly to sloth and slavery. They no longer speak exultingly of the May-flower, in which their ancestors came over; but of the iron-clad Merrimac, which run down our ships of war. The Moloch of their childhood has become the God of their maturity, and the God of their childhood the Moloch of their age. So much for the female Secessionists of New England birth.
                  The native born Secession damsel of Dixie is a much honester and more consistent female. She is suckled by a "contraband," and brought up on oranges and sugar-cane. She is instructed in political economy from her cradle, and taught to believe in State rights and Southern blood. She regards it as dishonorable to labor with her hands, and does not consider it necessary to do too much at it with her mind. She thinks fine feathers make fine birds, and considers the parrot superior to the robin. She believes slavery to be a Christian institution, and is prepared to prove it by quotations from the Bible. She looks on the Rebellion as sacred in its character, and finds its parallel in the Revolution of '76. The South is fighting for home, liberty, and rights. Our forefathers, she says, did no more. She writes startling articles for the Southern press, and is fond of "pitching into Butler." She would like to crucify Abraham Lincoln, not so much for what he has as for what he has not done. If, she pertinently asks, he is so desirous of saving the Union, why not extend the "institution" over the whole land, instead of seeking to abolish it? In her judgement, this would be the proper course to adopt, and then she thinks the Union would be preserved.
                  The Session damsel is generally a brunette, and, according to a Southerm poet,— 
                        
                           "Has violet eyes,
                           With rose-leaf lips of red;"—
                        
                      and has, moreover, the supernatural habit of wearing,— 
                        
                           "The moonshine round her neck,
                           The sunshine round her head."
                        
                     
                  
                  She delights in gay colors, and adorns her person with little rosettes of red and blue. She talks vauntingly about the "Stars and Bars." and promises herself the satisfaction of seeing them one day wave over the White House at Washington. She thinks "Rebellion" a nice game to play, and has a high esteem for Jefferson Davis, whose name she mentions in her daily prayers. In Stonewall Jackson she sees chivalry personified, and "Stuart, of the Raids," is her beau-ideal of a chivalry officer. She has several brothers in the army, whom she warns not to come home so long as the war lasts, unless they are brought thither either dead or wounded. She is very much in earnest, and don't believe in their army going into winter-quarters, unless it can locate itself in the neighborhood of Philadelphia or New York. She has given up her jewelry to aid the "cause of her down-trodden country." and taken Confederate notes at par in payment. She writes fierce letters to her former friends in the North, via Havana, in which she wildly declares that— 
                        
                           "You can never put us down, no never,
                           Though we perish in the track of our endeavor,"—
                        
                      whatever that may be, and more to the same purport. Although she declares that she owes no allegiance to the United States, it is worthy of notice that in New Orleans she has recently given in her adherence to the old Union This looks encouraging, and there seems to be hope that ultimately she will, wherever found, came back to her loving mother. She ever was a perverse damsel, and liked to have her own way; but she has a good heart, and though she is partial just at present to flirtations with French counts and English noblemen, it will all end by her returning to her Northern lover, and wedding him. The palmetto will yet flourish beside the pine, and the orange-blossom of the South mingle its fragrance with the glowing roses of the North.
               
               
                  THE BROADWAY BELLE.
                  THE Broadway belle is invariably a New Yorker by birth. Although she may not belong to a good old Knickerbocker family, she by no means is a parvenue. There have been city aldermen in her family for two or three generations back, and she has brothers who hold lucrative posts in the Custom House. If she did not graduate with honor at the "Rutgers" or "Springler," it was doubtless because her health would not permit of her applying herself as assiduously as was necessary to the prescribed course of study required in those institutions, to enable her so to do. She is never, by any chance, other than eighteen years of age. She may be a blonde or a brunette, but she always is stylish. She is wonderfully self-possessed, and does not allow the impertinent staring of the loungers about the doors of the hotels to annoy her in the least. By dropping her veil, or skillfully handling her parasol, she effectually prevents these terrible fellows from getting even a passing glimpse of her face.
                  She prides herself on being the first to wear the earliest new bonnet, and has a special arrangement with her milliner whereby she is enabled to appear in one at church on the Sunday previous to the regular "opening day." Of course she is the envy of all the rest of the female portion of the congregation, who curl their lips at her as often as they lift up their hearts in prayer. She bears their scorn, however, with Christian meekness, for she knows she has done the proper thing. She dresses richly, and much affects moires and flounced silks; but is apt to violate good taste through a partiality for strong colors. She is also slightly inclined toward the jewelry department, and crowds her fingers with rings which are not always formed of precious stones, while her swelling bosom is weighed down by gold chains and brooches.
                  She dwells in the neighborhood of Union Square, within a short distance of her favorite promenade. Twice a day she may be seen on Broadway. In the morning she goes out, ostensibly to do some shopping, going down by omnibus as far as Stewart's, where she buys a pair of gloves; and then returning home on foot, by easy stages as it were, stopping at sundry dry-goods stores, purchasing a ribbon here, and a skein of silk there, and such like trifles, until she reaches Maillard's, where she drops in for "lunch." In the afternoon, magnificently attired, she takes her regular promenade, going down, however, only as far as Canal Street, where, if it be a warm day, she goes into the corner drug store for soda-water. She usually times her walk so as to encounter some one of her numerous admirers returning from business, who thereupon accompanies her up Broadway. Sometimes they stop in at the Dusseldorf, or other gallery, for a half hour's look at the pictures. Not that she knows much about art, but she thinks it fashionable to affect an admiration for pictures, and as she used herself to paint fruit and flower pieces, in water-colors, when a pupil at "the Institute," it is only natural she should possess a taste for landscapes and other paintings.
                  In the evening she generally visits a theatre. She regards Wallack's as the most "genteel," and Lester Wallack as not only the handsomest but the "nicest" of living actors. She talks pathetically of "dear, old Burton," and wonders if she shall ever see his like again. Forrest she considers "immense," and alludes to Blake as "that droll old soul." She has a tenderness for Hackett as Sir John Falstaff, and declares that if she had been one of the merry wives she would not have treated the fat knight so cruelly. She thinks it's a fine thing to know by sight the actors "off the stage," and is constantly interrupting the pretty speeches of those of her admirers who may be walking with her, by pointing out, with exclamations of delight, any "star" who may chance to pass. She once had a desire to go on the stage, and actually learned by heart the balcony scene in "Romeo and Juliet," and enacted it one evening in summer in her father's back-yard, assisted by her Cousin John, much to the edification of the neighbors in the adjoining houses. When she ventured to propose her plans to her father, he vetoed the matter so demonstratively that she was glad to drop the subject, and never referred to it again, except confidentially, to half-a-dozen of her intimate friends, as an event which "might have been." She is invariably one of the lady patronesses of the "hops" given at the hotels during the winter months. The Broadway belle seldom makes any long journey from the city. Even in summer time she contents herself with brief trips to Coney Island, or Rockaway, or Long Branch, and then never remains away longer than a week. Broadway is her alma mater—at least that part of it is, which lies between the Park and Union Square. Occasionally she rides on horseback through the Central Park, but she likes to wind up her afternoon's equestrianism by a canter down Broadway. The risk to life and limb on these occasions is so great, that her terrified attendant never invites her to ride again.
                  On gala days, when Broadway is gay with waving banners, and noisy with brass bands, and some prince, or president, or general, or whoever he may be, is being received, presented with the freedom of the city—whatever that may be—and marched through the hot sunshine of the great thoroughfare, the Broadway belle is in her element. Seated in a balcony on the shady side of the street, she will wait patiently for hours for the hero to make his appearance, chatting gayly with her beaux, and eating large amounts of confectionery, with which her pocket is always filled. Her particular failing is chocolate carêmes, which she buys by the pound, and is ever eating,—at church, in the theatre, at home, and on the street. On grant occasions, like the present, she lays in an extra supply, so as to have a handful to throw, together with the bouquet, which she carries like a wand, into the carriage of the great man as he rides past. When, at last he comes, and those around clap their hands till they are blistered, and shout themselves hoarse, she contents herself with waving her handkerchief, and smiling prettily down on him, while one of her cavaliers tosses the flowers to him, and another showers him with carêmes.
                  Her reading is somewhat limited in its amount, owing to her greater predilection for walking, which occupies her time. Still she has her library, small to be sure, but not badly chosen, from which she selects her reading, whenever the weather compels her to remain within doors. She likes books of plays. Bulwer's "Lady of Lyons" is her especial favorite. Her daily newspaper is the "Herald," her weekly journal the "Ledger," her monthly "Harper's Magazine," and "Frank Leslie's" her pictorial. It would be an injustice to her to omit naming the Bible as among her collection. Perhaps she reads it more than she does any other book; let us trust she does.
                  It is the Broadway belle who astonishes the other promenaders with the first spring hat, with the first sunshade, and the first violets of the season. She is the last to assume her furs in the autumn, and the last to let a wintry storm keep her from promenade. If the flag-stones could reveal it, they might, every one of them, show the impression of her dainty little feet, and give the exact dimensions of her tapering ankles, which they have seen so many thousand times. They could tell when she has passed over them in joy, and when in sorrow; when, alas! in anger, and when in peace with all the world. All these moods the movements of her feet have chronicled as she walked on; and when the flags no longer resound to her accustomed tread, then all the world will say Broadway is not Broadway without the Broadway Belle.
