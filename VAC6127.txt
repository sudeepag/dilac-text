               CHAPTER I.
               THE LAST FORMULA.
               "Dust to dust and ashes to ashes," repeated the officiating clergyman, as he stood
                  at the foot of an open grave, where the last mortal remains of Jules De Vaughn had
                  just been placed to rest forever.
               The clods rattled upon the coffin boards. The men relieved each other by turns at
                  filling in the earth until the grave was closed.
               "Man that is born of a woman," repeated the clergyman, "is of few days and full of
                  trouble. He cometh forth as a flower and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow
                  and continueth not. Turn from, him that he may rest, till he shall accomplish as
                  an hireling his day. For there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will
                  sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. Though the root
                  thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground, yet through
                  the scent of water it will bud and bring forth like a plant. But man dieth and
                  wasteth away; yea, man giveth up the ghost and where is he? As the waters fail
                  from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up, so man lieth down, and riseth
                  not; till the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised out of their
                  sleep."
               All was over.
               It was an unpretending funeral. The hearse, one carriage for Rose, the only child
                  and surviving relative of the deceased, and one taken by some sympathizing
                  neighbors, together with a few stragglers who had fallen in from sheer
                  listlessness or a want of anything to occupy their time, made up the
                  procession.
               This little company, assembled to witness these final ceremonies, dispersed to
                  their homes, their pursuits and their pleasures. Jules DeVaughn, the artist, had
                  been buried; that was all; and the little world that knew him at once forgot
                  him.
               But Rose did not forget. She gave no expression in sobs and tears to the
                  overwhelming grief that bore her young soul to the earth. Mute, calm, and pale as
                  the marble slabs around her, she sought her home that chill and dreary afternoon,
                  through the fitful wind moaning about her and floating down the yellow leaves of
                  autumn.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               Rose.
               Rose DeVaughn was now left alone without a friend in the world to whom she which
                  would add a little to her scanty stock of funds. But after this was exhausted,
                  what then? The lilies of the field toil not, neither do they spin; the happy
                  sparrows chirrup the live long day, and are always sure to find their food. But
                  Rose was neither a lily or a sparrow; she was a friendless girl in a wide city
                  with just enough means to supply her present necessities.
               When she had returned and entered her little sitting-room an overpowering sense of loneliness and desolation fell
                  upon her. The. fire was burning briskly in the stove, but she would not prepare
                  the frugal evening meal for her father. His slippers were hanging in their usual
                  place, but she would not get them down this evening. His large arm-chair was
                  standing at the table where he used to sit and study and pursue his art, but the
                  chair was empty and its old occupant had no need for it now. His bed had been
                  removed, and the vacant place where it had stood so long made such a change in the
                  appearance of the chamber that Rose started when she observed it. Upon her
                  father's table was his flute, oiled and laid away with care in its mahogany case.
                  Henceforth it would be silent. By the flute-case was a copy of Jean Paul, which
                  had been her father's constant companion. Often had he read selections from its
                  pages to Rose, and she had learned to love its moon-lit haze of mysticism, and in
                  a measure to comprehend it. She would hear the rich, mellow voice of her father
                  intonating its broken sentences no moreâ€”no more!
               In contemplating these dear relics of her dear lost father, Rose found at length
                  relief in tears. And sleep, too, came at last and scattered the sacred incense
                  from his golden censer over her wearied body and aching heart, and her, fresh
                  young spirit wandered far away with the music of her father's flute among the
                  shadows of the land of dreams, while her father rested in one of the cemeteries on
                  the outskirts of Washington City.
               Jules DeVaughn had been one of that large class of emigrants who sought the shores
                  of America during the political troubles of 1848 which convulsed all Europe. In
                  his younger days he had given an indifferent attention to art, for which he had a
                  real passion, and had studied music and painting in some of the schools of Italy
                  and Germany. When the eventful days of the revolution arrived, and the heart of
                  Europe's millions began to throb again with a hope that had slumbered since 1789,
                  Jules DeVaughn relinquished his desultory studies entirely and hastened to his
                  home in the South of France to take part in the general conflict.
               The first condition of a successful revolution had been achieved, and Louis
                  Phillippe was an exile. But Jules DeVaughn was not a prudent politician. His
                  artistic and enthusiastic nature pursued the ideal in society and government as it
                  pursued the ideal beautiful in art. He was, therefore, mortified and disgusted
                  with the compromising measures of the Republican leaders, who, instead of building
                  upon new foundations, as they might have done, apologized to the Bourgeoisie,
                  continued the existing order under a new regime and paved the way for the empire.
                  As long as there was any hope in opposition, Jules DeVaughn opposed this policy
                  with all the energy of his nature. But with the banishment of Louis Blanc and
                  Ledru Rollin he saw the final success of the reactionary party and the downfall of
                  all his hopes. His own name, too, was on the lists of the proscribed, and though,
                  owing to his less prominent position and his narrower sphere of influence he might
                  have been spared a process and escaped their fate, yet the Bourgeoisie, through
                  the aid of the press, had succeeded in bringing the consistent radicals into such
                  disfavor with the people that Jules DeVaughn found his situation a very
                  embarrassing one. He was regarded with distrust and suspicion. He lived under the
                  constant espionage of the police, and was liable to be arrested on a charge of
                  complicity in conspiracy or treason whenever any of the hot and reckless spirits
                  of that day might enter into any such wild and hopeless undertaking.
               For these reasons he determined to emigrate from France to the United States, to
                  abandon politics forever and to devote himself for the future to art and to art
                  alone. His wife, whom he had married in Italy, had died during the revolutionary
                  times, and had left him Rose, a nut brown, dark-eyed child, who was four years old
                  when her father embarked at Havre for New York.
               After arriving in America, he adhered rigidly to his original purpose to eschew
                  politics and to cling to art. He never became even a naturalized citizen, still
                  prefering to owe allegiance to the land of his birth, although it had banished him
                  so harshly from its soil.
               But Jules De Vaughn was as unsuccessful with art in America as he had been in
                  politics in France. And for the same reasons. Had he painted theatres, railway
                  coaches, ornamental signs, or the panels in fashionable barber shops, he would
                  soon have earned a reputation that an American business man would have been proud
                  to enjoy. He could have laid on the strong colors with a dazzling brilliancy that
                  would have been the delight of American contractors, and he would have reaped
                  substantial rewards for his work. But he did not choose to do so. Ho refused to
                  degrade art either for the applause or the dollars of the mob.
               The consequence was that he did not prosper. The little patrimony he had brought
                  from France was nearly gone, and there was nothing coining in to take its
                  place.
               He left New York, and after wandering from city to city wills no better success
                  finally located himself in Washington, where he spent the last five years of his
                  earthly life.
               Broken down with trials, privations, disappointments and wanderings, and in
                  declining health and prematurely old and grey, he determined from the time of his
                  settlement in Washington to cease his vain efforts to make a generation of
                  practical business men recognize his art and to give his few remaining years to
                  Rose.
               The two had lived together in the strictest seclusion. But few had known the
                  artist and his daughter at all, and these few had no further acquaintance than
                  merely an acquaintance by sight and name. The father, driven to it from the
                  necessity of daily bread, painted those gaudy pictures in flaming colors which are
                  the admiration of what is vulgarly known as the "fancy," and Rose sold them to the
                  dealers. There was art even in these picturesâ€”a mocking ironyâ€”which the artist
                  could have detected, but which the purchasers could not see. The proceeds derived
                  from these sales were small, but by dint of economy the two were able to enjoy the
                  necessaries of lifeâ€”if that can be called enjoyment which is merely the prevention
                  of physical sufferingâ€”and Rose wanted for nothing which was necessary for her
                  intellectual and aesthetic development.
               Their tastes were simple and their habits frugal. The father had often performed
                  the offices of a mother when Rose was a child and now Rose performed the little
                  domestic duties with her own hands. The father submitted with a philosophic
                  resignation to the inevitable and Rose could conceive of no greater happiness than
                  the society of her father.
               In the spring time and in the balmy days of Indian summer, they would take long
                  walks among the hills which overlook the broad, Potomac and stroll hand in hand
                  like two children, stopping to gather flowers and grasses and insects. In the
                  sultry summer months they would take an humble cottage in some nook among the
                  neighboring mountains. In the long winter nights when the silent white snow was
                  falling or the storm was raging and the driving sleet was pattering against the
                  shutters, Jules DeVaughn would read to his daughter selections from the great
                  poets of Italy and England and from the great prose writers and dramatists of
                  France. Sometimes Rose would get her cithern and play and sing some of the joyful
                  airs of southern France which her father had taught her. But this she would not do
                  unless requested, for it made her father grave and thoughtful. Some times she
                  would rend or sew while her father, with a passion which is faithful until death,
                  would sit in his arm chair at his table and sketch designs for the canvas or
                  compose strange, wild melodies which never found favor and were only executed by
                  himself.
               And Rose was happy. She did not know that her father had wasted his years and his
                  genius in trying to represent in finite forms that unity in which music and
                  painting and all the arts find their common source and centre. Of the two spirits
                  which are given to finer souls to accompany them through life, Rose had known but
                  one, the gentle and companionable spirit of the beautiful. She had not yet arrived
                  at the top of those perilous heights, where the sense-world recedes and when the
                  strong and silent angel would come to carry her on his powerful wing over the
                  jagged precipices which would sink before her.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               FEED MY SHEEP.
               "Mrs, Hearsey's grand party comes off next Thursday evening," said Mrs. Doctor Plesington to her husband, the Reverend
                  Doctor Charles Plesington, entering his study and handing him the cards of
                  invitation.
               Doctor Plesington looked at the cards. The style was unobjectionable. The billet
                  was of thick English cream laid paper with an illuminated monogram at the
                  heading.
               "We shall go, I presume?" added Mrs. Plesington with a timid and inquiring look
                  and accent.
               "It is a duty we owe to society," replied her husband, with an air of solemnity,
                  returning the billet to the large square envelope with pointed flap. "It is a duty
                  we owe to society, my dear."
               Mrs. Plesington was not, to speak correctly, afraid of her husband; she was merely
                  embarrased in his presence; he was so infinitely superior to her in genius and
                  goodness, she thought.
               She slipped easily to the sofa and sat down, as if taking some great liberty.
               "They say the Hearseys are enormously rich," she continued, looking into the
                  glowing coals in the grate.
               "They have reaped the just rewards of diligence and honesty. Their lives and
                  conversation exemplify the true spirit of genuine Christianity. They are ornaments
                  to the high circle of society in which they move and strong pillars to my
                  congregation," returned the Doctor with a tone, and a slight cast of the eyes
                  heavenward.
               "They seem more indebted to chanceâ€”"
               "To Providence, my dear," interrupted the Doctor.
               "To Providence I mean," replied his wife, "for their good fortune than to any
                  exertions or merit of their own."
               Doctor Plesington never put aside the clerical manner and its peculiar form of
                  expression when addressing his wife
               "Mr. William Hearsey," he resumed, "entered the ranks in the humble capacity of a
                  private soldier and shouldered his musket at his country's call."
               "Yes; certainly;" assented his wife.
               "His meritorious sevices were soon recognized and promotion followed with rapidity
                  until the private soldier became one of the chief commissaries of the army of the
                  West."
               "He had a cousin in Congress, and they say he sold whiskey to the soldiers on pay
                  day, which we all know was wrong," added Mrs. Plesington.
               "Not necessarily wrong my dear, by any means," answered the dialectic Doctor. "The
                  French army is provided with regular rations of wine, and to cut off the allowance
                  of grog in the British navy would be equivalent to producing a general mutiny
                  among the sailors. Any physician will tell you that a stimulent is useful in.
                  cases of physical privation and fatigue. You remember Paul's advice to Timothy.
                  And if Mr. Hearsey added to his means by the enterprise of which you have just
                  spoken, what he received was but the legitimate profits of trade."
               "Yes; certainly," acquiesced his wife submissively; what you say is all very true;
                  if only Mrs. Hearsey were a little more refined," she continued, however, impelled
                  by a love of innocent gossip, a weakness common to the best of her sex.
               Doctor Plesington explained.
               "It is true," he said, "that Mrs. Hearsey did not, in her earlier years, enjoy
                  those advantages which are only to be derived from thorough training and an
                  association with elegant society. But it is not true, begging your pardon, that
                  she is lacking in any of those accomplishments which go to make up the truly noble
                  woman."
               Mrs. Plesington yielded as usual to the superior judgement of her husband and rose
                  to retire.
               "One word, my dear, before you go," said her husband. "While speaking of Mrs.
                  Hearsey, I have this to observe in addition to what I have already said, and that
                  is, that Mrs. Hearsey possesses one preeminent characteristic trait which you
                  would do well to copy. I allude to her firmness. I know your artless and confiding
                  nature and I know that you are liable to be imposed upon, that you actually are
                  imposed upon. You listen to the complaints of the ignorant, the vicious and the
                  low, and you believe them to be true. You think they are suffering from hunger,
                  cold and nakedness and you occupy your time in searching them out and giving them
                  food, medicine and clothing, in place of performing those social duties which arc
                  so especially incumbent upon your sex. When they tell you that they are seeking
                  employment and are unable to find it, they are deceiving you. Such a state of
                  affairs may exist in Europe, but it is impossible that a man or a woman who is
                  willing to work should suffer want in our enlightened Christian community. Their
                  misfortunes are but the results of their own indolence and vice, and the course
                  which you are pursuing rather encourages them in their evil habits than tends to
                  their wholesome reformation.
               There was not the slightest admixture of severity in these remark. The Doctor's
                  manner was, if possible, more than usually mild and gentle. What kind solicitude
                  for his wife! What a lively interest in the real welfare of the suffering
                  poor!
               His wife, at least, thought so, and glided noiselessly from the study without a
                  word in reply, deeply impressed with the vast scope of her husband's effortsâ€”which
                  would not permit him to see the sorrow and distress immediately around himâ€”and
                  more profoundly impressed, on this very account, with a sense of her own duty to
                  continue in her own humble way her work of doing good.
               After his wife had left the room, the Reverend Doctor Charles Plesington locked
                  the door to prevent intrusion from visitors and lunched heartily on hot buttered
                  toast, cold partridge and half a bottle of generous Burgundy. After finishing his
                  repast, he locked a drawer in his desk and took out and lighted a roasted coffee
                  colored cigar, rested his feet upon a cushioned ottoman and reclined before the
                  fire in his easy chair.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               IN THE EDDIES.
               Rose had to be fed and housed and clothed. There wan no one to do thin for her and
                  it followed, of course, that she had to do it for herself.
               She was a brave girl, and set to work at once to take an inventory of the capital,
                  as it is called, in her possession to begin life with and lay her plans for the
                  future.
               She could draw and paint and sing and play on the cithern; she was thoroughly
                  acquainted with the elementary branches and could read, write and speak English,
                  French and Italian with ease and fluency.
               How to make these accomplishments available?
               From determining to hire as a governess or a teacher, a merciful Providence and an
                  inborn sense and spirit of independence and a love of freedom prevented her. She
                  never once seriously thought of the stage, though she could think of no other
                  means of applying her musical talent. Not having a very wide margin for selection,
                  she finally made up her mind to try painting and selling pictures, and to
                  advertise for adult pupils desiring to learn Italian and French. These two
                  occupations would not conflict. She could paint during the day, but not by
                  gas-light, PO she would have her evenings free to give instruction to any who
                  might come to her place of residence.
               She would continue to live at her present home. The rooms were smallâ€”very
                  smallâ€”but the rent was proportionately low. Her father's bed room had been their
                  common sitting room. The bed had been removed and she would keep this for her own
                  little parlor. The parlor opened into a sleeping apartment, which was merely a
                  cabinet and properly belonged to the parlor, which fronted on the street. Both
                  were let together, and Rose would retain them. She would continue to prepare her
                  meals in the parlor cooking stove and would not need a servant.
               Rose was just sixteen and strange as the fact, may appear, it had never once
                  occured to her that she was possessed of a rare and remarkable beauty. But there
                  was one at least, well aware of the fact. He had frequently observed her walks
                  with her father, and upon one occasion had watched her home to ascertain her place
                  of abode. While Rose was thus casting about for the future, this same individual
                  was moving backwards and forwards on the opposite sidewalk in full front of her
                  window, crying, "R-a-c-k-s! R-a-c-k-s! R-a-c-k-s!"
               Rose's attention had been directed to him by his protracted halt in the immediate
                  vicinity, and she was annoyed, besides, by the constant repetition of his dull and
                  monotone cries. She knew that he belonged to the class of street merchants who
                  bought anything and everything, and the thought at once occured to her that she
                  could dispose of some unnecessary lumber to him.
               She raised her window and beckoned him to come. Ho obeyed the call with
                  alacrity.
               It would have been difficult to have found anywhere a more miserable specimen of
                  his type or profession. He wore an immense overcoat, which was gray and brown, but which might once have been black or
                  blue. It was sleek, shiny with dust and grease, and was stitched in all varieties
                  of length in all possible directions. His hat, which he did not remove when he
                  entered the room, was a cylinder which had passed through the first colors and had
                  taken a dingy, foxy red. He had on a ragged red cravat ornamented with a huge
                  brass pin. His overcoat was wrapped loosely over his chest, and a portion of his
                  bosom front, which was exposed, was ripped in parallel strips and was filthy and
                  discolored. His eyes were small and keen and his nose had that unmistakable
                  contour which characterizes the venders of old clothes and cheap jewelry. His
                  manner was rude and vulgar. Rose shrunk back in disgust when he entered the
                  chamber.
               She explained the object of her call and offered several articles for sale. They
                  were purchased at the price put upon them by the Jew.
               "I gifs you more monish for your dings as any udder man; vat else you got to sell;
                  eh?" said the merchant, examining the chamber and its contents with scrutinizing
                  looks, and regarding Rose with a coarse, brutal stare.
               Rose informed him that she was done trading for the present, and the Jew backed
                  out, with his stare fixed upon her until she closed the door in his face.
               "A treasure!" chuckled the Jew to himself, changing his tone and accent when he s
                  fairly on the street again; "a treasure! and mine she must and shall be at any
                  cost! If gold and Madame Zarowski's intrigues do not succeed, we will try what
                  virtue there is in starvation; if that fail, blacken her reputation and drive her
                  from the world. Then she is mine, soul and body mine! Ha!" ejaculated the Jew, "I
                  would like to see one of the pretty birds escape me when she is sixteen, alone in
                  the world and dependent on her own exertions to sustain life. It would be less
                  expensive to starve her at first, but that would be to rob my pretty fawn of her
                  beauty; no, not starvation, if it can be accomplished by gold and Zarowski's art.
                  Oh my little fluttering partridge! I shall cage you soon! I have use for you."
               The Jew, who rejoiced in the name of Isaacs, made a circuitous route home, crept
                  stealthily up a back alley and entered his house from a back yard. He divested
                  himself of his filthy garments, laid aside a wig of grisly hair and his artificial
                  whiskers and dressed himself in his ordinary fashionable costume, and was soon
                  busy among books and papers, working away in the interests of the Grand
                  Consolidated Railway Land Grant Bill.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               THE BILL.
               "These are some of the deplorable results which must inevitably follow if the
                  Grand Consolidated Railway Land Grant Bill becomes a law."
               This was the concluding sentence of an article, which George Hales, a journalist,
                  had carefully prepared for one of the great New York dailies.
               The article never saw the light, for the paper to which it was sent had been
                  absorbed in the interest of the lobby.
               Not only the journal to which the article had been forwarded, but all the other
                  journals of influence in the country had been retained in the same way.
               The consequence was that George Hales' valuable communication, full of interesting
                  history, statistics, facts and dates, with its telling arguments and earnest
                  protests, lay in one of the pigeon-holes of his desk and the dust from the stove
                  settled upon it.
               The bill in question conveyed to a railroad company an empire of the public lands.
                  The area of territory to be conveyed, deeded, granted and forever given away to a
                  corporation consisting of a dozen or more persons, was larger than any kingdom of
                  Europe excepting Russia. It was nearly equal in extent to the original thirteen
                  colonies of the confederation. Its mineral resources were of untold value, its
                  climate salubrious and its rich virgin soil nourished in luxurious abundance the
                  primeval forests of the continent. It was traversed by deep and broad rivers, it
                  contained mountains of iron and coal, vast prairies and grazing lands, broad rich
                  valleys of amazing fertility, water power sufficient for the manufacturing
                  purposes of a hemisphere, and innumerable convenient sites for future towns and
                  cities. It would one day support a hundred millions of inhabitants. It was such an
                  empire as Alexander the Great might have alloted to one of his generals. It was a
                  greater one than ever Napoleon Bonapart bestowed upon any of the kings that he
                  created. And this colossal domain was to be given away! given to a corporation; a
                  corporation composed of a dozen or more individuals! The emigrant and actual
                  settler were to be deprived of their privileges. Millions of unborn American
                  citizens were to be reduced to pauperism. Humanity itself was to be robbed of its
                  rights.
               Never before in the history of the world had such a stupendous prize been placed
                  within the reach of private commercial ambition. No wonder that the preps had been
                  subsidized, no wonder that lawyers and politicians and public speakers had been
                  hired to traverse the country and write and speak and exert all their influence in
                  favor of the Grand Consolidated Railway Land Grant Bill. No wonder that millions
                  on millions of treasure were expended in the effort to secure its passage. Life,
                  hope, happiness and virtue must all be sacrificed, if needs be, to secure the
                  bill. No cost was to be spared, no sacrifice avoided, no risk or danger shunned to
                  accomplish this result.
               George Hales was a popular writer and for that reason, perhaps, unknown to the
                  world of journalism, though this was his profession. He steadfastly refused to
                  prostitute himself to the uses for which hireling Bohemians are most usually
                  employed. Therefore he remained poor, while more practical, but less accomplished
                  men of his class around him were slowly and surely gathering wealth.
               Some of the purest hearts and clearest brains of the country opposed the bill, and
                  Hales was among the number. But he was dependent upon his pen for a living and
                  could not afford to devote his time to writing even against overshadowing and
                  controlling monopolies without pay; and he had to content himself within a
                  narrower sphere and with lower wages.
               So his manuscript article remained in the pigeon-hole of his desk and the dust
                  settled upon it.
               It is proper to mention in this connection, that Hales had had repeated interviews
                  with Mr. Isaacs, a financial agent of a London banking house, and also with Mr.
                  Hearsey, a celebrated railroad man, and that the object of these interviews had
                  been to induce Hales to give his journalistic support to the bill, which as we
                  have seen, he steadily refused to do.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               QUACK.
               Mr. Hearsey was not a member of the order of the Cincinnati, but he was the legal
                  owner of one of the most magnificent residences of Washington City. His wealth was
                  enormous, and Mrs. Hearsey could give parties equaled by few and excelled by none.
                  She could command the attendance of any of the really and practically great men of
                  the country whom she might choose to invite; and as for fashionable ladies, much
                  as they abused her behind her back, those who were the fortunate recipients of her
                  cards were always careful to leave them carelessly exposed on the top of the card
                  pile in their baskets.
               It is not a matter of surprise, therefore, that the company assembled at Mrs.
                  Hearsey's house on the evening appointed for her party was select.
               Seated on a crimson velveted sofa in the corner of one of the rooms were the
                  Misses Woggles, gayly entertaining a lot of young department clerks, invited to
                  perform the male part of the dancing. The elder Miss Woggles had read an original
                  poem a short time previous at a literary soiree and was ambitious to become the
                  centre of a circle of her own.
               Mrs. McWhorter, an eminently conservative lady, was deploring, in an opposite
                  corner, to old General Bingo, the latitudinarianism of her sex at the present day,
                  while her four amiable daughters were promenading in the hall and talking and
                  looking all kinds of nonsense to four young men.
               Professor Puffer was there, explaining to some elderly females the qualities of
                     a remarkable oil he had compounded,
                  and which, on the strength of some certificates that he had been promised by
                  certain members of Congress, he intended to bring before the public.
               Dr. Pilham, who had already made his fortune on a magic bitters of some
                  description, overheard Professor Puffer's remarks in passing, and expressed a
                  doubt to the lady at his side that Professor Puller's remedy would accomplish all
                  that the Professor promised for it.
               Jucocks, of the firm of Jacocks Bro's, was discussing with Shorts, of Langley
                  & Shorts, the depreciation of public securities and the advisability of
                  Western lands.
               Lawyer Snagg was entertaining Mrs. Fidgette with the history of the law of
                  divorce.
               Mrs. Crimples, with a marriageable daughter well in hand, was telling Potts, a
                  well to do hardware merchant and batchelor how she used to know Mrs. Packham, who
                  was blazing in jewels across the room, when she made pies and sold them to the
                  soldiers. Mrs. Crimples informed the hardware merchant further that Miss Pack-ham,
                  Mrs. Packham's daughter, who was flirting at that moment with a West Point cadet,
                  was sadly deficient in early education and training. Mrs. Crimples did not
                  ostentatiously display jewels herself, but if family was
                  to be taken into account, she would not be afraid to compare notes with
                     some people.
               The company was entirely too large, and the topics of conversation too numerous
                  and too frequently changing, to give more than a few random expressions picked up
                  here and there in the general hum and buzz of voices. There were present
                  merchants, lawyers, judges, doctors, professors, members of Congress, clergymen
                  and clerks. They talked of business, literature, art, politics, religion, fashion,
                  scandals and the current events of the day. It was evident that all were enjoying
                  themselves, immensely, whatever they may have said in disparagement of Mrs.
                  Hearsey or her entertainment after they left her house. As to the genuineness of
                  the carpets, the luxury of the furniture, the brocade and the brocatelle, the
                  Persian and the Italian cloths, the Sevres porcelain, the gauzes and the muslins,
                  the silks and the the, satins, the pearls and the diamonds, the ribbons, the laces
                  and the velvets, the snowy undergear, the shoulder straps and the gold lace, the
                  exact descriptions of the ladies and the number and names of the guests, Jenkins
                  was there to record it all and a faithful report appeared in the next morning's
                  paper.
               It was about eleven o'clock, and the elder guests had instinctively gravitated
                  together to the lower drawing room. Mrs. Hearsey, fatigued with the labors of the
                  evening, was reclining on a divan in as languishing an attitude as her great size
                  and large bones would permit, and by her side was the Reverend Doctor Charles
                  Plesington.
               Mrs. Hearsey had not, in early life, mingled with those people who constitute what
                  is generally understood under the term "society." She had sometimes chopped off a
                  hog's head or torn off a side of spare ribs for some of their servants, bat this
                  was as near as she ever approached in those days. For her father was a pork
                  butcher and Mrs. Hearsey used to help in the business and she was better
                  acquainted with the sharp crackling of boiling fat and the smells Of the
                  slaughter-house than with the crisp rustling of atlas and the perfumes of Araby. A
                  lucky speculation in hogs, a rise in the price and a contract
                  to supply the Western army, made her father's fortune. He retired from business,
                  and Mrs. Hearsey left the stall. Shortly thereafter her father died, and she,
                  being his only child, became the possessor of his estate and married Mr. Hearsey,
                  whose rise in life was owing, as we have seen, to somewhat similar
                  circumstances.
               If there was nothing specially attractive about Mrs. Hearsey's person or manner
                  there was certainly nothing repulsive about them. She was near forty-five, in
                  robust health, and though her features were coarse and large, she could not be
                  said to be positively ill-looking. And then when she was alone with Dr. Plesington
                  there was a knowing twinkle about her eye, or a look or a tone of melancholy, or
                  an indescribable softness and disposition to draw nearer to him, that greatly
                  added to her attractions.
               Doctor Plesington smiled upon Mrs. Hearsey.
               Mrs. Hearsey smiled upon Doctor Plesington.
               This innocent flirtation was interrupted at this interesting point by the approach
                  of Mr. Hearsey, the husband, who inquired of his wife in an anxious and uneasy
                  manner, "what could possibly detain the Senator and Madame Zarowski?"
               "I do not know I am sure, nor do I care," replied his spouse in an angry and
                  contemptuous tone, which might have been heard by every one in the room; for Mrs.
                  Hearsey had not acquired that command of her temper which is indispensable in
                  elegant society. "I have been waiting supper for them," she continued, "an hour,
                  because you begged me to, and I shall wait just fifteen minutes more by the clock
                  and not one minute longer; it's all the doings of that foreigner Zowski, or what
                  you call her. She wanted to keep the Senator with her as long as she could, and
                  then come late to make a sensation. The people are getting hungry, I know, by this
                  time, and the young ones want to go to dancing. I shan't invite her again to any
                  of my parties I know."
               Mr. Hearsey was too well accustomed to such demonstrations to manifest any
                  excitement. He merely turned on his heel and walked away to resume his
                  conversation with Isaacs, whom he had introduced into Washington society that
                  evening as a financial agent of an old established banking house in London.
               One reason for Mrs. Hearsey's outbreak on this occasion might have been the abrupt
                  termination of her pleasant tete-a-tete with Doctor Plesington, who had taken this
                  occasion to desert her side; or her wrath might have arisen from the profounder
                  fact that she suspected from former observations that Madame Zarowski had found
                  favor in the eyes of Doctor Plesington.
               Jacocks, of Jacocks Bro's, had joined Mr. Hearsey and Mr. Isaacs, and the two
                  former were soon engaged in an earnest and animated conversation, though it was
                  carried on in an under tone. Isaacs was imperturbably calm and seemed utterly
                  indifferent to the subject matter which so deeply interested his companions.
               "The Grand Consolidated Railway Land Grant Bill must become a law
                  this session of Congress," said Mr. Hearsey in a low, but resolute and determined
                  tone.
               "A very desirable result without doubt," said Jacocks, "we can count upon the
                  House; but the Senate; if only the Senatorâ€”â€”"
               He did not finish his sentence. There was a visible commotion among the company
                  and in a moment more a liveried footman in knee breeches, but lacking the powdered
                  wig, announced the Senator and Madame Zarowski.
               Mrs. Hearsey greeted the Senator cordially, but the cold reception extended to
                  Madame Zarowski was ludicrously in contrast with that accorded to her escort.
               Madame Zarowski was not in the slightest degree disconcerted. She barely touched
                  Mrs. Hearsey's hand with the tips of her delicately gloved fingers. She did not
                  even seem to observe Mrs. Hearsey's presence at all, and remarked to herself in
                  distinct language, for Mrs. Hearsey's benefit, that she had been BO agreeably
                  entertained by the Senator, that she had forgotten all about the stupid ball until
                  the Senator had called it to her attention.
               Mrs. Hearsey was furious. Indeed there is no telling what she would not have done
                  then and there, had not Doctor Plesington, like a guardian angel as he was,
                  appeared on the scene just in the nick of time to prevent a catastrophe by calling
                  Mrs. Hearsey's attention and apologizing for the absence of his wife, who was
                  detained by illness.
               Mrs. Hearsey was always ready to accept any apology for the absence of Mrs.
                  Plesington when Doctor Plesington was present.
               The apology was entirely satisfactory and the pair resumed their seats and the
                  conversation where they had been interrupted by Mr. Hearsey wondering what
                  detained the two guests who had just made their appearance.
               Doctor Plesington smiled upon Mrs. Hearsey.
               Mrs. Hearsey smiled upon Doctor Plesington.
               "Do you think, Doctor, that marraiges are made in heaven?" artlessly inquired Mrs.
                  Hearsey.
               "In one sense, yes; in another sense, I should return an answer in the negative,"
                  replied the dialectician.
               "I don't know that I exactly understand you," returned his companion, "what I mean
                  is, do you think it is wrong when we are married toâ€”toâ€”think of anybody else than
                  our husbands or wives?"
               "Our emotions," explained the Doctor, "are not subject to our wills nor can they
                  be made so. The laws of nature are not more inflexible in the physical world than
                  the laws which control the operations of our thoughts and feelings. I love that which is attractive and have an aversion
                  to that which is repulsive in spite of myself. The sphere of morality is confined
                  in freedom, in the will; not in the attempt to evade or resist immutable law. But
                  the unwarranted extremes to which this doctrine is carried is astounding. The
                  paramount consideration is the proprieties of society."
               While the Doctor was laying down these principles, his eye was following the
                  graceful aud haughty form of Madame Zarowski, who in her turn was not long at a
                  time absent from the side of the Senator.
               Supper was announced and quickly dispatched by the hungry guests. The music
                  commenced, the dancers took their places and the work of the young department
                  clerks began.
               While the dancing was going on, Mr. Hearsey made the Senator acquainted with Mr.
                  Isaacs, the financial agent of one of the oldest banking houses in London. The
                  Senator was glad to make Mr. Isaacs' acquaintance. Mr. Isaacs felt highly honored
                  by an introduction to the Senator.
               "Mr. Isaacs, Madame Zarowski;" said Mr. Hearsey. Zarowski bowed with dignity;
                  Isaacs bowed profoundly. He asked the pleasure of her arm for a promenade. The
                  request was granted, and the two passed into the hall and the back piazza for a
                  breath of fresh air, leaving Mr. Hearsey and the Senator in conversation.
               "Is the Senator still as intractable as ever?" asked Isaacs when the two were
                  alone.
               "Quite so," was the reply.
               "Then your charms have lost their wonted power, Irene," said Isaacs with a fine
                  tinge of sarcasm.
               Zarowski made no reply.
               "The love of money is not his passion," soliloquized the Jew rather than addressed
                  himself to his companion.
               "His own private fortune is large enough," interposed Zarowski.
               "Yes; quite large enough for one who desires no more," philosophized Isaacs. "A
                  petticoat may have more attractions. He seems fond of you, Irene."
               Zarowski started but kept silence.
               "But his fondness for you is not that all consuming fire which braves danger and
                  ruin to accomplish its purpose," continued the Jew, careless and indifferent to
                  the wounds he inflicted.
               Zarowski did not reply.
               "Irene," said the Jew, "form the acquaintance of Rose DeVaughn, bring her to your
                  house and introduce the Senator. Mrs. Doctor Plesington knows her and will assist
                  you."
               The Jew chuckled a low chuckle to himself when he said this.
               "There," said he, "I have done; I have no further commands for you this evening.
                  Let me hear a good report, for I shall see you soon. Time presses. My arm."
               He led her back to the drawing-room. The guests were beginning to take their
                  leave. The Senator and Madame Zarowski soon excused themselves. Isaacs, Mr.
                  Jacocks and Doctor Plesington followed shortly thereafter.
               By ones, by twos, by threes, by fours and by fives the guests disappeared. The
                  Woggles, including the elder Miss Woggles, Mrs. McWhorter and her four amiable
                  daughters, and old General Bingo, Professor Puffer, Doctor Pilham, Jacocks, of
                  Jacocks Bro's, Shorts, of the firm of Langley & Shorts, Snagg,, the lawyer,
                  Mrs. Fidgette, Mrs. Crimples, Potts, the hardware merchant, Mrs. Packham and
                  daughter, and the cadet, all went. The music ceased. Mr. and Mrs. Hearsey were
                  left alone and Mrs. Hearsey's party was over.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               TWIN SOULS.
               George Hales, the writer and journalist, did not have an office on Newspaper Row
                  or F Street. He occupied two small rooms, plainly, though tastefully furnished, in
                  a less fashionable part of the city. Strictly journalistic work, by which we
                  understand stand ascertaining the facts of the past twenty-four hours and
                  enlarging upon them in a sensational style, he did not do. He confined himself
                  chiefly to making abstracts of documents and collating, digesting and arranging
                  available information on interesting and important subjects. This kind of work did
                  not pay very well, although his faculties of keen discrimination and of breadth of
                  vision pre-eminently qualified him for that kind of intellectual labor where
                  analysis and synthesis are indispensable. But as the reading public makes no very
                  great demand for this particular kind of talent, and as Hales had his own notions
                  about journalism and stuck to them, he eked out his living by writing stories for
                  the popular weekly press, in addition to his heavier work, and continued true to
                  himself.
               He was fond of quaint literature and was constantly dipping into books known not
                  even by name to the readers and most of the writers of the present day; works on
                  Alchemy and Astrology,, the text-books of the theurgists and of the Rosicrucians,
                  the treaties of Jacob Behme and Swedenborg, and the books of Ezekiel and the
                  Revelations. He saw, or least fancied that he saw, a deep political significance
                  in this literature akin to that found in the book of Daniel. He looked down, or
                  thought that he did, into the secret heart of the writer and saw there a profound
                  and an infinite longing for a higher state for man on earth than the positivists
                  and the skeptics had ever permitted him to hope for. He was a poet, though he had
                  never written verses, and was penetrated in every fibre of his soul and nature
                  with the sense of religion. The life of a person so constituted must necessarily
                  be a lonely one. The ordinary excitements incident to the pursuits of men, as the
                  pleasures of friendship and of social intercourse, did not meet the wants he felt
                  or supply any worthy goal for his aspirations. Ho saw no hope in waging a contest
                  for ideals against the combined powers of organized society. He would rather cease
                  to struggle to make men recognize them, and would worship his gods alone in the
                  solitudes of his own soul.
               One morning while sipping his coffee and glancing over the papers, his eye chanced
                  to light on an advertisement in which a young lady proposed to give instructions
                  to adult pupils in French and Italian. Hales wanted a translation of some old
                  Italian legends and stories, and the thought occurred to him that lie would call
                  on the "young lady" and see if she were qualified to do the work.
               That evening he dressed himself with somewhat more care than usual, drew on his
                  overcoat and gloves and started out to go to the street and number designated in
                  the advertisement.
               After a half an hour's walk he arrived at the place of his destination. He rang
                  the bell, inquired for the lady and was shown to the door of Rose DeVaughn's
                  little sitting-room. He knocked and Rose opened the door and admitted him.
               Hales saw what he did not expect to see, or rather he had not expected anything at
                  all further than the common place business transaction of going to a translator
                  and leaving some work. But when he stood in Rose's little parlor and saw her
                  dressed in a dark red skirt and a closely-fitting black silk bodice that showed
                  the form of a bust and a pair of shouders that Rubens would have adored, saw her
                  luxuriant jet black hair loosely gathered in a loop and falling in massive tresses
                  down her back, gazed upon the rich color-of her dark brown face and felt the
                  influence of her largo and lustrous eyes, George Hales forgot for a moment all
                  about the package of Italian volumes that he had in hip hands and stood transfixed
                  to the spot, enraptured with the beauteous creature before him. His heart and soul
                  absorbed her beauty like a thirsty sponge. The blood pulsed quicker along his
                  veins. Strange and novel sensations, such as he had never experienced before,
                  trembled along his nerves. All the vague, wild, restless, infinite longings and
                  yearnings and hopes of the soul within him were in harmony and he bathed in a
                  deep, cairn sea of joy and rest. The infinite and ideal had become incarnate and
                  real in the form of a woman.
               Once in the course of a complex physical and spiritual existence a transfiguration
                  is possible for such natures as George Hales' and upon this occasion he had made
                  the transition.
               Such a transition is sudden and tempestuous; when it comes there is no room for
                  thought and feeling;â€”all is spontaneiety.
               When he had recovered himself, he stamered out the object of his visit.
               Rose, utterly unconscious of what Hales had experienced, bade him be seated and
                  state more particularly what he wished.
               Hales complied, and as books had to be handled between them, he naturally took a seat by her side for their mutual
                  convenience.
               After looking over the volumes generally for some time, a longer time than was in
                  fact necessary to give that general view of their contents, which Hales undertook
                  to do, one volume was taken and a story was selected for translation. The
                  probabilities are, that if Rose had not been able to do the work in the most
                  satisfactory manner, Hales would nevertheless have given her the job. But she was
                  thoroughly competent to do it and to do it in the very best taste.
               The purposes for which Hales wished these translations did not require a written
                  version. He only wanted the plot to re-arrange and work up in his novelettes.
               It took Rose over an hour to make the translation, for she took greater pains to
                  be accurate in words than was required for the object in view.
               During the reading, Hales continued by Rose's side that he might catch every word
                  she uttered. Sometimes Rose would turn her full face on him and ask if he, fully
                  caught the meaning. Frequently he said he had not, exactly; and would ask her to
                  give it in her own language without following the words of the original. This she
                  would do and that prolonged the time, and Hales could hear her voice and watch her
                  changing expression.
               Nor did the time seem long to Rose or the task irksome. George Hales was the first
                  man except her father with whom she had engaged in any reciprocal occupation or
                  with whom she had ever been alone for an hour. And George Hales was a man for whom
                  more than one woman would have risked much. He was rather tall, muscular and
                  handsomely proportioned, with light auburn hair, a remarkably clear complexion and
                  light grey eyes. His manners were quiet and easy, and he was naturally disposed to
                  be silent, but when he spoke, his tones were deep and earnest. There was an air of
                  entire self-reliance about him, which, without being in the slightest degree
                  ostentatious and offensive, commanded universal respect.
               The translation was finished at last, and by the time it was completed, Hales and
                  Rose were far advanced in each other's acquaintance. There was nothing done or
                  said or intimated with any purpose of bringing about any such result. It sprung up
                  as the flowers spring up when the soil is warm and the sun shines upon them. The
                  immutable laws had caught them up in their universal sweep and they were but the
                  passive subjects of inexorable fate.
               Hales could find no reasonable excuse to prolong his call, and so an arrangement
                  was concluded agreeable to both parties that Hales should come as often as he
                  liked to have his translations made, and that she should receive a certain fixed
                  price for her services.
               Hales went home filled with new reflections, new purposes and new hopes; and Rose,
                  the little Italian painter and teacher, was at the bottom of them all. Rose also
                  had undergone some new experiences and went to bed that night to dream of George
                  Hales and Italian stories.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               THE PRIZE.
               Madame Zarowski was alone in her richly furnished saloon. She was dressed for the
                  evening and waiting to receive the Senator and Rose. But neither of these two
                  expected guests expected to meet the other. They did not even know of each other's
                  existence. The meeting of the two had been arranged for by Madame Zarowski in
                  obedience to the instructions of Isaacs at Mrs. Hearsey's party.
               Madame Zarowski had made a visit to Mrs. Doctor Piesington to ascertain something
                  about Rose and find out the best way of forming her acquaintance. Mrs. Plesington
                  had received her politely, but not in that cordial manner which was natural to her
                  generally. She knew very little about Rose. She had only seen her once, and that
                  was during her father's last illness when she had called, upon hearing that a poor
                  artist was sick and might be in need of attention. She had found him well cared
                  for and did not repeat her visit. She knew where Rose lived then, but that was
                  all. What did Madame Zarowski want with Rose, Mrs. Plesington had inquired with a
                  distrust foreign to her unsuspecting nature. The reply had been that her visitor
                  had learned that Hose's father was a painter and he might have left some pictures
                  which she would like to purchase and add to her collection.
               That same evening Madame Zarowski had culled on Rose and found her alone, happy as
                  a bird and busily engaged in drawing designs for paintings. During her visit,
                  which was a brief one, she learned from Rose the outlines of her history and that
                  she had no friends and was entirely dependent upon herself. She admired Rose's
                  paintings, purchased one and paid for it, and then exacted from Rose a promise to
                  call on her the evening following at eight o'clock for some new work, and took her
                  leave. But not one word did Rose say about George Hales.
               Madame Zarowski seemed to be ill at ease. She was nervous and excited, and being
                  alone, gave expression to her restlessness. She paced the room impatiently. She
                  looked frequently at the elegant French clod: on the black marble mantle-piece.
                  Rose was to be there at eight, and the Senator had sent word that he would be
                  there at nine. It was now nearly eight.
               "If anything would only happen to prevent this meeting," she paid to herself, "but
                  Isaacs must be obeyed; wretched woman that I am, will nothing short of death
                  deliver me from this cursed Jew!"
               Madame Zarowski was a judge of female beauty. She was beautiful herself. Her
                  interview with Rose had been a short one, but she had seen enough to convince her,
                  knowing as she did the temperament and disposition of the Senator, that he would
                  be at Rose's feet as soon after he had seen her as an opportunity would permit,
                  and an opportunity he would make. It was this that distressed her. She loved the
                  Senator as much as she was capable of loving. She did not love him solely on
                  account of his rank and wealth and his acknowledged abilities, but on account of
                  all these together with his own individuality. Her affection towards him was
                  something more than mere vanity. She had never attempted to influence him with a
                  view to her own pecuniary advantage.
               It is due to truth to say this much in her behalf. The Senator, to say the least,
                  was fond of her society. She was in his confidence and he spent most of his
                  leisure time in her saloon. Not that he was really enamored of her person; but
                  then she was a fascinating woman in her way and when she chose to exert her power
                  there was no man possessed of any sensibilities at all, who could entirely resist
                  her. Hundreds were dying for her, to use the gallant phrase of the times of
                  chivalry, to whom she had not extended the smallest of her favors. Societyâ€”that
                  is, the female portion of it, which in fact constitutes what is thus popularly
                  denominatedâ€”hated her, but feared her and invited her to its entertainments. In
                  other days she would have been the queen of love and beauty to invest the
                  conquering knight with the guerdom of his prowess; or she would have been a
                  reigning toast, over which enthusiastic youths would have drunk themselves blind.
                  In the time and place where her present lot was actually cast, she might have been
                  queen of the lobby had she been so disposed, and had the shadow of Isaacs been
                  removed from over her.
               None but a woman can fully understand the anguish of wounded pride she felt while
                  waiting in her saloon for the time to come for her to enact that common-place part
                  of introducing two strangers to each other. To see the triumph of her rival with
                  her own eyesâ€”in her own houseâ€”to see her conquest of the man she loved, and to be
                  herself the instrument of bringing this fatal meeting about! Her agony was
                  terrible. Her faced Hushed, her bosom heaved, her teeth were, set and her whole
                  frame trembled. Once she started as if firmly resolved on some desperate purpose,
                  but she shrunk from the effort and murmured in a tone of despair, "Isaacs must be
                  obeyed."
               She composed herself and resumed her usual manner in time not to expose any trace
                  of her emotions to a servant who entered a few minutes afterwards to announce the
                  first expected visitor.
               Rose had never seen such elegance and luxury in her life before. The soft velvet,
                  carpet, the richly covered rose-wood chairs and sofas and ottomans covered with
                  blue satin, the standing furniture of the finest polish and inlaid with ivory and
                  gold and porcelain and worked in mosaics of pearl and tortoise shell, the articles
                  of vertu, ranged in etageres, the select paintings on the wall, the rich damasks and
                  China cloths, and all flooded with the light of the frosted silver chandeliers
                  sparkling with cut chrystal pendants, was enough to have overwhelmed a good,
                  simple-minded girl who had never seen or dreamed of such splendors. Madame
                  Zarowski observed every motion tion and
                  expression of Rose's countenance with the most intense interest. The scene had
                  made no visible impression on her visitor whatever. She entered the saloon and was
                  seated at Madame Zarowski's invitation with as much ease and self-possession as if
                  she were in her own cozy little parlor at home. To an imagination familiar with
                  the treasures of Italy, even Madame Zarowski's reception room was quite common
                  place. This had not escaped Madame Zarowski, and she took fresh hope. An hour ago
                  she could have strangled Rose; but now, seeing what little influence external
                  wealth and luxury and fashion had upon her, she might possibly become her friend.
                  She was satisfied that Rose was not mercenary. Her indifference could not have
                  been assumed; her nature was too ingenuous. Perhaps after all she might reject any
                  proposition the Senator might make, or it might be that she had a lover and was
                  faithful. The supposition that the Senator would remain untouched was not
                  entertained.
               After the usual salutation had passed between them, Madame Zarowski produced a
                  large portfolio filled with drawings and designs. There were fiords and cliffs in
                  Norway, forests and reindeer in Lapland, wolves and sleigh rides in the steppes of
                  Russia, the turban and the crescent and scimetar, there were landscapes of the
                  Tyrol and Switzerland, Italian lakes, German farm houses and French chateaux,
                  Dutch tiles and gables and English lanes and cottages. Madame Zarowski had
                  consumed considerable time in looking over and explaining the collection. Her
                  ostensible reason was to select the designs she wished to give Rose to work upon;
                  her real motive was to detain Rose until the arrival of the Senator.
               "I wish, Rose, you would paint this for me," said Madame Zarowski, giving her an
                  English country landscape which she had chosen. I think I will have work to keep
                  you occupied for some lime to come, and as I am the first customer, I must beg you
                  to refuse all others who may come until you have finished up for me," she added in
                  a friendly tone and manner.
               Rose promised.
               "Have you sold any of your paintings yet?" asked Madame Zarowski.
               "I have offered some for sale, but the men at the shops tell me there is no market
                  for such paintings as mine," replied Rose.
               "You give instructions in French and Italian you told me?"
               "Yes."
               "Have you many pupils?"
               Rose blushed. Madame Zarowski noticed it. Rose thought of George Hales, and
                  bashfully answered, "not many."
               Madame Zarowski did not pursue her interrogations any further; she perceived that
                  Rose had not suspected the drift of her questions and she did not want to run the
                  risk of arousing her suspicions.
               At this moment a light tap was heard at the door. Madame Zarowski's lip quivered
                  for a moment as she said "come in," and the Senator entered the room.
               Before he had time to explain, for the benefit of the stranger present, the
                  liberty he had takenâ€”and which he always tookâ€”of tapping at the door of her
                  private reception room without any previous announcement, Madame Zarowski had
                  introduced him to Rose.
               "An artist," said the Senator at hap hazard to Rose, noticing the design in her
                  handâ€”for Rose had picked it up from the table and was going to take her leaveâ€”"And
                  if her skill be equal to her beauty, we shall have a new star of double magnitude
                  in the firmament of Washington celebrities," added the Senator, without waiting to
                  ascertain the correctness of his first presumption.
               This speech displeased and mortified Rose. She felt that no one, much less an
                  utter stranger, had any right to address her with such freedom of speech. She was
                  anything but prudish and cared very little what other people thought of her so
                  long as she could make a living and be at peace with her own conscience. Hence she
                  resented this little piece of harmless gallantry by calling for her hat and cloak
                  and taking her leave without making the Senator any reply. Madame Zarowski was at
                  ease so far as Rose was concerned.
               "What little bird of Paradise is that, Zarowski, and why have I never seen her
                  before?" queried the Senator after Rose was gone.
               "She is the daughter of a poor artist who died a short time ago and having nothing
                  to leave her, he bequeathed her to the care of God and her country."
               "And are not we the country," joked the Senator, "and can not I make out a title
                  to this pretty bon bon?"
               "Not by such evidences as you gave to-night. You mortified and embarrassed the
                  girl and she carried away no very favorable opinion of your most honorable self;
                  and you boast that you know women!"
               "A spirited, hot blooded young creature, I swear," said the Senator
                  admiringly.
               "Not very warm towards yourself, however," retorted the lady.
               "The coal in your grate is as cold as a stone until it is warmed into a generous
                  glow by the proper appliances," argued the statesman.
               "And your vanity, doubtless, leads you to take it for granted that you possess the
                  necessary caloric properties, I suppose," said the Madame.
               "At all events, I shall put them into operation the first opportunity I findâ€”or
                  make," rejoined the Senator.
               "What if she have a lover?" objected Madame.
               "Oust him from her good graces." was the reply.
               "If she decline your honorable attentions?" interposed Madame further.
               "Press them the harder until she accepts them," answered the Senator.
               "But if she holds out in her opposition?"
               "Then find some way to overcome it."
               "But I tell you," urged Madame Zarowski vehemently, "that there are some women
                  whom neither arts nor entreaties, wealth or power, danger or death itself can
                  overcome."
               "Whose acquaintance I have yet to form. But tell me; whore does the obdurate
                  charmer make her nest? I must not loose sight of her."
               "Madame Zarowski gave him the particulars of her history as far as she knew them
                  and gave him her address. The Senator took out his pocket-book and took down her
                  number.
               The Senator had caught but a glimpse of Rose, but that alone had been sufficient
                  to excite his curiosity and imagination. He was too good a critic not to have
                  noticed the rich brown peach color in her cheeks, her massive natural hair; and as
                  she wore her dark red skirt and tightly fitting black silk bodice he could not
                  help admiring the wonderful symmetry of her form. He was already deeply enamored
                  of her and was determined to see her again and to kiss those lips if art and
                  patience and perseverance would enable him to do it.
               The Senator grew restive in Madame Zarowski's company this evening. She saw it and
                  knew that the slender hold which she had upon him was giving way. He soon bade her
                  good evening and retired and left her alone to her reflections.
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               THE CONTRACT.
               It was a bitter cold night. The north wind whistled and blew and stormed. The
                  sleet drove against the shutters and panes and danced and whirled along the narrow
                  alleys between the tall houses and around the corners. It was a night of suffering
                  and terror to the poor in their wretched hovels without fuel or sufficient
                  clothing. It was a night for rousing fires and good cheer in doors. It was a night
                  when no one was to be found upon the street except the homeless outcast, who
                  sought the best shelter he could find in some vacant stall or in some lumber yard;
                  or except some one who was on a mission involving something not much short of life
                  or death.
               That night Doctor Plesington informed his wife that he had an appointment which
                  could not by any possibility be postponed. His wife said something about it? being
                  such a terrible night to be out in; but the Doctor plead duty and his wife was
                  satisfied. That delicate and noble hearted little woman would have gone out
                  herself through that fearful storm to comfort the sick and suffering and to cheer
                  the dying if she had been called upon to do FO. She felt proud that her husband
                  was actuated by similar impulses of duty, as she thought. She never inquired where
                  he was going, but helped him on with his leggings and wrapped thick, warm, woolen
                  comforters around his neck and breast. The Doctor then drew on his overcoat, put
                  on a tight-fitting fur cap, encased himself in a rubber water-proof over-all, drew
                  on his gloves, and started out.
               
               The keen; sharp wind and the sleet drove full in his face as he went along. He
                  compressed his lips, bent his head forward and inclined it to one side, the better
                  to pierce through the warring elements. Once he stumbled and almost fell, for the
                  lamps were misty and dull and the night was pitch dark. He recovered himself and
                  hurried on with rapid steps. He encountered no one. He saw no one on the streets.
                  Not the rattling of a wheel or the tramp of a horse was to be heard in any
                  direction. The street cars had been hauled into the sheds and the drivers were
                  huddled around great roaring stoves at the stables. There were no carriages on the
                  stands. Dim lights were burning in the shops and the clerks had retired to the
                  counting-rooms and offices in the rear. For once, business had resigned its empire
                  for a while, and a common instinct to seek safety from the terrors of nature was
                  in the ascendant in every breast. The dogs were crouching in their kennels at home
                  or shivering on the sheltered side of buildings or walls or wherever they could
                  find protection; not a bark was to be heard. Except the raging of the storm all
                  was silent.
               After a hurried walk of about a quarter of an hour he reached the place of his
                  destination. He pulled the door bell vigorously. The door was opened immediately
                  by a weather-beaten old woman and Dr. Plesington was admitted. She had evidently
                  expected him, for as soon an he had given his name she at once showed him into the
                  private business office of Mr. Isaacs, the financial agent of the old established
                  London banking house.
               There he found Mr. Isaacs and Mr. Hearsey, seated at a large round table covered
                  with books and papers and maps.
               "A fearful night, Doctor," remarked Mr. Hearsey, after Doctor Plesington had
                  removed his wrappings and sat thawing before the fire.
               "The good shepherd knows no cold or heat when the welfare of his flock demands his
                  care," said Isaacs with an irony which was not lost on the Reverend Divine.
               "But come," said Mr. Hearsey, who was anxious to proceed to business, "this
                  meeting was appointed to take into consideration the best ways and means of
                  securing the passage of the Grand Consolidated Railway Land Grant Bill."
               DOCTOR PLESINGTON. Will Mr. Hearsey please to state exactly where we stand
                  to-night, in order tint we may know precisely what has been done and what yet
                  remains to be accomplished?
               MR. HEARSEY. About twelve months ago, a few gentlemen conceived a noble
                  enterprise. It was the patriotic idea of consolidating two proposed great lines of
                  railroad and of obtaining from the government a grant of public lands sufficient
                  to build and equip both roads and put them in operation for the public
                  welfare.
               MR. ISAACS. The land provided to be granted is actually worth to-day three times
                  all that the road will cost when finished and equiped; ten years from now it will
                  be worth, in good hard money, one hundred times as much. Do we risk such vast sums
                  of money to secure the passage of a bill which will end in being merely a public
                  benefaction!
               MR. HEARSEY. That is all understood between us.
               DOCTOR PLESINGTON. Certainly.
               MR. ISAACS. There is no other human being in the house except ourselves and my old
                  deaf housekeeper; and as we are not talking to see ourselves reported in the
                  morning papers, we might as well talk business in a business manner, and dispense
                  with the popular slang of the politicians, editors and preachers. Will Mr. Hearsey
                  proceed.
               MR. HEARSEY. A new company of corporators was accordingly constituted, composed of
                  the principal men of both the other two companies, and these two companies were
                  formally dissolved. There exists now but one company, and I have the honor to be
                  its President. We have been organized about ten months and at the beginning of the
                  last session of this Congress, our bill, the Grand Consolidated Railway Land Grant
                  Bill, was introduced by one of our friends in the House of Representatives and
                  refered to the appropriate committee. Ever since the introduction of our bill, we
                  have confined our energies to interesting members of Congress and other persons of
                  influence in our scheme.
               MR. ISAACS. I hold in my hand a book containing memoranda of the amount of funds
                  already expended in the prosecution of our plans. In most cases of payments, I
                  hold vouchers to account for the funds disbursed. In some cases, you will readily
                  understand that to obtain such vouchers was impracticable, the persons receiving
                  the money not wishing to give any written acknowledgments which might possibly
                  show hereafter that they had been in any manner connected with our company.
               I have separated the accounts into two classes. The first class comprises all
                  those, accounts in which vouchers were given. The accounts have been generalized
                  for convenience in some instances, but the vouchers are ready for an exhibit in
                  every specific payment, I will read the memoranda:

                   which is the precise amount which we have expended up to date in
                  endeavoring to secure the passage of the Grand Consolidated Railway Land Grant
                  Bill.
               DOCTOR PLESINGTON. I think I may say that the portion of the fund which was
                  expended under my supervision has brought forth fruits. The moral sentiment of the
                  christian people of the country in regard to the bill is right. The churches are a
                  unit in its advocacy. The roads open up new channels for christian civilization.
                  Churches and school houses will spring up in the wilderness; the desert shall
                  blossom as the rose, and new fields will be opened for the ministers of salvation
                  bearing good tidings.
               MR. ISAACS. A true christian worker!
               MR. HEARSEY. It was a part of my duty to regulate the press of the country. I have
                  expended a heavy sum of money in this direction, but I am satisfied that it has
                  not been misapplied. Though the influence of the newspapers in moulding public
                  opinion has somewhat declined, yet their power is still enormous. None embarking
                  in a grand enterprise like ours can afford to have the press arrayed against them.
                  And the only way to secure it is to subsidize it. In my interviews with the
                  gentlemen proprietors. I hinted at what seemed to me to be the extravagance of
                  their charges. But they convinced me by a recital of prices paid in various
                  similar but smaller transactions that their rates were not unreasonable for the
                  services required.
               MR. ISAACS. I bought up your members of Congress, judges, department officers,
                  confidential clerks, popular lectures, negro minstrels and comedians as cheap as
                  they would sell.
               MR. HEARSEY. Our majority is sure in the House.
               DOCTOR PLESINGTON. We only want the Senator with us to secure the speedy and
                  certain passage of our measure. I do not see how he can hold out much longer.
               MR. ISAACS. Do you know how to bring him around?
               DOCTOR PLESINGTON. I must confess that I have brought every consideration to bear
                  upon him, but without effect.
               MR. HEARSEY. He is the most remarkable man with whom I ever came in contact. Pride
                  of opinion seems to be his ruling passion; for the most magnificent proffers of
                  reward delicately hinted fail to move him in the least degree.
               MR. ISAACS. And yet he has his price if you can find out what it is.
               MR. HEARSEY. This is the last session of this Congress, and what is done must be
                  done quickly.
               DOCTOR PLESINGTON. All the work we have done will be lost if this Congress goes
                  home without passing the bill. We shall have to begin anew with the next
                  Congress.
               MR. ISAACS. A way MUST be found to silence the Senator's opposition, and it WILL
                  be found. The bill will be passed this sessionâ€”if not by one means, why then by
                  another. But let us three here to-night come to a final understanding and
                  agreement about our own mutual relations and interests in the enterprise after the
                  bill has passed. State your understanding, Mr. Hearsey.
               MR. HEARSEY. The corporation of which I am the President is already organized ized
                  and chartered. "When the land is granted, it will be given to us finally,
                  irrevocably and absolutely. The only condition attached is that we shall construct
                  the road in a reasonable time. This, of course, we propose to do, A fund of ten
                  million was to be raised to secure the necessary legislation. The London firm
                  which you represent advanced nine of the ten millions and we advanced one million.
                  It was a pure venture. In consideration of the nine millions advanced by your firm
                  I was specially instructed by the company to enter into a treaty with your firm in
                  London through yourself as its agent. The terms of the treaty I am now authorized
                  and instructed to make are the following:
               You will advance all the funds necessary to build the road and put it in operation
                  as required by the bill. You are to receive twelve per cent interest on the amount
                  so advanced, and shall receive as a security a mortgage on every acre of the land
                  granted by Congress. You are to receive in addition certificates of stock as the
                  funds are paid in, sufficient to give you the control of the road.
               DOCTOR PLESINGTON. I have been appointed in the nature of a trustee for the
                  Company to join Mr. Hearsey in executing this contract.
               MR. ISAACS. Gentlemen, the articles are ready for signature. I shall not fail to
                  comply with my part of the stipulations.
               MR. I. produced the articles and handed them to Mr. Hearsey who read them aloud
                  that Doctor Plesington might hear them. They had been properly framed and were
                  entirely satisfactory. Mr. Hearsey signed and attached the seal of the corporation
                  which he had brought with him for the purpose. Doctor Plesington signed after him
                  and then Isaacs signed last. Copies were signed in like manner and exchanged and
                  the contract was executed.
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               COMPENSATION.
               George Hales continued to visit Rose. He delayed a week after he made his first
                  visit until he made his second one. But the time hung so heavily upon his hands
                  and he became so nervous and restless thinking about her that he made two visits
                  the second week, and three the week following that. He had but few acquaintances
                  and no intimate friends and scarcely ever mingled in society. He now passed most
                  of his evenings with Rose and was quite domesticated in her little parlor.
               And Rose, too, she would stand at the window in the evenings and watch to see his
                  form pass the gas-light on the corner. And she loved to hear his footsteps in the
                  hall and to open the door for him and welcome him in.
               Rose continued to translate Italian stories and Hales paid her the little wages
                  agreed upon punctually at the end of every week, which was enough to pay her
                  little rent; and as she did not eat much more than a bird and only kept one lire
                  in a tiny parlor stove and did her own house-work, the price paid by Madame
                  Zarowski for the picture she had bought on her first visit would supply one of her
                  simple tastes with everything she needed for a month. Her wardrobe was well
                  furnished and the work that Madame Zarowski had given her would keep her
                  profitably employed for an indefinite time.
               But the evenings which she and Hales passed together were not entirely devoted to
                  Italian literature. They would have the most interesting possible con vernal ions;
                  sometimes Hales would read her selections from the best philosophical literature
                  of the day and follow it up with explanations and illustrations, and sometimes he
                  would read her one of his own nervously written logical articles on some social
                  question, or one of his novellettes and ask her for suggestions; sometimes Rose
                  would sing him one of those sweet songs of Southern France and accompany it with
                  the music of her cithern. And then Hales would forget for a moment the inexorable
                  chain of circumstances which bound him down and surrender himself to the visions
                  of his mystical imagination and wander away among the golden temples of the
                  future, for which he was unconsciously helping to lay the foundations.
               Occasionally on fine days the pair would start out early in the morning and
                     pass the day among the hills which
                  overlook the dome and the broad flowing river; and at noon they would sit down
                  together on the trunk of a fallen tree, near a clear strong spring which bubbled
                  up among the gnarled roots of a poplar, and make their simple repast. There were
                  some line ladies who lived in fine houses across the street who knew Rose well by
                  sight, who envied the two their youth, their beauty and their love, when they saw
                  them start out on their excursions, and who would gladly have exchanged places
                  with Rose, as she went tripping along with a little basket on her arm and looking
                  so radiant and happy.
               Hales was rapidly beginning to look upon Rose's parlor as his own proper home.
                  Already he had brought some of his books and papers and left them there, and some
                  evenings he would sit there and write, while Rose would read or sew. Upon these
                  evenings Rose would always prepare sandwiches and a cup of coffee, and give Hales
                  permission to smoke a cigar.
               The relation, though innocent, existing between them, would not have been approved
                  by the Reverend Doctor Charles Plesington. That gentleman's happiness, it is true,
                  would have been complete on earth had he occupied a much nearer relation to Madame
                  Zarowski. But then society had its proprieties.
               Meanwhile, Hales and Rose were profoundly ignorant and indifferent as to what
                  society might think or say about them. Rose had never been trained in its ways to
                  begin with, and Hales had been lighting shams and falsehoods all his life. They
                  owed society nothing arid asked none of its favors. They were a law unto
                  themselves and constituted a society of their own and never dreamed that they were
                  bold and defiant or heroic or anything of the kind. They followed the laws and
                  impulses of natural affection and of their own hearts. They loved each other and
                  were happy. Society might go its way. As long as they could compel it to permit
                  them to exist, it would do so; when they could no longer compel it, it would leave
                  themâ€”to stave; as it had millions of times before left the old, the sick, the
                  decrepit and the infirm to starve, when they could no longer toil for it.
               The good spirits held companionship with Hales and Rose. Their hearts were pure
                  and their souls were at peace. Their days were full of joy, and at night their
                  sleep was calm and sweet. In their dreams they would meet each other again in the
                  Spirit Land and their spirits would blend and mingle there in that unity which
                  completes the soul and perfects its happiness on the other side of the dark river
                  of Death.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               THE REPORT.
               About a fortnight after the meeting of Doctor Plesington, Mr. Hearsey and Mr.
                  Isaacs to discuss the Grand Consolidated Railway Land Grant Bill, a man enveloped
                  in a great fur coat, and wearing a tall rimless fur cap, opened the iron gate and
                  passed up the marble steps into the porch of Madame Zarowski's house and rang the
                  bell. It was about dusk, and the face of the man was almost entirely concealed by
                  the great cap and the muffler of his coat. He might have been an artist, or a
                  peddler of the better class, for he carried two elegant bronze statuettes, one
                  under each of his arms, which were folded on his breast.
               It was no other than Isaacs, the Jew, who had come to pay the Madame a visit, and,
                  for certain reasons of his own, desired that it should be kept secret.
               He handed his cap and gloves to the servant who opened the door, with an air and
                  tone of authority and ordered the servant to announce him.
               He merely intended to give Madame Zarowski notice, so that he might not intrude on
                  her privacy, for he followed the servant up and entered the reception room, where
                  Rose had met the Senator, at the same time with the servant.
               "The compliments of the season, and how goes it with her ladyship; has she brought
                  the haughty statesman to her feet or has the pretty little Gipsy stolen him soul
                  and body away? Matters of greater interest have detained me or I should have been
                  here sooner. Speak and tell me quick what you have done. Time presses I have much
                  to accomplish yet to-nigh," began the Jew in a hurried and impetuous manner and
                  insolent tone.
               "I wish you could cease to mock me, Isaacs; my situation is sufficiently
                  distressing without the addition of your heartless irony," replied the lady.
               "Irony! My dear Irene," continued the Jew, "the good angels will smile at your
                  blessed work; you have coupled two loving bosoms; the Senator's affection for the
                  Gipsy is so pure and warm; so entirely unselfish; he! he! so solely devoted to the
                  happiness of its object, eh?"
               Madame Zarowski remained silent.
               "Did the Senator meet her here."
               "He did."
               "Did she inflame his passion?"
               "She did."
               "What was his manner?"
               "Rash and impetuous."
               "Fool!"
               "But she repelled his advances."
               "Only fans his desire."
               "The interview was brief; she became offended at his familiarity and took her
                  leave before he had an opportunity for any any further gallantry."
               "Was the baggage not over-powered with your patronage and the splendor of your
                  establishment?"
               "On the contrary; she appeared quite unmoved."
               "She has visited you since, and met him?"
               "Yes."
               "With what results?"
               "He took care not to repeat his first mistake and restrained his impatience."
               "Had his passion cooled since the first rebuff?"
               "No; it was fiercer than ever."
               "And she?"
               "Was utterly indifferent to him."
               "She is young; perhaps she has a lover?"
               "She has."
               "Who is he?"
               "One Hales, a writer and journalist."
               The Jew paused for a moment and then resumed his interrogations.
               "She does not suspect you?"
               "No."
               "She will continue her visits?"
               "Yes."
               "And the Senator?"
               "Will of course do the same as long as he meets her here."
               It required all of Madame Zarowski's strengthâ€”and she was strongâ€”to undergo this
                  terrible ordeal. Though cold and selfish and though she could be cruel when her
                  plans required it, she was not naturally wicked and never inflicted pain out of
                  pure love of cruelty. The Jew had taken care to make her feel most keenly the
                  degradation which the task he had imposed upon her brought with it. Not satisfied
                  with this, he had laid bare her own fatal passion for the Senator and made it the
                  object of ridicule. He had trampled her in the dust and mocked at her humiliation.
                  Madame Zarowski was prostrate in the dust before him. She was like the leopardess
                  whose fierce eyes would gleam and blaze in the absence of her keeper, but which
                  would crouch and cringe in terror when its keeper entered the cage with his
                  red-hot iron bars.
               "You promised one day to set me free, Isaacs," said Madame Zarowski after a
                  moment's silence.
               "Yes; when I have no further use for you I shall do so," replied the Jew.
               "I have served you faithfully," she pleaded.
               "And with good reason," replied the Jew; "most women would prefer your rank and
                  your life of ease and luxury and the privilege of eating my bread and of giving
                  out to the world without fear of contradiction that this magnificently furnished
                     house which is my property was their
                  own, as you doâ€”I say most women would prefer this, to being published as I could
                  publish you, and to take the final plunge from the work-house to the Water street
                  dance-houses and the pauper's burying groud; eh?"
               A death like pallor came over Madame Zarowski's face but her nerves did not fail
                  her. She made no further plea or protest. She was silent and calm.
               "Hear me, Irene." said the Jew, "spare no art or intrigue to subdue Rose to the
                  wishes of the Senator. Continue to keep yourself informed through my servants who
                  attend you of all her movements, as you have done. Entice her with follies and
                  fashions. Encourage in her a love of display and of dissipating amusements. Excite
                  her vanity and supply her freely with all the means necessary for its largest
                  gratification. As she is more beautiful than other women, create in her the
                  ambition to outshine them in the world of fashion. For these purposes you may draw
                  to an unlimited extent on the bank account placed to your credit. If you succeed
                  in accomplishing this, she lies helpless and powerless at your disposal. Ambition,
                  luxury and fashion will soon drive that miserable scribbler Hales from her
                  thoughts. For the gratification of these passions, which will have become a second
                  nature, she will be dependent upon you for the means. If you withhold them, you
                  will dry up the sources of her life and being. Then the sacrifice will be ready
                  and the dead old artist's pretty daughter will play her part in the comedy
                  entitled, "The Grand Consolidated Railway Land Grant Bill." Meanwhile, manage to
                  bring the two together as frequently as possible and advise with the Senator as to
                  the best method of prosecuting his suit. The fact that you love him yourself will
                  better enable you to explain to him those secret arts and influences, which are
                  most likely to succeed in this combined attack of both of you on the heart of your
                  proposed rival. And to quicken your wits and energies I give you my promise that
                  when you have accomplished this task and secured the Senator for the Grand
                  Consolidated Railway Land Grant Bill I will let you go."
               Haying said these words and muffled his face, Isaacs left her abruptly as he had
                  come, without waiting a reply. He did not carry the bronze statuettes away with
                  him.
               "She has a lover," he muttered to himself as he went along. "I know him, a
                  dangerous man and not without influence on the Senator. There is another hand
                  needed in this business. I want one more partner and I know where to find
                  him."
               Pursuing these meditations, Isaacs reached his chamber, and forthwith proceeded'
                  to unlock a secret closet, take out the great greasy overcoat, the battered
                  cylinder and ragged red cravat, the huge breast pin and grizzled wig and whiskers,
                  and packed them away in his valise.
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               SPIRITUALISM.
               The evening after Isaacs visit, Madame Zarowski was favored with a call from
                  Doctor Plesington.
               Neither this gentleman or Mr. Hearsey knew anything about the relation existing
                  between Isaacs and Madame Zarowski. This was a profound secret, known only to the
                  two persons themselves and to the confidential servants that Isaacs had placed
                  with Madame Zarowski to act as spies upon her movements. In fact they had been
                  introduced at Mrs. Hearsey's party as though they really were entire strangers to
                  each other, and both had united to maintain the delusion.
               When the Doctor's name was announced, Madame Zarowski sent him word to be kind
                  enough to wait a few minutes in the ante-room until she was prepared to receive
                  him.
               She kept him waiting full an hour. And though the ante-room was warm and
                  comfortable and well provided with files of newspapers, reports, periodicals and
                  quite a variety of books, Doctor Plesington began to grow nervous before the time
                  of his probation expired, especially when he thought of his ridiculous situation
                  and the amusement it would afford the public should it become generally known.
               While her admirer was waiting without, Madame Zarowski was finishing up the labors
                  of the day.
               She had before her two books; one large one and one small one. At the head of
                  every left hand page in the larger one was written in a bold, full hand, the name
                  of a member of Congress. Then after a vacant line the name of a female was written
                  in a small fine hand in red ink on the margin outside of the perpendicular red
                  line on the left. On the body of the page, and commencing at the name written on
                  the margin, were notes. Then came a vacant space and another female name on the
                  margin and notes as before. And so on following. The two pages allotted to each
                  member were nearly all tilled, and under many names the two pages were not
                  sufficient, and additional leaves had been gummed in to furnish the necessary
                  space. The notes related to the particular kind of influence that each lady was to
                  bring to bear upon the member whose name stood at the head of the page and to the
                  results which bad been accomplished by these efforts.
               The smaller book contained the names of the members and the ladies arranged in the
                  same manner but without the notes. Opposite each lady's name were dates and
                  figures, representing sums of money which had been paid them or presents which
                  they had received. Entries in this book would run thus: 
                     Ione St. Clare, Dec. 21, 18â€”, $100 00.
                     Lilly De Vere, Jan. 5, 18â€”, Velvets.
                     Maud Melville,, Jan. 10,18â€”, Diamonds.
                  
               
               The names were fictitious to avoid exposure in case the book should he mislaid or
                  stolen, but they all represented real persons. Doctor Plesington had a similar
                  record at home, showing the amount of money he had expended to "produce the grand
                  moral sentiment of the Christian world in favor of the Grand Consolidated Railway
                  Land Grant Bill." So had Mr. Hearsey. But neither of these two co-laborers with
                  Mr. Isaacs supposed for a moment that Madame Zarowski was similarly occupied.
                  These two sagacious men of the world took her to be exactly what she gave herself
                  out to beâ€”a wealthy and fashionable lady of American birth and education who bad
                  married a Polish count, spent much of her time in Europe, had lost her husband and
                  who devoted that part of her time which was not given to society to literature,
                  and who proposed to spend the winter in the city for the express purpose of
                  gathering the material for a volume she intended to publish, which was to be
                  entitled "Recollections of a Winter in Washington."
               When Madame Zarowski had finished up her entries and notes, she locked up her
                  books carefully in an elegant rose-wood secretary, put the key in her pocket and
                  opened the door and said, "Doctor Plesington, come."
               Doctor Plesington was a generous liver and possessed a robust and vigorous
                  constitution and was not easily thrown off his guard; but the sweet and gentle
                  manner in which Madame Zarowski had uttered the words, "Doctor Plesington, come;"
                  taken in connection with the fact that she had opened the door herself instead of
                  ringing for a servant, caused a tingling sensation to quiver over the surface of
                  his nerves.
               Madame Zarowski might not have been expected to have been in a very gracious mood
                  towards a lover to whom she was indifferent and who really annoyed her with his
                  attentions, so soon after she had entirely lost the Senator and been interviewed
                  by Isaacs. But she was a prudent woman and had been thinking. Her situation was a
                  desperate one. She was completely at the mercy of Isaacs, and did not know how
                  soon she might need a friend. Upon Doctor Plesington she could rely HO long as she
                  gave him a little hope and maintained her own high position in the world of
                  fashion; so she relaxed her manner towards him and became gracious.
               Doctor Plesington entered in his oiliest manner and composed himself in a great
                  fauteuil.
               "Some time since I have had the pleasure of seeing you, Doctor," began Madame
                  Zarowski, with a deprecatory air, as if vexed at the Doctor's neglect; and yet in
                  a tone of such mingled sweetness and Badness that the Doctor'8 heart fairly
                  dissolved in an ecstasy.
               "My dear Zarowskiâ€”my dear Madame I meanâ€”"
               "No formulae among true friends, my dear Doctor," said Madame re-assuring him in
                  the kindest manner.
               "Well, then, my dear Zarowski," said the amorous Divine, drawing the fauteuil
                  nearer to the sofa where Madame rather reclined than sat, "your own merits more than the commanding position you occupy
                  in our society has frequently given rise to a wish on my part for your more
                  intimate personal acquaintance."
               "Which was reciprocated on the part of your humble servant," replied Madame
                  Zarowski, with a languishing look.
               The fauteuil approached again and the dialogue continued.
               DR. PLESINGTON. Two considerations concurred to prevent the fulfilment of my
                  wishes. First. I feared that among your numerous friends and admirers you would
                  find so many whose pursuits in life, not being so grave as mine, could with
                  propriety entertain one of your happy and joyous nature in a manner which, while
                  eminently proper for them, would not, in the eyes of the world, be consistent with
                  the dignity of ray calling. Second. I was aware that you devoted that portion of
                  your time which was not given to the discharge of your social duties to literary
                  pursuits; and I was not disposed to trespass on your valuable time.
               ZAROWSKI. But I am not actually engaged in writing now. I am merely gathering the
                  materials for my book, which, as you know, I intend to call "Recollections of a
                  Winter in Washington." So if my friends desire to aid me in my work, they will
                  visit me and gossip with me as frequently as they conveniently can. Again the
                  fauteuil drew nearer.
               Doctor Plesington could express himself forcibly and could deal in plausible logic
                  when he thought it expedient to lay aside the oratorico-pulpit style; for he was a
                  man of the world. Upon this occasion he thought it expedient to do so, after
                  having made a few flourishes of the clerical school at the beginning.
               He proceeded.
               "Your book will certainly be an interesting one if its contents meet the bill on
                  the title page."
               "That will depend upon the extent and interest of the author's experience," said
                  Madame Zarowski.
               DR. PLESINGTON. Will you treat the subject generally or confine yourself to a few
                  principal topics?
               ZAROWSKI. Principally the latter. I shall first take a brief and comprehensive
                  view and then give particular attention to those points which would be most likely
                  to interest a stranger visiting our shores. There will be nothing specially
                  Washingtonian about the book; I might equally well have substituted the name
                  Boston or New York. But I happened to be here and so I said Washington.
               DR. PLESINGTON. What particular feature of American civilization would you single
                  out as the one which would strike the educated foreigner with the greatest
                  force?
               ZAROWSKI. The religious element.
               DR. PLESINGTON. You surprise me.
               ZAROWSKI. That may well be. The religious spirit exerts less influence on our,
                  professional religious teachers than on any other class of persons.
               DR. PLESINGTON. Be kind enough to explain.
               ZAROWSKI. The connection between Church and State existing in Europe creates the
                  same hostility against the former that naturally exists against the latter. The
                  masses of the people look upon both as acting in concert and mutually supporting
                  each other in pressing them down. A feeling somewhat akin, to this exists in this
                  country towards our fashionable churches. Here this a mere prejudice. These
                  churches are merely the creatures of society, so-called, and neither exert an
                  influence on government or on the people, outside of their own limited circle.
                  Their best efforts are always due to the religious spirit which presses upon them
                  from the outside. The churches clung to slavery to the last, and yielded when they
                  could no longer resist, to the principles of a philosophy in exact opposition to
                  the ground teachings of their formal confessions.
               DR. PLESINGTON. The churches received the credit of emancipation at all
                  events.
               ZAROWSKI. To show that they did not merit it, it is only necessary to note that
                  they utterly repudiate the principles upon which abolition was waged, and which
                  alone can justify the abolition. The condition of slavery irrelative.
                     Absolute slavery never did exist in this country. The slave
                     did have rights which his master was bound to respect, and that,
                  too, by the laws of every slave commonwealth. Masters could not take the lives of
                  their slaves, and some have been hanged for doing so. The black slaves were more
                  enslaved than the white slaves. That was all. The masters of the black slaves
                  commanded their labor without any compensation. The masters of the white slaves
                  command their labor for an inadequate compensation. The only
                  difference between the two classes consists in the degree and not in the
                     nature of the enslavement. If the churches were honest, they would
                  advocate the emancipation of the race on precisely the same principles that the
                  abolition of slavery was demandedâ€”human rightsâ€”but they do not. On the contrary,
                  with an ignorance equal to their inconsistency, they appeal to the rabble and lead
                  them on in hurling the cries of "socialism" and "infidelity" against the radical
                  thinkers of the day who are merely repeating the doctrines proclaimed in Judea
                  over eighteen hundred years ago.
               DR. PLESINGTON. But the outside religious spirit of which you speak possesses no
                  forms through which to express itself. I mean it is not organized.
               ZAROWSKI. If it has no organization it has vital force, and organization will
                  naturally take place at the proper time. As to forms, it expresses itself through
                  all forma and is now struggling for a fuller and a freeer expression. If the
                  churches have organization, that is all they do have, except their money; for
                  their fires are long burnt out and only ashes and dead coals remain.
               DR. PLESINGTON. I suppose you regard spiritualism as one of the forms through
                  which this religious spirit expresses itself?
               ZAROWSKI. I do not regard spiritualism as a form at all. It is a sentiment. It
                  cannot be put down with printers' ink in thirty-nine, or in any other number of
                  articles.
               DR. PLESINGTON. But if spiritualism mean anything at all, surely language, which
                  is the expression of thought, can convey some conception, however limited, of what
                  it is.
               ZAROWSKI. Spiritualism is a profound truth. As I stated, it is a sentiment and
                  cannot be conveyed in symbols, either of sounds or of letters, which are only
                  appropriate to represent definite conceptions. What is soul? What is sense? When
                  you define these, I will explain what I mean when I say that the essence of
                  spiritualism consists in the union it makes between soul and sense. The heathen
                  religions ignored soul; the Christian religion ignores sense. Spiritualism
                  recognizes both.
               DOCTOR PLESINGTON. In that view of spiritualism I find it ineffably sweet.
               Madame Zarowski languished in the corner of the sofa. Her head had reclined
                  backward and reposed softly on the silk covered cushion, exposing her full round
                  neck and affording a glimpse of a dainty bit of her bosom of snow. The flowing
                  folds of her robe were gathered up on the sofa and a pair of charming little feet,
                  encased in bright brown silk stockings and slippers of blue satin, peeped out,
                  exhibiting a pair of ankles of faultless mould and beauty. One arm rested on the
                  back of the sofa and the other was under her neck.
               Doctor Plesington hitched the great fauteuil nearer to the sofa and continued:
               "Considered from this standpoint, spiritualism is the natural religion of
                  humanity. The union of soul and sense! There is a coarseness and brutality
                  inseparably connected in the average mind with the enjoyments of sense, which
                  places moral sentiment in direct conflict with the sweet operations of nature's
                  laws. It is the province of spiritualism to end this conflict by harmonizing the
                  two opposing elements. With spiritualism, the Absolute is the Real, and the most
                  ravishing delights of sense make up the highest and finest joys of the soul.
                  Spiritualism sees no state or condition, present or future, where these two
                  elements are not combined to constitute the individual unit of personal conscious
                  existence. The one supplements the other and makes it round and complete, which by
                  itself is only a fragment of the whole. To sever this union is to mutilate and
                  degrade humanity; to enjoy both in their fullest extent together is its chief
                  excellence. As the longings and desires of Soul and Sense cannot be suppressed by
                  arbitrary laws and enactments, spiritualism teaches that true manhood and true
                  womanhood will disregard the police regulations of society and put themselves in
                  harmony with nature, where alone true happiness is to be enjoyed. But these
                  speculations are not for the vulgar herd. They would be misunderstood and
                  misapplied. And above all things, would it be improper for a clergyman like
                  myself, officiating in one of the most respectable of churches, to give expression
                  to any such opinions. But my dear Zarowski, we are the Gymnosophists and have an
                  esoteric doctrine for ourselves and an exoteric one which we give to the rabble,
                  of spiritualism is that it reveals the secrets of our order."
               Doctor Plesington drew the fauteuil quite close to Madame Zarowski and rested his
                  arm upon that end of the sofa where her head was reclining.
               
               "How often" he said, "have I felt even in the moments of my highest exaltation,
                  the want of something to render my satisfaction complete and full. I have watched
                  at sunset the changing colors die away as they fell on the landscape of hill and
                  dale and river and ravine and lake and plain and forest. I have stood upon the
                  shores of the boundless ocean and watched the sails of the distant ships; I have
                  stood among the solitudes of the mountain peaks and viewed the sombre and solemn
                  grandeur of nature; I have been transported from earth on the enrapturing strains
                  of music; I have watched the white cranes suspended high in heaven, slowly winging
                  their way to sunny Southern lands, but amid all these scenes and emotions the
                  heart was not yet satisfied. Something was wanting still."
               "But these moments of combined spiritual and sensual delight are of brief
                  duration, my dear Plesington," she resumed, with a wearied look and tone, "and we
                  must descend from our supernal heights, and come down and perform our several
                  tasks in the world of practical business life."
               "Only to renew our strength for similar enjoyments in the future," observed the
                  Doctor in the true spirit of the Epicurean philosophy.
               "For instance, in the matter of the Grand Consolidated Railway Land Grant Bill,"
                  remarked Madame Zarowski with a significant smile.
               Doctor Plesington looked startled. He had been so deeply interested with Hearsey
                  and Isaacs about the bill, and so deeply interested with Madame Zarowski in
                  affairs of love, that he had never connected her image with the Grand Consolidated
                  Bail-way Land Grant Bill, in all his thoughts.
               Madame Zarowski saw his surprise and went on to explain.
               "It ought not to appear surprising that a lady of such extensive acquaintance as I
                  have in the city, and possessing fair powers of observation, should know something
                  about this gigantic scheme. At Mrs. Hearsey's party, I observed her husband
                  engaged in earnest conversation with a Mr. Isaacs, a financial agent of a house in
                  London, and with the Senator. I suspected from the fact that the Senator is the
                  only barrier to the passage of the billâ€”of which fact I am informed by some of my
                  numerous lady visitors who know much more of the matter than I doâ€”that Messrs.
                  Isaacs and Hearsey were endeavoring to overcome his objections. And then, judging
                  from your intimacy with Mr. Hearsey, and your active support of the bill in your
                  own circle, and I might add," continued the Madame, with a roguish cast of her
                  eyes upon the Doctor, "from your naughty attentions to Mrs. Hearseyâ€”"
               "My dearest Zarowski! I protest that I neverâ€”"
               "that you yourself were somehow interested in the enterprise. Now, I will pardon
                  your infidelity to me."
               "Dearestâ€”"
               "upon on condition, and that is that you tell me all you know about the bill."
                  "Well, then, my love, since you will not permit me to exculpate myself from a,
                  suspicion which is as groundless as itâ€”"
               "Not one word more on that subject. My jealousy is easily aroused. Proceed with
                  what you have to say, and I shall try and bury in oblivion the sad memory of your
                  faithlessness."
               After such a spontaneous gush of affection and devotion, Doctor Plesington could
                  not do less than open up the innermost chambers and recesses of his
                  confidence.
               He recapitulated in detail all that had been said and done at the meeting between
                  Hearsey, Isaacs and himself, at Isaacs' house, down to the execution of the
                  contract and the exchange of the papers.
               "But," he added in a low voice, drawing close up to Madame Zarowski, "Hearsey and
                  myself are dissatisfied with Isaacs, and have determined, to oust him when the
                  proper time arrives."
               "What is the cause of your dissatisfaction?"
               "Isaacs is an insolent and grasping Jew. His manner is dictatorial and insulting,
                  and according to the arrangement, he is to have all, and we are to be mere
                  pensioners upon his bounty."
               "But how can you possibly oust him after he has advanced the sum agreed upon, and
                  the contract has been executed?" inquired Madame Zarowski with increasing
                  interest.
               "In every great bill," said the Doctor, "which has been thoroughly canvassed,
                  there is always a greater or less period of time, which necessarily intervenes
                  between the point when it becomes absolutely certain that the bill will pass and
                  the point of time when the bill actually does pass. Do you understand?"
               "Perfectly well," answered Madame Zarowski, listening with the most intense
                  interest and eagerness.
               "It is during that critical interval that we intend to strike the blow. Mr.
                  Hearsey will shortly go to New York, where he will see a majority of the directors
                  of the company, and explain matters to them. He will remain there mostly for the
                  present, while I shall remain in Washington, to look after things here. As soon as
                  the success of the bill becomes a certainty, I shall telegraph to Mr. Hearsey in
                  cypher, to call the directors together, and have the contract with Isaacs
                  cancelled."
               "But can that be legally done?" asked Madame Zarowski.
               "Undoubtedly;" answered Dr. Plesington, "there is no difficulty whatever of that
                  kind in the way. Either party may withdraw from the agreement before the bill has
                  passed, upon payment to the other party with interest, all the money advanced by
                  that party. Our company was entirely without means when this scheme was
                  inaugurated, and we were compelled to go to the Jews. When the certainty of the
                  success of the bill is ascertained, we can readily raise the nine millions which
                  Isaacs has advanced, and pay him off, and get rid of him immediately."
               "Do you anticipate any difficulty in carrying out this plan?" inquired Madame
                  Zarowski again.
               "No serious difficulty," replied the Doctor. "Of course, Isaacs will be kept in
                  profound ignorance of our intentions; otherwise, he would defeat the bill and ruin
                  the individual directors with his charge of the nine millions in gold coin, and
                  his exorbitant interest, likewise payable in specie."
               "Will you not be required by law to give Isaacs due notice of your intentions to
                  withdraw from the contract before the passage of the bill?" continued Madame
                  Zarowski, for further information.
               "The law will be observed to the letter," said Doctor Plesington. "A notice will
                  be made out and placed in the hands of responsible witnesses, who will keep copies
                  and be able to testify that they placed it in the post-office in ample time for
                  Isaacs to have received it before the bill was passed."
               "But then," said Madame Zarowski, "you defeat your own purpose in giving Isaacs
                  the notice, before the passage of the bill."
               "Not if the post-office clerk forgets to send it," whispered Doctor
                  Plesington in Madame Zarowski's ear.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               WANTED A PARTNER.
               About eleven o'clock at night, a few days after the conversation recorded in the
                  last chapter, a shabby-looking individual might have been seen crossing City Hall
                  place in the direction of Chatham street. He wore an immense thread bare overcoat,
                  lined and stitched from top to bottom. A red cravat, ornamented with a huge brass
                  pin, was tied round his neck and he had on a cylinder hat which had been black in
                  time, but which was of a dingy red color now and badly battered. He carried in
                  each hand an oil daub, cased in a gilt wooden frame. One would have taken him for
                  a Jew with pictures to sell, had such an one been near enough to see his coarse
                  grizzly hair and note the outlines of his face.
               He entered Chatham street. The pawnbrokers were doing a driving business, but the
                  pedestrian with the pictures did not stop to offer his wares to them. Rum-sellers
                  were busy and concert-saloons blazed with gas and tawdry finery, but Isaacs, for
                  the sagacious reader has doubtless penetrated his disguise, did not stop to
                  propose a sale. He passed, without stopping, all the low, dark, foully-smelling
                  shops, where still filthier and fouler creatures vended imitation jewelry, old
                  clothes, cheap clothing and stolen goods. He emerged from Chatham street Into the
                  square, where he paused for a moment as if hesitating which course to take, and
                  then proceeded up the great thoroughfare of the Bowery.
               
               He had not gone far when he dived down a flight of steps and entered a low, narrow
                  bar-room in the cellar.
               There was a dozen or more customers and loafers of both sexes, and three or four
                  ragged children standing in front of the bar. In the corner behind the counter
                  stood a double-barrelled gun, and lying on one of the shelves was a twelve-inch
                  revolver. The bar-tender, a great red whiskered man with a pock-marked face, was
                  serving the vilest whiskey and gin at five cents a glass.
               Isaacs passed his pictures to the bar-tender, who took them with a deferential
                  look and then after a hurried survey of the miserable wretches around him, he
                  opened a green baize side door in the bar-room, paid ten cents to the doorkeeper
                  who gut in the hall, arid passed through another door into the dance-room.
               The hall was some forty or fifty feet long by about half that width. It was dimly
                  lighted. At the opposite end from which he entered were three musicians, a tall,
                  bald headed man with base viol, a girl of about thirteen with a harp and a boy of
                  about sixteen, dressed in an old coat of black cotton velvet and a pair of smeared
                  white corduroy pants, with a violin. All around the walls were ranged rough wooden
                  benches, which were occupied by such of the visitors as were fortunate enough to
                  secure them during the intervals between the dances. There were from twenty to
                  thirty females present, ranging from thirteen years of age to twenty or thirtyâ€”it
                  was hard to tellâ€”participating in the amusement. There was not one among them all
                  that had the slightest vestige of beauty or freshness about her. It was impossible
                  to approximate with accuracy the ages of any of them except the youngest, and the
                  ages of these were only to be judged by their size. They all looked care-worn and
                  haggard, and bloated and pimpled from the excessive use of intoxicating liquors.
                  The faces of some of them were sallow and sunken, and their eyes large and
                  lustreless; these were the victims of consumption. Most of them were under the
                  influence of drink, and some were noisy and boisterous and obscene in their
                  language and gestures. They were dressed in every variety of costume, according to
                  their individual tastes and means. Some wore soiled and discolored tights; others
                  had donned the garb of a Scotch highlander; some were flower girls and others
                  gipseys. They had on secondhand laces and ribbons, faded and stained; cast-off
                  frippery and finery and cheap jewelry, either stolen or purchased from the shops
                  in Chatham street. They were whitened and bedizened with powders and paint, and
                  those who had any, freely exposed their dirty, yellow bosoms. Those who had none
                  made up for the deficiency by a display of still coarser attractions.
               The men were more in number than the women, but they were constantly coming and
                  going, while the women remained, unless escorted away by male companions. The men
                  were for the most part well-known to the police and were thieves of every class
                  and gradation. They bore the marks of extreme debauchery. They were filthy in
                  person and meanly clad and emitted foul odors of rum and tobacco.
               Isaacs stood for a few moments in the heated, crowded room, filled with
                  pestilential vapors, and took the men one by one in review, as if he were on the
                  look-out for some one he expected to find.
               The result of his examination seemed to be unsatisfactory, for when the signal was
                  given for the dancers to take their places, he threaded his way through the crowd
                  to the opposite end of the hall to a small bar in the corner near the musicians,
                  where the visitors were supplied with liquors. He passed a few hurried words in an
                  undertone with the bar-tender and received from him a key, with which he opened a
                  side door and entered a hall. The hall was narrow and about thirty feet long and
                  dimly lighted at the other end by a single jet of gas. On either side of the wall
                  was a row of cabinets, each cabinet about five feet wide and seven feet long. The
                  bar-keeper in the dancing hall kept the keys. Some of the cabinets were occupied.
                  The air was close, and foul with the sickening smells of corruption and
                  disease.
               Isaacs passed through this hall, and opened with a key which he took from his
                  pocket a heavy door, very strongly secured and locked in a peculiar manner.
               He entered a small room and locked the door securely behind him. A dim jet was
                  burning feebly on the side of the wall. One would have taken the room he had just
                  entered for a junk shop, to judge from the character of its contents but for the
                  fact that it had no windows, or doors, or any visible place of ingress or egress,
                  except the massive door through which Isaacs had entered. He listened
                  instinctively for a moment, All was still, except the faint noise of the dancing
                  and music. He then sprung open a false panel and passed through the aperture. He
                  replaced the panel after him, and descended a rickety, spiral stair-way. It was
                  pitch dark. He landed on a stone pavement below, and thrust his arm as far as he
                  could reach through a grated iron door which stopped his way. He found and grasped
                  a knob, or handle hanging by the wall inside. This he pulled three separate times.
                  The first time, he gave a long, steady pull; the second time, two short, quick
                  jerks, with a moment's interval between them; the third time, he gave three jerks,
                  and in rapid succession. All was as dark and silent as the grave. Presently a lamp
                  appeared at the other end of a long, vaulted subterranean passage, A moment
                  afterwards, a man appeared, and came towards the door where Isaacs stood. "Sharp
                  on time, old Israel," said the man unlocking the door and admitting him.
               "Yes, yes," said the Jew, "pusiness is pusiness, unt time is monish."
               One more passage traversed, and one more door opened and passed and closed behind
                  him, and the Jew found the end of his route.
               There was a small, red-hot stove in the vault or cell, whatever it might be
                  called, with a kettle of water simmering on the top of it. In the center of the
                  cave or den, stood a plain, round deal table, where piled up in a promiscuous heap
                  among well-filled bottles and decanters, were lemons, cigars, sugar, silks, laces,
                  chains, watches and jewelry. A pack of cards lay on the table, at which two
                  villainous looking fellows with shaggy eyebrows and gray-black whiskers, were
                  seated.
               "I vants to see dig shentlemans vot you calls Mister Nobby Dick, by myself, a
                  leettle whiles," said Isaacs, breaking the object of his mission, in the genuine
                  Israelitish tone and accent.
               Isaacs' conductor nodded to the two men at the table, and they withdrew through a
                  dark aperture in the rough stone wall, into a passage or vault, leading in a
                  nearly opposite direction to the one by which Isaacs had entered. When the sounds
                  of their footsteps had died away in the distance, Isaacs closed the thick, sheet
                  iron door through which they had made their exit, and continued: "You knows me,
                  Mister Nobby Dick, and you gifs me one peeps yesterdays, on Shatum streets, unt
                  tells me to come and see you here to-nights."
               "Well, old Israel, come to swindle me out of my hard earned merchandise again, I
                  suppose?" said Nobby Dick.
               "I buys noting from you dis long times; I see you not also dis long times; I have
                  no pusiness mit you dis long times; once I buys one vatch from you, Mister Nobby
                  Dick, eh?"
               "Yes," said this worthy, "a heavy, fine gold chronometer; you paid me ten dollars
                  for it; it was worth two hundred and fifty."
               "Then why you no sells him to somebody else? But I buys no more tings, Mister
                  Nobby Dick," said the Jew, slowly shaking his head.
               "What do you mean," roared Nobby Dick in a deep and threatning voice and tone.
               "Mebbe you don't know who dat vatch belongs to, eh?"
               Nobby Dick gave a start.
               "Dat vatch gets me into droubles some days," said the Jew forlornly, "and you pays
                  me back my monish ven I lose dat vatch."
               Nobby Dick jumped from his seat and was about to take the Jew by the throat, when
                  that indefatigable man of business asked him to wait just one moment, and hear
                  what he had to say, before he was strangled.
               Nobby Dick desisted and the Jew resumed:
               "De man vat owned dat vatch is dead. De harbor police find his body in de vater.
                  De man vat sell de murdered man de vatch know de kind and de number of de vatch.
                  Dat vatch you sell me."
               "Death and damnation!" exclaimed Nobby Dick, "but day-light will never shine on
                  you again, cursed dog of a traitorous Jew!"
               Nobby Dick drew a knife from behind his back, and with eyes glaring like a
                  tiger's, advanced toward the Jew.
               "De man vat owned de vatch was murdered mit a shlung, unt de shlung unt one of de
                  bills vat vas in his possession is mit de police, unt de police is ail around dis
                  house," cooly observed the imperturbable Jew.
               Nobby Dick let fall his arm and seated himself and told Isaacs to explain.
               Isaacs did so.
               "You sees dat de police does not knows dat you is here in de house. I tells de
                     police I comes here to looks for you,
                  unt de police waits outside till I come back. De vatch, de shlung unt de bill is
                  all in one leetle case vat belongs to me de police sealed up; de police does not
                  knows vat is in de box all sealed up, unt I tells de police to keep all dem dings
                  till I comes back once. If I don't comes back to nights, de police opens dat box
                  unt finds dem dings, mit one letter which explains it all; who was murdered, de
                  jeweler vat sold de vatch, unt de man vat identify de shlung, unt de man vot
                  fished him up out of de river, unt de man vat identify de bill, unt de man vat got
                  him from you. You vants to know how I gets all dem dings? Vell, I gets dem all mit
                  my time hunting for dem ven I find de number of de vatch advertised in de paper,
                  unt I vastes my time unt I pays my monish. I tells you no more now. I can hang you
                  Mister Nobby Dick."
               Nobby Dick's hand sought the handle of his knife, but his better judgment
                  prevailed.
               "Well, then," said Nobby Dick, "what do you want, for I know you did not come here
                  to do me a good turn or to risk your life in my hands for nothing. Speak and tell
                  me what is your price for my life. Tell me what I am to do to get those evidences
                  out of your hands and be free. Is it murder? Yes; I will commit one more, or two,
                  if necessary to cover up the first. Why not? "It's always the way. Speak and
                  command me. But mark me, Jew, if you play false, this knife shall find your heart
                  before I find the gallows. Speak."
               Isaacs turned his face for a moment from Nobby Dick, and when he turned it towards
                  him again, Nobby Dick, accustomed as he was to disguises, was astounded at the
                  transformation.
               "Now that we understand each other," said Isaacs, dropping his barborous jargon,
                  "disguise is no longer necessary. Though you are totally unacquainted with me, I
                  have known and liked you since our first acquaintance. Otherwise I should not have
                  been at the trouble and taken the time and paid detectives to track up the
                  evidence against you, and taken care so to manage the investigation that even the
                  detectives themselves whom I employed were kept utterly ignorant of what they were
                  doing, and could pick up no possible clue upon which to begin a new investigation
                  hereafter. It is unnecessary to go further into detail than to state that ray real
                  object in making your acquaintance some months agoâ€”which I did under the pretext
                  of wanting to buy your stolen goods and actually buying a watchâ€”was to secure your
                  services in some jobs of my own, in which I could have paid you more money than
                  yon were making and where your own personal risk would have been much less. But
                  though you pleased me, I could get no hold upon you to secure your fidelity.
                  Fortunately, however, the watch which I purchased gave me the clue to the
                  discovery which I have made, and I have been able to run you down as I have
                  explained, Your neck is in my hands, but the police will never know the fate of
                  the man picked up in the harbor, unless I furnish them with the information. Now,
                  if you are willing to enter my service, and shrink from no deed that I may require
                  you to perform, in consideration of heavy wagesâ€”for I am richâ€”and silence on my
                  part, call on me privately to-morrow morning, at nine o'clock, over the Lake on
                  the Square, and we will arrange the terms. There is nothing serious on hands now,
                  and there may not be at all; This much for your present satisfaction. And now,
                  Mr.â€”Mr.â€”Tyrrellâ€”henceforth that shall be your nameâ€”good night!"
               Without waiting a reply, Isaacs put on his wig and whiskers and greasy, threadbare
                  overcoat and emerged into the dancing room by the way he came, took his pictures
                  from the bar-keeper and passed into the street.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               SPECKS OP CLOUD.
               Rose and Hales continued to love each other and to pass their evenings together.
                  Rose was busy as a bee all day long with her painting and was always glad when
                  night came, not only because it usually brought her lover, but because she could
                  lay down her brush and pencil and rest her eyes. Hales was busy, too, in his way;
                  but fortune always seemed to take sides against him. He was one of those men who
                  seem born to be unsuccessfulâ€”laborious men of great energy and force of character,
                  but who expend their strength in directions that do not lead to pecuniary profitâ€”.
                  His novelettes, religio-political in tone, founded upon the old Italian legends,
                  brought him in but a mere pittance. His publishers said that the country was
                  flooded with just such productions, and that they could not afford to pay more
                  than a merely nominal price.
               Sometimes he gathered information and arranged facts and tables for the Senator,
                  who received great credit for accuracy and range of research when his speeches
                  wore printed. But Hales received less for a day's work applied to this purpose
                  than the stone-cutters upon the public buildings.
               His pecuniary condition embarrassed him. It did more. It mortified him. He lived
                  with the most rigid self-denial, and yet it was all he could do to pay Rose the
                  paltry sum he agreed to, for making the translations. Should he withold this
                  expenditure, he must give up Rose, he thought, for his pride could not endure the
                  humiliation of living upon her bounty. But to give up Rose was to give up all, and
                  that was to give up life itself. The thought of giving her up was not to be
                  entertained for a moment. So he starved on his crust in his attic and gave his
                  money to Rose.
               Every evening when Hales did not come, Rose was at Madame Zarowski's. This lady
                  was her only customer, and she was constantly sending Rose word to come to see her
                  about this thing or about that. This line was not sufficiently shaded that color
                  was too light, or this too deep. Madame Zerowski made pretensions to art herself,
                  but even if she had not, she was the purchaser, and her views and suggestions had
                  to be followed. Consequently, Rose was there very often. Upon these occasions she
                  would invariably meet the Senator. She was on friendly terms with him. She
                  overlooked his first rude demonstration when Madame Zarowski explained to her that
                  it was merely a harmless gallantry, which, although it might be exceptional in
                  itself, could not was the more disposed to pardon the offence, as the Senator
                  afterwards observed towards her the strictest decorum and propriety. She thought
                  she discovered some marks of attention in his behavior, but these were so delicate
                  and refined, and hismanner was that of so complete a gentleman, and his
                  conversation so entertaining withal, that by dint of consumate skill and the
                  advantage of frequent opportunity, he not only repaired his first mistake, but
                  succeeded in winning her good opinion and esteem. As to Madame Zarowski, Rose
                  looked upon her in the light of a customer, rather a troublesome one indeed, but
                  being her only one, as a proper subject for consideration. But she was not now so
                  profitable as she had been; she had offered Rose some costly presents on one
                  occasion, to be received as such, and Rose had declined to receive them in such an
                  emphatic manner, that the experiment was never repeated. For Rose was proud, and
                  there was no such intimate relationship to justify such a gift; she was unwilling
                  to accept the obligation and place herself in a false, position. From that time
                  forward, Madame Zarowski had given her no new work. In fact, Isaacs had told her
                  to cut Rose off, if she continued refractory. At present, she was merely finishing
                  what work she had on hands, and when this was done, it was questionable whether
                  the Madame would require her services any longer. Then she would be entirely
                  dependent upon Hale's translations, unless good fortune would throw something else
                  in her way.
               Rose's nature was the very reverse of Hale's. He was from the Northâ€”grave,
                  reflective and melancholy. She was from the Southâ€”hopeful and happy and joyous.
                  With her the love of beauty was an instinct. She loved the skies and the fields
                  and the forests and the rivers. And she loved to see the gas lights of the
                  chandeliers flashing upon beautiful women, clothed in beautiful garments and
                  sparkling in jewels. She enjoyed beauty in all the simplicity and enthusiasm of
                  childhood, and never once thought it a hardship that she herself could not shine
                  and dazzle among the glittering throngs she saw through the windows of the houses
                  as she passed along the street at night. Like the beggars that bask beneath the
                  sun and skies of Naples and watch the glorious bay the live-long time from morning
                  till the sun sinks in his bed of roses and lilies in the West, her enjoyment of
                  beauty was complete in itself. There was no admixture of sadness, discontent or
                  envy to dim the purity and lessen the joy of her emotion. She did not know what it
                  was to have enemies, or to stand guard against the treachery and plots of
                  pretended friends; or what it was to engage in that terrible battle, called "the
                  struggle for physical existence," which only those can properly understand derstand who have had it to fight.
               So Rose was at peace with the world and loved everybody.
               But she was a full grown woman inheart and mind and soul, as well as in body.
                  There was no real danger to be feared for her on account of her ignorance and
                  inexperience in the ways of the world. She had escaped the torturing and
                  mutilating process which young ladies must undergo to prepare them for society.
                  The growth and expansion of sentiment and thought within her had not been forced
                  into cramping forms and moulds to grow rigid in unnatural shapes. She had
                  developed into true womanhood, the free and graceful woman of nature, as nature
                  had formed her, and as nature alone had caused her to grow. Of course, she was not
                  philosophical and reflective. It is only diseased humanity that turns within and
                  feeds upon itself; and Rose" was free from every taint of education. Her womanly
                  instincts would keep her from harm.
               There were no secrets between Rose and Hales. Hales knew all about her visits to
                  Madame Zarowski and whom she met there. He had no fear that she would forget him
                  and become discontented with her narrow sphere and sigh for the blaze and fashion
                  of the great world into which she had been introduced at Madame Zarowski's. house.
                  And he was right. Rose continued loving and affectionate and happy. She felt
                  somehow as if she belonged to Hales, and this sense of dependence was so
                  sweet!
               When he would come in the evenings, she would sit down close beside him and talk
                  to him with all the artlessness and innocence of a child.
               The storm might be at its wild work without, and the favorites of wealth and
                  fashion might be rushing by outside in silks and furs, in carriages that rattled
                  to and fro, and the great world might sup and drink and sing and dance. What
                  matter? Rose's parlor would be a Paradise, and of all the gay devotees of pleasure
                  and amusement, there would be none so completely happy as Hales and Rose.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               THE MISTAKE.
               Hales and Rose were alone together in the little parlor. It was late at night and
                  Hales was still busy, writing rapidly, with his books and papers piled on the
                  table and on the floor around him. Rose was seated opposite working at some
                  embroidery, The sandwiches and coffee cups were on the table and the water was
                  boiling and bubbling in the kettle on the stove.
               Rose never interrupted Hales when he was writing and this evening he had been
                  engaged much longer than usual and scarcely more than a word had passed between
                  the two for hours. Hales worked away and Rose kept still.
               "There now, it is finished at last;" said Hales, throwing down his pen and turning
                  his chair facing Rose and the stove; "finished at last and probably ths last piece
                  of literary work that I shall do for some time to come if I am to escape
                  starvation and have something left for Rose."
               "What is it George; tell me," said Rose looking up enquiringly from her
                  stitching.
               "It is simply this, Rose, that I have nothing to do and have not enough money to
                  pay for a dinner to-morrow unless I sell some of my books or clothes," replied
                  Hales.
               "Ah! is that all!" laughed Rose, "why then come and dine with me to-morrow," she
                  added archly.
               "But seriously, Rose," answered Hales, "the question is a grave one. I might share
                  your meal to-morrow and the day after and the day following that; but, you know
                  this could not continue. And then I have other expenses. It is true they are
                  light, but without the means to meet them, the amount will make no difference and
                  I am none the less a beggar."
               "Take this then," said Rose, taking out her pocket-book and tossing it to him with
                  assumed gravity and condescension, "and eat and drink to my health and your own
                  better encouragement."
               Hales could not resist smiling himself, desperate as his real situation was, at
                  the mock heroic tone and accent with which Rose was pleased to make known her
                  grace.
               He said, "you are a darling!"
               "But so are not you when your courage fails and you give up hope. What will become
                  of poor little Rose when you forsake her?" she replied, with a pearly tear
                  standing in her large black eye.
               "Dearest creature," he exclaimed "I was wrong to give you pain, but I merely meant
                  to state my present situation, and to have you help me to consider what next to
                  do."
               Rose dried her eyes, and in a moment more was radiant with happiness.
               "Madame Zarowski has given me no more new work for some time past, and has paid me
                  for all I have done, and my entire fortune is in the pocket-book in your hands and
                  I must think of something, too, and so we will hold a council of war together. But
                  first let us estimate what is our present strength to oppose the common
                  enemy."
               Rose spoke this in a firm and soldier-like manner.
               Hales opened the pocket-book. It contained seven dollars and some cents.
               Hales shook his head with a melancholy smile.
               "But the rent is paid for my rooms in advance for this month, and we have enough
                  to last until one or both of us find something to do," said Rose gaily, "and then
                  you know I shall see more of you if you dine with me every day in the mean-while,"
                  she added with her large, loving eyes cast affectionately upon him.
               "I have made a terrible mistake, Rose," said Hates, changing the tenor of the
                  conversation, "but then it was before I saw you and learned to love you."
               "Is it too late to correct it?" she asked.
               "Possibly not; at all events I am determined to make the effort to do so," he
                  answered.
               "And the sooner the better, too, George," said Hose; "but what was your mistake?"
                  she enquired.
               "Trying to enjoy the luxury of being an honest man when my pecuniary means would
                  not admit of the extravagance," replied Hales bitterly.
               ROSE. I do not understand you; you have always been honest?
               HALES. Unfortunately; Yes.
               ROSE. Why unfortunately?
               HALES. Because had I not been so, I would not now be penniless and dependent, for
                  a while at least, on your kindness for food and shelter. But I shall correct my
                  error and go as far as the best of them for all time to come.
               ROSE. But you will not do anything wicked?
               HALES. No; dear child. On the contrary; I shall do something which is regarded as
                  eminently proper and patriotic, and shall be applauded for doing so.
               ROSE. What will Unit be?
               HALES. I am going to support the Grand Consolidated Railway Land Grant Bill.
               ROSE. And what is that?
               HALES. It is to give away something less than half of the territory of the United
                  States to a dozen or more persons and their successors in fee simple forever.
               ROSE. And how can that affect our happiness in any way?
               HALES. True, child; how can it?
               ROSE. And why will you support it?
               HALES. For money.
               ROSE. And is there anything wrong in that? I paint for money and why should not
                  you write for money?
               HALES. There, is no reason why I should not. Long enough have I beat my head
                  against the iron bars of my cage like a mad fool; long enough have I lived under
                  the delusion that there was hope in the sordid and Vulgar rabble. I thought that
                  I,â€”I, a miserable beggar, not even secure of my own existence, might accomplish
                  something on the side of Truth and Justice, although the wealth and rank and power
                  of the land were arrayed against me. I had a wild and glorious dream of God and
                  humanity. That dream is past.
               ROSE. And what will you do, George?
               HALES. I shall write a line to Mr. Hearsey and tell him I have reconsidered the matter and am willing to support his
                  bill.
               ROSE. And then we shall have money; shall we not, George? And we shall be so
                  happy; so happy!
               HALES. Yes, Rose, we will be happy and you shall be my only divinity.
               ROSE. But tell me; what is that you have been writing to-night?
               HALES. It is an anonymous communication addressed to the Senator. I want to test
                  him. I know his ambition and his power. Will he dare be great? Will he have the
                  courage to grasp for the stars? This is what I wish to ascertain. The means are in
                  his hands; the opportunity is before him. If he raise the flag and pound the cry
                  there is a career before him that mortal man has never made. In my communication I
                  have endeavored to show him how this is so. This is my last effort in this
                  direction unless I hear of something from the Senator to indicate the purpose I
                  have suggested to him. If I hear nothing from him, I shall apply to Hearsey and if
                  he makes no favorable response, my literary labor is ended and I shall seek some
                  other field of enterprise to realize the means to make you happy.
               ROSE. When by your side I am always happy, George.
               And Rose skipped like a fawn across the room and took her cithern out of its case
                  in the corner, and began to sing and play some of the happy songs of happy
                  Southern France.
               And Hales sat silent and thoughtful. His look was care-worn and anxious.
               When Rose had finished her songs she crept up to Hales and put her white arm
                  around his neck, smoothed back his hair, and then nestled her face close up
                  against his. Hales pressed her hard against his heart and kissed her on the
                  forehead.
               "George," said Rose, "do you know how I would like to die?"
               "What makes you think of dying now, dear Rose?" asked Hales.
               "I cannot tell, but the river is so broad and beautiful, and seems so like a grand
                  old friend," replied Rose. "But," she added, with a fearful determination of
                  purpose which looked out at her eyes, "I have a poison for those who would harm
                  you, George. My poor, dear, old fatherâ€”her eyes filled with tears and her voice
                  falteredâ€”gave it to me to use in the last extremity. The revolutionists used it in
                  the old times in France, he said. It does not produce death immediately, but
                  administered at intervals for a little while it destroys the nerves of the brain
                  and reduces the victim to complete subjection to the will of any person who is
                  about him and chooses to control him. After a time idiocy follows and then comes
                  death."
               And Hales had a glimpse for the first time down into the deeps of Rose's soul.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               THE TABLEAUX.
               Madame Zarowski spared no pains or expense to make her house attractive. And being
                  herself a woman of wit and culture and taste and fashion and beautiful besides,
                  she succeeded.
               She had appointed an evening for tableaux in the drawing-rooms, and had invited a
                  select few of her friends to be present at the entertainment.
               Madame Zarowski's circle was the innermost one of all the charmed circles in
                  Washington. And her tableaux!â€”those who were so distinguishedly favored as to have
                  the entree there had penetrated into the very sanctum sanctorum of the arcana of
                  high life.
               Not that her tableaux were essentially different from those exhibited in the cheap
                  theatres in large citiesâ€”especially those In sea-port townsâ€”only the actors and
                  the spectators belonged to a different class from these. The nymphs du pare who advertised their charms on
                  revolving pedestals, in the temples of art about Chatham square and the Bowery,
                  for an admission price often cents, could not be compared for a moment with the
                  beautiful bevy of young girls that Madame Zarowski selected with such care from
                  her wide field of acquaintance. Nor could the weather-beaten sailors, the
                  besmeared and brass-bejewelled Jews, the pickpockets and the thieves who
                  frequented the aforesaid temples be mentioned in the same connection with the
                  learned doctors, the lawyers, the judges, statesmen and divines who attended the
                  tableaux of Madame Zarowski.
               Upon a closer examination, the resemblance between the two classes of exhibitions
                  would become more apparent. Madame Zarowski's girls were poor and fond of fashion
                  and display, and for the most part without natural protectors. They had been
                  selected solely with a view to their natural beauty. And they vied with each other
                  in the arts of exposing their personal attractions to the best possible advantage.
                  It must be remembered, too, that statesmen and divines, as well as thieves and
                  pickpockets, are but human creatures after all, and none the less susceptible to
                  the charms of leg and bosom, by reason of their high vocations. As for the girls
                  themselves, they enjoyed it, and so far from being offended at the gallant remarks
                  and observations of the distinguished guests assembled, this would only stimulate
                  their ambition to render themselves deserving of the compliments they received.
                  Madame Zarowski, who was the. priestess of these rites, did not demand a fee often
                  cents from each spectator, but if the flame of soft desire had been kindled in the
                  breasts of any of the lawyers, judges, statesmen or divines who were present, the
                  priestess could so arrange it that the unhappy one thus stricken could meet the
                  object of his passion alone in her own private parlors upon another occasion, when
                  he could pour out his soul without fear of intrusion or interruption. The
                  consideration which Madame Zarowski would receive for this favor would be a
                  promise to support the Grand Consolidated Railway Land Grant Bill.
               Rose was one of the young ladies selected by Madame Zarowski to appear in the
                  tableaux. When she first received the note of invitation and request she was not
                  disposed to go, but she reflected that she was sadly in need of funds, and that by
                  gratifying Madame Zarowski, she might receive from her some more work, and thus be
                  able to put Hales and herself on a living footing. This consideration determined
                  her purpose, and she went.
               She was graciously received by Madame Zarowski, who presented quite a number of
                  gentlemen-to her for an introduction. Among the gentlemen thus presented, were the
                  Rev. Doctor Charles Plesington, Mr. Isaacs, and a Sir, Tyrrell, a young gentleman
                  of family and fortune, it was said, who was on a visit to the capital city. Mr.
                  Hearsey was not present, but his good lady was there, having been escorted by
                  Doctor Plesington, and Rose was presented to her.
               The guests were not numerous, but the company was elite. A noticeable feature was, that, with the exception of Mr.
                  Tyrrell, all the male guests were of middle age or past it; while all the ladies
                  except Mrs. Hearsey and the priestess were under twenty. The absence of the
                  department clerks was also worth remarking; but the fact that there was no dancing
                  might account satisfactorily for this vacancy. It is further proper to mention in
                  this connection that Jenkins was not admitted. He had struggled hard to obtain a
                  card, but had failed.
               The most remarkable thing, however, about the entertainment was the ease and
                  freedom which prevailed, and the want of anything like fashionable etiquette.
                  There was no profusion of silks and jewels and laces. Madame Zarowski herself was
                  dressed in a plain white muslin, with a black silk cape thrown over her shoulders,
                  and her hair was bound with a single blue ribbon. The young ladies had received
                  their instructions and came attired in an equally simple and unassuming
                  manner.
               This was a prudent arrangement of Madame Zarowski. One and all of the young ladies
                  present, excepting Rose, would willingly have put their charms alone, in
                  competition with the world; but most of them being unable to afford a fashionable
                  party dress, would have hesitated to have come where what they had on might have
                  been made the object of criticism. And the very object of the tableaux was to
                  bring these ladies together, and pass them in review before the distinguished
                  gentlemen present. And this object would have been defeated, had dress been made a
                  requirement of admission. And then again, simplicity and economy in dress was an
                  evidence to the experienced old voluptuaries that the young things were yet fresh
                  and uncorrupted, otherwise they would have been able to have displayed more
                  extravagance.
               There were no servants on these occasions and the guests helped themselves and
                  each other.
               The long suite of drawing-rooms and boudoirs and side-cabinets were all thrown open, and in the end of the furthest room
                  stood tables piled with all the materials for a luxurious cold collation. There
                  was boned turkey, duck, partridges, quail and venison. There were coffees and
                  breads and cakes and confectioneries. There were pyramids of wine bottles, filled
                  with the oldest and choicest juices, piled upon the sideboards and stronger
                  liquors were on the shelves underneath. There were wax candles and boxes of fine
                  cigars upon the centre-tables. The shutters were closed; the double window sashes
                  were down and the heavy curtains were drawn inside.
               There was no formal invitation to take refreshments. The tables were there and
                  ready for each one to partake, whenever and as often as appetite prompted. Some
                  were eating and drinking, some were promenading the saloons in couples and some of
                  the gentlemen were smoking and some of them were paired with the ladies and
                  closely engaged with them in conversation, on the sofas, in the cabinets and
                  boudoirs. All seemed to be supremely contented and happy, excepting the
                  unfortunate Doctor Plesington. For Mrs. Hearsey, knowing his general weakness in
                  this direction, had managed to get an invitation and was present for the single
                  purpose of mounting guard over him. Owing to this circumstance, the Doctor was not
                  so brilliant and entertaining as he had been when he was in the apartments the
                  last time.
               Rose amused herself, too, in her way. But her enjoyment was quiet and rational,
                  and not wild and stormy. She was such a still and demure little thing in company
                  that but few ever noticed her presence. It was so upon this occasion, and the
                  Senator had her all to himself in a little library which opened into the
                  drawing-rooms, and where the two were looking over books and pictures
                  together.
               At eleven o'clock the tableaux were to begin, The stage had been fitted up in the
                  end of the suite of drawing rooms, opposite to that occupied by the refreshment
                  tables. A cabinet which opened upon the stage behind the curtain, and which was
                  accessible from another room in the house, was used for the green-room.
               No cost had been spared in making the arrangements. Appropriate costumes of great
                  elegance and taste had been prepared at the theatre establishments. The scenery
                  had all been painted by the best artists, expressly for the occasion. The rarest
                  flowers and plants had been provided. Isaacs himself had recently furnished
                  Zarowski with pearls and diamonds. Everything was complete for the exhibition down
                  to the chemicals for the colored lights and the gold and silver shower dust.
               Madame Zarowski had selected or designed all the tableaux herself, and being a
                  lady of excellent taste in such matters, had so arranged and apportioned them as
                  to bring out all the strong points of the young ladies in the best manner
                  possible.
               To Rose had been assigned the death-scene of Cleopatra with the basket of fruits
                  and flowers and the asp.
               The guests were all seated in rows facing the stage and the curtain was ready to
                  rise. Five or six musicians who had been in waiting below were admitted. The music
                  began, the bell rang, the curtain went up.
               A rich variety of beautiful tableaux appeared in succession on the stage. The
                  display of feet and arms and neck and ankles was all that could be desired. The
                  spectators were loud in their approbation, and the young lady performers were
                  happy.
               "Cleopatra in the death-scene!" announced Madame Zarowski.
               A low, deep murmur of approbation was heard from the audience as the curtain
                  slowly went up, and Rose appeared in this great picture.
               Her physical beauty and symmetry were perfect. Her robes were the richest and most
                  elegant that art could devise or money could procure. A tiara of diamonds sparkled
                  and burned in her thick black hair, clusters of pearl hung about her dark brown
                  neck and shoulders, and a bunch of opals was fastened on her breast. The scenery
                  in the back-ground represented the pyramids, the Nile, lotus flowers, and a forest
                  of palm trees, under a dark-brown African sky. She was seated on a throne, and
                  attendant maidens were ranged in groups around her. Her arms were bare, and her
                  left was hanging carelessly down over the back of the throne and fully exposed.
                  Her right elbow was resting upon a table covered with the cloth of gold, and her
                  head slightly inclined backwards and to one side, seemed to be resting upon the
                  tips of fingers that looked like flower-stamens and had the roseate glow of sea
                  shells. Upon the table stood the fatal basket, filled with fruits and flowers. Her
                  eyes were cast upwards and fixed on vacancy. Her throat and a portion of her
                  richly-colored bosom was exposed. She sat motionless as a statue, blending in her
                  expressive face the passions and emotions of love and despair, of sorrow and
                  defiance. She was a woman-symbol of the dying gladiator.
               When the curtain fell, the applause was unbounded. The men all wished to know who
                  Rose was, and the young ladies were all undergoing an agony of jealousy. Madame
                  Zarowski maliciously asked Mrs. Hearsey if she had noticed the enthusiastic
                  admiration of Doctor Plesington. That estimable woman thought, she had, and
                  proceeded at once to put the unfortunate divine under a still stricter
                  serveilliance.
               Rose's part concluded the performances. The musicians withdrew, and the servants
                  were ordered to remain below and admit no one, under any circumstances whatever.
                  The drawing room doors were closed and the merriment proper of the evening began.
                  The ladies now appeared among the gentlemen again in their costumes. There was
                  feasting and drinking and high revelry. The old roues plied the girls with
                  generous wines until the color mantled in their cheeks and their eyes sparkled
                  with excitement. There was love-making and flirting and intrigue, and there was,
                  billing and cooing going on in the adjoining boudoirs and cabinets. The wine
                  flowed and the girls romped. The lawyers, judges, statesmen and divines caught the
                  infection. They mingled furiously in the revelry. The gas was turned down low, and
                  blind man's buff was played; forfeits were taken, and the penalties were
                  rigorously exacted. The girls submitted and the old libertines triumphed. For wine
                  and passion ruled the hour. Only poor Doctor Plesington did not enjoy himself at
                  all. Driven by the supervision of that excellent lady, Mrs. Hearsey, to the very
                  brink of despair, that worthy divine had poured out libations to Bacchus until he
                  was hiccoughing helplessly in close proximity to Dame Hearsey's crinoline. But
                  that strong minded woman had conquered. She would have no further occasion for
                  jealousy that evening and so she was con tented with the manner in which she had
                  performed the duties which she had imposed upon herself.
               Rose took no part in the wild excitement of the evening. As soon as she came off
                  the stage, the Senator led her back again to the library where they had been
                  looking over the books and pictures, before the performances had commenced.
               After a long interview, the Senator left her alone and passed into the
                  drawing-rooms, and gave his arm to Madame Zarowski.
               Madame Zarowski conducted him through the noisy and tumultuous company and led him
                  through two or three rooms into a private apartment of her own.
               "And what has been the result of the honorable Senator's suit this evening?" asked
                  Madame Zarowski when the two were seated alone together without fear of
                  interruption.
               "Rose still remains as indifferent to me as ever," answered the Senator with
                  vexation and chagrin.
               ZAROWSKI. Did you declare your passion?
               SENATOR. No; for that would only have been to subject myself to additional
                  humiliation at her hands.
               ZAROWSKI. How then can you expect her to be aware of its existence?
               SENATOR. Because my attentions to her ever since I first met her hereâ€”and you have
                  afforded me ample opportunityâ€”have been of such a character that she could not
                  possibly mistake them.
               ZAROWSKI. And have you exhausted all your arts?
               SENATOR. I have laid siege to her heart from every point. I have tried the most
                  delicate flattery and made the most insinuating appeals to her vanity and her
                  ambition; I have tried to create new hopes and aspirations; I have gone so far as
                  to attempt to excite her fears. All my intrigues and schemes have come to nothing.
                  She is as obdurate as a stone.
               ZAROWSKI. And does the honorable Senator propose to abandon the pursuit and give
                  up the game?
               SENATOR. Give her up! Not while life and vigor last. What does all my wealth and
                  power and all the pride of my position avail me as long as she can baulk my
                  wishes? I tell you, Zarowski, without her I cannot live. She haunts my very soul.
                  Her image is constantly before me to torment me by day and by night. I follow her
                  in my dreams. My passion for her consumes me. If she withold herself, I shall die
                  of desire. But she must and shall be mine at every sacrifice and every risk.
               The Senator spoke this fiercely and in a voice husky with passion.
               "And would the honorable Senator give his commanding influence to the support port of the Grand Consolidated Railway
                  Land Grant Bill, if the goddess that he worshipped were placed in his arms?"
                  demanded Madame Zarowski.
               For a moment the Senator paused, and then replied:
               "Even that, Zarowski."
               "Has she agreed to meet you at your apartments on the pretext on your part of
                  giving her work?" asked Zarowski.
               "She has," replied the Senator.
               "Your hand, Senator, on the contract."
               "My hand, Zarowski."
               "And your word of honor?"
               "And my word of honor."
               The bargain was closed.
               Madame Zarowski left the Senator and sought Isaacs. She found him alone in a
                  cabinet awaiting her. She repeated to him the conversation she had just had with
                  the Senator, and then she went on to give that part of the conversation with
                  Doctor Plesington which related to the proposed treachery of that divine and Mr.
                  Hearsey.
               Isaacs had not seen her since his return from New York; he had been too busily
                  engaged. He listened attentively to what she had to say, and when she had
                  concluded, he told her that she had served him faithfully.
               "And may I be free now?" she asked timidly.
               "Yes; you have done all that lies in your power to do and can serve me no longer,"
                  replied Isaacs in a milder tone then his accustomed one. "I shall take the girl in
                  hand myself now."
               "And the horrible history of my life in Paris, before you took me from the cafe
                  chantant in St. Antoine?" faltered Zarowski.
               "Shall die with me," said the Jew.
               "Heaven bless you," sobbed Zarowski, clasping his hands in hers and covering them
                  with her kisses and her tears.
               "And though the Jew is cold and cruel," said Isaacs, "he never fails to reward
                  faithful service according to its value. You have done all that you could, Irene,
                  and the balance of the amount placed at the banker's to your credit and to be
                  expended in my service, which is not yet disposed of, shall be your own. It will
                  make you independent and place you above the world. Up to this point our destinies
                  have been mysteriously connected, but here they separate. Good-night and
                  FAREWELL.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               NOBBY DICK.
               "Nobby Dick," alias Mr. Tyrrell, had met Mr. Isaacs the next morning after the
                  interview between them "over the Lake on the Square," and had accepted his
                  conditions and entered his service.
               Mr. Tyrrellâ€”for so he shall be designated in the remainder of this historyâ€”was
                  every way qualified to succeed as a man of the world. He had originally been
                  trained to business and understood it thoroughly. He was active and industrious,
                  sprightly and good-looking, was possessed of an average degree of culture and had
                  polite and easy manners. He could readily make himself a favorite with any
                  reasonable employer, and become popular generally. It was owing to these
                  qualifications that Mr. Isaacs had selected him.
               Tyrrell's career in that species of vice which is ever liable to meet with open
                  and disgraceful punishment had been a short one. He had been led astray in the
                  usual-manner. Hard work and insufficient pay, then pilfering from his employer,
                  followed by a discharge and the impossibility of obtaining any honest employment
                  that would afford him the means of gratifying his large stock of desires and
                  wants, had been the moving causes which impelled him to take to vulgar thieving,
                  from which beginning he had been led on and on until he had committed the deed
                  which put his neck in Mr. Isaacs' pocket, as we have already seen.
               He was not generally known to the police, and to his objection that he had been
                  discharged for pilfering, and that some of the detectives had had their eyes upon
                  him, and that he might not succeed in society, Mr Isaacs had allayed his fears and
                  reassured him with the statement of hisâ€”Isaacs'â€”experience, that so many men of
                  the world were in the same box themselves, that they readily overlooked such
                  youthful delinquencies on the ground of inexperience, unless, indeed, the culprit
                  had been the subject of disgraceful punishment for his offence, in which case
                  there would be no hope for him.
               Mr. Tyrrell had accompanied Mr Isaacs from New York to Washington and had there
                  been introduced into the best society. Madame Zarowski had received him and
                  invited him to her tableaux, which was such a distinguished honor. Doctor
                  Plesington was too happy to vouch for him at any time, and Mrs. Hearsey gave him
                  an additional shove by sounding his praises wherever she went.
               Mr. Tyrrell had been placed as one of Mr. Hearsey's confidential clerks through
                  Mr. Isaacs' influence for the purpose of observing and reporting to his patron all
                  the movements and operations of his nominal employer that he might chance to find
                  out.
               Mr. Hearsey had given the place to Mr. Tyrrell because he desired to show to Mr.
                  Isaacs the extent of his good will and confidence towards him, and to allay any
                  suspicion that might arise in his bosom, derogatory to hisâ€”Mr. Hearsey'sâ€”good
                  faith and honesty in their mutual grand enterprise.
               Mr. Tyrrell conducted himself in all respects as a gentleman of breeding and
                  honor. Being supplied from Hearsey and Isaacs both with all the money lie wanted,
                  he was able to gratify his wants and desires without being reduced to the terrible
                  necessity of grand and petit larcency or burglary or forgery.
               Mr. Tyrrell was furthermore strictly temperate in all his habits and wasâ€”following
                  Mr. Isaacs' adviceâ€”a regular attendant on divine worship in Doctor Plesington's
                  church. He was on the high road to success in life.
               Not that any wonderful moral revolution had taken place in Mr. Tyrrell's sentient
                  organism; on the contrary, he remained essentially and identically the same "Nobby
                  Dick" of former times. His circumstances were merely changed and his range of
                  operations enlarged; that was all. He was still as ready to scuttle a ship or cut
                  a throat as ever he had been to pick a pocket or crack a till while engaged in his
                  former field of enterprise. The only difference was that he would do these things
                  now under the wing of an all powerful protection and in strict observance of the
                  rules of propriety.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               THE PLOT.
               "The session of Congress draws to a close. There is no time to be lost. What is
                  done must be done quickly. But that was famous generalship in Irene to draw
                  Hearsey's treachery out of that old fool Plesington! I had expected as much from
                  him, but not in that direction, Tyrrell will take care of Mr. Hearsey. And that
                  obdurate wench of a wild gipsy girl who holds out in refusing the Senator! Poor
                  thing I Why does she riot meet the Inevitable easily and gracefully like a lamb
                  that is led to the altar to grace a festival? She might approach her fate crowned
                  with bays and roses, the emblems of love and conquest. She refuses. It is not my
                  fault. She is to visit the Senator. But if he could not win her in Irene's
                  boudoirs he cannot improve results in his own chambers. It was the fierceness of
                  his passion that prompted him to exact from her the promise. It must be looked to
                  that in the rage and tempest of desire, the Senator does not forget himself and
                  ruin all by a fatal attempt to coerce her will when the two are alone together in
                  his great, dark mansion. But she shall be his. He has given his hand and his word
                  and his honor to support the Bill on this condition. And he shall possess her in
                  spite of all her refractory efforts; in spite of all her struggles to resist and
                  escape him. And no form of law or requirement of society shall be violated in
                  placing him in full possession."
               Thus soliloquized Isaacs, the Jew, as he sat alone in his business office about eleven o'clock at night with his right
                  arm resting on the round green table and his eyes fixed upon the glowing coals in
                  the grate.
               Isaacs was not given to soliloquizing or idleness.
               On this occasion he was waiting for Mr. Tyrrell to come in and make his
                  report.
               Presently the door opened and this gentleman made his appearance.
               ISAACS. Anything further from Hearsey?
               TYRRELL. Nothing of importance. He spends most of his time in New York as you are
                  aware.
               ISAACS. Was there anything of interest in his correspondence?
               TYRRELL. Yes.
               ISAACS. What?
               TYRRELL. A supplicating letter from Hales, the journalist, whom you ordered me to
                  keep eyes upon and run down, stating his pecuniary distress and begging
                  employment.
               ISAACS. Was he poor; very poor; the pauper?
               TYRRELL. Entirely destitute and due for a week's lodgings.
               ISAACS. What did he propose to do?
               TYRRELL. Write for the Grand Consolidated Railway Land Grant Bill.
               ISAACS. Mr. Hales' services once solicited are no longer required.
               Mr. Isaacs rubbed his hands in a great glee and seemed to be meditating.
               "Tyrrell," said Isaacs, "this man Hales is a great scoundrel."
               "And a dangerous man," added Tyrrell.
               "His socialistic principles and his inflamatory appeals to the working men may
                  result in great mischief," said Isaacs.
               "And lead to the destruction of towns and cities by fire and to mob processions
                  with red flags and cries of "Bread or Blood," put in the late Mr. Nobby Dick.
               "He is a debauched wretch, who has spent his substance in riotous living with a
                  mistress," said Isaacs.
               "And is capable of committing any crime in the calendar," added the virtuous
                  Tyrrell in an emphatic manner.
               "Such a man should be made an example of," said Mr. Isaacs.
               "I have informed Mrs. Hearsey of his relation with the Cleopatra of the tableaux
                  and you may depend upon her giving it sufficient tongue in the community,"
                  remarked Mr. Tyrrell.
               "Good," said Mr. Isaacs with a grunt.
               "I have made the fellow's acquaintance as you ordered me, and stand on fair terms
                  with him. I have watched him and dogged his steps wherever he has gone, but I can
                  ferret out nothing that would justify his arrest by the legal authorities. I must
                  confess that the villain's schemes are too deep for me," said Tyrrell, with a
                  solemn shaking of the head.
               "Society will not require overwhelming evidence to send such a dangerous character
                  to the gallows or the State's prison," strongly observed Mr. Isaacs.
               "And the man who might bring him to justice would be rewarded as a public
                  benefactor," said Tyrrell. looking keenly into Mr. Isaacs' eyes.
               "Has Mr. Hearsey properly authorized you to sign his name in his absence?" asked
                  Mr. Isaacs.
               "Only the other day he bestowed upon me that flattering mark of his confidence,"
                  answered Mr. Tyrrell.
               "Do you know the 'Rogue's Post,' Mr. Tyrrell?" inquired Mr. Isaacs.
               "I heard an old stager once allude to it. But it must be a rare article and its
                  use confined to the very top of our profession, for I have never seen it or even
                  heard it spoken of but this one time. It is a kind of writing paper, I believe,
                  that possesses some very peculiar properties," replied Mr. Tyrrell.
               Mr. Isaacs went to his safe, unlocked it and sprung a secret drawer in the side
                  and produced a sheet of paper.
               "And now, Mr. Tyrell," said Mr. Isaacs, "I will give you the master's degree."
               Mr. Tyrrell took the paper and examined it with great care. There was nothing
                  about it to distinguish it from ordinary tine letter paper, except, perhaps, that
                  it was not ruled and was not very smoothly glazed.
               Mr. Isaacs took a pen and wrote his name on the lower margin of the sheet. Then he
                  tore it off so as to make jagged and irregular indentures. He then produced from
                  the safe a small, square bottle wrapped in buckskin and cased in lead, and took a
                  small camel's hair pencil and applied a few drops of the pale, colorless liquid
                  which it contained to the sheet lying before him, covering a space large enough
                  upon which to place the slip he had torn off with his name upon the moistened
                  surface, and then penciled it over with a few more drops of the same fluid. Then
                  he dried it before the gas and handed it to Mr. Tyrrell for inspection.
               Mr. Tyrrell was lost in wonder and admiration. He had never seen anything half so
                  beautiful in all his life. The slip containing the name seemed literally to have
                  been melted into and become absorbed in the page upon which it had been pasted!
                  There was not the vestige of a line or shade or color to show the shape of the
                  slip that had been attached.
               Mr. Isaacs then took the sheet and placed it between two leaves of tissue paper,
                  and held it before the gas, and lo! there was to be traced clearly and distinctly
                  the jagged and irregular outlines of the indentures.
               "This is no slight of hand performance, Tyrrell," said Isaacs, amused at his dumb
                  astonishment; "it is tangible reality. But few living men besides myself have the
                  secret of this paper, and it is never employed except in the rarest and most
                  extraordinary emergencies."
               Mr Isaacs then took a drop of oil and water and loosend the slip and pulled it
                  off.
               Tyrrell continued to stare in mute amazement.
               "You have not of course replied to Hales' letter?" asked Mr. Isaacs with a
                  negative accent.
               "I was waiting your instructions," answered Tyrrell.
               "My instructions are these," said Mr. Isaacs: "you will take with you this evening
                  three sheets of the 'Rogue's Post.' One of them you will retain yourself. Upon one
                  of them you will address a polite note to Mr. Hales, regretting your inability to
                  comply with his wishes. To this note you will attach Mr. Hearsey's signature. You
                  will deliver this note in person to Mr. Hales, and carry the other sheet with you
                  and manage to secrete it in Hales' papers where you can find it again. Then your
                  skill as a pick-pocket will enable you to detach Mr. Hearsey's signature from the
                  noteâ€”and for this purpose you must write Mr. Hearsey's name well below the body of
                  the noteâ€”place the nameless note in a pigeon hole in Hales' desk, and bring back
                  the slip containing Mr. Hearsey's signature with you. Do you understand?"
               "Perfectly," replied Tyrrell, "and an easy job to put up on that absent-minded,
                  dreaming, unsuspecting fool."
               "After you have done this," continued Isaacs, "you will write on the sheet which
                  you have retained an order purporting to be from Mr. Hearsey on myself, to pay to
                  George Hales the sum of five hundred dollars for services rendered in the support
                  of the Grand Consolidated Railway Land Grant Bill. To this order you will attach
                  the signature of Mr. Hearsey, which you have torn off from the note addressed by
                  yourself to Hales as you have seen it done by me here to-night. You enclose this
                  order to my address through the post-office. By return post I will send the money
                  to Hales. Be ready with a policeman at the post-office and seize him and charge
                  him with the crime before he has an opportunity to explain, or to send the money
                  back. He can only deny all knowledge of the affairâ€”any thief would do the sameâ€”but
                  who will believe him?"
               "But might riot the note addressed to him, being on the same kind of paper,
                  implicate Mr. Hearsey and myself in the transaction?" thoughtfully suggested Mr.
                  Tyrrell.
               "To prevent this very thing is the object of this third blank sheet, which you are
                  to secrete among Hales' papers While Hales is in your custody, you will take out a
                  search warrant and discover the note addressed to Hales and the clank sheet which
                  you have secreted. But first you will show the outlines of the slip attached to
                  the order through the tissue paper. Then you will remove the slip and show that it
                  exactly fits the place where it was torn off the note he received from you. The
                  evidence will be conclusive. The blank sheet of this paper which you find there
                  will prove that he keeps the material on hand, and is a professional forger."
               "But this plan involves an exposure of the paper, and it will be seen on
                  examinnation that the paper on which I wrote the note to Hales is of the same
                  character as the paper on which the order
                  was written, and also as that of the blank sheet," objected Tyrrell.
               "In the first place," said Isaacs, "I am the prosecutor in the case, and there
                  will be no such examination as you fear, to show the kind of paper on which your
                  note to Hales was written. I will retain the evidences in my own possession, and
                  produce just so much as may be necessary to secure his commitment without bail.
                  When this is done, my purpose is accomplished. I have no revenge to gratify upon
                  Mr. Hales, and shall prosecute him no further than is necessary to accomplish my
                  purpose."
               Upon the renewed assurance of Mr. Tyrrell that he fully comprehended the
                  arrangement, Mr. Isaacs gave him the paper and the material, and ordering him to
                  begin at once, dismissed him from his presence.
               "Strike down the buck and secure the doe," said Isaacs, rubbing his hands when he
                  was again alone.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               MY COUNTRY.
               The Senator was at home. He was seated at his desk and busily engaged at work. On
                  his desk stood a basket full of papers and letters. The papers he merely glanced
                  at and threw among the waste paper. But he read all the letters; some rapidly,
                  merely noting the substance of their contents; others he read more carefully. None
                  of the letters were thrown away. He would put them back in their envelopes and
                  make a mark or a sign upon them. Sometimes he would write our a brief memo-signs
                  and would get the letters and answer them every one without exception, exactly as
                  the Senator would have them answered, and would sign them with a fac simile of the Senator's signature. This was his
                  duty. Often he could not do all the work himself and would distribute the work
                  among assistants and direct how it ought to be done.
               There was nothing of a strictly confidential nature in the letters turned over to
                  the confidential secretary. Letters of that character the Senator arranged in the
                  drawers of his desk and carried the key himself. The most of the letters answered
                  by the secretary were for information or solicitations for petty offices, some of
                  them volunteered advice and others begged support for some private bill; some were
                  for charity. They were on all possible subjects, but those given included the most
                  of them.
               For these there were stereotyped answers, always courteous and pleasant, assigning
                  some very satisfactory reason why the Senator could not do as requested; which he
                  regretted. On letters in relation to his support of bills, heâ€”or rather his
                  secretaryâ€”would say that the bill was not yet before the Senate, and until he
                  should hear it discussed he would not have the necessary information to justify
                  his giving an opinion. Every correspondent received an answer and all were
                  pleased, and some felt honored at receiving such a polite response, and signed,
                  too, by the Senator himself. The secretary filed all the letters received, in
                  order, in a book kept for that purpose. The names of the months were printed in
                  gilt letters on the backs of these books in which the files were kept.
               The more important letters the Senator filed in his own desk and answered at his
                  leisure. But it was a noticeable fact, that none, even of these letters, contained
                  original matter of really great importance. They contained allusions to such
                  matters and were explanatory of important matters, but they did not have direct
                  reference to these matters themselves. This was because persons having such
                  matters, requiring legislation or official action, were either present themselves
                  or had their agents in the city, and these things were arranged orally, whereby a
                  much better understanding could be arrived at between the parties.
               The compartments of the Senator's desk were arranged under two divisions. One was
                  labelled "Business," and the other "Political." The first had reference to his
                  legitimate official duties, and the second referred to his individual political
                  interests.
               Both these principal divisions were appropriately sub-divided and labelled. The
                  division marked "Political," was the one of the most interest. It was labelled in
                  one of the compartments with the names of the States. The Senator knew every man
                  of any mark in every State who was his friend. He knew very many who were his
                  friends who had not made any mark at all. In this division he kept large ledgers
                  and books, and in one of these books he kept the names and post-office, address of
                  all his correspondents.
               In a row of very light covered booksâ€”so made to economize space and save strength
                  in handlingâ€”on the upper shelf, extending the whole length of the desk, was
                  recorded all the Congressional districts in the United States, with a sub-division
                  of the counties under each. In every county in the country, (except the counties
                  of his own State) where the Senator had friends upon whom he could rely, their
                  names were written under the names of the respective counties where they resided
                  In his own State this arrangement was continued down to the townships. He was
                  doing the same thing in the other States as fast as the increase of his friends
                  permitted it. All this required labor, but the Senator never spared expense in
                  clerk hire. He had been elected Governor and then Senator, owing to this laborious
                  and thorough organization, and what might not be reached if this same plan was
                  extended to the country at large? He was in the prime of life, enjoyed vigorous
                  health, was possessed of great personal popularity, his ability was universally
                  acknowledged and his fortune was very large. There was nothing that he might not
                  aspire to.
               The Senator never received company in the evening before he had finished his mails
                  and had given directions about answering the letters, and answering all that
                  required answering from himself personally. This was his rule. Sometimes there
                  were special cases and he made exceptions. But for general visitors and in all
                  ordinary cases, be was inflexible.
               He had finished the contents of the basket, and the confidential secretary had
                  taken out the last letters and closed the door behind him. He had written all his
                  answers and put them into the mail-box and locked up his desk. He was relaxing
                  himself a moment before he opened the door to admit the crowd that was in waiting
                  below.
               This was the night that Rose was to visit him, and he was somewhat nervous and
                  impatient. A female intrigue was the only thing which divided his mind with
                  ambition. It was yet early in the evening, and he intended to feign illness to get
                  rid of his visitors, so that when Rose came he could have her alone, The Senator
                  occupied his own private house. It was a dark and sombre looking building of grey
                  stone, mossy and mildewed and one side covered with creeping vines. Its internal
                  arrangements were made solely with a view to his own convenience. Being a single
                  man, the house was not, well adapted for a family.
               The waiting-room, the large parlors and the dining hall were on the first floor.
                  On the second were arranged in suites, working rooms, private parlors, the library
                  and bed rooms. The third story was for servants and lumber generally.
               The Senator rang the bell and ordered the servant who answered it to bring up the
                  cards of the gentlemen in the waiting room below. The servant collected them upon
                  a silver waiter and deposited them upon the Senator's desk. The visitors were
                  rapidly disposed of, all with comforting assurances, but disposed of nevertheless.
                  The Senator plead illness. He was not usually ill, and it was not his habit to
                  appear anxious to get, rid of those who called. So he was excused. The servant
                  himself declared that he had never seen the Senator HO prostrate since he had been
                  in his service.
               The Senator left his working-room and went into one of his private chambers where
                  he intended to receive Rose. He gave special orders to his servants to admit no
                  other visitors and to excuse him on account of indisposition, but if a young lady
                  should come, to let her in.
               The chamber into which the Senator went was a temple dedicated to Venus. No man
                  ever crossed its threshold except himself. Its ceiling was a dome frescoed with
                  cupids and Hebes. From the centre was suspended a chandelier of silver, crusted in
                  grotesque forms of satyrs, fauns and water-lilies. The walls were covered with
                  white satin and hung with paintings of soft and glowing female forms of the school
                  of Rubens. The carpet was elaborately manufactured to represent a cushion of thick
                  green moss, sprinkled with red rose buds. The furnitureâ€”the ottomans, divans and
                  sofasâ€”was of massive black old mahogany, polished till it shined and gleamed like
                  jet in the reflected brilliancy of the
                  chandelier. It was of the Turkish pattern and covered with Turkish cloth richly
                  embroidered. On the mantles and etageres of the
                  side furniture were exquisite vases filed with cut stone and rare and beautiful
                  shells, and there were statuettes and carvings representing scenes in the loves of
                  the water nymphs and the dryads. Immense bosks of fresh flowers in hanging baskets
                  emitted their fragrance, and from a censer on an altar-shaped centre table, a
                  fine, thin smoke, scarcely visible, curled upwards from the burning of aromatic
                  gums. The oppressive fragrance from the flowers and gums benumbed the senses and
                  induced languor and passion. In one corner of the room was a bed of eider down,
                  half hidden from view by curtains of fleecy gauze. On the yellow maple canopy was
                  painted the amours of Leda and the swan.
               The Senator was restless and uneasy. He looked at his watch and he, paced the
                  chamber. It was time for Rose to be there. Would she come, or would the little
                  minx deceive him? No woman had ever baffled him so long a time before. For the
                  most part they had surrendered themselves willing victims on the first assault.
                  And how should he receive Rose when she did come? Should he continue the old fraud
                  about art and her paintings, or should he throw himself at her feet and declare
                  his love? The Senator's passion was consuming him.
               While these doubts and embarrassments were going on in his bosom, Rose was on her
                  way to fill her appointment and meet him as she had promised.
               Poor thing! She was thinking all the time about George Hales, and thinking that
                  the Senator whom she was going to see was so very rich, and a great man and a good
                  man. For so he had impressed her. She was thinking that her dying father had
                  bequeathed her to God and her country; and she thought that the good, kind Senator
                  would give her work, and that then she would have money and she and George would
                  be so happy when they took their long rambles among the hills and were alone
                  together in her little parlor. For since Madame Zarowski had ceased to give her
                  work, she had been without means, and her rent would be due in the morning, and
                  Hales was as poor as she was. So she hurried along under the gas lights to be in
                  time to meet her appointment.
               But she did not see the dark, muffled form across the street as she entered the
                  door of the Senator's house. But if she had, it would not have attracted her
                  attention, she was so deeply occupied with the thought of getting work and earning
                  a little money.
               In less than a minute after Rose had entered, Isaacs, for his was the muffled form
                  across the street, crossed over and rang the bell at the same door.
               The servant who opened it for him explained that the Senator was ill, and that he
                  had received strict orders to admit no one. But Isaacs overcame his scruples. He
                  told him that he understood the arrangement, and enforcing this argument with a
                  few good gold pieces, the servant allowed him to enter the waiting-room.
               But he was scarcely seated before he heard a shrill, piercing scream from
                  upstairs. He rushed up into the Senator's working roomâ€”another screamâ€”he bursted
                  through doors in the direction from which the screams proceeded, until he was in
                  the chamber face to face with Rose and the Senator. The Senator stood humiliated
                  crest fallen, glowering and biting his lips in silence. Rose, with her face
                  flushed with the rush of blood, her long, black hair streaming down her back, and
                  her large eyes flashing with rage and indignation, was standing in a corner of the
                  room, her lips half open as if to speak, her arm extended and her finger pointed
                  at the Senator.
               There were broken glasses and vases, and scattered flowers on the carpet
                  indicating that there had been a struggle.
               "This insult shall be avenged," said Rose when Isaacs had entered; and then left
                  the chamber hastily without speaking another word, and passed into the street.
               "Senator," said Isaacs, before the former had recovered from his confusion,"
                  perhaps I have arrived in time to save you from utter ruin. How far you have
                  succeeded in carrying out whatâ€”from the disordered condition of this chamberâ€”seems
                  to have been your purpose, I do not know. But this is pertain; the girl has been
                  deeply wronged and may find friendsâ€”aye, and powerful friendsâ€”to take her
                  part."
               The Senator had not yet recovered his wonted courage. His exposure had come upon
                  him so unexpectedly and suddenly. He was abashed and confounded and timid, as the
                  strongest men will be, from a sense of conscious and detected guilt.
               "And what brought you to play the spy about my premises?" asked the Senator with
                  as much scorn and contempt as he could force into his tone and accent under the
                  embarassing circumstances.
               "Your own protection," replied the Jew, "and if your Senatorship will lay aside
                  all epithets and compose your feelingsâ€”which must be no less ruffled by my
                  intrusion than by the ill success of your amorous enterpriseâ€”and consider, the
                  matter ally, something may be evolved to your Senatorship's advantage."
               "And who are you that dares to address me in this insolent manner?" asked the
                  Senator with rising indignation and anger.
               "Your master," replied the Jew, carelessly smelling at a bouquet he had picked
                  from one of the vases.
               "Scoundrel and dog! Begone from my presence before I pollute my hands with the
                  touch of your Jewish carcass!" roared the Senator in a towering passion, rising
                  from his chair and advancing towards the bell to ring for his servants.
               "Gently; gently," said the Jew. "Would you send me for a warrant to have you
                  arrested, and cause me to hire the greatest criminal lawyers to prosecute you for
                  your crime, or would you risk a murder to remove a witness in preference? should
                  you attempt the latter alternative, you will find my nerves of a firmer texture
                  than those of a defencelessâ€”as you supposeâ€”and orphan girl."
               The Jew triumphed.
               "What would you say?" asked the Senator resignedly.
               "I would say that I am intimately acquainted with all your designs and purpose:
                  relative to this girl, and with all the arts and intrigues you have employed to
                  bend her to your will since your first acquaintance with her at Madame
                  Zarowski's," deliberately answered the Jew.
               "Zounds! And has that false cat betrayed me?" ejaculated the Senator with
                  bitterness.
               "Madame Zarowski is in my service," said the Jew, "and she informs me of a solemn
                  pledge you made her to be performed on a certain condition. Is it still your
                  purpose to fulfill that pledge upon the performance of the precedent
                  condition?"
               "More than ever, Jew, since you have compelled my confidence and forced a right to
                  demand an answer," replied the Senator.
               "You do well to say more than ever," said the Jew with a leer. "Your true
                  connoiseur in matters of desire knows how to unite the passions. All the secret
                  arts of love known to the voluptuous Turk can teach no higher exstacy than to
                  enjoy, and triumph, and revenge together. And you owe your willful little
                  nut-brown maid a lesson, eh?"
               "And this unfortunate scene of to-nightâ€”â€”
               "All nonsense," interrupted the Jew, "you were awaiting me on some business; the
                  girl came and annoyed you; she was pert and you jocularly took some liberties; she
                  screamed, you discovered that she was a black-mailer and ordered her off the
                  premises; I am a witness to the substantial facts. You could have her arrested if
                  you chose and it was not in conflict with our plan."
               "And the girlâ€”â€”
               "Shall be yours," replied the Jew before the Senator could finish his sentence
                  "But," he added with a warning look and gesture, "remember your part of the
                  contract. Remember that the Jew holds your honorable self and all your honorable
                  colleagues in the hollow of his hand. The wealth and power of this nation is his.
                  Your public securities to which this broad land and the toil and sweat of this
                  people are pledged are his also. He furnishes the means for your colossal
                  enterprises and holds the mortgages upon them. He makes and unmakes your Senates
                  with a breath. He controls your press and raises up your boasted party organisms
                  and put them down to suit his pleasure. He permits your nation to exist until it
                  shall suit his purpose to destroy its life. Be wise. Adieu."
               The Jew went his way and left the Senator alone in the desecrated temple of
                  Venus.
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               RETRIBUTIVE JUSTICE.
               The plot against Hales, contrived by Isaacs and executed by Tyrrell, succeeded in every detail. Hales was arrested and
                  in spite of all his protestations was looked up in a felon's cell charged with an
                  infamous crime. He had no friendsâ€”no money. It was a common thing.
               The affair caused no excitement whatever. It was the most natural thing in the
                  world, it was said, for a spendthrift and a libertine arid for one entertaining
                  such infamous social opinions as he was said to entertain, to wind up in the
                  State's prison for forgery.
               The thought that he might be innocent occurred to no one who read an account of
                  the affair in the evening papers. Those high toned journals enlarged upon the
                  heinousnesa of the crime. They showed that the evidence was overwhelming. The high
                  character of the witnesses, too, was noticed. There was Mr. Hearsey's clerk, who
                  had been received into the most fashionable society in the city, whose strict
                  integrity and gentlemanly bearing had been a matter of public observation. Mr.
                  Tyrrell, the gentleman in question, was, further, a regular attendant at Doctor
                  Plesington's church and that distinguished Divine would take pleasure in vouching
                  for him, as would also Mr. Hearsey, who had shown his appreciation by appointing
                  Mr. Tyrrell his private secretary, a post to which no young man would be advanced
                  unless his employer had the most undoubted evidence to convince him of his worth
                  and character.
               The gravamen of the crime, however, was assigned to be that Mr. Isaac had been
                  made the intended victim. The Evening Luminary wished to know if
                  there was any one unacquainted with the fact that Mr. Isaacs was, perhaps, the
                  greatest public benefactor in "our midst." It was stated that his benefactions
                  were not confined to one locality or section but embraced the entire country. His
                  spirit of enterprise and vast means had enabled him to furnish employment to
                  thousands and render them his debtors for their daily bread, while his large
                  hearted liberality and charity had supplied the necessities and the wants of the
                  widow and the orphan. None other than just such a wretch as Hales was represented
                  to beâ€”as stated in this journalâ€”could have conceivedâ€”mnch less perpetratedâ€”such an
                  atrocity on such a man. Society had cause to rejoice, as was stated further, that
                  it had rid itself of one more of those pests who disregarded the eternal fitness
                  of things as expressed in the sublime and immutable law of supply and demand, made
                  war upon the conveniences of society, and endeavored to organize strife by
                  inciting a spirit of discontent and insubordination among the working men and
                  women, who, that journal asserted, were contented and happy, and would do well
                  enough, if the demagogues would only let them alone.
               The comments of the "Luminary" were mere echoes of the sentiments
                  of the community.
               When Mr. Tyrrell informed Mrs. Hearsey of the arrest and imprisonment of Rose's
                  lover, that good lady's delight knew no bounds. Mrs. Hearsey viewed things from
                  her own stand-point. She had hated Rose from the time that Madame Zarowski had
                  poisoned her mind with the suspicion that Doctor Plesington had looked upon her
                  with a favorable eye. She bore no special malice towards Hates personally, but
                  anything which would humiliate Rose would be a triumph to her. So she got on her
                  bonnet and furs and drove straight to Rose's land-lady, made herself acquainted
                  and stated to her all the circumstances, and wound up with warning her against the
                  "viper" she was cherishing in her bosom.
               Isaacs complimented Mr. Tyrrell on the neatness and dispatch with which he had
                  done up the job and told him that he was afraid that he would require his services
                  before long in a much more serious business, in which Mr. Hearsey would be the
                  victim.
               As Mr. Isaacs said this he looked strangely at Mr. Tyrrell.
               And Mr. Tyrrell looked strangely at Mr. Isaacs.
               Meanwhile, George Hales, humiliated and crushed, was lying in prison under charge
                  of an infamous crime, and Rose, as yet, knew nothing at all about it.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               DE PROFUNDIS.
               The night that Rose left the Senator's house her sleep was broken and irregular.
                  It was long before she could find repose at all. She had gone expecting work and
                  had me with insult and violence. She had hoped to find the means of support for
                  herself self and to aid Hales in his embarrassment and had received instead,
                  dishonorable propositions. She now understood the meaning of all the Senator's
                  professed kindness towards her.
               She wondered what there was about her that had given the Senator the feeling of
                  liberty to treat her as he had done? She wondered if other girls had ever met with
                  similar treatment. She was wounded in the heart. But she was not humiliated on
                  crushed. There was a quality of steel about her heart and soul, and a glint in her
                  dark black eye that showed a consciousness of self-respect and a spirit unsubdued.
                  What would George say about it, she thought. Should she tell him or not? There was
                  no one else who cared for her or for whom she cared sufficiently to induce her to
                  mention the matter at all. As to having any legal rights, the thought did not once
                  occur to her. She thought she would not tell George; it would only distress him to
                  no purpose. But that she would revenge the insult, and revenge it terribly, was
                  something well settled in her mind. The only question was how and when? But then
                  was no necessity for haste about this. It was one of those inevitable things of
                  the future, like death, which must come. So she could afford to put by the thought
                  for the moment.
               What more deeply interested her immediately was how she was to live, and how
                  George was to live. She had failed to get any other pupils than George in her
                  proposal to teach French and Italian. Madame Zarowski had given her no more work,
                  and it was not probable that she would, though she had gone to her tableaux and
                  acted in them for the express purpose of gratifying her, with a view of getting a
                  continuation of employment from her. In this she had failed. Neither could she
                  soil her pictures at the shops. What could she do? George could not aid her, for
                  he was as unfortunately situated as herself. What was she do do? This
                  was the question which kept repeating itself over and over again until it nearly
                  drove her to insanity. She could, not work upon the street or break stone or
                  shovel earth; she had not the physical strength. She had no means of sustaining
                  animal heat and life that she had not tried to render available, but without
                  effect.
               In the morning her rent would be due and she could not pay it. She would be hungry
                  and she would not be able to purchase food. In a few days her fuel would be all
                  consumed, and how was she to get any more? She could not even compete as a
                  chamber-maid or as a cook or washer and ironer with a thousand brawny armed women
                  that would step in and take the places before her. What was she to do? She had no
                  money and she had no friends able to help herâ€”only one single friend, George,,
                  Halesâ€”Her conscience told her that she had done her duty and was pure. How gladly
                  she would have done something that she was capable of doing to have given her a
                  modestâ€”a very modestâ€”living, that she and George might be happy!
               But there was no prospectâ€”not even a hope. Why had she been born? Why had she been
                  placed upon the earth where she seemed to be an alien and an intruder? Who was
                  responsible for this grevious wrong and injustice? Not she herself; not her dear,
                  old, dead father. When Rose thought of him she wept. It was the only thought that
                  would bring tears to her eyes.
               She was becoming wild. The eternal repetition of the question, "what shall I do?"
                  had fixed itself on her brain. Awake, her brain would be beating with it; in her
                  broken slumber its monotonous throb would arouse her. Was she growing mad? The
                  eternal question in an eternal monotone beat through her nerves with every
                  pulsation of her heart. It set itself to musical rythm and kept time to the
                  throbbing of the heart and brain. "What shall I do?"â€”like the ticking
                  of a clock, the first word to one stroke of the pendulum and the other three in
                  the same time before the pendulum struck again. Rose was getting near to the doors
                  of a mad-house.
               Should she go to the alms-house, or should she beg, or should she sacrifice her
                  womanhood, or should she die? These seemed to be the only alternatives. "What
                  shall I do?"
               A thousand girls have gone through just such moral agonies, but not one out of
                  them all was like Rose, She had in her the fiery, revolutionary blood of the
                  south. She was of the Latin races. She could have closed the doors and windows and
                  net fire to the charcoal with as much care and deliberation as any grisette of
                  Paris, had she thought it necessary; but she did not think so. Her bosom was
                  tossed with quite other emotions.
               She felt that a terrible wrong was being done to her. She felt that she had a right to live and love George and be
                  happy, and that she was being deprived of this-right. Her resentment did not fall
                  upon the Senator for this. It was this necessity which had driven her to him for
                  work. She felt the wrong, but did not know where to place it.
               In her madness and despair she could have seized a torch and plunged it into all f
                  ho treasures of the wealth and the art of the ages, and plunged after it into the
                  blazing pile with a wild shout of defiance. She began to understand how it was, as
                  her father had told her, that ten thousand women excited by Camille Desmoulins
                  could surge from Paris to Versailles, drawing canon, and pull down the horses of
                  the royal Officers and roast them at the fires they had kindled, and eat the half
                  raw and quivering flesh. She began to understand now that there were lofty moments
                  of exaltation when the soul could laugh danger and death to scorn, and triumph
                  over all in the hour of dissolution. She felt that the days of heroism were only
                  ordinary days, and would be certain to appear again whenever the time came
                  round.
               Rose wanted to live. She was youngâ€”not yet seventeenâ€”she wanted to live and she
                  wanted George to live, and she wanted to be happy with him. It would require but
                  littleâ€”very littleâ€”for them to live and be as happy as the days were long. A
                  little food and clothing and shelter, and fuel in the winter timeâ€”that was allâ€”and
                  how willingly they would both labor to secure it, if they only had an opportunity.
                  The fishes of the sea and rivers lived; the birds of the air lived; the hares and
                  foxes of the fields lived; people all around her lived, and that too, without
                  labor; why could not she and George live, who were willing and able to do
                  something for the common good?
               Rose was exalted and depressed by turns. Now she was elevated to heaven in a
                  sacrificing effort of heroic daring, and then she was dragged down to earth again
                  when she thought that she might be turned into the street in the morning because
                  she could not pay her rent. Her face was by turns hot and feverish with the
                  excitement of high resolve, and pale and moist with large cold drops of
                  perspiration.
               With these reflections and emotions Rose passed the night after her visit to the
                  Senator, half waking, hall dreaming by fits and starts of Hales and the happy
                  spirit land, where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXII.
               THE LAST STRUGGLE.
               It was about nine o'clock in the morning following the wretched night which Rose
                  had passed after her visit to the Senator, that Mrs. Hearsey had driven to Rose's
                  landlady and formed her acquaintance for the purpose of narrating to her the
                  circumstances of Hales' arrest, and warning her against the "viper."
               Rose had risen unrefreshed and looked haggard and weary. She had put on her little
                  pot of coffee to boil, more mechanically than from any want of stimulant or
                  nourishment. She was still in her morning gown and did not seem to be making any
                  preparations to dress for the day.
               She heard a sharp rap at the door. Surprised at a call at this unseasonable hour,
                  she went to the door and opened it herself to see from whence proceeded the
                  alarm.
               "Begone from my house this instant!" cried her landlady who stood before her with
                  her face flushed with excitement and gesticulating violently with both hands.
                  Begone! How dare you disgrace my house! Off, or the police will move you. Your
                  things will remain until your rent is paid."
               The landlady was a long, sharp, keen, sallow woman of about forty-five, in white
                  cup and apron, not scrupulously clean.
               Rose and her father had lodged there for two or three years, and Rose had retained
                  the rooms after her father's death. During all this time the rent had been
                  punctually paid whenever it had become due, without a single omission. Rose and
                  her father had been, and Rose was, what are called by ladies renting small
                  appartments, "most excellent lodgers," not merely on account of the regular
                  payment of the rent but because they were such quiet
                  people.
               The circumstance that Rose had not paid her rent would not have been a
                  sufficicient reason to have determined the landlady's mind to give Rose such
                  peremptory notice to leave the house; neither would any suspicion of her own as to
                  what might have been deemed an improper relation between her and Hales, or even
                  the arrest and imprisonment of Hales itself been sufficient. Miss Brackmanâ€”for
                  that was the landlady's nameâ€”was like all others of her class who had to subsist
                  the best way they could by letting lodgings. When she knew her lodger well, and
                  was satisfied, she would always prefer to overlook a failure to pay rent at the
                  exact date than to deport herself in such a manner as to lose her customer.
               This would have been her course in regard to Rose, but for the intervention of
                  Mrs. Hearsey. For this guardian of female virtue had whispered in Miss Brackman's
                  ear that morning, that an irregular intimacy existed between Rose and Hales, which
                  in itself was nothing, it was true, but that it was the common talk in some of the
                  best circles of society in the city, and that if she continued to keep Rose in her
                  house, that her house would soon acquire a disreputable fame, and that Miss
                  Brackman herself, however innocent, would be sure to share the opprobrium.
               Miss Brackman became alarmed and declared with emphasis that if she had had the
                  most remote suspicion of such a state of things, she would have "dumped" the
                  little hussy into the street in such an incredibly short space of time that her
                  head, (the hussy's), would have swam by reason of the suddenness of the
                  change.
               Then Mrs. Hearsey proceeded to state the circumstances of Hales' arrest and
                  imprisonment, his spendthrift habits, his debauchery and his profligate social
                  principles and his final capture as a forger. Mrs. Hearsey also spoke of the
                  search-warrant and of the material for forgery found in Hales' possession, and did
                  not doubt, if the truth were known, that Rose was in collusion with him, if not an
                  active partner in his crimes. She had no doubt that a similar warrant would have
                  to be taken to make a search among Rose's possessions, and she felt sure that the
                  result of such an investigation would establish Rose's guilt beyond any question.
                  But this, suggested Mrs. Hearsey, would be extremely unfortunate for Miss
                  Brackman, and for the hitherto respectable character of her house. Mrs. Hearsey
                  added in conclusion, as she was taking her leave, that she had been prompted in
                  making these disclosures solely with a view to herâ€”Miss Brackman'sâ€”interest, and
                  out of herâ€”Mrs. Hearsey'sâ€”general regard for the cause of virtue and religion.
               It was an event for a carriage to stop at Miss Brackman's door; how much greater
                  an event was it for the great and fashionable Mrs. Hearsey, wife of the great
                  railroad king, Mr. Hearsey, to get out of such a carriage and cross the threshold
                  of Miss Brackman's rented house!
               This effort was not lost on the appreciative instinct of Miss Brackman. She was
                  overwhelmed with confusion at the honor which Mrs. Hearsey's visit had conferred
                  upon her. It had placed her reeling under obligations to that lady which she felt
                  she could never pay in life. It was, therefore, but the work of a moment after
                  Mrs. Hearsey had gone, to rush up stairs into Rose's room, and tell her that "she
                  must begone from her house in an instant."
               What was Rose to do? She could not quarrel with Miss Brackman, for that would be
                  to recognize an equality between them. It was not worthy of serious revenge, and
                  to gratify a petty spite for an insult from a low creature was not in Rose's
                  nature. So Rose merely told her that if she would speak in a respectful manner she
                  would hear her, otherwise, being as yet mistress of her own apartments, she would
                  close the door, for Miss Brackman had not entered the room.
               Although Rose gave no expression to any feeling in response to Miss Brackman's
                  brutality, yet her sensitive nature was keenly alive to the terrible circumstance,
                  which in a manner, put her at the mercy of Miss Brackman's insults. Rose could not
                  pay her rent and it was due. She did not have one single dollar in the world. She
                  was a "pauper" and Miss Brackman had a right to tell her so and to call her a
                  swindler and to threaten her with the police.
               Rose was ignorant as yet of the fate of Hales, and thought that Miss Brackman's
                  outbreak was due to the fact that she had not been able to pay her rent. But she
                  was at once to be undeceived and made acquainted with the fearful calamity which
                  had fallen upon her.
               "A pretty piece of business to have the police searching your trunks for stolen
                  property and burglars' things and all that," said Miss Brackman in a hurried and
                     excited cited manner, "and you a
                  lodger in my house, and me a poor but honest woman! Go to your lover, Hales, or
                  whatever his name is, and never put foot in my house again until you come to pay
                  your rent, for if you do, I will have you taken to the station-house for a common
                  thief. If you want to know where to find your lover, you will find him lying in
                  jail for forging an honest man's name to a note."
               Rose only heard the last words that had been spoken. Hales in prison! For forgery!
                  It could not be! It was some awful mistake! Some terrible dream!
               Rose sprang upon Miss Brackman like a young leopard. She seized her fiercely by
                  the arms. Every fibre of her body quivered. Her eyes fashed fire and her
                  dark-brown face turned crimson.
               "Infamous woman! You lie!" cried Rose, utterly losing herself in a paroxysm of
                  rage and grief. "You would add to my tortures by your base slanders. George Hales
                  is innocent of any crime. He is not in prison, say that he is not in prison or I,
                  will tear your foul tongue from your throat!" shrieked Rose in tones frantic with
                  despair and clutching Miss Brackman's throat and tightening her grasp. Then in a
                  moment she relaxed her hold and fell at her feet and implored her to have mercy
                  upon her. She plead with her to tell her that what she had said was not true, but
                  merely intended to insult her because she could not pay her rent. She plead with
                  all the eloquence of a strong woman's heart in the desolation of its love; she
                  clung to hope with the tenacity of the drowning wretch who catches at the sea-weed
                  and is washed lifeless ashore with his hands clutched upon it in the rigidity of
                  death.
               In vain!
               Miss Brackman was not wicked and bore no malice towards Rose. And now, seeing that
                  poor, crushed, half-senseless thing crouching in terror at her feet, she took pity
                  upon her and told her with a kinder accent that what she had stated was true; that
                  George was then in prison on a charge or forgery; and that her ownâ€”Rose'sâ€”name was
                  mentioned in connection with the affair.
               After Miss Brackman had made this explanation she retired.
               Rose did not weep or sob or wring her hands or tear her hair. She was
                  calmâ€”terribly calm and stillâ€”but very cold and pale.
               What could she do? She had no money or any friends, and Hales needed both. Madame
                  Zarowski would not help herâ€”even if Rose could find herâ€”for she had even refused
                  to give her work when she needed it, and besides, Rose was proud.
               She glanced round her room. She took an inventor of all her worldly possessions as
                  she had done that chill Autumn evening after she came home from her father's
                  funeral. But with quite other emotions. Then her sorrow was sanctified and soothed
                  by all the tender recollections of the past. The peaceful spirit of her father
                  could look down on her from its sphere of calm repose and could bless her.
               There stood the same table at which her father had pursued his art, and upon it
                  was the old mahogany flute case with the flute oiled and laid away as he had left
                  it. There was the old and well-worn copy Jean Paul standing at its accustomed
                  place. There was the old arm-chair. Rose had preserved these from a sense of
                  religious veneration for her father's memory and she loved to see them about her.
                  It kept her father's spirit nearer to her she thought. And that spirit would be
                  happier too, Rose thought, when it lingered in her presence, if these relics were
                  near.
               Rose's furniture consisted of a bed and fixtures, a little parlor stove, her
                  father's tableâ€”as she called itâ€”where Hales used to write, a table in the centre
                  of the room, and a cupboard in the corner.
               She changed her clothes. She put on a heavy, stout woolen dress and laid out her
                  cloak. Then she took out all her articles of wearing apparel from her trunk. She
                  laid them neatly together and folded them up in a large bundle.
               There were some toys and trinkets that she had played with when a child. There was
                  a wax doll, a little China set of play things and an ivory cup and ball. Then
                  there were two rings. One had been her mother's wedding ring; the other had been a
                  birth-day present from her father. They were not worth much in money.
               All these articles Rose laid on her father's table to themselves.
               Then she put out the fire in the stove.
               After she had done this she went out and found a second-hand dealer and brought
                  him to her room and sold him the furniture for cash in hand.
               It was then a little after ten o'clock and the things were to be removed that
                  afternoon.
               When Rose had finished business with the dealer, she put the toys and the trinkets
                  ets and the two rings and the copy of Jean Paul and the flute with its mahogany
                  case all into a little basketâ€”the one she used to carry with George and her father
                  in their rambles among the hillsâ€”she took the basket and the clothing and left the
                  house. She took along the cithern.
               The landlady did not see her go, or if she did, she never stopped her to make
                  inquiries.
               Rose went to a dealer and sold the clothing.
               Then she went to a pawn-broker and pledged the toys and the trinkets, the rings,
                  the copy of Jean Paul, and the flute with the mahogany case and the cithern.
               There was a gleam of hope and Rose thought one day she might redeem these
                  treasures.
               When she had turned into money all her earthly possessions except the clothing
                  which she wore, she sought the prison where George Hales was lying.
               When she arrived, the jailor, a blunt, plain-spoken man, told her she had no
                  business there; that it was no place for the "likes of her." He told her further
                  that it was little satisfaction she would get if lie let her in, for the prisoner
                  Hales was in a raging fever and rattling all kinds of nonsense in his delirium.
                  The doctor, he said, did not think he would live over the night; he had the prison
                  fever and his brain was affected. At last he told Rose roundly that he could not
                  let her in without a permit from the proper officer and that she need not waste
                  her time.
               Another long and weary tramp for Rose. She would not hire a carriage, urgent as
                  the case was, for George would need the money. She set out to get the permit. She
                  was desolate and heart-broken, but the strong angel came to her now and lifted up
                  her soul and will far above the real, working world around her. She was tired and
                  foot-sore, but she kept on her way. She knew that Hales was innocent and she knew
                  that he had been made the victim of some dark plot, which she could not
                  understand. She scorned and despised the laws; she despised the miserable
                  creatures who hired themselves out for pay to execute them; she despised the dumb,
                  stupid people among whom she passed, for submitting to them.
               She found the proper officer at last, stated her request, and received a
                  permit.
               Another long walk back and a presentation of the permit, and the jailor let her to
                  Hales' cell.
               He was dying.
               At her request, Rose was locked in with him that she might the better give him the
                  last attentions that he would need on earth.
               The cell was in the lower range where the worst class of criminals were confined.
                  The air was foul and noisome. None could penetrate from without, and all the light
                  that entered through the grating of the door was from the dim and narrow stone
                  corridor, in each end of which a feeble jet of gas was burning. The stone floor of
                  the cell was cold and damp. There were two great iron rings there where prisoners
                  were sometimes chained down. The stone walls were covered with green mould and
                  were scrawled over with the reflections of former occupants. The prisoner was
                  allowed two old blankets which smelled of disease.
               Rose's womanhood did not forsake her. She watched over and tended her dying lover
                  in his prison cell with all the tender care of a mother for her first born. The
                  jailor passed to and fro on his rounds in the corridor but never interrupted
                  them.
               Hales could not speak. His eyes were growing glassy. But he was young, and
                  terrible as the stroke upon his brain had been, and fierce as the prison fever
                  was, the spirit seemed loath to take its flight, though reason had already gone.
                  The spirit seemed as if it wished to speak; to say something, before it could
                  depart in peace. It seemed to suffer intense pain and agony in making a vain
                  effort for expression. The struggle lasted long. Rose, seated upon the cold, damp
                  stone floor, rested the head of the dying man upon her lap and sponged his
                  forehead and lips with vinegar. The jailor passed his rounds, the sun was sinking
                  and Rose kept watch. Not a sigh or a sob escaped her. She seemed to be as cold and
                  strong as the iron bars that formed the grating of the door that shut her in with
                  George. And still she watched and ministered to her dying lover. She had no
                  emotions. Over her soul there reigned a calm; the calm that preceeds a high
                  resolve. She did not reflect. The Infinite Soul was working spontaneously within
                  her own.
               Rose heard the fatal rattle in his throat, the infallible precursor of
                  dissolution. She observed the nervous twitching and the wild, restless glare of
                  his glassy eyes. She noticed his nervous
                  fumbling at the blankets. Her instinct told her that the end was near.
               Suddenly there was a change. At once he became calm, the twitching ceased, the
                  death rattle was still, his features became composed and his eyes resumed their
                  natural expression.
               He turned bin eyes upon Rose full of all the love of other days and reached out
                  his arms to clasp her round the neck and said clearly and distinctly, "ROSE," and
                  then was DEAD.
               The jailor unlocked the door and let Boss out. She gave him all the money she had
                  and made him promise to give Hales as decent an interment as he could. The jailor
                  promised.
               When Rose reached the open air it was dark. It was cool and damp. It was late at
                  night. The full moon gave out a dull and gloomy light from behind the dense masses
                  of fog and mists. The wind moaned in fitful gusts at intervals and then was still.
                  Rose was walking in the direction of the South. She was insulted by some ruffians
                  of the night, but she did not heed them. She continued on her course.
               Presently she came to great piles of coal and could distinguish the masts of the
                  vessels. She was approaching the river. She looked round to see if she were
                  pursued. No one was to be seen.
               She reached a dismantled old quay, where the water was deep and the steamboats
                  used to come. She gathered her cloak around her and stood gazing into the Mack
                  water below, beneath the dull and misty light of the full moon that dreary,
                  moaning night. She thought of George, driven to prison and to death. She thought
                  of her dew old father and the flute and the mahogany case; she thought of her
                  mother, whom she could dimly remember as the angel of her childhood in happy
                  Southern France.
               She inclined forward, when she was suddenly seized by a strong arm and forced
                  violently backwards.
               It was Isaacs, who had learned she had gone to the prison, and had watched and
                  tracked her since she had left it.
               "What evil being arc you who would snatch a worn and weary creature from her rest
                  and peace?" asked Rose imploringly.
               "A friend," was the reply.
               "Why should I live?"
               "For revenge."
               "And can you give it to me?"
               "I can."
               "Then take me with you."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               THE SACRIFICE.
               The next morning Rose awoke in a luxurious chamber in the house which had been
                  formerly occupied by Madame Zarowski. That lady had made her final exit from the
                  scene and Rose had been installed by Isaacs in her stead. That day she addressed a
                  note to the Senator, and that night she rested in his arms, and the Grand
                  Consolidated Railway Land Grant Bill WAS SECURED.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               AD FINEM.
               Madame Zarowski has passed from the scene, and let us hope has found rest and
                  peace at last.
               Mr. Hearsey's dead body was picked up floating in the water by the New York harbor
                  police. There had been a mystery about his death, which had never been unravelled
                  ravelled. He was in New York, the papers said, to attend a. meeting of a Railroad
                  company of which he was the President. He had called a special meeting and had an
                  important proposition to make. What this proposition was no one ever knew, for Mr.
                  Hearsey never lived to attend the meeting which he had called. His confidential
                  clerk, a Mr. Tyrrell, had accompanied him from Washington and had disappeared at
                  the same time.
               Mrs. Doctor Plesington still continues to relieve the sufferings of the poor and
                  the needy and to believe in her husband, the Doctor, as implicitly as ever.
               Doctor Plesington has made a fortune and retired from the pulpit and devotes his
                  time to consoling Sirs. Hearsey'a widowhood.
               A terrible calamity over-took the Senator. He was suddenly seized with a strange
                  disorder, such as the physicians had never witnessed and against which all their
                  remedies were of no avail. In the midst of the most vigorous health and activity,
                  his mind gave way by degrees until he became a perfect imbecile. He gave Rose
                  money and jewels as long as he bad any ready means and then disposed of his estate
                  and gave the proceeds to her. He lived but a short time after the curse fell upon
                  him and died an idiot.
               Rose did not remain with the Senator until his death. After she had exhausted all
                  his means and secured them to herself, she left him to die in poverty and among
                  strangers, calling put her name.
               Rose herself is in Paris now, where you may see her sometimes in the Bois de
                  Boulogne, driving two Arabians, one milk white and the other jet black. Sometimes
                  you may see her in a private box at the opera, sparkling in jewels and fashion and
                  entertaining half a dozen elegant gentleman at the same time. But she takes them
                  to the card tables and ruins them and then turns them adrift. She is sparing of
                  her favors and takes remarkable care of her health and of her wondrous beauty.
                  They call her in Paris la tigresse. But she is
                  kind to the poor and lavish in her charities to suffering prisoners.
               The Grand Consolidated Railway Land Grant Bill became a law and the individual
                  interests under it vested according to the contract that was executed between
                  Plesington, Hearsey and Isaacs, that bitter cold night at Isaacs' house.
               There were some rumors of bribery connected with the transaction, but that was all
                  disproved and found to have originated in a forged letter of credit, demanding
                  money for pretended services in favor of the Bill. The scoundrel who had forged
                  the letter was imprisoned and had died in jailâ€”it was said.
            
            THE END.
