            PREFACE.
            A GENEROUS enemy will forgive us for taking a retrospective view of scenes that in a
               few years will fade from our memories; and although they may consider these home
               pictures too highly colored by a prejudiced hand, you, my friends, will recognize the
               accuracy of the drawing, and cast with me one last, fond, lingering look on our
               Southern homes as they existed before the red hand of war made them desolate. If the
               sentiments expressed in these pages should give offense to any, it must be remembered
               that they only indicate in a slight degree that feeling which helped to bring about
               the long and bloody war; and as it was my desire to adhere strictly to facts, I have
               been compelled to slightly introduce a trite subject. With the hope that these
               truthful sketches of Southern life may divert for a brief season your thoughts from
               the dull monotony of the present gloomy state of our country, as they have mine, I
               cast forth upon the uncertain billows this frail bark freighted with delightful
               memories of the happy past.

               CHAPTER I.
               
                  
                     
                        Good God! to think upon a child
                        That has no childish days,
                        No careless play, no frolics wild,
                        No words of prayer and praise!
                     
                  
               
               IN the beautiful South, on the eastern, bank of the Chattahoochee, where the tall
                  pines like stalwart grenadiers of the forest rear their green-crested heads far
                  into the blue vaulted canopy above, and the magnolias bow their royal diadems over
                  the modest violet, there is a lovely bower, formed by a jasmine-vine, which twines
                  itself around the wide-spreading arms of a gnarled oak.
               From its trailing branches the sweet, golden bells are continually dropping into
                  the flowing stream, where they whirl awhile in a merry waltz, then glide swiftly
                  on, disappearing from sight in the distant waters.
               Nature has lavished her rarest gifts to adorn this beautiful spot, where fairy
                  queens were supposed to hold their courts and revel in gorgeous splendor.
               Such, indeed, was the opinion of a little blue-eyed girl of scarcely ten summers,
                  who sat upon the moss-covered root beneath that shady bower, plying with wonderful
                  industry, her needle through a coarse garment of homespun cloth.
               She was a child of rare beauty, with lustrous, pleading eyes, in whose depths one
                  might read the purity of her heart and
                  soul. The face was exquisitely delicate—her eyebrows arched, her forehead broad
                  and clear. Strange and unnatural as it may appear, there was a look of habitual
                  sadness, mingled with patience and gentleness, in the child's face, which appealed
                  touchingly to the heart of the spectator.
               Her soft, dark-brown hair, which a mother's loving hand would have twined into
                  graceful ringlets, was hanging in a thick, wavy mass over neck and shoulders of
                  exquisite mould and whiteness. Her dress was originally black, but time had
                  converted it into a dingy, lusterless hue.
               Look into the unfathomed depths of those dark-blue eyes, and read the great and
                  fearful sorrow which is brooding over her young heart.
               She is an orphan! and the iron chain of dependence has bound her to a cold, stern,
                  heartless woman, who cares only for the work her little hands may do.
               It is sad to see the bright and cheerful spirit of a child crushed and broken—to
                  see it thirsting for sympathy—hungering for affection—drooping—dying—like some
                  sweet flower that pines for the dew and sunlight of heaven.
               Could I appeal to the world in behalf of orphan children, I would ask neither gold
                  nor silver—but kind and loving words for the desolate ones, which would fall like
                  manna from heaven on their poor wounded hearts; then they would go forth with
                  renewed strength to battle with the world, and make better men and women. They
                  would bless and ask blessings on those who gave the pleasant words which came like
                  refreshing waters to the weary pilgrim.
               "Blessings upon the little children, for of such as they are is the kingdom of
                  heaven!"
               "A happy childhood," said Isaac Taylor, "is a precious inheritance, with which, as
                  a fund, to begin trading in a practical wisdom and active usefulness. It is a
                  great thing only to have known by experience that tranquil, temperate happiness is
                  actually attainable on earth; and we should think so if we knew how many have
                  pursued a reckless course, because, or chiefly because, they early learned to
                  think of happiness as a chimera, and believed momentary gratifications to be the
                  only substitute placed within the reach of man. Practical happiness is much
                  oftener thrown away than snatched from us; but it is the most likely to be pursued
                  and overtaken, and husbanded by those who already, and during some considerable
                  period of their lives, have been happy. To have known nothing but misery is the
                  most portentous condition under which human nature can start on its course."
               Nervously the little orphan's fingers continued their task, only stopping
                  occasionally to brush from her eyelids the tear-drops that refused to be forced
                  back upon her burning brain.
               But hark! There comes from her lips a sound soft and low, but sadly sweet, like
                  the soft tones of the Zanaida dove, or the last plaintive notes of the dying swan.
                  She is trilling forth the words of that favorite little song— 
                     
                        There is a happy land,
                        Far, far, away—
                        Where saints in glory stand,
                        Bright, bright as day;
                        Oh! we shall happy be,
                        When from sin and sorrow free,
                        Lord, we shall dwell with thee,
                        Dwell, dwell for aye!
                     
                  
               
               With touching sweetness these beautiful words strike the ear, as the melody
                  mingles with the flowing waters and the dreary moan of the lofty pines.
               So absorbed had she been with her work while singing, that the approach of a
                  handsome youth of fifteen, with his gun and dog, had failed to attract her
                  notice.
               
               Stepping softly aside, he took the gun from his shoulder and placed it against a
                  tree; then giving a whispered command to the intelligent-looking dog, who
                  immediately crouched himself on the ground to watch every motion of his master, as
                  he stood with folded arms, gazing intently on the lovely child. Not until the last
                  echo of her sweet, sad song was borne away, did he emerge from his retreat.
               Taking the hunting-cap from his head and brushing the soft black curls from his
                  brow, he advanced toward her.
               Hearing footsteps, she looked up in alarm, and met his laughing eyes bent
                  inquiringly upon her. Like a startled gazelle she was about to fly from his
                  presence, when he gently caught her hand, and in the mock heroic style which is so
                  often assumed by youths in speaking to those of inferior age, said:
               "Stay, sweet fairy! and tell me from what radiant sphere thou comest, with those
                  melting azure eyes, and the voice that fell on my ear like the gentle vibrations
                  of an angel's harp?"
               With a look of mild reproof, she quickly replied:
               "It's wrong for you to speak so! for no song on earth is equal to the angels, with
                  their golden harps."
               A blush suffused itself over his face at this gentle rebuke—he saw the compliment
                  did not please her; then said:
               "Tell me your name, and why you have strayed into this beautiful bower? Does your
                  mother allow you to ramble off so far from home?"
               "I have no mother or father—I am all alone—with no one to love me!" she replied,
                  as the tears rushed to her eyes; "and Mrs. Grant does not care where I go, if I
                  finish my work. I love to sit in this pretty bower, for the birds all know me, and
                  while I sew they sing and twitter in the trees, and I don't feel so lonely here as
                  I do at the house, where everybody is too busy to talk to me. But I must go on
                  with my work, for she will be very angry if it is not finished when I go back to
                  the house."
               "She will not dare to punish you if it is not done," said the youth, his eyes
                  flashing with anger, as he observed her troubled look.
               "Oh! she will be very cross, and scold me terribly, and will not let me come here
                  again soon. I do wish she would not scold me so much; it makes my head ache, and
                  oftentimes my heart seems to swell and swell until I'm afraid it will break. Do
                     you think hearts can break?"
               "Yes, indeed, poor child!"
               "Nobody was ever cross to me until mamma died. I try—oh! so hard—to please Mrs.
                  Grant, for it's very kind in her to let me stay at her house. If she did not, I
                  would have to live in the woods, and feed on nuts and berries like the little
                  birds and squirrels."
               "Dear little girl, I think you would fare much better out here with the birds,
                  than you do with that blue-lipped dragon over yonder hill," was the youth's
                  rejoinder.
               Turning her head suddenly, the child remarked:
               "What a beautiful dog! how I should like to have a romp with him, if I had time.
                  Tell me his name, and let me call him, won't you?"
               "Tasso is his name—call him, and let him sit at your feet while you finish that
                  horrid task."
               "Tasso! Tasso!—what a pretty name!" she exclaimed, as he came forward. She patted
                  his glossy brown head, and for a moment wound her white arm caressingly about his
                  neck.
               "If I only had you to love me, pretty dog, I would not feel so
                  lonely; but I cannot even have a dog's love now. I know you think me a silly
                  little girl," she continued, looking up, with tears in her eyes, "but this
                  affectionate creature reminds me so much of my poor Rolla, and his sad death, that
                  I cannot keep back my tears."
               
               "Indeed I do not, but I think you an affectionate sweet child—much too good to be
                  tyrannized over by that hateful old virago, Mrs. Grant. Did she kill your dog?" he
                  asked, hastily.
               "Why, how strangely you talk! You musn't hate Mrs. Grant—I'm sure you have no
                  reason to do so. She did not kill my dog; but she is a person who is fond of
                  keeping a nice, clean house, and poor Rolla would follow me everywhere I went, and
                  leave his tracks all over her clean floors; then she said she would not stand it
                  any longer, and told me to make some of the negroes carry him off, where she could
                  not see him again. He was my papa's dog, and all that I had to love me in the wide
                  world, so I could not bear to send him away, but I begged one of the women to keep
                  him down at her house. She promised to do this, and for a long time kept him tied;
                  but whenever he could get loose, he would run back to the house, and howl and
                  whine until he could find me. This vexed Mrs. Grant so much that she told one of
                  the negro men if he let the dog trouble her any more she would make the overseer
                  punish him severely. So one day, as I was coming here, I saw my poor old Rolla
                  lying dead in a ravine."
               "The hateful old wretch! If she was a man I—I would make her wish that she never
                  saw a dog,—but where is her husband? Is he a bird of the same feather?"
               "She has no husband; he died long before I came to her house."
               "I would bet my head she worried him to death, if she did not kill
                  him some other way. She is not too good to do it, I will venture to assert. But,"
                  he added, "you have not yet told me your name?"
               "Lula Graham is my name. I was christened Louise, but my little brother in trying
                  to call me lisped out 'Lula'—and it sounded so sweetly from his baby lips that
                  papa and mamma always called me that afterward. But it is getting so late I must
                  go to the house now," she added, hastily rising.
               "For Heaven's sake! Stop one moment, and tell me if your father was William
                  Graham, of Charleston?"
               "Yes, that was my papa's name, and he lived in Charleston when I was a little
                  girl."
               "Found at last! Great God, I thank thee!" fervently ejaculated the youth, as he
                  clasped the astonished child to his bosom—then he added:
               "Yes, sweet child, I knew your father and mother, and loved them dearly when I was
                  a little boy; and you too, my precious pet! my little darling! I have caressed and
                  fondled by the hour, never tiring of your winning ways, or of watching the pure,
                  holy light that shone from your soft blue eyes. I used to look into them and think
                  that such were the angels' in heaven. Lula, have you no curiosity to know who I
                  am? Have you ever heard of Mary Herbert?"
               "Why, yes indeed! She was my mamma's adopted sister, and was so good and
                  beautiful. Mamma said, when she kissed me the last time, if she could only leave
                  me, with dear Aunt Mary she would die happy. If you know Mrs. Herbert, please take
                  me to her. I know she will love me for mamma's sake!" she cried, eagerly.
               "Mrs. Herbert is my mother, and I promise that she will not only love you for your
                  mamma's sake, but for your own also."
               "Are you really Charlie Herbert?" she asked, looking doubtfully into
                  his face.
               "Yes, that is my name; why do you doubt me?"
               "Oh! it seems almost too much to believe! I have prayed day and night to see dear
                  Aunt Mary; and sometimes in my dreams she comes, and whispers my name so sweetly,
                  and calls me her darling, as mamma did. Please don't deceive me—it will be too cruel—but tell me
                  truly, can I see her? Can I go to her? Now?"
               "Yes, my little Birdie! Just as soon as she can catch you, she will put you in a
                  cage so bright and pretty that you will never wish to wander in the woods to eat
                  nuts and berries with the birds and squirrels again. In a few hours you will be
                  out of the clutches of the old dragon. We will take you to our home, to love you,
                  and take care of you always—and you shall never, never go away again to live with
                  horrid, cross people, and never be obliged to work for them any more."
               "Oh! I shall be so happy! And you will be a dear, good brother to me, and I shall
                  love you all so much!"
               Thus she chatted, regardless of the flight of time, until suddenly it occurred to
                  her that she would delay Mrs. Herbert's coming. Charlie promised to take his
                  mother to Mrs. Grant's as soon as possible, and after a hasty leave-taking, Lula
                  ran, with a heart almost bursting with happiness, to the house.
               On the brow of the hill which overlooked the river the brick mansion of Mrs. Grant
                  stood, frowning with lurid glare as the hot, noonday sun shone fiercely against
                  its broad, red surface. Its closed shutters and freedom from outward adornment was
                  typical of the misanthropical and selfish nature of its mistress, who could never
                  see beauty in any flower or shrub save a cotton bloom, corn tassel, or some
                  bearded grain that promised to bring forth an abundant harvest by which her
                  coffers might be filled. When Ceres vouchsafed a bountiful yield from the broad
                  acres, the happiness of the mistress was complete; but should the seasons prove
                  unpropitious, her discontent would vent itself upon the sturdy laborers, by short
                  rations and scanty clothing, until the fickle goddess reversed her decree and
                  filled the barns with her golden fruits and fleecy lint.
               As the little orphan ran hastily toward the house, an old negress appeared at the
                  window of her cabin, and said:
               "Run fast, honey! She's been calling for you 'long time. She's done eat her
                  dinner, and she's as mad as a March hare, 'cause you wa'n't there in time. Bless
                  de Lord, an' be quick, poor chile!"
               On meeting Mrs. Grant, Lula was severely reprimanded for her long stay, and by way
                  of punishment was ordered to take another piece of work into her cheerless little
                  room, and remain there without her dinner during the long, sultry afternoon. In
                  vain did the poor orphan endeavor to explain the cause of her protracted stay. But
                  at this Mrs. Grant's small stock of patience seemed to exhaust itself. She refused
                  to let her see Mrs. Herbert, and said:
               "If she comes here on any such errand, she will be very much disappointed. No one
                  has the power to take you out of my hands, after I have supported you for nearly
                  two years, just as you are getting old enough to earn your salt."
               Lula burst into a passionate flood of tears, and fell at the feet of her heartless
                  companion. She refused to leave the spot unless Mrs. Grant gave her permission to
                  see Mrs. Herbert.
               This conduct from the hitherto docile child was too much for the enraged
                  termagant. Her anger was truly appalling, and the rage depicted in her face would
                  have subdued the sisterly trio, Alecto, Megara, and Tisiphone, in their most
                  terrific wrath, as with her foot she spurned the kneeling form of the pleading
                  child, and commanded her to leave the room.
               But Lula was immovable; despair had suddenly transformed her gentle nature—and
                  with determined resistance she continued to kneel and implore, perfectly
                  regardless of the cruel woman's threats.
               Poor little orphan—sweet innocent child! Is there another mortal with heart so hard, who could look
                  on thy prostrate form, and listen to thy pleading voice, and not pity, and forgive
                  the first act of willful disobedience? That look of agony and wild despair is
                  enough to melt the heart of Zeno's sternest disciple.
               Mrs. Grant looked for a moment with speechless astonishment on her pleading
                  victim, then seizing her hand, dragged her to the dark and dreary little room,
                  rudely pushed her in and locked the door. A loud heart-rending scream escaped from
                  the imprisoned child, and struck terror into the sympathizing hearts of every
                  servant about the house. Then a heavy fall was heard in the room, and all was
                  still and silent as the grave, as Mrs. Grant turned away with a look of determined
                  vengeance upon her flushed and angry face.
               Oh, woman! why will you ever leave your proper sphere, where gentleness, love, and
                  harmony should exist, to don a masculine nature, give vent to violent passions,
                  render yourself an object of dislike, and sacrifice the delicacy and refinement
                  that charms and renders you attractive to friends, and commands the regard and
                  admiration of enemies!
               Oh, it is sad! it is terrible! to witness the rage of a vindictive woman when
                  passion has crushed every human feeling from her heart. The fury of the combined
                  elements is rather to be endured than this unsightly object, which appalls, and
                  apparently turns into stone all who look upon it, as if it were Medusa with her
                  hissing serpents, enormous teeth, and brazen claws.
               The servants had often looked with indifference on their mistress when swayed by
                  fits of passion, but in this instance they quaked with fear, and gazed with
                  speechless wonder and awe on the angry woman, as every violent feeling was brought
                  into action, and they trembled for the safety of the little orphan.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               
                  
                     
                        Oh! stranger, scatter roses,
                        And slips of cypress burn,—
                        A broken heart reposes
                        Within this silent urn.
                     
                  
               
               MANY years ago the names of Wilmot and Seaton were known as belonging to one of
                  the largest and most influential mercantile houses in the City of Charleston,
                  South Carolina.
               This firm was at length dissolved by the death of Mr. Seaton; his wife died a few
                  days after, leaving their only child, Mary, to the care of Colonel and Mrs.
                  Wilmot. The husband and wife were victims of that dreadful scourge which sometimes
                  decimates the Southern seaport towns and cities.
               Colonel and Mrs. Wilmot welcomed Mary as their own, and so beautifully were the
                  ties of parent and child portrayed between them, that but for the name she bore
                  none would have supposed her an orphan.
               Their own daughter, who was several years younger, loved the little stranger with
                  a pure and disinterested affection rarely seen, and in her childish imagination
                  Mary was a model of beauty and perfection, and to emulate the character of "my
                  sister" was the acme of little Louise Wilmot's hopes.
               Years had strengthened this bond of love; and the first real sorrow known in that
                  happy household was when young Walter Herbert, a distinguished lawyer and wealthy
                  planter, led the lovely and accomplished Mary Seaton a blushing bride from her
                  happy home.
               
               Louise Wilmot, the idol of her parents, and beloved by all who knew her, fulfilled
                  every promise of her childhood, and became a woman of exquisite beauty and rare
                  mental endowments.
               Her gentle, unassuming manners her superior accomplishments, without an effort at
                  display, won the admiration of every heart.
               When she gave her heart and hand to William Graham, and resigned herself into his
                  keeping, it was said that she had chosen wisely and well, for in every respect he
                  was her equal.
               In this marriage her parents felt that they had not lost their daughter, but had
                  gained a son who was worthy of their confidence and love. Under the same roof they
                  became a united and happy family.
               After years of contented enjoyment in their luxurious home, Mrs. Wilmot, the
                  presiding genius of that bright and happy Eden, died.
               Her husband bent beneath the chastening blow. For almost a half century they had
                  walked together, hand in hand, through the checkered scenes of life; and now, as
                  though prematurely old, he would totter daily, with staff in hand, to kneel and
                  pray beside the last resting-place of his wife.
               The vine that for ages clung and imbedded itself into the trunk of the oak, when
                  torn roughly away will tear and wound the tree, leaving its vital parts exposed to
                  the stormy blast of winter and scorching suns of summer, which must at last cause
                  it to wither and die.
               Thus, day after day, the step of the feeble old man slackened, and at last he fell
                  asleep, to wake no more, until— 
                     
                        Through the world the awful call is sounded,
                        Wake, O ye dead—to judgment wake, ye dead.
                     
                  
               
               Soon after this sad event, Mr. and Mrs. Herbert determined to visit Europe, and to
                  remain there several years. This they accordingly did, leaving their friends, the
                  Grahams, in possession of health and every luxury that wealth could procure.
               But, alas! through treachery and misfortune, Mr. Graham suddenly became insolvent.
                  With the consent of his wife, he decided to dispose of their vast estate, in order
                  to meet his liabilities, and then seek employment and a location elsewhere.
               From his well-known integrity and capacity for business, he was soon enabled to
                  make suitable arrangements, and shortly afterward commenced operations in the City
                  of Mobile.
               As soon a Walter Herbert became aware of his friend's misfotunes he offered
                  pecuniary assistance; but Mr. Graham refused to accept aid from any one, never
                  doubting his own ability to retrieve his fallen fortunes. In their more humble
                  dwelling his wife and children were cheerful and contented—these he considered his
                  greatest treasures, and he confidently looked forward to the time when they should
                  possess a home equal in elegance to the one they had left.
               It was, however, a beautiful sight to witness the quiet happiness of their now
                  retired sphere. To see the gifted mother and lovely children, with bright and
                  cheerful faces, watching and waiting to welcome the dear husband and father.
               There the proud and happy man would rest his weary frame and overtasked brain,
                  leaving all cares behind him, and devote himself to the amusement and instruction
                  of the loved ones.
               It was not long before these devoted parents were called upon to restore one of
                  their precious little ones to Him who gave them.
               
               After a short and distressing illness, their first-born, the darling little
                  Willie, was taken to his home on high— 
                     His happy home beyond the sky.
                  
               
               Though it was like tearing asunder every fiber of their hearts, they bowed humbly,
                  and kissed the rod that smote them, and exclaimed, in the language of Job, "The
                  Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord!"
               Mr. Graham had endeavored to keep his creditors in ignorance of his residence,
                  until he should have it in his power to settle every demand against him. That time
                  at length arrived, the last debt was canceled, and he felt himself once more a
                  free and independent man.
               When this was accomplished, he wrote frequently to apprise Mr. Herbert of his
                  residence in Mobile. But as that gentleman had returned from Europe and made his
                  home in Georgia, the letters were never received. Pained and mortified by the
                  apparent neglect of his friend, William Graham, like all sensitive natures which
                  have experienced such reverses of fortune, became sadly suspicious of friendship,
                  and made no further effort to attract his notice.
               It was not so, however, with Mrs. Graham. She, with woman's unerring instinct,
                  read truly the hearts of their friends, and attributed their silence to the real
                  cause. She knew, too well, the heart of Mary Herbert, to believe for a moment that
                  any change of fortune could alienate her affections, and anxiously looked forward
                  to the time when she would meet her heart's sister, and with a mother's pride
                  exhibit her pearl above price—her darling little Lula.
               But, alas! just as their star began to rise again and throw its brightening rays
                  over the gloomy past, Mr. Graham's partner, in an unguarded moment, placed the
                  names of the firm as securities on a note for a large amount. As he had unbounded
                  confidence in the parties for whom the arrangement was made, he scarcely gave it a
                  second thought, until informed that the principal had absconded and left them the
                  note to pay.
               Thus—by a strange freak of the fickle goddess—Mr. Graham was again insolvent; the
                  innocent victim of another's treachery. The terrible shock occasioned a violent
                  hemorrhage from the lungs, which soon resulted in his death.
               Mrs. Graham had passed through a fiery ordeal of affliction; but her trust was in
                  God, the friend of the widow and orphan. 
                     
                        For He can heal the broken heart,
                        Which, like the plants that throw
                        Their fragrance from the wounded part,
                        Breathe sweetness out of woe.
                     
                  
               
               She roused herself to action, and did what she knew her honorable, high-minded
                  husband would have done, and resigned everything they possessed to meet the
                  demands against them.
               She then sought employment as a music-teacher. Her ability as a musician was well
                  known among her friends and acquaintances, and she soon found sufficient
                  occupation.
               After the lapse of a few months, a more lucrative offer was made her of a
                  situation as teacher near the spot where we found her child, the little Lula,
                  which was accepted.
               And here, with unswerving perseverance, she continued to pursue her vocation,
                  regardless of health and strength, until close application and confinement began
                  the work of destruction. She was then reluctantly compelled to resign her charge
                  and seek the country air, with the hope that rest and balmy breezes might restore
                  her exhausted nature.
               In the spring, when the hilltops and meadows were dressed in their emerald robes,
                  and bright flowers filled the air with
                  delightful perfumes, Mrs. Graham engaged board for the summer with Mrs. Grant.
               Day after day the fatal hectic flush deepened its roseate hue on her cheeks— 
                     
                        And giving a tinge to her icy lips,
                        Like the crimson rose's brightest tips.
                     
                   Her hollow cough echoed through the still hours of the night— 
                     
                        Her eyes still beamed unwonted fires
                        With a mother's love and a saint's desires;
                        And her last, fond, lingering look is given
                        To the love she leaves, and then to heaven—
                        As if she would bear that love away
                        To a purer world and a brighter day.
                     
                  
               
               Before the summer flowers were chilled by the autumn winds, the poor storm-tossed
                  wanderer "slept her last sleep" beneath the clods of the valley.
               She died as she had lived, trusting in the promises of the blessed gospel.
               Although poor, and destitute of worldly treasure, she felt that she had a home on
                  high—a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens, where no sighs are wrung
                  from wounded hearts, and no farewell tears are shed.
               We would not recall the sainted dead, or murmur at the release of her heaven-bound
                  spirit; but we sigh to think that the innocent heart of her child may become
                  hardened by unkindness and neglect; and the good seed implanted by a mother's care
                  may wither and perish in the chilly atmosphere of apathy which surrounds her.
               Mrs. Grant was not entirely callous to the opinion of her neighbors, and did not
                  close her doors against the little orphan, as she really felt inclined to do, but
                  decided to let her remain for the present an inmate of the house. She soon
                  perceived that Lula was intelligent beyond her years, and that errands performed
                  by her were better executed than when done by a servant. She had learnt to have
                  confidence also in the child's honesty, and would intrust her with the keys of her
                  store-room and other domestic offices where the negroes were not allowed to enter.
                  So by degrees the gentle girl became necessary to the convenience and comfort of
                  Mrs. Grant, who daily tightened the chain of bondage; and the perpetual scolding
                  and faultfinding of this stern, heartless woman, had well-nigh crushed the once
                  free and joyous spirit of the little orphan.
               In the afternoon of the day of Lula's meeting with Charlie Herbert, Mrs. Grant sat
                  on the front gallery of her house, shelling dried beans. So cold and hard was the
                  expression of her sallow face, that, but for the rapid movement of her hands, one
                  might have supposed her some statue, fashioned by Pluto to represent the "Iron
                  Age."
               A carriage was seen approaching the house—and very soon, Charlie Herbert,
                  accompanied by an elegantly dressed lady, presented themselves before Mrs.
                  Grant.
               She wished to appear unconscious of their presence, and did not raise her head
                  until the lady, in a pleasant voice, said:
               "I presume this is Mrs. Grant?"
               "That is my name," she replied, scarcely glancing toward her visitor.
               "I am Mrs. Herbert, the adopted sister of Mrs. Graham, who, I regret to learn,
                  died some time since at this place. My absence from the United States for several
                  years has prevented me from knowing anything in regard to her sad fate until a few
                  hours since. My son met her little daughter, accidentally, this morning, and she
                  informed him of her mother's death. This child, I learn, is a member of your
                  household, and I am, as you must imagine, most anxious to see her, and as soon as
                  possible."
               This Mrs. Herbert said, seating herself, notwithstanding ing her unwilling hostess had neglected to extend
                  to her this common courtesy.
               "You can't see her," was the curt reply.
               "Why not?" asked Mrs. Herbert, in astonishment.
               "Because the child is out of the way, and I have something else to do besides
                  running about to look her up."
               "Let me go and find her!" exclaimed Charlie, rising hastily from his seat.
               "Young man, I guess you had better keep quiet! Don't presume to interfere with my
                  authority here," she angrily replied.
               "How long shall we probably be detained before seeing her?" calmly asked Mrs.
                  Herbert, before Charlie could answer.
               "You won't see her to-day, madam!" was the stern rejoinder.
               "Mrs. Grant, the child has certainly mentioned to you her meeting with my son this
                  morning, and his promise that I would call for her this afternoon. You surely
                  cannot doubt the connection existing between myself and Mrs. Graham's child, nor
                  the claim I have upon her, and must thus recognize me as her proper guardian."
               "I recognize no such right; and if you get her out of my house you must
                     prove your right before a court of justice," said Mrs. Grant,
                  stooping calmly to take up another handful of beans; then she added:
               "If Mrs. Graham had intended you to have her child, she would have said so; but as
                  she did not, and there is no tie of relationship between you, I shall keep the
                  little girl, as she was left with me, and I will teach her to support herself
                  better than her mother did, by drumming on the piano. I have supported her for
                  nearly two years, and am not silly enough to give her up to the first person who
                  may fancy her, just as the puny thing is getting strong enough to work and pay me
                  for my trouble."
               "Great God, forbid it!" exclaimed Charlie, quickly; then added: "How silly I was
                  to leave the poor child this morning! I could have carried her home so
                  easily!"
               "And been prosecuted for kidnapping afterward," Mrs. Grant savagely answered.
               "My son, leave me to manage this affair with Mrs. Grant; she will listen to
                  reason, I have no doubt; and will soon find that my legal claim to the child can
                  readily be established."
               Then Mrs. Herbert, with a great effort to appear calm, gave a history of her
                  connection with Mrs. Graham's family, and endeavored to explain why all
                  communication had ceased between them. Furthermore, that every effort made by Mr.
                  Herbert to hear of the Grahams had been unsuccessful, until within a few weeks,
                  past, a package of letters (some of them written by Mr. and Mrs. Graham from
                  Mobile), which had recrossed the Atlantic, was received. "Upon the reception of
                  these letters," continued the lady, "Mr. Herbert left immediately for Mobile, and
                  has not yet returned."
               "All that goes to prove nothing, except that if Mrs. Graham had felt that she had
                  any claim on your charity, she would have hunted you up, instead of coming to me
                  in her distress. Therefore, say no more about it. I shall keep her child," stoutly
                  replied Mrs. Grant.
               "Perhaps, if you would take the trouble to search among her papers, we may find
                  out her wishes in regard to her daughter. If you will allow me, I
                  shall be glad to assist you, and the question may be decided immediately."
               "I shan't attempt to hunt among her trumpery for a thing that does not exist;
                  besides, if a letter were found expressing any such desire, the simple fact of her
                  not sending it, or ordering it to be sent, would go to prove that she doubted the
                  propriety of the step, since you had neglected her so long."
               
               "Mrs. Grant, it is not necessary for me to repeat what I have said in regard to
                  our sojourn in Europe and final settlement in this vicinity, to convince you that
                  Mrs. Graham was ignorant of our address; hence her inability to communicate with
                  us by letter. It is too absurd to deny me the privilege, at least, of seeing the
                  orphan child of my dearly-beloved and precious Louise. To me she belongs, and to
                  no one will I yield my claim. Oh! Mrs. Grant—be just, and let me have the dear
                  child! I was not prepared for this emergency." And Mrs. Herbert buried her face in
                  her handkerchief and wept.
               Charlie was so indignant that he could no longer control himself, and taking
                  advantage of his mother's silence, he said:
               "Mrs. Grant, your conduct is utterly heartless and unbecoming a lady! If I were a
                  man, I would have you arraigned before the country court for your harsh treatment
                  of that innocent child. I know, if the matter was thoroughly investigated, that
                  any jury in the State would find a true bill against you."
               "Young man, hold your tongue! your impertinence is beneath my notice."
               Then turning to Mrs. Herbert, and rising from her seat, she said:
               "Madam, business requires my attention elsewhere. You have heard my decision; I
                  shall keep the little girl."
               Mrs. Herbert continued to plead, but in vain. Every inquiry in regard to Lula's
                  place of refuge was insultingly replied to, and at length the perplexed and
                  disappointed lady determined to leave, and await her husband's return before
                  making another application for the orphan child.
               "Oh, Charlie," she cried; as they were again seated in the carriage, "I feel as if
                  could scarcely tear myself from this house, and leave the little angel exposed to
                  the wrath of that cruel and unjust woman! Oh! the thought of Louise Wilmot, the
                  beautiful and admired belle, the indulged and beloved daughter of devoted parents
                  who anticipated and granted every wish of her gentle heart before it was uttered,
                  toiling day after day for the bread of life, is positively maddening! But more
                  horrible still is the knowledge that her innocent, helpless orphan is held in
                  bondage by this godless woman, who, in my fears for the child's safety, appears a
                  modern type of the Roman Agrippina! Poor suffering darling! No effort shall be
                  spared to save her from a life of such misery and degradation."
               Thus conversing, they drove rapidly homeward; Charlie endeavoring to forget his
                  indignation and contempt for that "hateful ogress," as he was pleased to
                  denominate Mrs. Grant, in making delightful plans for the future; which though
                  bright to him before, had to-day received an additional touch of beauty and
                  sunshine, in the happy thought that the lovely little Lula—discovered, too,
                  through his instrumentality (that thought how precious to his boy's
                     heart!)—might henceforth be his companion and sister "forever and
                  always," as he pronounced in joyous superlative. In building glorious "Chateaux en
                  Espagne," of which he and Lula were ever the charming and fortunate occupants.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER III
               
                  
                     
                        'Tis a little thing
                        To give a cup of water! yet its draught
                        Of cool refreshment, drained by fevered lips,
                        May give a shock of pleasure to the frame
                        More exquisite than where nectarian juice
                        Renews the life of joy in happier hours.
                     
                  
               
               MR. HERBERT returned, fortunately, the same evening of his wife's visit; and at an
                  early hour the following day they rang the bell at the door of Mrs. Grant's
                  inhospitable mansion. A servant met them, and in reply to the inquiry for Mrs.
                  Grant and Lula Graham, she said:
               "Mist'es has gone to town, and Miss Lula's mighty sick, ma'am, though mist'es
                  didn't seem to b'lieve it when she went off. The poor chile done gone clean out of
                  her head, and keeps on talking 'bout her pa' and ma', and de angels, and eber so
                  many folks, day I don't know nothing 'bout."
               "For pity's sake take us to the dear child immediately!" cried Mrs. Herbert, in
                  alarm.
               "I'm mighty 'fraid mist'es won't like it if I do, ma'am but I wish somebody would
                  do something for the sweet cre'ter', for I've done all I could," said
                  the girl, with tears in her eyes.
               "Lead the way instantly!" commanded Mr. Herbert, in a tone which plainly indicated
                  that he would be obeyed.
               The girl accordingly turned to do so, notwithstanding the dissenting looks and sly
                  winks of a fellow-servant, who muttered, as they passed:
               "You'd better not!"
               "I will, if she kills me for it!" was the stout reply,— and they were forthwith
                  conducted through the hall into a little "shed" room, which seemed to be more of a
                  lumber-closet than a sleeping apartment. There were piled in one corner a number
                  of hamper-baskets with their crevices filled with cotton-lint, some garden
                  implements in another, while a heap of unwashed wool occupied a conspicuous place,
                  and filled the confined space with its noxious odor.
               For a moment Mrs. Herbert drew back in disgust; but the low murmur of the
                  suffering child reached her ear, and caused her to enter hastily and approach rude
                  cot, on which the little orphan lay, with her face fearfully crimsoned, and the
                  swollen veins throbbing wildly on her burning brow.
               "Oh! mamma, dear mamma! have you come for your little darling at last?" the child
                  cried in delirium, as Mrs. Herbert bent over and kissed her parched lips. "Why did
                  you leave me all alone, with no one to love me? Take me with you, dear mamma!
                  don't leave your poor little girl again. Be quick—quick, before Mrs. Grant comes,
                  for she will not let me go;" and she threw her arms around Mrs. Herbert, and clung
                  convulsively to her neck.
               Mr. Herbert had followed his wife into the apartment, and witnessed with strong
                  emotion this touching scene—then he came forward and gently unclasped her little
                  arms. As he did so the sick child uttered a low, piercing wail, and looked
                  fearfully up into his face; then meeting his kind, paternal glance, a change
                  instantly came over her face, and she sweetly murmured:
               "You too, papa?" and fell back exhausted in his arms. He laid her tenderly on the
                  pillow, and kissed her fevered cheek, then wiping the tears from his eyes,
                  hurriedly left the room to dispatch his servant for a physician.
               In the interim Mrs. Herbert called for fresh water, and gently applied the cooling
                  liquid to the burning face and hands of the child. With the aid of the
                  servant-girl Sally, who was willing to
                  brave the anger of her mistress if she could add to the comfort of the little
                  sufferer, the room was soon made a little more habitable.
               "Oh! mamma, how the sun scorches to-day!—it almost sets my brain on fire! When you
                  came in I was wishing I could throw myself into the beautiful river, where you
                  said the red warriors bathed their dusky forms long ago. I wanted to float away on
                  the bosom of the stream, far, far away, with no housetop to hide the bright sky
                  from my sight,—where the angels' wings could cool my hot head. You told me, mamma,
                  that God was everywhere; that his holy angels would watch over me; but I'm afraid,
                  mamma, they don't love this place, and won't take care of me if you
                  leave me again," the child said, in hurried, feverish accents.
               "Yes, darling, God is everywhere; he is watching you now, and I hope
                  will soon make my precious little Lula well again. Do not fear, I shall not leave
                  you, my dear child. Try and rest quietly now," replied Mrs. Herbert, as she
                  continued to bathe the throbbing brow.
               When Mrs. Grant returned and found her house in confusion, with the servants
                  hurrying to and fro, eager to obey every command of Mrs. Herbert, her indignation
                  knew no bounds. With flashing eyes and lowering brow, which betokened a coming
                  storm, she entered the sick-chamber.
               For awhile, the fierce tirade of abuse which fell from the lips of virago was
                  unheeded by her auditors, as Lula had fainted away at the first sight of her angry
                  face. Mrs. Herbert feared that life was extinct, and devoted all of her energies
                  to resuscitate the apparently lifeless form.
               Mrs. Herbert was impatiently pacing up and down the hall, awaiting the arrival of
                  the physician, when the loud, coarse voice of the mistress of the mansion
                  attracted his attention. He immediately entered the little room, and approaching
                  Mrs. Grant, said, with an expression of stern calmness:
               "Madam, as to intruding ourselves into your house, surely the sight of that
                  suffering orphan child is a sufficient apology; common humanity, if no other
                  motive, would have prompted us to act as we have done—there was no choice left to
                  us in the matter."
               We must do Mrs. Grant the justice to say, that she had been so blinded by passion
                  as scarcely to give a glance or thought to Lula, the innocent cause of all her
                  fury; but had directed both attention and speech principally toward Mrs. Herbert,
                  as the offender and intruder upon her domain. As she looked now upon the child,
                  and saw the fearful change which a few hours had wrought in her appearance, the
                  savage eyes quailed for a moment, and she was silenced. But she soon recovered
                  herself, as she felt the stern gaze of Mr. Herbert fixed upon her, as well as the
                  curious glances of her servants, and remarked:
               "It's only a scene the artful little thing has gotten up to suit the
                  occasion."
               The arrival of the physician prevented any reply to this heartless speech; and
                  Mrs. Grant, finding that her presence and fierce harangue had alike failed to
                  produce the desired effect, indignantly left the room. The physician who entered
                  was a person of striking appearance; he was above the middle height, with dark
                  hair and eyes; his face was handsome, and indicated intelligence and gentleness;
                  while his air and manner belonged unmistakably to a thoroughbred gentleman. He
                  advanced courteously toward Mr. Herbert, and gave his name as Dr. Clinton.
               As he stood by the bedside of the sick child, and watched the alarming symptoms,
                  her new friends felt confident that if medical skill could save her from speedy
                  death, he possessed that power.
               Mrs. Herbert had been informed by the servants of the unhappy contest between Mrs.
                  Grant and Lula on the preceding day, and justly ascribed the child's illness to
                     that cause. Dr. Clinton concurred with
                  her in this opinion, and decided that the attack was produced by the continued
                  system of tyranny and harsh treatment upon the sensitive nature of the little
                  orphan.
               "I will not be responsible," he said, "for the consequences, if my gentle patient
                  is left in charge of this modern Xantippe; for I am too well acquainted with her
                  peculiar temperament, to stake my reputation as a physician, where she has the
                  privilege of interfering. Besides, this child should not again be exposed to the
                  pernicious effects of her ungovernable fury; for tender nursing is more essential
                  in her case than medical treatment. I hope, my dear madam, you feel sufficient
                  interest in the little orphan, to protect her from this callous-hearted
                  personage?"
               "She is very dear to me, and I shall not leave her exposed to the baneful
                  influence of Mrs. Grant's temper for the future," was the reply.
               When the mistress of the house became aware of the intention of the Herberts to
                  remain under her roof as Lula's guardians, she was unable to find in her
                  vocabulary words of sufficient strength to express her resentment; but when Dr.
                  Clinton informed her that it was a matter of life and death, the storm raged with
                  unmitigated fury.
               "And you are abetting this artful little creature in playing off on
                  the credulity of these people, for the purpose of extorting from them a heavy
                  fee!" she cried, in deafening tones.
               "Mrs. Grant, if in your anger you forget to act the lady, be assured I shall not
                  forget the duty of a gentleman; therefore I shall listen not longer to your
                  unprovoked insults;" then bowing formally to her, he left the room.
               The tempest had well-nigh exhausted itself at the failure of every attempt to rid
                  her house of the unbidden guests, and the virago sat with the look of a despairing
                  and vanquished foe, revolving in her mind a change of tactics for their egress,
                  when Mr. Herbert again appeared before her and said:
               "Mrs. Grant, as the friend of Mrs. Graham and the guardian of her child, I wish to
                  inform you of my intention to liquidate every demand against the former, and to
                  make you ample compensation for the trouble and expense of keeping the latter. As
                  the child's situation will not admit of her removal, and we are necessarily
                  compelled to remain in your house for awhile, you will, therefore, please consider
                  us as your boarders, and any inconvenience we may occasion will be fully and
                  willingly remunerated."
               "I suppose what can't be helped must be endured," she replied, more graciously
                  than she had spoken since they entered the house.
               Mr. Herbert had instinctively read the character of this strange woman, and was
                  right in supposing money to be the "open sesame" to her heart. At the altar of
                  Mammon she worshiped, before no other shrine did she bend, and where her treasure
                  were, there was her heart also. Every member of her household could vouch for the
                  truth of the proverb: "He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house." She had
                  sacrificed comfort, friendship, conscience, and every social feeling, to the great
                  Moloch. Although an immortal tongue had propounded the awful inquiry, which still
                  re-echoes through the passing ages, "What shall it profit a man to gain the whole
                  world and lose his won soul?" it fell unheeded upon her ear. She still sought 
                     
                        Gold! gold! gold! gold!
                        Bright and yellow, hard and cold,
                        Molten, graven, hammered, rolled
                        Heavy to get, and light to hold.
                     
                  
               
               Regardless to poor Lula's imminent peril, Mrs Grant continued to pursue with
                  unwearied zeal the rugged tenor of her way, hurrying and scolding her negroes for
                     obedience dience as well as
                  disobedience. But they had long since become callous to her perpetual
                  fault-finding, which produced as little effect as the whistling winds through the
                  pine grove; it was heard, but not heeded. For what did it profit the poor
                  creatures to work and drudge so unceasingly? Punishment fell alike on the faithful
                  and unfaithful. "A bon chien il ne vient jamais un bon os." Therefore, under the
                  vigilant eye of the mistress the negroes would work; but in her absence they would
                  say: "When the cat is away, the mice will play," and literally they acted upon
                  this principle.
               One afternoon, as they kept watch by the bedside of the sick child, who was then
                  sleeping under the influence of an opiate, Mr. Herbert said to Dr. Clinton:
               "Can you tell me anything of Mrs. Grant's antecedents? She strikes me as a strange
                  anomaly of our Southern social life"
               "You are correct, I think, sir; a more complete amalgamation of the despot,
                  chicaner, and miser could scarcely be found; such growth is seldom indigenous to
                  our system, with its aristocratic tendencies and languid insouciance.
               
               "Her history is well known to every old resident in this vicinity. Many years ago
                  she came South as a teacher, and was engaged with her duties in one of the
                  'up-country' villages, where she met Mr. Grant, a newly-made widower, with one
                  child, and by some power of bewitchment, she managed to inveigle the old man into
                  matrimony. It was said he had been, formerly, very happy in his domestic
                  relations, and fondly hoped for a renewal of that happiness in this, his second
                  launch, upon the precarious sea-matrimonial. But she soon put to flight all these
                  bright Utopian fancies, by the stern sway of her material scepter-remodeling his
                  household, and establishing a new form of government—exactly the reverse of the
                  mild and gentle discipline of her predecessor. Mr. Grant was a cheerful, good
                  natured old man, fond of society, and much given to the bounteous hospitality of
                  the Southerner; but this last quality was not in accordance with the economical
                  ideas and habit of his new wife. So, rather than seat his guests before a solitary
                  dish of pork and beans, or some such meager bill of fare, at the board where peace
                  and generous plenty once so gratefully smiled, while the plump poultry, luscious
                  fruit, and other delicacies were reserved for market, he finally succumbed to her
                  indomitable will in this, as he did in everything else. His daughter, however, who
                  had been tenderly nurtured from infancy, and was, withal, an indulged child, was
                  not so easily subdued. She loved her father, and revered the memory of her mother,
                  and stoutly contested every point, either of reform or encroachment on their
                  rights. They lived in a state of continued warfare until Miss Grant married and
                  left the house.
               "The step-mother considered this a happy riddance, and from that time began to
                  tighten the reins and enforce her iron rule so mercilessly-that she at last
                  succeeded in worrying the old man's life out of him.
               "The strangest feature of the case, however, is that this reformer came South an
                  inveterate abolitionist. In the family where she was first domesticated, she did
                  not hesitate to express her sentiments, and asked permission to instruct the
                  negroes. Their mistress replied, that she understood their peculiar characters
                  best, and preferred teaching them herself. Notwithstanding this refusal, the
                  meddlesome creature undertook the task, and, for several months, carried on her
                  systems of enlightenment clandestinely. The result was, that the hitherto
                  contented and faithful servants grew suddenly morose, disobedient, and unhappy.
                  The cause became finally evident, and the teacher was given to understand that her
                  presence was no longer desired, and she must seek another home. I suppose this
                  unceremonious ejectment acted as a warning— trenching as it did upon her popularity and consequent pecuniary success, a
                  very moving argument in her case, as you may imagine—and she did not try the
                  experiment again; or, at least, it was not discovered. And now, this once bold
                  abolitionist and soi-disant crusader against the
                  evils of slavery, is a terror to the negroes, and is looked on with contempt by
                  every person to whom her character is known."
               "It is characteristic of this entire class of fanatics," remarked Mr. Herbert, in
                  reply, "that their philanthropy is but seldom more than lip-service—it does not
                  often reach their hearts, or interfere with their purses; when it does, a complete
                  revolution in sentiment is frequently the result—forming rather an amusing
                  exemplification of the meeting of extremes."
               "I have observed that Northerners generally, when they become slaveowners, are
                  harder taskmaster than Southerners," said Dr. Clinton
               "It is no doubt owing to the fact, that at the North one or two servants will do
                  the entire work of a large family," replied Mr. Herbert, "and it is quite natural
                  for them to expect the same amount of labor from the negroes. But they soon find
                  this a lamentable mistake, for one of their Irish or Northern 'helps' will
                  accomplish more in one day than the naturally indolent negro will in two or three.
                  With us, who understand them, they are seldom over-tasked; but discord generally
                  ensues, where two natures, so diametrically opposite as those of the Yankee and
                  negro, are brought in contact."
               
               Mrs. Herbert watched, with unceasing tenderness, the little sufferer, and many a
                  bitter tear fell from her eyes at the touching pathos of the orphan's delirious
                  murmurings. Her patience and gentleness during this illness had endeared her, if
                  possible, still more to the hearts of her anxious ious friends, and Mr. Herbert
                  evinced for her an affectionate interest scarcely inferior to that displayed by
                  his wife. Charlie's visits were frequent—bringing each day fresh flowers and
                  luscious fruits, as though he would fain coax the sweet child into health by his
                  tempting offerings. But what shall be said of the young physician who shared with
                  the Herberts their constant vigil beside the orphan's couch; and, when worn with
                  watching, they would seek repose, he would sit by her side through the silent
                  night—note her uneasy slumber, and offer, with tender solicitude, the cooling
                  draught to her parched lips? Was it, as Mrs. Grant in her bitter taunting had
                  said, for the purpose of extorting a fee? or a desire to insure for himself the
                  patronage and influence of the wealthy planter, that caused him to display such
                  unwonted zeal in the fate of his little patient?
               No! it was the pure and holy desire of a Christian to do the will of his Master.
                  He required no compensation for his attention, save the approbation of his God.
                  Often had this noble young man been known to keep his lonely watch beside the
                  pauper's cot, where he was sure no reward could be his except the fervent "God
                  bless you," which came gushing from the hearts of the friendless poor.
               It was touching and beautiful in the extreme to behold the faith of Lula in the
                  promises of the Bible. On one occasion, after the day's work was finished, and
                  Mrs. Grant had retired for the night, an old negress came into the sick-chamber,
                  and inquired in her broken, but kind manner concerning the welfare of the little
                  sufferer; then, after a heavy sigh, she bowed her head close to the pillow, and
                  said:
               "If de good Lord see fit to take my little lamb to his bosom, would it like to go
                  'thout a single murmur?"
               "Yes, Aunt Elsy; I am willing. 'The Lord is my Shepherd;' 'He will take care of
                  me,'" she answered faintly.
               
               "Bless de Lord for dat 'surance beney; but I hope he'll spare you to labor in his
                  vineyard for many years to come," said the old woman, solemnly—then turning to
                  Mrs. Herbert, she added:
               "Dis chile's bin de g'ardi'n angel of dis plantation, and she's done more good wid
                  her little Bible dan all of dem circus riders do in a lifetime wid
                  their highfalutin talk dat poor nigger can't onderstand."
               "But you all seem so busy, Aunt Elsy, I cannot imagine what time she could have
                  found for reading to you," said Mrs. Herbert.
               "Sure 'nough, ma'am, thar's no time weeky days, but when Sunday comes, an' mist'es
                  goes to church an' leave de blessed chile to watch, an' pray too, if she like, she
                  takes her little book and 'splains it so sweet to us, dat de road to heaven looks
                  'bout as plain as de path to dat wheat-field yonder."
               'She is a dear, good girl, and you all must love her very much,' said Mrs.
                  Herbert, as she stooped to kiss Lula's little white face.
               "Why, bless my life, ma'am, thar ain't a man, woman, or chile on de plantation dat
                  wouldn't die for her dis night if 'twould do de poor sick lamb a bit of good. Why,
                  big and little hangs 'bout de house ev'y time dey comes to eat jes' to ask arter
                  dat sweet, motherless chile, 'till de overseer he done say he's 'fraid mist'es
                  gwine to drive him off 'bout it—but it's gitting late, honey, and I must go.
                  Good-by, Miss Lula, I hope de Lord done see fit to make you well soon," and
                  pressing the tiny, white hand between her hard palms, old Elsy made her adieus,
                  and left the room.
               Days melted into weeks, and weeks into months, and God in his infinite mercy had
                  rewarded the faithful friends, and the judicious skill of the physician, by
                  sparing the life of their precious charge.
               Now she was about to bid farewell to the home that had sheltered her through the
                  trials and temptations of her lonely orphanage, and enter another sphere of life
                  as the center and idol of a household where clustered warm and loving hearts. With
                  tremulous joy she rested for the last time upon the little couch which had so
                  often received her weary form, and witnessed the struggles of rebellious
                  childhood, with its prayers and tears of penitence, awaiting the hour for
                  departure.
               "All ready, mother! all ready, Birdie!" cried Charlie's cheery voice from the
                  hall, whither he had just gone to carry out the last installment of packages for
                  the carriage—he could not allow the servants to do it, "they were too slow for
                  him," he said, as he hastily entered the room where Mrs. Herbert and her maid were
                  preparing Lula for removal.
               "Come, mother! leave Birdie to me, please, while you go and make your regrets to
                  Madame Grant for being forced to leave her fascinating society!" he said, with a
                  mischievous glance at his little friend.
               Then lifting Lula's slight form from its pillow, he tied on her little white hood,
                  wrapped a soft shawl around her, took her tenderly in his arms, and was about
                  leaving the house when she whispered something in his ear which arrested his
                  steps.
               "Excuse me, if you please, I can't afford to waste any more of my valuable time!"
                  he answered, smiling down into the little pleading face.
               "Indeed you must, Charlie! I cannot go without telling Mrs. Grant good-by," she
                  said, firmly.
               "And the old curmudgeon will be apt to box your ears for your trouble," he
                  replied, with a grimace—nevertheless he retraced his steps, and in a moment stood
                  with Lula before the lady of the house.
               The little orphan said:
               "I did not want to go away, Mrs. Grant, without thanking ing you for taking care of me since mamma died, and
                  telling you how very, very sorry I am for having given you so much trouble. I did
                  try—oh! you don't know how hard—to do right; but I did not understand your ways,
                  and you thought me naughty oftentimes when I didn't know any better. Good-by, Mrs.
                  Grant—please, ma'am, forgive me?" and she stretched out her little white hands
                  nervously toward the cold, immovable figure before her.
               This unexpected speech from the truthful child for a moment staggered the firmness
                  of the stern woman. A visible change came over her hard features, a slight
                  moisture dimmed her cold, gray eyes, and her voice quavered as she took the little
                  hand and replied:
               "Say no more about it, child; I have nothing against you. Good-by; I wish you
                  well."
               Thank you, Mrs. Grant, I feel stronger and better now from what you say."
               Charlie bowed to the hostess, and with his little charge left the house.
               "Mother, that is what you call 'heaping coals of fire on your enemy's head'—now
                  didn't Madame Bruin wince under our little Birdie's lash? She rivaled Shakspeare
                  in taming the shrew; I would not have missed the grand finale and exit for a splendid mustache and goatee!" he laughingly
                  said, as he placed Lula in the carriage.
               "Charlie! Charlie! When will you learn discretion? Profit by Lula's example, and
                  'Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.'"
               As they pursued their homeward course, and Mrs. Herbert listened to the orphan's
                  artless prattle, the following thoughts revolved through the mind of the amiable
                  lady:
               "Children are the sovereigns of our hearts, their smiles and tears are more potent
                  than the laws of an emperor; the latter may command the will and the
                  understanding, but the former rule our hearts. The tearful eyes and sobbing bing
                  breath of an injured and oppressed child will arouse painful emotions in the
                  beholder's mind, and indelibly stamp its offender with cruelty and ignominy. The
                  merry laughter of a joyous child is contagious, and falls soothingly on 'the
                  sin-sick heart and world-weary brain,' reminding it of that blissful home whose
                  dwellers have been likened to such little ones on earth. 'Little children are the
                  poetry of the world—the fresh flowers of our hearts and homes.' Their purity and
                  innocence breathes of a heavenly clime, and makes us forget the selfishness,
                  deceit, and treachery of a sinful world. They produce perpetual sunshine, and stir
                  vigorously the feeble life-drops about aged hearts, keeping them fresh and green,
                  carrying their memories back to a sunny childhood, those 
                     
                        Happy days that were as long
                        As twenty days are now.
                     
                   Beware of one who can find no room in his heart for the love of an innocent
                  child! Such a one is the possessor of a selfish, cold, and savage nature.
               "Heaven bless the precious earth-angels! 
                     
                        Ah! what would the world be to us
                        If the children were on more?
                        We should dread the desert behind us
                        Worse than the dark before."
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IV.
               
                  
                     
                        Fram thy mind to mirth and merriment,
                        Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.
                     
                  
               
               BELVOIR, the estate of Mr. Herbert, was several years ago a dense forest almost
                  inaccessible; but the wealth, energy, and refined taste of its proprietor had made
                  it one of the most desirable residences in the Southern States. While
                  contemplating its beauty and magnificence, one is reminded of Dr. Johnson's speech
                  to Garrick, after being shown the fine house and gardens at Hampton Court; instead
                  of replying in the language of flattery, he exclaimed:
               "Ah! David, David, these are the things which make a death-bed terrible!"
               The mansion at Belvoir is a large, handsome structure of gray stone, with graceful
                  iron verandas, standing upon a natural terrace overlooking the beautiful
                  Chattahoochee and the ever-verdant hills of Alabama. A group of majestic oaks with
                  their wide-spreading branches, shelter the house from the summer's sun, and give
                  an air of imperial grandeur to the place. In the foreground is a beautiful
                     parterre, where flowers of every shade and
                  variety are cultivated in great perfection; just below and around is the charming
                  park with its well-kept shrubbery; and noble clumps of forest trees, through which
                  firmly-rolled graveled walks wind in gentle curves amid the smooth, green lawn,
                  beneath embowering trees. In winding his way along these serpentine paths, the
                  visitor unconsciously meets with an opening affording a lovely prospect of hill
                  and dale, or enters some wild labyrinth, where rustic seats or a romantic bower
                  invite the weary to repose in their picturesque solitude. A lovely brook
                  gracefully meanders through the grounds, and here and there a sweet waterfall or
                  sparkling fountain will arrest the footsteps, and bring forth exclamations of
                  surprise and delight. Near the house are rare specimens of sculpture gathered
                  abroad; and in the center of the court stands an exquisite statue of a chaste and
                  beautiful nymph, who, like Arethusa, had apparently been enticed by the limpid
                  waters of the fountain to refresh her weary limbs after a chase with Diana. So
                  charming was its grace, so rare its lifelike beauty, that one almost feared it
                  might dissolve into water from the admiring gaze of some Alpheus-like eyes.
               Beautiful and unique hedges hide from the eye every unpleasant object, while they
                  complete a landscape that presents a scene of Arcadian beauty.
               It was at the close of a mild December day, and the household at Belvoir were
                  engaged in preparations for the approaching Christmas festival; always celebrated
                  by its every member, from the master and mistress, who looked with reverent joy
                  upon the day which brought "Peace on earth, good will toward men"—to the humblest
                  servitor, who reveled in unbounded hilarity and good cheer.
               And now the shifting scene once more brings the little Lula before us—Lula, now an
                  orphan only in name—the treasure and sunshine of her home-circle, the idol of the
                  household; wearing no longer the quiet sadness in look and tone, but whose eyes
                  beamed with hope, and whose cheek again wore the rosy tint of health, is
                  wondrously happy in the thought of the coming holiday.
               She was skipping merrily to and fro with self-important air; first in the back
                  parlor, where piles of mysterious packages cumbered tables and chairs, peering
                  about with childish curiosity, then whispering in Mrs. Herbert's ear, as if she
                  feared the walls might reveal some pleasant surprise prise intended for to-morrow; and receiving a smile
                  from the amiable lady, who humored the innocent mystery, the happy child would
                  bound away presently to appear in the kitchen, where Joe and Betty, supreme
                  dictators in its sphere, were deeply immersed in the culinary art.
               "Uncle Joe, are my little cakes and pies almost ready?" she asked, trying to peep
                  into the stove, as she saw him open the door to watch the baking process.
               "Why, bless your heart, honey! they's not had time to 'rive at the beautiful
                  spongy state I wishes 'em to, yet, much less done; but don't consarn yourself
                  'bout 'em, Miss Birdie—they'll be as light as a feather when you does get 'em. And
                  in that t'other side of de stove," he continued, "there is a pair of as putty
                  little ducks as you ever saw, with beautiful eyes made of spice, and wings all
                  covered with icing; I got Betty to make 'em out of puffy paste, an' they'll fairly
                  melt in your mouth when you goes to eat 'em."
               "There now! thought you 'tended 'em for Christmas gift?—done made me
                  promise fifty times not to tell, too! dat's de way—ketch a nigger keeping a
                  secret; he cant't do it, 'cept he keep it a-going!" said Betty, laughing
                  immoderately.
               "Never mind, Uncle Joe—I have not seen them yet," exclaimed Lula, as
                  she observed his confusion, "and I will be just as gland to get them when the time
                  comes, as if I had never heard of them before."
               "Sure 'nough, chile, you haven't seen 'em, so I'll keep 'em hid 'till I presents
                  'em to you," he remarked, much relieved, then added:
               "But I'm sorry I blabbed 'bout it."
               "He! he! he!" laughed Betty, in an undertone. "Nigger 'bleeged to be a fool
                     anyhow;" but she presently said: "Miss Birdie, how'd you like to
                  have a little jelly rabbit, shaking stiff and cold, in one of your little saucers,
                  Christmas mas morning?" as she filled the various moulds with the clear
                  amber-colored liquid.
               "Hurrah for you!" shouted Joe, in triumph, as her inadvertency,
                  "'done 'trayed yourself now! It takes a women to keep a
                  secret, certain; you don't ketch dem blabbing 'bout what dey 'spects to do
                  Christmas morning, 'cause 'deys so fond of 'greeable 'sprises!" and his loud
                  ha-ha's rang through every part of his domain.
               "Joe is having a merry time," said his mistress, as faint echoes of their mirth
                  reached her in the parlors. "I think he must have succeeded finely with his
                  baking, by that cheerful laugh."
               "Or Lula has provoked him into it by some of her artless prattle. I saw her bright
                  face it the kitchen as I passed. She is the sunshine of the place; and the negroes
                  all seem to love her as much or more than they do Charlie," was Mr. Herbert's
                  reply.
               "Uncle Joe, why don't you love to make new fashioned cakes and custards like Aunt
                  Betty does?" Lula asked, as she watched with unflagging interest the multifarious
                  compounds manufactured by their zealous skill.
               "'Cause, Miss Birdie, they's in gineral made by 'ceipts that aint got 'gredients
                  'nough in 'um to be fit for nothin' when they's made," was the sable artiste's reply, in a slight accent of involuntary
                  contempt at the mere thought of parsimony in such matters. "Now I
                  can't cook 'thout I've got plenty of things to cook with. Give me full weight of
                  the eggs in flour, sugar, and butter, and I'll make a pound-cake good 'nough for a
                  king. But when I makes by dem stingy Yankee fabrications, with a little bit of
                  flour, a little bit of sugar, and a heap of soda, with two or three eggs, taint
                  fit for nobody 'cept for dem dat wrote 'em. I wish de 'oman dat made dat book was
                  in de place they calls Halifax, where she 'long, 'fore she put any more 'conomy in
                  folks' heads. Didn't I hear you read in dat book t'other day 'bout making ox-tail soup, stuffed calf ears, stewed
                  sheep-trotters, and ever so many things of dat sort? It makes me sick to think of
                  um now. I 'spect there's no niggers and dogs whare she lives, couldn't spare
                  'nough to keep um 'live; all done dead long ago."
               "Uncle Joe, ox-tail makes very nice soup; I have seen it often at Mrs. Grant's,"
                  artlessly remarked Lula.
               "That was 'cause you had nothing better. I've heard talk of her 'fore
                  now, chile, and she's one of um, certain. I 'spect she made 'lasses pies and
                  pop-corn tarts, too. Why, bless your heart, honey, there aint a nigger nor a dog
                  on this plantation that would eat a calf's ear or a sheep foot. 'Twas jes' t'other
                  day I flung one of dem same trotters to Tasso, but he 'tended like he warn't
                  hungry, and turned up his nose and walked off, like he was insulted. Presently a
                  plantation dog come 'long, I 'vited him to lunch, he smelt it, then turned his
                  head away. After while he takes it up, and run a little ways off and buried it in
                  the ground, where he let it stay,—dat's all de use he got for Yankee
                  sweetmeats."
               "Oh! what dear little cakes!" Lula exclaimed, as Joe took them from the tin
                  shapes. "Not a single scorched one among them; I declare, they are too pretty to
                  eat. I am so much obliged to you; now may I take them to the house?"
               "Certainly you may, Miss Birdie; but if you want to see something nice, come back
                  after while and see me turn out dat big one; it's most ready now."
               "I'll be sure to come," she replied, taking up the dish of cakes, and away she ran
                  into the house.
               "I'm 'fraid that chile's too good to live," said Aunt Betty; "she's a real angel,
                  anyhow; I 'spects some day she'll take wings and fly clean away."
               "De Lord knows she's good 'nough," exclaimed Joe; "but it'll be a sorry day for
                  this place if she does, for there aint a soul here but what loves the sweet
                  creature better than they do themselves."
               Very soon Lula returned to the kitchen, and said:
               "Uncle Joe, auntie thinks the cakes are very nice, and Charlie would eat ever so
                  many, but he said he only wanted to show us that they were as good as they looked,
                  that was all."
               "'Bound for Mass' Charlie, you don't ketch him waiting for Christmas, nor nothin'
                  else, when be sees good things 'bout, and I does hope he won't be running over
                  here 'jes now," he said, glancing toward the house with mock anxiety, "cause I'm
                  gwine to turn out dat big cake," and he commenced the delicate operation with a
                  self-confident air, while Lula and Betty looked on in anxious expectancy.
               "Well! how do you like it?" he exclaimed, stepping back with arms a-kimbo and an
                  air of intense satisfaction, as he gazed admiringly on his work.
               "Now that's what I call a beauty; that's a cake as is a cake."
               "I declare, Joe, you ought to take the premium at the world's fair for that
                  cake—it can't be beat!" said Betty.
               "It is elegant! such a beautiful light-brown, and just the same color all over; it
                  looks like it was painted instead of baked," added Lula. "I hope auntie will not
                  have it covered over with icing, it is prettier just so."
               "I can't trust this big beauty to your little arms, Miss Birdie; Betty must take
                  it in," and as he gave it to her, he remarked:
               "Look here, nigger! if you led dis thing fall don't you come back here any more;
                  if you do, I'll kill you for true."
               "Where you bury all them folks you kill?" asked Betty, laughing as she walked off
                  to the house. "But you needn't think I'm gwine to hurt it; I thinks much of de
                  Christmas dinner as you do."
               "Oh, Uncle Joe, we are going to have such a splendid time!" exclaimed Lula, at the mention of the coming
                  festivity; "it will be a Chirstmas just like it used to be when my own papa and
                  mamma were alive; auntie has given me ever so much money of my own, and I have
                  bought, and made, presents for everbody! I love to make
                  presents!—from Uncle Walter and auntie, down to little Tom and Lucy at the
                  quarter; and auntie is making such a beautiful Christmas-tree for us children, and
                  she will have a grand dinner party for the grown people; now what are all the
                  servants going to do? Mrs. Grant did not give her negroes any presents, or let
                  them have any parties, she said it was as much as she could do to clothe and feed
                  them the year round, without such waste and foolishness going on for two weeks at
                  Chirstmas."
               "Humph!" said Joe with intense contempt at the mention of such scruples; "I
                  'spects so sho' 'nuff, Miss Birdie; there ought not to be no Christmas for such
                  stingy folks as dat. But it'll do your heart good to see how we all does such
                  things here. Master and mist'es says they wants to see us 'joy ourselves—de work
                  is all done up beforehand, and we jes' frolicks from mornin' till night, now;
                  Christmas-eve we's gwine to have a big dance, and every other night, at the
                  quarter, there will be a quilting or a candy pullin' one, and then we'll 
                     
                        Dance all night,
                        Till the broad day-light,
                        And go home with the gals in de mornin'.
                     
                   La, Miss Birdie, you never dreamp' 'bout sich times!"
               Later in the afternoon of the same day, Charlie asked: "Lula, will you drive with
                  father and mother to Mr. Carlton's, or remain at home and help me arrange the
                  Chirstmas-tree?"
               "I had rather stay with you, but if they wish me, I will go with them," she
                  replied.
               "We wish you to please yourself, my dear child, so stay with Charlie; I know he
                  will make no progress without you. What do you say to our inviting your friend,
                  Dr. Clinton, out to see the tree to-morrow evening?" asked Mr. Herbert.
               "Oh, I would be so glad to see him; let me kiss you, Uncle Walter, for thinking of
                  it!" and she put her arms around his neck and gave him a hearty kiss: then
                  suddenly her face assumed a sober expression, and she said: "I am afraid he will
                  feel badly if there is nothing on the tree for him, and now it is too late to make
                  anything. I am so sorry!"
               "Why, give him what you gave me just now, little one! It will please him better
                  than anything else."
               "Oh, I know what I can do! I'm so glad I thought of it; do let him come, uncle,"
                  she cried, clapping her hands and dancing about.
               "And we will invite Mr. and Mrs. Sunderland, Annie, and the children to come
                  also," said Mrs. Herbert.
               "And Alfred Raymond, too, please, auntie—he always looks so sad; but I hope he
                  will smile and be cheerful when he sees our beautiful Christmas-tree."
               "Of course Alfred will be included in the children's invitation, as he is one of
                  the family," replied Mrs. Herbert.
               "But Charlie don't call himself a child, and Alfred is about the same age," said
                  Lula, with a mischievous glance at the young gentleman.
               "Who dares call me a child, I should like to know? I am Mr. Herbert—junior—at your
                  service, ladies!" returned Charlie, drawing himself up and bowing with mock
                  dignity; "and first of all, madam (to his mother), I will escort you to the
                  carriage, as it is waiting at the door." Mrs. Herbert departed on her errand,
                  while Charlie and Lula were left to their pleasant task.
               Although Mrs. Grant had complained so bitterly of her excessive charity to the
                  widow and orphan, Mrs. Graham had left
                  more than a sufficient sum to defray her own indebtedness, besides some valuable
                  jewels which she had refused to sacrifice which she had other resources at her
                  command. The jewels were mementoes of dear relatives and friends—links that bound
                  her to a happy past of the loved and lost; these Mrs. Grant relinquished after Mr.
                  Herbert had satisfied the exorbitant demand against Lula for clothing and
                  sustenance.
               The orphan knew that among them was an elegant watch and chain which had belonged
                  to her father, and this was the gift which she had intended, with Mrs. Herbert's
                  permission, to present to Dr. Clinton as a token of gratitude and esteem for his
                  disinterested kindness toward her. She was aware of his having refused to receive
                  any compensation for services rendered during her illness, and she felt deeply her
                  obligation to his kindness, and firmly believed that her mother's spirit would
                  sanction the bestowal of this gift.
               Before retiring that night she took occasion to confer privately with Mrs. Herbert
                  on the subject, who was as much pleased as surprised by this unexpected request,
                  and quickly consented to grant the required permission. She had herself wished to
                  show her appreciation of Dr. Clinton's kindness to the little orphan by some
                  similar token, but feared to offend his sensitive nature by requesting his
                  acceptance of it. As this was, however, the free-will offering of an affectionate
                  child, she concluded that he could not refuse the gift.
               "But, my darling," she said to Lula, "I think you do not know the value of this
                  watch; it is an imported one, and has scarcely an equal in the State."
               "So much the better, auntie! If it was a common one I would be ashamed to offer
                  it."
               "Very well, then, I see your little heart is interested in this matter, so act
                  according to its generous dictates, and place the watch upon the tree to-morrow
                  evening. Now good night! and pleasant dreams; you must be up with the lark
                  to-morrow, in order to complete your preparations for the evening."
               Calm and cloudless was the night of Christmas-eve, while myriads of golden stars
                  sparkled from their glittering home on high, and shed their radiance—the beautiful
                  Southern starlight—over the happy home at Belvoir. Cheerful lights gleamed from
                  the windows, like friendly beacons, to the invited guests, as they traversed the
                  winding way, and promised a glad welcome to the joyous runion.
               
               Charlie and Lula, with bright and happy faces, awaited the arrival of their young
                  friends on the veranda, and amid the gay words of greeting, the delightful,
                  birdlike chorus of juvenile voices, there fell from some mysterious source a
                  perfect hailstorm of noisy torpedoes, producing peals of merry laughter, and
                  causing the children to scamper away with reckless haste.
               But Charlie soon rallied his scattered forces in the parlors, where, amid the hush
                  of intense expectancy, at a signal from Mrs. Herbert, the sliding-doors were
                  thrown open, and revealed a scene of fairy splendor.
               In the center of the room, between the mirrors, stood the beautiful
                  Christmas-tree, reaching from floor to ceiling glittering with starlike tapers,
                  and festooned with white wreaths of popped corn, which hung like snowdrops from
                  the branches that were drooping with their gay and precious load. The large
                  mirrors reflected the brilliant scens—each glittering point shone again, till the
                  impression produced was that of being translated into some enchanted grove.
               The illusion was so complete that the children cried out in bewildered joy,
                  pointing to the mirrors:
               "There is another tree! and another still!"
               
               Charlie was the good genius who distributed the fruit of the mystic boughs,
                  accompanying each gift with some facetious remark, until he plucked from it a
                  tortoise-shell case, with a card attached bearing his own name. On opening it a
                  handsome Geneva watch met his astonished gaze, and for a few moments silenced his
                  volubility.
               "Chickie, my cranie crow! what's o'clock, old witch?" cried little Johnny Carlton
                  impatient at the delay his examination of the time-piece occasioned.
               "Well! the watch is not dumb, if I am, and it says ten o'clock," he
                  replied, adjusting his long-coveted prize; and then added in a declamatory
                  manner:
               "My dear father and mother, I cannot find words to express to you my gratitude for
                  this unexpected token of your kindness and affection; but as you have heretofore
                  seen my anxiety on this point, you can now imagine how acceptable it is;" and
                  bestowing a kiss on each beloved parent, he returned to the tree, exclaiming: "My
                  friends, Richard is himself again!"
               "To Aunt Mary—from Lula."
               And he handed his mother a package, neatly folded, which proved to be a miniature
                  likeness of Lula and himself in a pretty oval gilt frame.
               "Oh, it is beautiful!" exclaimed Mrs. Herbert, as she fondly pressed the pictured
                  semblance of the loved ones to her lips.
               "Mother, you meant to say that mine was beautiful, did you not? for Birdie was
                  doubtful about her good looks, and begged my handsome phiz to set off
                  the picture," cried Charlie, looking quizzically at Lula.
               "No, you saucy fellow, I do not consider you an Adonis by any means. Of course, I
                  meant Lula; how did you manage to have this picture taken without my knowledge, my
                  darling?" asked Mrs. Herbert, as she folded the happy child to her bosom.
               "I heard you say, dear auntie, that you wanted my likeness, and I thought you'd
                  prize it more if Charlie's was with it. So I took some of the money you gave me
                  for toys, and had the picture taken; and Charlie brought it out yesterday."
               "A thousand thanks, my darling. It is, indeed, an agreeable surprise—and to me, a
                  gift invaluable."
               An exquisite meerschaum pipe, margined with gold, from Lula to Mr. Herbert, caused
                  considerable amusement.
               "My child, if you thus encourage my ruling propensity," he laughingly said, "I
                  shall soon rival Sir Walter Raleigh in my passion for the narcotic weed."
               "Our little fairy seems to have divined the wishes of every one. I would not be
                  surprised to find a splendid set of whiskers and mustache for myself; as she heard
                  me wishing the other day that my prospects in that line could be 'hurried up,'
                  and, like Jack's bean-stalk, become full fledged in a single night," Charlie
                  gravely remarked. "But ah! here is the next thing to it," he exclaimed, displaying
                  a handsome dressing-case, which contained everything appurtenant to a gentleman's
                  toilet.
               "A work-box for Lula, filled with thread, needles, and all necessary articles for
                  keeping her own, Master Charlie's, and every one else's wardrobe in perfect
                  order," continued the merry boy, as he handed the box to its owner.
               An exquisite miniature silver tea-service, from Mr. Herbert to the orphan, was
                  another evidence of his love for her.
               A set of coral ornaments from Charlie, and a handsome annual, finely illustrated,
                  from Dr. Clinton, showed that she occupied a prominent place in their affections
                  also.
               Each guest received a due share of the "fairy fruit," as Charlie called the gifts,
                  and were made to rejoice over some unexpected token of love and friendship on the
                  eve of the great festival week.
               
               Even Alfred Raymond was surprised into cheerfulness, as he witnessed so many
                  manifestations of kindness and good will.
               Dr. Clinton received Lula's gift with surprise and pleasure; and when Mrs. Herbert
                  told him how much the little orphan was interested in its acceptance, he could not
                  offend her noble, ingenuous heart, by refusing this sacred pledge of affection and
                  gratitude.
               Time sped swiftly on its wings of pleasure; the last article was plucked from the
                  tree, and the waning tapers began to drop like tiny meteors from its branches. The
                  last merry game was played, and the youthful revelers showed need of 
                     Tired nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep;
                   and with cheerful "good nights," and many kind words and good wishes for
                  future happiness and prosperity, the gay party dispersed.
               By the first gray light of dawn, dusky forms were seen stealthily gliding through
                  the house at Belvoir, depositing in some conspicuous place humble tokens of
                  affection for the beloved master and mistress, as well as for the children of the
                  family. If by an awkward step they stumbled against some unseen object, and
                  aroused the sleepers (as they invariably did), a broad grin would illumine their
                  sable faces, as they cried out cheerily: "Christmas gift!" and a "merry Christmas
                  to all!"
               Joe and Betty, true to their expressed intentions, had placed the ducks and rabbit
                  on the little tagre in Lula's room; they were
                  set in little baskets filled with sugar-plums, which were gifts from the other
                  servants, and to the eyes of the happy child seemed models of taste and beauty, as
                  she discovered them in the first light of the clear winter morning.
               When the family assembled in the breakfast-room, Robert, the polite waiter, bowed
                  to Mrs. Herbert, and said:
               "Mistress, I hope you'll excuse the liberty I've taken with the tea-tray this
                  morning, as I and my fellow-servants hope you will all do us the honor of drinking
                  your coffee from the cups and saucers which we beg you will accept from us as
                  'Christmas gifts.'"
               "Indeed we will, Robert, and thank you for this beautiful proof of your esteem. We
                  will drink to your health and happiness, and hope that you may always consider us
                  your best friends and faithful guardians. We are proud of your handsome
                  presents."
               When breakfast was over, the party adjourned to the veranda, where a large number
                  of the negroes from the plantation had assembled to pay their respects to the
                  family, and to bring their Christmas offerings of fresh eggs, dried fruits, nuts
                  and neat baskets which were manufactured by their skillful fingers.
               These were modestly laid at the feet of their mistress, and her kind words and
                  pleasant thanks brightened the smiles and gladdened the hearts of the donors.
               Then Mrs. Herbert had several large baskets brought out and placed beside her;
                  these contained the gifts which had been prepared by the family for their
                  dependents. No one was forgotten,—from Uncle Jerry, the gray-headed patriarch of
                  the plantation, who had known several generations of Herberts, to the numberless
                  little toddling children who crowded around the veranda in joyous wonder and
                  expectation.
               Charlie and Lula were the almoners of the day; and while she distributed the
                  gay-colored dresses and bright plaid shawls to the women, Charlie would give money
                  to the men from his roll of bank-bills. Many a fervent "God bless you!" arose from
                  the humble, though happy group, as they
                  received this substantial token of good will and satisfactory proof of faithful
                  service.
               Gentle reader! this scene is no fancy sketch; but one which really did occur
                  annually in our happy Southern homes. And many a philanthropist from the hot-bed
                  of fanaticism, who had been taught that the negroes at the South were scarcely
                  above brutes in the estimation of their owners, have witnessed these touching
                  instances of mutual affection with incredulous wonder and astonishment; and at
                  last—and we fear frequently with unwillingness—have acknowledged their compassion
                  and sympathy misapplied.
               While penning these lines, a scene of similar nature, out of many of the kind
                  which she was witnessed, comes before the mind's eye of the writer, stamped, as it
                  is, indelibly upon her recollection by its peculiar circumstances and bearing upon
                  a much-discussed topic.
               An eminent divine from the State of Connecticut, distinguished alike for fervent
                  piety and brilliant talent, whose ministrations and eloquence have won the love
                  and commanded the admiration of thousands, was sojourning for several months in
                  the home of a Southern planter.
               The Christmas festivities began, and Dr. L. now witnessed, for the first time, the
                  celebration of the holiday as peculiar to this section; saw the happy bands of
                  dependents watched over and cared for by their kind owners, reveling in hilarity
                  and generous plenty. And when, as the crowning feature of the occasion, the gifts
                  and tokens of mutual good will and regard were offered,—"Oh, my friend!" he
                  exclaimed to his host, while tears of feeling filled his eyes, "how have these
                  things been represented—or misrepresented to me! where I thought to find only
                  misery and degradation, I see content and happiness; instead of strife and bitter
                  feeling, mutual kindness and regard. Truly, we live and learn!"
               But where, oh! where are those humble friends now? Unbidden tears spring to the
                  eyes in answer to this query. Dissension and discord were sown between the two
                  races, and the faithful and once happy domestics became suspicious of their former
                  friends, and are now idle and miserable wanderers, without home or country. Many
                  of them have perished from want and exposure, and the few who have returned to beg
                  shelter and protection of their former owners, are glad to eat of the "crumbs that
                  fall from their master's table."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER V.
               
                  
                     
                        Humor and fun; humor and fun!
                        There's nothing like it under the sun!
                        But if you'd have it a perfect thing,
                        All of it honey, and none of it sting—
                        Except perhaps an occasional fling
                        At pride or folly or some such thing,
                        Hold on the reins, or rather chains
                        That wisdom throws o'er fancy's strains.
                     
                  
               
               WHERE do you having Lula educated?" asked Mrs. Carlton of Mrs. Herbert, one day,
                  in a social visit to the latter.
               "At home, of course," was the prompt reply; "or as near home as possible—for I
                  heartily disapprove of the practice so prevalent at this time, of sending girls
                  from the paternal roof, or placing them in the care of strangers and hirelings; at
                  the very time, too, when a mother's counsels and influence are most needed."
               "But you acknowledge the superiority of Northern institutions over our own, do you
                  not? and that the facilities for acquiring accomplishments are much greater there
                  than with us?"
               "No, I do not admit their superiority. Young ladies are often sent from those
                  fashionable institutions with a few showy accomplishments, which are well
                  calculated to fascinate a casual observer and to shine in a mere ballroom
                  existence; but their hearts and understandings are seldom cultivated—but more
                  frequently than otherwise, are suffered to run riot amid the light literature of
                  the day; and to imbibe the prejudices of those around them. Home is never brighter
                  by their presence, for their happiness is usually derived from excitement, and in
                  the display of those accomplishments which have been achieved at the expense of
                  every domestic grace and virtue. I insist that girls who are educated at home,
                  under the guidance and watchful care of cultivated and Christian parents, are more
                  thoroughly instructed and are better calculated to fulfill all their duties in
                  life—that, too, in a manner that will reflect credit on themselves and happiness
                  on all around them."
               "They certainly do make better housekeepers," was Mrs. Carlton's reply; "but do
                  you think they appear as well in society as those who are sent to a 'finishing'
                  school?"
               "I do, indeed; and I have had ample opportunity for observation in this country
                  and in Europe; and in no instance have I seen the home-educated Southern ladies
                  surpassed in elegance, grace, or accomplishments. My impressions in this matter
                  are confirmed by the statements of various distinguished travelers. Mr. Herbert
                  can tell you, too, how his heart swelled with conscious pride, at a tribute of
                  praise and admiration bestowed on our countrywomen by an English nobleman at some
                  dinner in London. The party were discussing the comparative differences between
                  the English and Americans, when this gentleman remarked that he thought a great
                  similarity of character existed between Southerners and his countrymen.
               "In touching upon the various traits by which he had been most forcibly impressed,
                  he said:
               "Their women will attract you by their winning though unassuming grace; fascinate
                  you with their sprightly, intelligent conversation; and excite your admiration and
                  respect for their practical sense and useful knowledge. You find them elegant,
                  refined, and accomplished, with every virtue calculated to adorn the home circle,
                  and dignity to grace the highest rank in society,'—and concluded this eulogy by
                  saying: 'Indeed there is a singular fascination about those Southern ladies, which is rarely met
                  elsewhere.'"
               "Those arguments are quite forcible, certainly, in favor of your views," replied
                  Mrs. Carlton, "and doubtless you are right; but I fear I cannot give practical
                  proof of being convinced by them; for Alice has won the consent of her father to
                  place her at Madame Laurie's establishment in New York, and she would not now
                  yield her point for the opinion of every nobleman and crowned head in Europe."
               Mrs. Herbert paused a moment, and then answered in grave tone:
               "Children are not capable of judging between right and wrong. It should be our
                  first care and duty to teach them that our will must be their law, and that
                  obedience to this law will be rigidly enforced if necessary."
               "I acknowledge the truth of your remark, but, unfortunately for me, I have never
                  had sufficient resolution to carry it into effect. Alice has an indomitable will,
                  which it would require very severe discipline to conquer; and I often find it
                  better to yield at once to her plans, although my judgment would convince me she
                  was in error. I think, however, that if Mr. Carlton would co-operate with me in
                  the management of the children I might succeed; but he always says: 'Let them
                  alone—let them have their way, for they will necessarily meet with disappointment
                  enough in life, and I wish their childhood's home to be the brightest spot to
                  which they can look back in future years.'"
               "I think, by exercising a proper authority over them when young, they are better
                  prepared to struggle with the realities of life," was Mrs. Herbert's reply.
               "The same remark was made to me, years ago, by a very dear friend, the mother of
                  Annie Sunderland. Little did she think then that its truth would be so soon
                  verified by the conduct of her own children. I have often admired the order and
                  system of her household—she required implicit plicit obedience, yet the love and
                  reverence manifested by those children for their parents was, and is still, truly
                  beautiful."
               "From the peculiar character of the children I imagine their mother was a very
                  superior person. Annie is very lovely, and displays some remarkable traits of
                  character; and I am told that her brother has acted with a nobleness of mind that
                  would reflect honor on those of more advanced years."
               "Yes, he has excited the surprise and admiration of every one by his honorable
                  course. Mr. Carlton says it would gratify him more to know that his son would act
                  in a similar manner, if similarly situated, than to have him fill the highest and
                  most exalted station in life. You are perfectly right in your estimate of their
                  mother's character—she was indeed a noble woman! 
                     
                        ——All that the world calls great she once possessed,—
                        With wealth, with rank, her prosp'rous youth was blessed;
                        In adverse fortune was serene and gay,—
                        'Who gave,' she said, 'had right to take away.'
                     
                   The children whom she had so wisely nurtured were a comfort and solace in her
                  declining years, and she felt scarcely a regret at the thought of death, as in her
                  last moments Mr. Sunderland, her brother-in-law, promised to take her children
                  under his protection. Annie is a worthy representative of her mother—a noble type
                  of character, which we do not often meet.
               "But, Mrs. Herbert, the object of my visit was to insist on your allowing Lula to
                  accompany Alice to New York to school; I have failed in gaining Mrs. Sunderland's
                  consent for Annie to go, but hope to have better success with you."
               "I regret extremely that I am unable to oblige you, Mrs. Carlton; but I cannot
                  think for a moment of sending Lula away
                  from me, as, among other potent reasons, I have always considered it best to
                  educate children not only in their own country, but immediately among their own
                  institutions, and where you have reason to think their future home will be made.
                  For this reason we did not allow Charlie to remain in Europe, although he might
                  have enjoyed some advantages there that he will not here, especially in Prussia,
                  where it is well understood the system of education is more complete than in any
                  other nation of Europe. We have determined to patronize our own institutions; and
                  I feel assured you will not find an establishment North superior to Dr. Hall's.
                  For talents and scholarship he stands almost unrivaled; the prominent position he
                  occupied in the theological seminary at Columbia proves this fact. In placing Lula
                  under his charge I shall feel confident that I have secured for her the protection
                  and instructions of a gentlemen,—a desideratum which is often neglected."
               "But Dr. Hall's is a mixed school, is it not?" returned Mrs. Carlton; "and I
                  fancied that the idea of mingling young ladies and gentleman promiscuously in a
                  common school had grown obsolete, except in the backwoods villages."
               "You mistake; Dr. Hall's is really not a mixed school; but a number of gentlemen,
                  who have great reliance on his ability for imparting instruction, have prevailed
                  upon him to admit their sons into his library, and by devoting a portion of his
                  time to them he will prepare them for college."
               "Then I am fully persuaded that yours is the wiser plan, and would gladly adopt it
                  myself if I could induce Alice to give her consent," said that dutiful young
                  lady's mother, with a sigh.
               It was a pleasant picture—that large, airy school-room, with its bright and
                  cheerful faces; some bent studiously over books and slates, while others, with
                  sly, roguish eyes, were more intent on watching the master, and only awaited an
                  opportunity to play off some mischievous jest upon their unsuspecting
                  companions.
               Love and affection were the rules of government, and the venerable instructor,
                  whose lofty brow and noble features were stamped with intellect and benevolence,
                  would often glance with paternal pride and affection over his interesting and
                  lovely charge.
               Dr. Hall belonged to that class of men upon whose face nature had legibly
                  stamped—gentleman. He had a commanding person, a polished air, and manly dignity,
                  that inspired respect without creating awe. His devout and reverential character
                  peculiarly fitted him for leading in public worship, and won the admiration and
                  confidence of all who knew him. Indeed, he was a man in whom the suaviter in modo and the fortiter in re were admirably blended; and his pupils carried with
                  them a grateful remembrance of his kindness and love wherever fortune cast their
                  lot in life.
               At this moment, as we introduce him to the reader, his eye is suddenly arrested by
                  a curious pantomime enacted by the girls who occupied the seats immediately in the
                  rear of those reserved for the classes during recitation—which were now filled
                  with a number of young ladies who were just concluding a lengthy Latin
                  exercise.
               The pantomimists understood perfectly the order and regularity which
                  characterized, even to minuti, their teacher's system; and witnessing so
                  constantly its strict fulfillment, seldom anticipated the slightest deviation
                  there-from. In the present instance, their expected amusement hinged upon the
                  custom of the doctor—generally an unvarying one—of leaving the room as soon as
                  each recitation was concluded.
               Apparently unconscious of their by-play, the teacher continued the ordinary routine of duty, with an
                  amused expression on his kind face; and when the exercise was concluded, contrary
                  to all precedent, he ordered the class before him to give place to another.
               "Lis sub judice—repice finem!" he said, as he
                  quietly remained seated in his chair.
               But, behold! as the class attempted simultaneously to rise, they found it
                  impossible to do so, and were forced back upon their seats!
               The mischievous girls in their rear had securely fastened the flowing skirts to
                  the carpet; and the efforts made to extricate themselves were so perfectly
                  ludicrous, that they provoked a smile from the "grave and reverend seignior"
                  himself.
               But instantly relapsing into stern gravity, he demanded the names of the culprits,
                  who thus dared to infringe and set at defiance the authority of a school hitherto
                  distinguished for the most exemplary order and decorum.
               The fun-loving delinquents turned pale with trepidation as they watched the
                  doctor's implacable mein, and sat mute and motionless, unwilling to brave his
                  anger or to implicate their companions.
               "Young ladies, this is a grave offense, and one which I cannot suffer to pass
                  unnoticed! Release your prisoners; then come forward and receive your punishment,"
                  he said in stern tones, as he bent over to reach his ferule (a much dreaded but
                  heretofore unused instrument of torture) from his desk.
               A painful silence still reigned throughout the apartment, no one appearing in
                  answer to this terrible summons.
               "Young ladies, shall I punish all of you, in order to find the real transgressors?
                  or will some of your number turn 'state's evidence,' and thus save yourselves?" he
                  gravely asked.
               "Dr. Hall," said a sweet, tremulous voice, "I am the perpetrator of this innocent
                  freak—all are not guilty; and I am ready to abide the punishment, although no
                  disrespect or mischief was intended, if you think proper to administer it." And
                  Annie Sunderland, a fair, graceful girl, came forward and stood with calm dignity
                  before the teacher.
               Then, by her side, immediately appeared our young friend Lula Graham (several
                  inches taller than when we last met her), with the meek pleading look of a lamb
                  about to be sacrificed.
               The folding-doors that opened into the library where Dr. Hall's students were
                  assembled had been left ajar; and as the two girls approached, several boys, who
                  had been attracted by the unusual tones of the doctor's voice, and had overheard
                  the discussion, stepped simultaneously into the room, and now stood with fierce,
                  defiant glances directed toward their instructor; who, apparently unconscious of
                  their movements, gave his attentions to the girls.
               "Dr. Hall," said Lula, "I can only repeat what Annie has said. We expected you to
                  leave the room immediately after recitation, and only thought to have a little
                  amusement at the expense of the class during our recess."
               "My dear child, I feel tempted to pardon this, your first act of disobedience; and
                  if you will divulge the names of your accomplices, I will grant you full
                  absolution," said the doctor, with much tenderness, as he looked upon the truthful
                  face.
               "I had rather not, sir!"
               "What do you say, Annie? Will you accept pardon on these terms?"
               "No, sir, I cannot!" she replied, firmly.
               "Then I must proceed to administer the punishment as I think proper."
               At this juncture the boys, who had stood silent spectators of the scene, made
                  another impatient movement, with riotous
                  looks intent; but still the doctor seemed to ignore their presence, and
                  continued:
               "Young ladies, I have witnessed the whole of this proceeding, and must acknowledge
                  my surprise and pain to find some of my best pupils guilty of such misdemeanor.
                  Sarah Ridgly, Isabel Willard, and Julia Stanly, come forward, and let us know why
                  you should not receive lawful punishment?"
               All came, and stood like guilty criminals at the tribunal of justice, except Julia
                  Stanly (who, perhaps, understood the character of the good doctor better than most
                  of his scholars); she approached with a bold, fearless air, while a merry smile
                  played around her saucy lips.
               The venerable preceptor and eminent divine, whose pulpit eloquence had so often
                  and so successfully appealed to the multitude and enraptured their hearts,
                  concealed beneath a grave and dignified exterior a keen sense of the ludicrous,
                  and a dormant love of innocent humor, which none were so well aware of as the
                  mad-cap Julia.
               "How is this, Julia? I see no evidence of penitence in your manner; do you plead
                  'guilty' or 'not guilty' to the charge preferred against you?"
               "I plead guilty, sir! and unless I can prevail on those chivalrous youths to
                  protect me from your anger, I fear we must submit; although the punishment seems
                  greater than I can bear," she replied, with mock solemnity.
               For the first time, their instructor deigned to turn his glance toward the boys,
                  who stood grouped together in threatening attitudes, as if meditating an attack,
                  and said:
               "Young gentleman, which of you will come forward as champions in defense of these
                  hapless ladies? Their punishment may be inflicted by proxy, provided they can find
                  willing substitutes."
               "I appear as a substitute for Annie and Lula!" exclaimed Alfred Raymond, stepping
                  quickly from the group; and waving his right hand toward Annie, and the left to
                  Lula, he presented them to the doctor.
               "No, no!" exclaimed the two girls, "we will not allow it;" and seizing his hands,
                  held forward their own instead.
               "I am for Annie! and I for Lula!" simultaneously exclaimed Robert Carlton and
                  Willie Sunderland, extending their hands, drowning with their loud voice the tones
                  of several others who proclaimed themselves knights ready to defend the two
                  helpless fair ones just mentioned.
               "One at a time, young gentlemen, if you please. Your hand, Master Raymond," said
                  Dr. Hall; and he gave one blow as punishment for each girl; then went through the
                  same ceremony with Masters Carlton, Sunderland, and others, each stroke bringing
                  tears from the eyes of the two girls.
               "Has the heat of the contest exhausted the chivalry of Young America, that
                     we should remain defenseless?" exclaimed Julia Stanly, defiantly,
                  inclining her head toward Alfred Raymond.
               "I owe him a grudge," she whispered to Sarah Ridgly, "for saying that Lula
                  Graham's composition was better than mine, last week."
               "Oh no! I have strength left to protect the weak," he replied, significantly; then
                  bowing to her, he offered his hand to the preceptor.
               "No, Master Raymond! you have already volunteered in defense of two ladies, and I
                  cannot permit you to suffer for the third."
               After considerable parley among them, other boys were persuaded to come forward
                  and rescue the forlorn damsels; perhaps shamed to the duty by the spontaneous
                  gallantry of Raymond, Carlton, and others. Some were heard to remark that all
                  except Annie and Lula deserved punishment for refusing to acknowledge their guilt,
                  and then in heartlessly wishing the boys to suffer for them.
               
               The doctor might have been of the same opinion, and his high-toned, chivalrous
                  spirit was certainly shocked at their tardiness in coming forward; for the blows
                  fell thick and fast upon the hands of the ruthless knights.
               This novel mode of correction had a salutary effect upon the pupils—the rules of
                  decorum were henceforth strictly observed by our friends, Annie and Lula, and
                  corporeal punishment was never again resorted to in the school where honor,
                  esteem, and affection held such potent sway.
               A few days after the incident recorded above, Lula Graham lingered in the
                  recitation-room after the dismissal of the school, and said, with some
                  hesitation:
               "Dr. Hall, if you have no immediate engagement on hand, I would like to detain you
                  for a few moments, as I wish to ask a favor."
               A smile brightened his benevolent face as he gently stroked her soft ringlets.
               "Do not hesitate a moment to do it, my dear child; for without knowing the nature
                  of your request, I feel assured that it is a reasonable one, and therefore can
                  promise a ready compliance with your wish."
               "Thank you, doctor! but still I fear you will not approve of this request when it
                  is made known, as it may possibly cause mortification and embarrassment to the
                  person whom I wish to serve."
               "Well, let us decide that after your purpose is revealed; perhaps I may be able
                  assist you in some way."
               Thus convinced of his sympathy and willingness to oblige her, she said,
                  blushingly:
               "I have a little friend, who is very bright and intelligent considering her
                  advantages. She is very anxious to be taught, and I have assisted her in acquiring
                  a knowledge of books which has incited to make further progress in learning. Her
                  parents are poor, ignorant Irish, and, of course, cannot send her to school;
                  therefore I concluded to appeal to you in her behalf."
               "You have done wisely, my child. Bring her to me by all means. It will be a labor
                  of love for me to assist in her laudable desire. Bring her without fail on
                  to-morrow. I shall welcome your little Irish friend as cheerfully as if she were
                  the daughter of a millionaire, indeed more so, because from the latter I should
                  expect only temporary remuneration, but in the case of the former I shall receive
                  an immortal reward."
               "Dr. Hall, I intended you should receive both. It was not my purpose to introduce
                  Maggie Mooney into your school as a charity scholar. That I never should have
                  dared to do. I have reserved a sufficient amount from my pin-money to pay half of
                  her tuition in advance, and at the expiration of the term, when the remainder is
                  due, it will be ready for your acceptance."
               "God bless your pure and unselfish heart, dear Lula!" the venerable teacher
                  exclaimed, with tender emotion; then, after a brief pause, added:
               "I cannot permit this self-denial on your part. I cannot allow you so much
                  advantage of me in Christian kindness and generosity. Say no more about
                  remuneration, my child, but request your young friend to meet us on to-morrow at
                  this place. You have interested me greatly in her behalf, and I am anxious to
                  cultivate an acquaintance which promises much pleasure."
               "You must excuse me, doctor, if I fail to comply with your request on such terms.
                  Maggie is a peculiar girl in some respects, and possesses an innate sense of
                  independence and self-respect. She would never enter the school-room of a stranger
                  without thinking she could give a recompense for the services bestowed. She does
                  not feel the same hesitancy in receiving a favor from me, because I have persuaded
                  her that at some future time she can
                  assist me with her needle, and in various other ways. Her father is a man of good
                  impulses, and if he could refrain from liquor, would probably be able to support
                  his family very genteelly; but that unfortunate habit has mastered him completely,
                  and often in his hours of intoxication he will say or do something that will
                  disturb the peace and quietude of his family, and cast a reproach on the Catholic
                  Church, of which his wife is a pious and exemplary member. You must let her come,
                  doctor, upon the condition I propose, or she will not come at all; and it will be
                  a great disappointment to me as well as to Maggie."
               "Have it your own way for the present, my daughter; but when Maggie and I become
                  acquainted, we will arrange it differently, I suspect," he said, smilingly.
               "Thank you! thank you! my kind, good teacher. Now, the only thing that disturbs
                  me, or will mar the pleasure of bringing my friend to school is, that the girls
                  may not receive her kindly on account of her parentage, and her sensitive nature
                  perhaps will be wounded by some careless or unkind remark."
               "Ah! my dear child, do not let the fear of ridicule deter you from doing a noble
                  and generous deed that will surely meet with the approbation of your God, and
                  cause joy among the heavenly hosts."
               The next morning, at the appointed hour, Lula Graham appeared, accompanied by a
                  modest, quiet-looking young girl, whom she escorted up to the teacher, and
                  said:
               "Dr. Hall, this is my friend, Maggie Mooney."
               His kind face was instantly illumined with a pleasant smile, which completely won
                  the little stranger's heart, and taking her hand, he remarked:
               "I am glad to receive you as a pupil, Maggie, and I am certain we shall be stanch
                  friends in a little while."
               After further conversation, her timidity gave place to natural ease, and she met
                  his paternal glance quite fearlessly. Then he requested her to be seated.
               No particular seat had been designated, and the poor girl stood for a moment
                  painfully embarrassed as she saw several of the young ladies spread out their
                  spacious crinoline to the fullest extent, showing thereby that her proximity to
                  them was not desirable.
               Dr. Hall witnessed this cruel and unkind manœuvre on the part of his pupils, and
                  quickly remarked:
               "Annie, give Maggie a seat between Lula and yourself; as she is my friend, I can
                  safely depend on you to see she is properly cared for until she is sufficiently
                  acquainted to feel at home among us."
               As Lula seated herself beside the blushing girl, Julia Stanly gave a contemptuous
                  toss of her head, and said:
               "'Birds of a feather flock together;' I want none of Paddy's company myself."
               Annie Sunderland and Lula Graham were universal favorites, and exerted a happy
                  influence over the pupils; therefore Dr. Hall felt no uneasiness about the
                  introduction and future welfare of Lula's protege.
               
               Maggie soon made rapid progress in the good graces of a majority of the young
                  ladies by her gentle, modest manner. Her improvement was watched with surprise and
                  delight by her teacher, who would often stimulate the happy girl to renewed
                  efforts by saying, as he gently patted her head:
               "Ah, Maggie! when you are a little older, you can relieve me of many duties that
                  are becoming almost too onerous for an old man who has nearly numbered his
                  three-score and ten."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VI.
               
                  
                     
                        The sunny hours of childhood,
                        How soon they pass away!
                        Like flowers in the wild-wood,
                        That once bloomed fresh and gay.
                     
                  
               
               TWELVE or fifteen months had elapsed since the scenes described in the last
                  chapter. It was at the close of the scholastic year, and the examination of the
                  first class had passed creditably to all parties. Annie Sunderland was the
                  successful competitress for the first honor, and had won golden opinions from the
                  critics by her thorough knowledge of the text-book. Her gentle, unassuming manners
                  had secured the affection of her companions; and when it was known that she would
                  receive the highest premium for scholarship, the voice of envy and malice were
                  hushed, for none dared to question a decision so justly made.
               But in the second class, much doubt had existed as to who would be the fortunate
                  candidate. The contest at length became exciting and amusing between Julia Stanly
                  and Lula Graham: Although it was an established fact among teachers and pupils
                  that Lula was the best scholar in her class, yet the bold, confident manner of
                  Julia so deluded the audience that it soon became evident she would triumph over
                  the timid Lula.
               A difficult question was propounded, and correctly answered by Lula, but in
                  softly-modulated tones, scarcely audible to any save her teacher and companions.
                  Julia's quick, attentive ear was on the qui
                     vive, and instantly catching the words, boldly remarked to Lula, "You
                  mistake!" and then turning to the audience, in a clear, distinct voice, she
                  repeated the same answer verbatim; which before
                  Lula's reply was unknown to her.
               Dr. Hall, and Lula's friends who sat near, saw through this stratagem immediately,
                  and were secretly annoyed at Julia's duplicity in thus endeavoring to defraud the
                  orphan girl of her just laurels; and the poor child was so overcome by the
                  audacity of her rival that the encouraging smile of her teacher, and his
                  affectionate request: "Speak a little louder, my dear child—your answers are
                  perfectly correct," failed to produce any effect whatever on the embarrassed and
                  sensitive girl.
               Emboldened by the success of her artful game, Julia continued to play off upon the
                  credulity of the audience, and completely vanquished her competitress.
               Dr. Hall appeared perfectly nonplussed at this unexpected termination of affairs,
                  and closed the book with apparent disgust, as he saw the proud, exultant looks
                  which Julia bestowed on her gentle victim. His noble and generous heart was deeply
                  grieved by the shameless manner in which Lula had been deprived of the honor so
                  justly her due; and requested her to meet him in the library after the exercises
                  had closed, that he might relieve her mortification by acknowledging her
                  superiority in scholarship, and express his regret at the unjust decision of the
                  committee.
               Accompanied by Mrs. Herbert, she soon entered the room; but, instead of the sad,
                  tearful face he expected to see, she appeared radiant with happiness, and her
                  cheerful voice and merry laugh rang through the apartment as sweetly as the tones
                  of a silver bell.
               "My dear child, I am delighted to see this happy transformation in your
                  countenance; you come like a sunbeam to dispel the cloud that had settled over the
                  heart of your old teacher,—I expected to see your face bathed in tears; and
                  knowing that you would value my opinion, I wished to comfort you by saying that you have acquitted yourself well, far
                  better than any other in the class; and I am compelled to say my disappointment is
                     very great, in having this affair terminate so differently from
                  what I anticipated. Madam," he continued, turning toward Mrs. Herbert, "does it
                  not strike you as something very ridiculous, that one, proverbial for idleness and
                  inattention, should apparently excel a class of intelligent girls, and carry off
                  the prize before the eyes of her instructor and companions; and through the
                  decision of impartial critics, who were to see justice done?"
               "It was certainly very amusing to those who understood the farce; but I hope you
                  will not allow it to disturb you for a moment, Dr. Hall; I am perfectly satisfied
                  with the result—and shall always feel proud of my little girl, when modesty and a
                  want of boldness are considered her greatest defects;" and Mrs. Herbert wound her
                  arm affectionately around the child.
               "Thank you, dear auntie! For the sake of my friends I should like to have
                  succeeded, but I am not at all disappointed, as I felt certain beforehand that my
                  confidence would desert me; and when we came upon the stage, and I found so many
                  eyes turned toward us, I felt dizzy, and thought that I should faint, although I
                  tried, as Charlie had told me, 'to screw my courage to the sticking point.' At
                  first I was scarcely conscious of the sound that issued from my lips; still, if I
                  had been left alone, perhaps I would have recovered myself; but Julia entirely
                  disconcerted me by saying; 'You mistake! it is thus and so;' and the girls all say
                  she repeated precisely what I had just said, for fear of betraying her ignorance
                  at the next question. I cannot imagine her motive for such queer conduct; but I am
                  sure she is not so happy in the possession of her prize as I am now in receiving
                  the approbation of such dear friends;" and her beaming eyes and glowing face gave
                  evidence of the truth of this assertion.
               "I do not doubt it, my child;" and Dr. Hall gently stroked the head of his
                  favorite pupil, and remarked to Mrs. Herbert:
               "I have never approved of a public examination of young ladies, and am now more
                  thoroughly convinced that it should never be allowed. My objections were
                  overruled, however, by my patrons, who contended that it was best not to run
                  counter to popular opinion in such matters."
               "I agree with you cordially," returned Mrs. Herbert, "for it is rarely the case
                  that true merit is rewarded on such occasions."
               "I think Julia will find it rather difficult to get the advantage in composition,
                  for Lula has one that cannot be surpassed by a girl of her age. It is beautiful in
                  its simplicity, and bears the unmistakable impress of originality,—a compliment I
                  cannot pay to many," said Dr. Hall, aside to Mrs. Herbert, as she was leaving the
                  room.
               
               "I declare, it is too provoking! to allow that great ignoramus to take the first
                  honor, when Dr. Hall and the whole school knows that Lula Graham is entitled to
                  it; why, Charlie, she cannot parse a sentence correctly to save her life. The
                  other day one of the boys inquired of her, 'Miss Julia, what general commanded at
                  the battle of Waterloo?'—and the reply was, 'General Washington, of course!' She
                  is the butt of the school. The girl has mind enough, too, but she has never
                  applied herself to books; and yet, by constant intercourse with good society, she
                  has picked up considerable information, and will often astonish one with brilliant
                  flashes of wit and wisdom, which are apparently genuine. There is no depth or
                  solidity about her; the little information she possesses is all superficial, and
                  the cloven-foot will show itself when least expected." It was thus Alfred Raymond
                  vented his indignation to Charlie Herbert as they left the seminary.
               
               "She deserves a reward! for it was the richest farce I ever saw acted," was his
                  friend's energetic rejoinder; "and the audience were easily humbugged, as they
                  were too far off to hear poor Birdie trilling out her low notes. I could scarcely
                  control my risibles, when the daring creature, with a haughty toss of her pretty
                  head, said: 'You mistake! it is so and so,'—and then with perfect sang froid she
                  repeated Birdie's answer."
               "Yes, and the other girls had no opportunity to expose her ignorance, as she sat
                  next to Lula, who always replied correctly, and thus Julia's answers were ready
                  made for her. But she is no match for her in composition, as you will see
                  to-night, when the reading takes place."
               "Alfred, I do not feel the slightest chagrin at Lula's defeat; her soft tones fell
                  more pleasantly on my ear; than if she had combined with her knowledge the bold
                  and self-confident manner of Julia Stanly."
               "By-the-by, Charlie!" exclaimed Alfred, as he stopped suddenly in their walk, "I
                  promised Cousin Annie to take her books home, and it had escaped my memory until
                  this moment; I will return for them, and rejoin you immediately."
               "Well, Charlie!" said Alfred, excitedly, as he came running back, "I suspect some
                  foul play again; what it is, I cannot say; but there is certainly some evil
                  afloat, as you must see when I tell you what I have seen and heard. As I entered
                  the library, which you know opens into the school-room, 'not a creature was
                  stirring, not even a mouse;' but as I was in the act of taking the books from the
                  table, I heard a light, stealthy step in the next room, which arrested my
                  attention in a moment, and soon I heard a familiar voice say: 'This is not the
                  first time I have frustrated the plans of that mealy-mouthed pauper!' The
                  unmistakable click of the doctor's desk-lock followed this speech, and then I
                  concluded to interfere and spoil some plot; when, in my haste to get a sight of
                  the conspirator, I dropped the whole armful of books I had just collected, and
                  only reached the door in time to catch a glimpse of that hateful pink dress of
                  Julia Stanly's as she sprang into the opposite room."
               "What could she have been doing? And who is the pauper? She certainly
                  did not allude to Lula Graham!" said Charlie, with indignant vehemence.
               "She will condescend to do anything, or to say anything, to accomplish her
                  designs. Unfortunately for us, too, Annie and Lula have gone out to dine, and we
                  shall not see them before the exhibition commences this evening, therefore cannot
                  make inquiries of them, or warn them of danger in time."
               "Were the compositions placed in Dr. Hall's desk?" asked Charlie, after a few
                  moments' pause.
               "I do not know, but I'm afraid they were; for I think the doctor intended to give
                  them into the hands of the committee this noon. I would return and speak to him of
                  my suspicions, but he left the house some time ago; and I fear that Themis and
                  Astra have forsaken the halls of learning."
               "I suppose, nolens volens, we must let the
                  matter rest. But I am anxious for the dnouement," said Charlie, ironically, "and hope it will pass off with
                  brilliant effect; for as neither Annie nor Lula will be seriously disturbed by her
                  heartless manœuvring, it will be quite interesting to watch the course of
                  events."
               The concert was a brilliant affair; the gifted, the beautiful, and the gay
                  thronged the lighted halls. Rich music floated through the air and blended with
                  the rapturous applause, after the reading of each essay, as the fair authoress
                  seated herself, with a sigh of relief, beside her companion, whose heart was
                  throbbing wildly in anticipation of the ordeal through which she too must
                  pass.
               
               Dr. Hall had granted to the junior class the privilege of requesting some
                  gentleman to read their compositions aloud to the audience; Lula and a few others
                  of the more timid gladly availed themselves of this indulgence. According to their
                  request, Charlie Herbert and Alfred Raymond had obtained seats near the stage, to
                  be in readiness for this ceremony.
               One by one the folded papers were taken from the table and handed to their owners,
                  and number was growing "beautifully less," when the teacher took the remaining
                  ones and carefully examined their envelopes. Immediately his face assumed a
                  perplexed expression, and he approached Lula, holding them still in his hand.
               "Oh! Dr. Hall," she exclaimed in great trepidation, "Charlie or Alfred will read
                  it for me; give it to either of them." And she sank timidly back on her seat.
               "But, my dear child, it appears that you wish to deprive us of your composition
                  altogether; you must return it immediately; we cannot afford to lost it," he said,
                  smiling.
               "Return it, Dr Hall! Indeed, I have not seen it since I handed it to you
                  yesterday!"
               "Where can it be, then? I folded them all carefully together, and handed the
                  package to the committee this afternoon; and they were all returned, as I
                  supposed, and placed on the table. I will inquire of the gentlemen—perhaps they
                  can account for its non-appearance."
               As the last notes of the musical interlude died away, he gave Julia Stanly her
                  composition and left the stage.
               Julia arose and moved to the center of the stage. Proudly beautiful did she appear
                  as she calmly met the admiring gaze of that vast assembly.
               With a graceful inclination, and an air of dignity which a tragedy queen might
                  have envied, she commenced her reading.
               It was a singular medley—emphatically a "mosaic" of fancy and "flowers of
                  rhetoric," with some wild flights of imagination strung together in sounding
                  phrase,—the grand finale being the introduction
                  of the American eagle, who, perched upon the pinnacle of liberty, was then and
                  there ready, "and waiting," to pounce upon and utterly annihilate any meddling
                  interlopers who dared to trespass on the rights of freedom.
               Casting another triumphant glance over the sea of upturned faces, she retired to
                  her seat amid the plaudits of the crowd.
               "I say, Will! don't that sound like John Stanly's fourth of July oration, down at
                  Buckhead, last summer?" said Robert Carlton, in a stage whisper, to his friend,
                  Willie Sunderland.
               "That it did!" exclaimed Willie, in a tone of ill-disguised contempt. And this
                  resemblance was so striking to many that they in vain endeavored to conceal their
                  laughter, which, fortunately, was presently drowned by the music.
               Your composition is lost, and no one can give any clew to its disappearance, my
                  dear Lula. The gentlemen tell me that it was not among those given them, and the
                  only conclusion I can arrive at is, that it was purloined by some envious or
                  malicious person from my desk. Truly this has been a bitter day to you; but do not
                  despond, for true merit and talent such as yours will sooner or later meet its
                  just reward. Cernit omnia, Deus vindex," said
                  the doctor, as he walked away.
               Last, though not the least in the estimation of the audience, came Annie
                  Sunderland.
               Beautiful as a poet's dream, in a gossamer robe of virgin purity, the loose
                  sleeves looped with fragrant white flowers, and exposing arms which were so
                  exquisitely moulded that the fastidious
                  taste of a Canova could wish for no better models. She wore no ornament except
                  circlet of pearls, that rested lightly on her neck, which rivaled them in purity,
                  and would have shamed the boasted alabaster whiteness of Lady Hester
                  Stanhope's.
               There was modesty, simplicity, and dignity in her mien, united with rare
                  loveliness; and the sweet expression beaming from her soft, hazel eyes reminded
                  one of Raphael's faultless Madonnas. At first the words came soft and low from her
                  trembling lips, sounding like music in the distance; but gradually her confidence
                  revived as her heart became interested in her theme; and then no artful Parisian
                     rouge could vie with bright rosy hue which
                  mantled her cheek.
               It was her valedictory, and from the abundance of her heart her mouth spake. In
                  touching and beautiful language she alluded to the happy band now about to be
                  severed, who had traversed the paths of knowledge, exercising loving kindness and
                  good will toward each other, and directed by the counsel and wisdom of one who
                  smoothed the rugged way, and gently led them through the intricate paths.
               "How shall I thank you," she continued, "my venerable friend and beloved
                  instructor, for your paternal care; for your lessons of wisdom and truth; for your
                  kind and gentle forbearance toward the willful and erring ones, whom the dictates
                  of your noble heart would have made wise and good!
               "You have unlocked for us the vast store-house of knowledge, and taught us that
                  'wisdom's ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.' May we hope
                  that your counsel has sunk deep into the hearts of those whom you have so wisely
                  tutored; and when in pursuit of temporal blessings, we may not forget your
                  repeated charge to lay up 'treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth
                  corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal.' If prayers from grateful, loving
                  hearts can avail, heaven's riches blessings must ever rest on you and yours!"
               The address was such as a refined and noble-minded girl would have written—the
                  outpouring of her pure and guileless heart, embellished with glowing imagery and
                  striking thought.
               When she had concluded, many an eye, unused to weeping, was seen to glisten with a
                  tear; but no applause or compliment gratified her so much as the warm pressure of
                  the hand and fervent "Heaven bless and protect you, my dear, good Annie!" from her
                  venerable preceptor.
               The young ladies had performed alternately on the piano and harp; but policy on
                  the part of Signor Robaldi, the musical instructor, had reserved Lula for the
                  last. United to her superior skill in instrumental music, she possessed a voice of
                  rare sweetness and power; and it had been a pet wish with the signor up to the
                  last moment, that he could prevail upon her to sing with him one of those splendid
                  duets from the Italian opera, which display so finely that compass and flexibility
                  of voice which she possessed in an eminent degree, united to great melody and
                  pathos. But she firmly refused to comply with this request, and with a look of
                  disappointment upon his face, he placed one of the brilliant sonatas of Mozart
                  before her.
               The complimentary manner in which it was received by the audience determined him
                  to make another effort to exhibit her voice.
               Several months previous, the signor had arranged and set to music in masterly
                  style some lines from Moore's poems, intending to dedicate them to Annie, and
                  expected soon to surprise her with a printed copy of the same.
               This secret had been imparted to Lula, and she was quite familiar with the music; so he quickly
                  decided, as a last resort, that this piece she should sing, and said:
               "Will you not sing that simple aria in
                  compliment to Miss Sunderland, who will soon leave us to return no more?"
               The wily Italian had touched the right chord, as he well knew; for Annie, although
                  a year or two Lula's senior, was her dearest and best friend, and her name was the
                  magic spell which would serve to inspire the young performer with confidence.
               With a gratified smile he acknowledged Lula's acquiescence—arranged the manuscript
                  on the rack, and, approaching Annie, he bowed with native grace, and said:
               "Miss Sunderland, will you listen to our farewell song?"
               A light prelude floated through the apartment; then joining the signor's full,
                  rich tenor, Lula commenced in a voice, soft and low, to warble forth notes of
                  exquisite sweetness. Louder, still louder grew the strain, until every heart
                  seemed electrified with the delicious harmony; then melting again into murmurs as
                  gentle and low as the tones of an Eolian harp, it was borne by the night-breeze
                  slowly away.
               No heartless plaudits now! but one loud enthusiastic outburst of feeling greeted
                  her ears, and "Encore!" "Encore!" rang from every quarter of the hall.
               Not deeming this compliment personal, or occasioned by any merit of her own, but
                  supposing that her listeners concurred in the sentiments of the song, and
                  rejoicing that the peerless Annie was thus appreciated, she again sang, in
                  faultless strains: 
                     
                        Peace be around thee, wherever thou rovest!
                        May life be for thee one summer's day;
                        And all that thou wishest, and all that thou lovest,
                        Come smiling around thy sunny way!
                        If sorrow e'er this calm should break,
                        May even thy tears pass off so lightly;
                        Like spring-showers, they'll only make
                        The smiles that follow shine more brightly
                     
                     
                        May Time, who sheds his blight o'er all,
                        And daily dooms some joy to death,
                        O'er thee let years so gently fall,
                        They shall not crush one flower beneath!
                        As half in shade, and half in sun.
                        This world along its path advances,
                        May that side the sun's upon
                        Be all that e'er shall meet thy glances!
                     
                  
               
               A few days after the concert, Robert Carlton called one morning at Mrs. Stanly's
                  to deliver a note from his mother. As an answer was required, he was requested to
                  remain until one could be written, and Mrs. Stanly said:
               "Julia is from home, so in lieu of better company, I will offer you an agreeable
                  book."
               Calling a servant, she ordered her to bring a couple of new books from the table
                  in Miss Julia's room—then turning to Robert, she added: "I think you will find
                  some handsome plates in those volumes; they were sent to my daughter yesterday, by
                  a friend;" and, satisfied that she had provided for the amusement of her youthful
                  guest, Mrs. Stanly proceeded to write her note.
               In a moment or two the servant returned, and as Robert received the books, he
                  could not resist smiling as he read their titles,—"Davies' Algebra" and "Miss
                  Leslie's Complete Cookery."
               "Well," thought he, "I shall have a charming time of it, and no
                     mistake! for I never see a cookery book without its making
                  me as hungry as a wolf—the pangs will become insupportable if I am forced to read
                  one for twenty minutes or a half hour; and for this scientific treatise—the old Algebra—I shall certainly fall asleep
                  over that, as I have done hundreds of times before,"
               As he said this, however, he mechanically opened the latter volume, and apparently
                  the effect was somewhat different from the somnolent one he had anticipated; for
                  as his eyes fell carelessly on the open page, they suddenly became riveted on a
                  neatly folded paper, superscribed "Lula Graham's composition," in pretty, ladylike
                  characters.
               Robert uttered an exclamation of astonishment which caused Mrs. Stanly to glance
                  toward him; but as he appeared to be so much interested in his book, she continued
                  writing without making any remark.
               "I will take it upon myself to relieve you of this document, fair lady!" he said,
                  mentally; and suiting the action to the words, he quietly slipped the paper into
                  his pocket.
               "Well, Master Robert, I hope you have been amused with the books?" said Mrs.
                  Stanly, as she folded her note.
               "I have indeed, madam," he answered, with a queer smile, "but not, I think, in the
                  way you imagine. The servant failed to bring the books you mentioned—yet I do not
                  regret it—and was quite pleased to see the familiar face of the old Algebra again.
                  Be kind enough to say to Miss Julia, for me, that if she has difficulty in solving
                  any of its mysteries, I think I can furnish a clew; and will be happy to render
                  any assistance." With a bow of profound respect, the young gentleman left the
                  house.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               
                  
                     
                        Her form was faultless, and her mind,
                        Untainted yet by art,
                        Was noble, just, humane, and kind:
                        And virtue warmed her heart.
                        But, ah! the cruel spoiler came.
                     
                  
               
               ON a beautiful eminence which commanded a view of the graceful wavering chain of
                  the Blue Ridge, stood a fine old baronial-like mansion, whose immense size and
                  solid grandeur indicated the princely wealth of its owner. From its noble portico
                  the view was charmingly diversified by hills and valleys, highly cultivated
                  fields, and groups of forest trees, beneath whose mantling shade the white cabins
                  of the negroes rested in tranquill beauty. Cattle grazing upon fertile hills, and
                  a thousand beauties of pastoral nature as far as the eye could reach, called forth
                  the wonder and admiration of every beholder.
               It was evening, about the close of summer, when the first chill winds of autumn
                  had begun to clothe the rich verdure in her somber hues, that the mansion was
                  brilliantly illuminated, and presented a scene of gorgeous magnificence. Along the
                  winding avenue innumerable vehicles were seen approaching—from the great coach of
                  the "F.F.V." to the airy phaeton of the parvenu.
                  All were assembling to celebrate the marriage of Kate Sunderland, the beautiful
                  heiress of Prospect Hill.
               William Sunderland, the father of Kate, was the son of one of those noble old
                  cavaliers whose life and fortune were devoted to the cause of liberty.
               Oftentimes had Kate, with her little brother and sister, sat at their father's feet and listened to his
                  thrilling accounts of the noble Washington and his heroic band of suffering,
                  hungry soldiers, who, during their weary march, sought shelter on the plantation.
                  And while the poor, tired, ragged creatures rested in comfort, his mother, with
                  the maidens of the household, manufactured from blankets and every available
                  material clothes to protect them from the chilling blasts of winter.
               Father, mother, brother, and sister had all passed away, and Kate, the last of the
                  family, alone remained. From childhood she had been left to the care of Mr.
                  Preston, a kind and indulgent guardian, who, by his judicious management, had
                  increased the estate to an immense value.
               When the heiress made her debut in society, she was greeted with great eclat by
                  the good and noble for her intrinsic worth, as well as for her golden charms by
                  those ignoble wretches—fortune-hunters—who infest society under the garb of
                  honorable men. Among the worshiping throng came one of commanding appearance. His
                  manly beauty, his intelligence and rare colloquial powers, were all calculated to
                  win the guileless heart and passionate love of an unsophisticated girl.
               In eloquent tones he plead his suit, and, regardless of the warning voice of
                  guardian friend, she consented to become the bride of George Raymond. To
                  remonstrate with her seemed useless—for love had suddenly transformed the gentle,
                  affectionate girl into an independent, self-willed woman. She would reply, in the
                  language of song: 
                     
                        Oh! what was love made for, if 'tis not the same
                        Through joy and through torrents, through glory and shame?
                        I know not, I ask not, if guilt's in that heart,—
                        I but know that I love thee, whatever thou art.
                     
                  
               
               A short time previous to the introduction of Kate Sunderland into society, George
                  Raymond made his advent as a teacher in one of the public schools of Virginia. His
                  intelligence and gentlemanly bearing were considered a sufficient passport to the
                  first circles in that land of equal rights, where worth and not money constituted
                  the real aristocracy. In a little while he became a law student of Judge Thompson,
                  and very soon it was announced publicly that Thompson and Raymond had formed a
                  copartnership for the practice of law.
               An intricate case presented itself, and Raymond's maiden speech on that occasion
                  was delivered with so much force and power that the acclamations of the assembled
                  multitude rose to the highest pitch. His oratory entranced and aroused the
                  audience, while it carried conviction to every heart. Even the reporters sat idly
                  at their desks, and, with lips apart and eyes riveted on the speaker, listened to
                  the words of burning eloquence which fell from his mouth. The passions and
                  understanding of the jury were so perfectly controlled by this splendid and
                  masterly effort, that without leaving their seats a verdict was rendered in favor
                  of Raymond's client. It was conceded by all, that since the days of Patrick Henry
                  no orator had ever so enraptured and swayed the hearts of an assembly.
               Like that great man, there had been no gradual climbing up the ladder of fame,
                  but, bold and self-confident, he had instinctively mounted the giddy height and
                  assumed a position which none had a right to dispute. Congratulations poured in
                  from every quarter. The dignified judge who had presided came up, after the
                  adjournment of court, and said, as he cordially grasped his hand:
               "I see, young man, that you have been brought up at the feet of Gamaliel, and
                  partaken of the fruits of knowledge. See to it that it be for good, and not evil;
                  but I fear so much learning will make thee mad."
               While this triumph formed the chief topic of conversation, and Raymond was being
                  lionized by the elite of the city, Kate
                  Sunderland made her debut, and was unanimously proclaimed the belle of the season.
                  Beautiful, amiable, and accomplished, she received the homage paid her as a child
                  whose heart knew no guile would the kindness and attention of companions. Artless
                  and sincere herself, she never doubted the veracity of others; and when suitors on
                  bended knees sued for her heart and hand, and vowed that a refusal would doom them
                  to a life of eternal misery, she would often seek the solitude of her chamber, and
                  weep for the woes she bad unconsciously caused.
               Alas, poor Kate! Had you been a few years older, experience would have taught you
                  that some men, as well as women, 
                     
                        Can't do otherwise than lie, but do it
                        So well, the very truth seems falsehood to it.
                     
                   Kate Sunderland was rather above the medium height, with dark auburn hair,
                  bright hazel eyes, and a clear transparent complexion, which varied with every
                  emotion of her heart. Her features were of the Grecian type, and when in repose
                  indicated a regal hauteur; but when she spoke, the saucy dimples would play at
                  hide and seek upon the soft rounded cheeks, and dispel any such delusion.
               It was, indeed, a matter of little surprise that a man who could fascinate and
                  influence the judgement of "potent, grave, and reverend seigniors," should
                  captivate and win the love of a maiden who had scarcely numbered her eighteenth
                  birthday, or that Kate should have returned to her home the affianced bride of
                  George Raymond, although she had no knowledge of his antecedents previous to his
                  arrival in Virginia.
               The faithful old guardian, with a trembling hand and tearful eyes, fearing to
                  forfeit her love by a stern refusal, gives the beautiful child of his adoption to
                  the noble-looking ing stranger, and vainly strives to stifle the thought that a
                  father's or a mother's love would possibly have saved her from the cruel fate
                  which he feared awaited her.
               All within the festive hall appeared filled with joy and gladness, save the
                  affectionate old guardian; and the fair bride, with the air of an empress, bows
                  her lovely head, with its rich coronal of orange flowers, and willingly resigns
                  her heart and hand, with all her worldly possessions, in childlike confidence and
                  trusting love to her heart's idol.
               The autumn winds howl and moan, and the guardian's anxious heart fancies they sing
                  her requiem as she enters the portals of a living tomb. The banquet-hall was soon
                  deserted, and the old man was alone; still the requiem sounded strangely sad, and
                  fell like molten lead upon his heavy heart.
               For awhile Kate appeared the personification of happiness, and Mr. Preston hoped
                  that his fears had been groundless, as he witnessed the mutual love and devotion
                  of the wedded pair. By-and-by his watchful eye discovered that the rose on her
                  cheeks was gradually assuming the lily's hue, and her cheerful ringing laugh was
                  seldom heard to echo through the lofty halls, as George Raymond would absent
                  himself for weeks and months from Prospect Hill.
               Occasionally a floating rumor would reach his ear that Raymond, who was strongly
                  addicted to gaming, had returned to his former haunts and habits.
               As straws show which way the wind blows, so do trifles mark the course of events.
                  A simple incident, which occurred about twelve months after the marriage, will
                  indicate the state of feeling among the negroes on the plantation.
               Old Jesse, a faithful but superannuated servant of the family, occupied
                  comfortable quarters convenient to the
                  mansion, where his wants were liberally supplied by the young mistress. Scarcely a
                  day passed that she did not personally inquire of his welfare, and bring with her
                  some token of her appreciation of his faithful services and devotion to the
                  family. About his feet were usually congregated the progeny of the second and
                  third generation, who roasted potatoes, and drank buttermilk from a large pewter
                  basin on the broad hearth. It was a snatch-and-grab game; sometimes one and then
                  another getting the advantage, and the victor was furiously assailed with tin cups
                  and spoons, and a general row would ensue, which brought into requisition
                  granddaddy's crutch. A fierce rap upon the heads of some of the nearest would
                  cause the little rogues to scamper in every direction. Just after a disturbance of
                  this nature had been settled, the old daddy seated himself in his high-back chair,
                  and puffed vigorously an old corn-cob pipe, when a succession of yells were heard
                  outside of the door, which brought the old man to his feet, and in bounced a
                  portly dame, with vengeance flashing from her eyes. She gave a kick, as she
                  entered the door, to a harmless little squatter on the sill, and sent him whirling
                  out of the door.
               "Look here, nigger, what's to pay out there? what's that fuss about? I'll let you
                  know I'm master here, and nobody rules this house but me," said old Jesse with an
                  air of offended dignity.
               "'Nuff to pay, I can tell you, daddy—I'm just in the notion to fight somebody, I
                  don't care who; 'cause dat white man's come home mad as a March hare, and 'cause
                  little Jim didn't open the gate fast enough for him he took the butt of his whip
                  and fetched him a whack 'cross de face, and dun most put out Jim's eye. And
                  there's poor Miss Kate been crying the last week for him to come home, too. It's
                  too bad—but, poor child, she's got 'nuff to cry 'bout, the Lord knows, for she's
                  done sacrificed herself and her niggers gers to that white man's hansum face and
                  glib tongue. Peter says dat white man's done nothing but play cards and cuff him
                  'bout since they's been gone, and 'fore he'll go another sich jaunt with dat man,
                  he's gwine to ax Miss Kate to send him 'long with some speculator to the
                  Massissippa," was the breathless response.
               "Well, Rachael, I'm 'fraid thar's whar we're all gwine; and I've been thinking so
                  ever since I he'rd Mr. Raymond tell Miss Kate that I was a lazy, trifling, good
                  for nuthin old rascal, and dat she's done made a fool of me. Soon's ever I he'rd
                  he sprung from Yankee land, I know'd he had no marcy on poor nigger. Our white
                  folks are r'al gentlemen and ladies, and is satisfied with nigger's work, cause it
                  sure if 'tis slow, but dem thar Yankees always kills the goose to get the golden
                  egg. If ever they git hold of a nigger, they go sell him right straight and put
                  the money in their pockets, cause they's 'fraid nigger 'II git sick and die, and
                  den they lose him. Well, well, the Lord have marcy upon us, and Miss Kate too, for
                  she's a r'al born lady; but as for dat white man, de devil's got a bill of sale
                  for him long ago, and de sooner he take him home de better for her, and us too. It
                  does seem 'tis nuff to make de old masters rise out of their graves to see the
                  awful doings on this plantation."
               Alas! it was all too true. For after a lapse of time, by a single throw of the
                  treacherous dice, the noble ancestral mansion of the Sunderlands passed into a
                  stranger's hand.
               In a lovely cottage which overlooked the banks of the Chattahoochee we find the
                  residence of Henry Sunderland, who was a member of another branch of the family.
                  Mr and Mrs. Sunderland were well known throughout this section of country for
                  their benevolence and kindness to the sick and afflicted—the widow and orphan.
                  Many a poor wounded spirit has been
                  cheered by their Christian sympathy and generous deeds, and grateful hearts are
                  daily beseeching Heaven for blessings upon the heads of that noble man and his
                  good wife.
               At the time of which I write, a merry, happy group were gathered around the
                  pleasant fireside, which consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Sunderland, several noisy,
                  frolicsome boys, together with a fair girl who had scarcely numbered a dozen
                  summers. Her hazel eyes and dark-brown hair, so unlike others of the party,
                  plainly indicated that she had not always been a member of the household. She was
                  a Sunderland, however, and, it was often remarked, bore a striking likeness to her
                  cousin Kate. True, she was an orphan; yet her merry laugh and cheerful countenance
                  were unmistakable evidences of contentment and happiness in that, her adopted
                  home.
               A loud peal from the door-bell announced a visitor, and brought the conversation
                  to a close. Very soon a singular apparition presented itself.
               A tall, strange-looking woman of commanding appearance, with dark flashing eyes
                  and long waving hair, which fell like a shining veil around her fine form, which
                  was covered, but not concealed, by a coarse calico gown much too short to hide her
                  dainty ankles, and rough shoes which incased her small feet. A dark shadow beneath
                  the long lashes gave to her eyes a peculiar expression, reminding one of a
                  frightened deer, as she stood in the door-way and regarded the party with much
                  interest. Suddenly her pale cheeks flushed, and a smile like the moon's soft ray
                  lighted her face, then quickly approaching the young girl, she remarked, in a soft
                  sweet voice:
               "You are my cousin, Miss Sunderland, I suppose; I am Kate Sunderland, of Prospect!
                  Hill, Virginia. As I was passing through this State, I have taken the liberty of
                  calling on my relatives, hoping that I might induce them to honor me in return
                  with their presence at the old family mansion."
               Then with the grace and dignity of a queen she gave to each one a regal bend of
                  the head, and seated herself, amid the consternation of each one present.
               Alas! it could not be doubted: Kate Sunderland, the once proud and beautiful
                  heiress, was a deserted wife a harmless but hopeless maniac. A stranger in a
                  strange land, without money or friends, until Providence directed her to the
                  hospitable roof and generous care of her kinsman, Henry Sunderland.
               Mr. Mason, the gentleman who accompanied her, stated, that while seeking a
                  settlement for himself he had found her wandering along amid the forest, in a
                  distant part of the State of Alabama. She informed him that her object was to find
                  a conveyance to take her back to Virginia. She gave her name as Miss Kate
                  Sunderland, and proved her right to it by showing an elegant locket, which she
                  wore suspended from her neck, with that name engraven upon it.
               The unfortunate condition of the poor creature could not be mistaken, and fearing
                  to leave her alone in the wilderness, he followed her to a cabin, where he was
                  told by its inmates that several months previous she had been left by a gentleman,
                  whom they had reason to think was named Raymond. Although he had promised to
                  return for her in a few weeks, he had never since been heard from. Also, that
                  while this person remained, her fear of him was so great that she would often
                  crouch behind the door, in some hiding-place, and there remain until she supposed
                  he had left the house.
               Mr. Mason was induced, by her delicate, ladylike appearance, to believe her story.
                  And being well acquainted with the character of Mr. Henry Sunderland, whom he knew
                  to be a Virginian by birth, he had taken the liberty of introducing her to his
                  notice.
               
               It was a labor of love for these Christian relatives to array in suitable attire
                  the faded form of their unfortunate cousin, and to contribute in every way to her
                  comfort and pleasure.
               When in company with ladies, she would converse with ease and fluency, and would
                  often astonish the listeners by her thorough knowledge of ancient and modern
                  literature; but on the approach of a gentleman she would immediately seek some
                  obscure corner, and there remain until relieved of his presence.
               It was presumed that the conduct of her husband toward her had been of such a
                  nature that she dreaded his return; and from the startled glance she gave, feared
                  that every footstep might prove to be that of the cruel man whose name she now
                  refused to bear.
               When allowed, she would amuse herself by the hour in decorating the person of her
                  cousin Annie, with every available trinket and piece of incongruous finery,
                  telling her at the same time that she did not dress as became a Sunderland: "But
                  when I return to Virginia I will supply you with a suitable quantity of silks,
                  satins, and velvets; and I shall take great pleasure in replenishing your jewel
                  boxes, for allow me to say, my dear little cousin, that in this particular you are
                  sadly deficient."
               If left alone, she would suffer from great depression of spirits, and often, in
                  soft, plaintive tones, would sing that beautiful song from Lalla Rookh: 
                     
                        Oh! ever thus, from childhood's hour,
                        I've seen my fondest hopes decay;
                        I never loved a tree of flower
                        But 'twas the first to fade away.
                        I never nurs'd a dear gazelle,
                        To glad me wit its soft black eye,
                        But when it came to know me well,
                        And love me, it was sure to die!
                        Now, too—the joy most like divine
                        Of all I ever dreamt or knew,
                        To see thee, hear thee, call thee mine,—
                        Oh, misery! must I lose that too?
                     
                  
               
               One day Annie said to her: "Cousin Kate, you sing so sweetly I suspect you are
                  fine musician; will you not play some for us?"
               "Oh yes! I will play if you wish me. At one time I was called the finest amateur
                  performed in Virginia; but that was long ago, when my heart was light and gay.
                  Since then a change has come 'o'er the spirit of my dream.'"
               She seated herself at the piano with grace, and with skill her fingers glided over
                  the keys, from which sprang sounds of delicious melody. Gradually the music
                  changed—then a voice, like the tender wail of a broken heart, sent forth its sad
                  notes of anguish. Both music and words seemed the work of inspiration. Tears burst
                  from Annie's eyes as she listened to the maniac's impromptu lay: 
                     
                        Long ago she stood in her youthful pride,
                        That careworn wife, then a beauteous bride;
                        And her downy cheek wore the bright spring bloom,
                        As she fondly clung to her noble groom,
                        Long ago, long ago!
                     
                     
                        But the rose on her cheek has wither'd now;
                        Sorrow and care have furrowed her brow;
                        And the joyous heart of that blushing bride
                        Will never more throb with its wonted pride,
                        Never more, never more!
                     
                     
                        The accents of love that fell on her ear
                        Will be heard no more from the lips so dear,
                        Of the false one, who vow'd, in gallant pride,
                        Forever to love and cherish his bride,
                        Long ago, long ago!
                     
                     
                     
                        And oft, when her heart was swelling with pain
                        At his cruel words and his rude disdain,
                        She'd turn and wipe away the bitter tears,
                        And sigh for the love of happier years,
                        Long ago, long ago!
                     
                     
                        Silent and sad sits the poor lone one now,
                        With her aching heart and throbbing brow;
                        For despair, like a pall, hangs o'er the life
                        Of that loving but now forsaken wife,
                        All alone, all alone!
                     
                     
                        'Tis sad, indeed, to watch the parting breath
                        Of lov'd ones stricken by the hand of death;
                        But shed no tear for them, their sorrows o'er,
                        Hope whispers you will meet to part no more,
                        No more, no more!
                     
                     
                        Weep for the broken heart—true love slighted;
                        Its fond hopes crushed, its prospects blighted;
                        And curse the cruel wretch whose fiendish art
                        Has won, then broke, a gentle woman's heart,
                        Long ago, long ago!
                     
                  
               
               When Raymond first discovered that the mind of his wife was being affected by the
                  rapid transition from wealth to penury and want, together with his constant ill
                  treatment and neglect, he determined to take from her their only child, which was
                  her sole comfort in life. By so doing he hastened the terrible malady. Her mind
                  soon became a complete wreck; and in that roughly-clad woman with disordered
                  intellect there was little to remind one of Kate Sunderland, the dashing belle and
                  wealthy heiress.
               Such is the destiny of woman. Give her love, and she craves no greater blessing;
                  then let poverty and affliction come, and with self-denial and heroism that would
                  immortalize one of the sterner sex, she cheerfully battles with the ills of life,
                  and with love as her guiding star, will come off conqueror at last. Refuse her
                  this boon, and, like a flower which is denied the sunshine and dews of heaven, she
                  will fade, droop, and die.
               After remaining some while with her friends in Georgia, her health began to
                  decline rapidly, and she pined for the mountain air of her childhood's home, and
                  the familiar face of the kind guardian of her youth. Poor deluded creature! She
                  firmly believed that on her return to Virginia she would be reinstated in the
                  ancestral home, with all of its wealth and grandeur, and, under the care of her
                  faithful domestics and the paternal smile of dear Mr. Preston, she would regain
                  all the strength and vigor of her youth.
               Mr. Sunderland had ascertained, by writing to Virginia, that Mr. Preston still
                  lived, and resided on a small farm adjoining her old home; and with him was Alfred
                  Raymond, the son of his former ward, Kate Sunderland.
               Rather than provide for the child himself, or trust to the charity of strangers,
                  as he did in regard to his unfortunate wife, George Raymond had forced upon the
                  old man the care and support of his son, without a word of apology for so doing;
                  and by changing his own locality soon afterward, he cut off all means of
                  communication between Mrs. Preston and his wife.
               Mr. Sunderland provided a liberal purse and a suitable escort, and sent her to the
                  care of her guardian, who welcomed her with tearful eyes and outstretched arms to
                  his humble home.
               Hope had seated itself at her heart, whispering a prospect of future happiness,
                  and pointing to the Old Dominion and
                  its lovely mountains as a resting-place for the poor weary soul! But, alas, alas!
                  as she drew near the long-sought Mecca, it leaves the wounded heart to break and
                  die!
               Amid her native haunts they laid her down to rest; and above that lonely grave
                  rises, in majestic grandeur, a lofty peak of the Blue Ridge, the only monument to
                  mark the resting-place of Kate Sunderland, the gambler's wife! 
                     
                        There, broken heart—
                        Poor broken heart, farewell!
                        The pang is o'er—
                        The parting pang is o'er,
                        Thou now wilt bleed no more;
                        Poor broken heart, farewell!
                        No rest for thee but dying,
                        Like waves whose strife is past,
                        On death's cold shore thus early lying
                        Thou sleep'st in peace at last—
                        Poor broken heart—poor broken heart, farewell!
                     
                  
               
               Mr. Preston did not long survive the untimely death of his adopted daughter, and
                  by his last will Kate's son, Alfred Raymond, became the possessor of his little
                  property, and Mr. Henry Sunderland was appointed his guardian. So, by the singular
                  and wise interposition of Providence, Alfred Raymond became domiciled under the
                  hospitable roof where, a short time before, his unfortunate mother had been kindly
                  sheltered and affectionately tended.
               Among the numerous club-rooms or gambling saloons of Paris, there is one
                  conspicuous for its unique and splendid beauty. Its circular walls are lined with
                  mirrors, and richly-carved Corinthian pillars of spotless white support the
                  exquisitely frescoed ceiling. So deceptive was the reflection and re-flection,
                  that it seemed a hall of interminable able length, carpeted with glowing crimson,
                  and studded with elegant columns and courtly figures.
               It was a scene of oriental magnificence, which was well calculated to fascinate
                  the eye and intoxicate the senses of a novice; but the parties around the tables
                  were utterly unconscious of their surroundings, and appeared like so many
                  automatons placed there to complete the splendid picture. Silently and quietly
                  they played, betraying no triumph or chagrin; but with studied politeness
                  transferred from one to another papers which often enriched the beggar and
                  beggared the rich.
               Conspicuous among one of the groups was a noble-looking personage, of commanding
                  and elegant manners, who for some weeks past had been the observed of all
                  observers. He played high, and invariably won! and Monsieur Raymond was considered
                  the most fortunate as well as among the wealthiest men in Paris.
               Miraculous stories were told of his immense estates, both in the United States and
                  South America, which stories were partly confirmed by his extravagant and princely
                  style of living. He was admired by the ladies and envied by the gentlemen, and
                  many of the latter would gladly have assisted, by fair means or foul, to rid Paris
                  of such an unpleasant guest.
               Previous to Raymond's introduction into society, Count Moreau had been looked upon
                  as the Adonis of Paris, and his skill in cards was considered unequaled. Great
                  indeed was the count's mortification to find himself despoiled of his laurels by
                  an untitled American, who had sprung up like a mushroom amid the first Parisian
                  circles. For several nights past he had lost large sums of money, and Raymond was
                  the winner. Moreau became reckless, and
                  taked higher—still the result was the same: he arose from the table and drank
                  freely of wine, then returned and bantered Raymond for another game. It was
                  accepted. The count lost all—and then became desperate and insulting—he accused
                  his partner of fraud. A quarrel ensued, friends interfered, and the count was led
                  from the room. The next morning he refused to pay the debt, and reiterated his
                  belief that Raymond had acted a fraudulent part. A challenge was sent and promptly
                  accepted. They met in mortal combat, and Raymond fell mortally wounded while Count
                  Moreau escaped unhurt.
               A few days afterward, while tortured with remorse, and writhing in the agonies of
                  death, several suspicious-looking persons entered the splendid apartment, charged
                  with legal power to arrest George Raymond for forgery on various houses in New
                  York, London, and Paris. He acknowledged himself guilty of the crimes imputed to
                  him; but death, that grim-visaged monster, had encircled him with its merciless
                  arms, to convey him beyond the reach of an earthly tribunal, where the awful
                  sentence of an avenging God awaited him.
               "Kate! poor murdered Kate, thy avengers have come! Retribution is at hand, and I
                  must meet and abide the dreadful sentence of a just and angry God," were the last
                  words of George Raymond, the gambler.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               
                  
                     
                        Thou that didst bow the billow's pride,
                        Thy mandates to fulfill,
                        Speak, speak to passion's raging tide,
                        Speak, and say—Peace! be still!
                     
                  
               
               ALICE CARLTON had been absent about two years at a Northern boarding-school, when,
                  one day in early spring, her father and mother were seated in their pleasant
                  parlor speaking of their hopes and fears regarding her.
               "I must acknowledge, I see my error now, in allowing her to go from our care,
                  particularly to a city like New York, where her young heart must be more or less
                  exposed to the pernicious influences of their false state of society. I am not at
                  all satisfied with her letters; they indicate little or no improvement, while
                  Annie Sunderland and Lula Graham have made rapid progress in the acquirement of
                  knowledge. I have never listened to a more creditable examination than that of Dr.
                  Hall's scholars—the young ladies certainly surpassed my expectations. Annie's
                  valedictory would reflect honor on a much older writer, while Lula's charming
                  music completely enraptured the audience—her birdlike notes are haunting me still.
                  What is the difference in the ages of the three girls?" asked Mr. Carleton, as he
                  puffed the smoke from his cigar, and watched its graceful wreaths as they floated
                  through the open window.
               "Alice is seventeen, a few months younger than Annie; and Lula, I think, cannot be
                  more than fifteen. I doubt whether Alice has made the same improvement, for her
                  letters are too often filled with accounts of the opera, theater ater, and the absorbing topic of dress, for her
                  mind to be much occupied with books: and worse than all," continued Mrs. Carlton
                  in a grave tone, "she writes to Julia Stanly that once a week Madame L. allows
                  them to have receptions, when such charming beaus are admitted; then follows the
                  most exalted descriptions of their perfections—this one has a delightful foreign
                  air; that one wears such an exquisite mustache; another is so distingu, etc. etc. I regret exceedingly that we did
                  not take Mrs. Herbert's advice, and have her educated at home."
               "It is too late to remedy that matter now—but we must hasten to recall her, for
                  her expenses are enormous, and I cannot sanction such reckless extravagance in a
                  girl of her age. If I had been apprised of those receptions and their mustached
                  heroes before, I would have summoned her at a much earlier day," said Mr. Carlton,
                  as he impatiently threw the stump of his cigar from the window.
               "I am convinced, now, that Mrs. Herbert's views were correct,—that children can be
                  indulged to excess, and that a girl should not be sent from home at the time she
                  needs most the counsel and guidance of a mother. How much I wish that I had
                  possessed the firmness to put this principle into practice; so many troubles and
                  anxieties would have been spared me!" and Mrs. Carlton bowed her head upon the
                  table in gloomy thought.
               This woman, though gentle and amiable in the extreme, unfortunately did not
                  possess the counterbalancing traits of firmness and decision of character, and was
                  so yielding in her disposition that a little child might sway her will at
                  pleasure. She was a devoted mother, and her great fault was not in "loving wisely,
                  but too well;" and this excessive amiability was likely to embitter her life,
                  together with the lives of her children.
               Poets and novelists may rave of angels in human form,—whose brows are never
                  ruffled by a frown, whose serene and heavenly minds are never disturbed by angry
                  passions, but in perpetual sunshine they travel on through flowery paths of
                  ease,—such creatures are charming heroines for romances; but, like Dora
                  Copperfield, they should be transplanted to heaven, their abiding-place, before
                  they are called upon to rear immortal souls for eternity. Common sense, and
                  "common humanity," require a noble, hing-minded woman, who has wisdom, discretion,
                  and strength to guide and direct her children in the paths of virtue and
                  uprightness—who will, not in anger, but in love, "chasten her child while there is
                  hope, and let not her soul spare for his crying." She will rear her children to be
                  bright and shining ornaments of society, and they will crown her gray hairs with
                  blessings and honors—in their hearts will her memory be engraved; for it was her
                  loving hand that guided them safely through trial and temptation; and she was the
                  instrument which made them what they assuredly will be—noble men and women;
                  glorious and enviable monuments to the memory and worth of their mother.
               In the midst of Mrs. Carlton's reverie, when the past, with its errors and
                  shortcomings, stood arrayed before her in its saddest hues, and good sense was
                  prompting her to redeem these faults, and by them, to receive a lesson for the
                  future a lout scream, and the voice of a child in angry contention outside the
                  door, was heard to say:
               "I won't! I won't! and if you don't let me alone, I'll cry just as
                  loud as I can, and then mamma will make you stop teasing me."
               "Please let me have it, Mars' Johnny! I'm 'fraid you'll break it," said an
                  expostulating voice.
               "Oh! oh! oh!" screamed Johnny with such piercing shrillness that it brought his
                  mother to her feet.
               A child about five or six years old rushed into the room with his face distorted
                  by passion; in his hand was a small glass dish, which he carelessly handled, while
                  a servant-girl girl who followed was
                  vainly urging him to surrender it to her care.
               "What in the world is the matter with the child? Why can't you let him be quiet,
                  Nelly?" exclaimed Mrs. Carlton.
               "He's got one 'dem cutglass dishes, ma'am, and he's gwine to break it sure, if I
                  lets him keep it."
               "Well, let him keep it, then, if nothing else will satisfy him; for really it
                  seems there is no peace in the house for the child." His mother, happy to stop the
                  noise at any risk, seated herself with a sigh of relief.
               Johnny left the room, saying, exultingly:
               "Oh, yes, Miss Nelly! I told you so. I know how to fix
                  you." He began dancing about in great glee, when down came the dish with a
                  terrible crash upon the hall floor, followed by a howl from the juvenile despot
                  that was perfectly appalling.
               His mother ran out in great alarm, and tried in vain to pacify him; but Johnny
                  refused to be comforted.
               "Why, in the name of all that's wonderful, don't you quiet that child out there?"
                  called his father, from the parlor. "If he has broken the glass, give him another
                  and send him out of the house, for this state of affairs is intolerable."
               As a last resort, another dish was handed him, which he transported in triumph to
                  his playground.
               "Yes!" muttered Nelly, as she followed him. "If you was my child, I'd
                  give you 'bout forty 'stead of letting you have dem preserve stands
                  to break up like so many clods of dirt, you little injun!"
               "Mr. Carlton, we ought really to adopt some measures to conquer that child's
                  rebellious spirit; he is growing to be unbearable. I think we did wrong in
                  allowing him to have another dish after he had broken one," said Mrs. Carlton, as
                  she returned to the parlor.
               "Perhaps so; but what is that trifle in comparison to the peace and quietude of a
                  household?" asked her husband.
               "It is true, the value of the glass is not much, but such indulgence may seriously
                  injure the child's character," replied the gentle woman, as she seated herself;
                  and continuing this strain of thought, endeavored to devise some means of bringing
                  about a reform in the government of her family.
               Mr. Carlton was a politician—one whose heart and soul was in his calling; and in
                  devotion to his country he sadly neglected the true interests of his children. He
                  sought in the retirement of home, a relaxation from the cares and perplexities of
                  public life—exercising no control over his children, but allowing them every
                  liberty, and sparing no expense to gratify their every wish. He desired to make
                  home happy and agreeable to them; hoping that they would seldom have cause to seek
                  elsewhere for pleasures and amusements, and that when compelled to meet with the
                  necessary trials and disappointments of life, they might look back to their
                  childhood's home as the "dearest spot of earth."
               Alas, there was no restraining influences! Religion, that one thing needful, did
                  not dwell, an abiding presence, with its mild and holy luster, within that
                  thoughtless house-hold. No family altar had been reared in their midst, where
                  night and morning these "young immortals" were taught to look beyond this world's
                  dull glare to a purer light on high; or commended to the care of Him who said,
                  "Suffer-little children to come unto me, and forbid them not." Mrs. Carlton's
                  anxious musings were interrupted by the entrance of her son Robert, a fine,
                  manly-looking youth, who said:
               "Father, here are the letters and papers from the office; there is no letter from
                  Alice, but one from New York, in a lady's handwriting; perhaps it may contain
                     something in regard to sister," and
                  he deposited his packages on the table.
               Mr. Carlton immediately singled out the letter designated, and commenced its
                  perusal; while his wife approached, and anxiously waited to hear its contents. As
                  she watched his changing countenance, a presentiment of coming evil crept over her
                  heart, and she could scarcely articulate the words:
               "What is the matter, Mr. Carlton? If your letter relates to Alice, for Heaven's
                  sake tell me quickly!"
               He looked up and confronted her blanched face with one as pale; and in trembling
                  accents replied:
               "Alice is quite well, my dear—do not alarm yourself unnecessarily. This letter is
                  from Madame Laurie, who writes that for some time past a clandestine
                  correspondence has been carried on by Alice and a young man by the name of Lovell,
                  who has a sister at the seminary. As soon as this correspondence was discovered,
                  Madame Laurie threatened to write and apprise me; this had the desired effect for
                  awhile. Since then, however, Lovell has boasted that he will marry her at all
                  hazards, in order to retrieve his broken fortunes—as he credits the rumor which
                  makes Alice a wealthy heiress. This idea, I suppose, has grown out of her reckless
                  extravagance; I must go to New York immediately, and put a stop to this affair, if
                  I am under the necessity of blowing the scoundrel's brains out."
               "I pray you may not be too late!" feebly gasped the wretched mother, as she
                  clasped her hands in agony, and raised her eyes beseechingly to heaven.
               "Father, do you stay with mother, and let me go," said Robert, eagerly. "I can do
                  all that is necessary,—and I am afraid that if Alice has determined to marry him,
                  she will persuade you to consent—for I have often heard her say that she never
                  appealed to you in vain."
               "No, my son, I shall never give my consent to such a marriage! I had rather see
                  her laid in her grave than to have her united to a man who speaks and acts as he
                  has done. I need no stronger proof of his dishonor, than this clandestine manner
                  of engaging her affections, and his base attempt to inveigle into matrimony a
                  young and confiding girl like Alice. By his refusal to consult my wishes, he has
                  acknowledged himself to be a villain, and is aware that his character will not
                  bear the scrutiny of a parent's eyes."
               "It is all true, father! and I long to get the wretch in my power who would rob me
                  of my sister and bring disgrace into the family. I would stigmatize him as a
                  coward, and kill him before he should marry her. Oh, Alice! my beautiful sister! I
                  have never loved you so dearly as now, when ruin and degradation threaten you. Why
                  were you sent into temptation, with none to warn you when the serpent was near?"
                  The boy bowed his head in passionate weeping, and his heart-rending sobs added to
                  the anguish of his parents.
               "Robert, my dear boy, be more calm. Your imagination has colored this unfortunate
                  affair too highly, I think. Madame Laurie will keep a strict watch over your
                  sister, I do not doubt, until I can reach New York, which will be in four or five
                  days at farthest. Alice shall return home with me, and in a little while her
                  infatuation will be forgotten."
               "O God, spare my child! May she never bring sorrow and reproach upon our name, nor
                  send our gray hairs with sorrow to the grave," murmured the wretched mother.
               But there was no time for the stricken hearts to indulge their grief—they must
                  arouse themselves, as it was necessary for Mr. Carlton to leave on the first train
                  of cars.
               The excitement of preparing her husband for his journey supported Mrs. Carlton
                  until the swift-moving engine bore him
                  from sight; but when she returned to the house despair took possession of her
                  heart, and with a hopeless moan the stricken mother sunk to the floor. She felt
                  herself struggling amid deep, dark waters, while the waves rolled in maddening
                  fury over her defenseless head.
               She had not faith to seek refuge with One who alone had power to still the
                  tempest; but apparently hopeless and alone, with no divine eye to pity or hand to
                  save, she sank insensibly beneath the surges of despair.
               
               Mrs. Carlton was ill—very ill, and by her side stood Robert, the wayward boy, with
                  every noble and generous impulse of his nature brought suddenly into requisition.
                  He seemed fully impressed during this trying ordeal of the responsibility that
                  rested on him as the representative of his father. By a strong effort he
                  controlled his excitement, and issued his orders and directions to the troubled
                  household, with a thoughtfulness and composure which won the respect and
                  admiration of the friends who soon came with anxious hearts and willing hands to
                  his assistance.
               Mrs. Herbert and Mrs. Suderland, whose Christian hearts were ever ready to relieve
                  and aid the distressed, established themselves beside the couch of their friend,
                  who unconscious of their presence, would call in piteous accents for her absent
                  child:
               "Alice, dear Alice! come back to your heart-broken mother! Come, my darling, and
                  give me a cup of water to cool my parched lips—for I am faint and weary. Oh my
                  daughter! I have nursed you in these arms, and through long sleepless nights your
                  dear head has nestled on my bosom. Yet I did not tire; and now, when your mother
                  stretches out her trembling hand and begs a little water, you refuse to come. She
                  does not heed me! Oh 
                     
                        How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
                        To have a thankless child!
                     
                  
               
               "Alice, my darling! I would have died for you!"
               In this manner the fond mother mourned her erring child, in broken and feverish
                  accents. Although the true cause of this distress was unknown to her attendants,
                  they imagined from her thoughts being so constantly with Alice, that she had
                  occasioned her parents some trouble, which had probably brought on her mother's
                  illness. Robert could not bring himself to speak of the calamity that threatened
                  to blast the happiness of the family and destory the life of his mother, therefore
                  he left them to interpret as they pleased her mournful words.
               The days wore on; still the fever raged, and her delirium did not abate; but as
                  she manifested a disposition to sleep, Dr. Clinton insisted, one evening, that
                  Mrs. Sunderland and Mrs. Herbert should retire to seek repose as they were
                  beginning to show the effects of fatigue and confinement.
               Annie and Lula had petitioned to remain during the night to keep watch beside the
                  sufferer, and gladly availing themselves of the permission granted, entered the
                  sick-chamber with noiseless steps.
               Annie quietly seated herself at the bedside, while Lula approached the physician
                  to receive his instructions.
               Just then Mrs. Carlton opened her eyes and observed Annie.
               As her thoughts still dwelt, in their mournful intensity, upon Alice, she fancied
                  it was her daughter who had at last hearkened to the repeated appeal of her
                  mother.
               With a joyful cry, she sprang from her pillow and clasped the startled girl in a
                  passionate embrace.
               The delusion appeared to soothe her fevered brain—she grew more calm, and soon,
                  with her burning hand clasped in Annie's, she fell into a fitful slumber.
               After this, she would not permit Annie to leave her presence, and would gaze with
                  yearning fondness on the gentle girl,
                  and readily take everything offered by her hand.
               She had also conceived a strong fancy for Dr. Clinton, and whenever he prepared to
                  leave the room she would insist that he should stay and aid Alice in nursing her
                  mother—and so long as they would remain near her, she was perfectly tranquil.
               One evening she requested the physician to take a seat at her side, as she wished
                  to have a conversation with Alice and himself upon a matter of considerable
                  importance. They immediately complied with her request; while Lula sat near the
                  open window and watched the stars in the quiet sky,—Nelly availing herself of a
                  housemaid's privilege and occupying a low stool at her feet, for the purpose of
                  indulging in a whispered tte--tte.
               
               Lula was willing, in a measure, to indulge her, as she well knew that a marked
                  peculiarity of the negro race was to fall asleep if hands of tongues
                  were not actively employed—and that if this infirmity should overcome
                  Nelly—scarcely a thunderbolt from Jupiter Tonans could avail to arouse her.
               Presently the girl asked:
               "Miss Lula, what does you 'spects made massa hurry off so quick to New York? I
                  heard him tell mist'es he gwine to bring Miss Alice home, sure; and—"
               "Hush, Nelly! You must not repeat what you heard your master say; if there were
                  any tidings of Alice, which we ought to have known, Robert would have told us. I
                  suppose your master has business in New York."
               "No, Miss Lula, 'twas somethin' 'bout Miss Alice! I heard 'em call her name 'gain
                  and 'gain, and they all looked like they jus' been dug out de graves.
                     I thought Miss Alice must be mighty sick; so I asked mist'es, and
                  she said how Miss Alice was quite well—but she looked like she'd drop on de floor
                  when she told me, and I didn't say on more. Master and mist'es was in de parlor
                  that morning, and all seemed mighty pleasant 'till mars' Johnny, he had to come in
                  hollering, cause I wanted to get a preserve dish 'way from him what he wanted to
                  play with. I know'd he'd break it! but his mamma would let him have it—and sure
                  'nuff, he let it fall, and broke it into flinters. I never
                     did see such a child for breaking things in all my life! Aunt
                  Rhody says it's cause he mocks owls. Well, he cried so loud that
                  master made me give him another dish. After while I come back to clean up the
                  glass, and mars' Robert was in de parlor with the letters, and I heard 'em
                  say—"
               "Stop, Nelly! I told you not to repeat what you heard again."
               At this moment the house-dog, which occupied his accustomed post upon a mat in the
                  veranda, startled them by a loud and mournful howl.
               Nelly seemed electrified with terror. She sprang to her feet and commenced
                  wringing her hands and crying aloud:
               "Oh, my dear mist'es gwine to die! she's gwine to die! Aunt Rhody said so, Miss
                  Lula, cause she dreamed mist'es was done married ag'in. Oh my poor mist'es! my
                  dear mist'es!" and the affectionate creature wept bitterly.
               "Nelly! Nelly!" cried Lula in great alarm, as she caught the girl by the arm. "I
                  am astonished at your being so silly—you will frighten your mistress and make her
                  much worse. Go and drive the dog away immediately;" and she led the shrinking girl
                  through the low window into the veranda.
               Frequently had the watchers heard that this most mournful sound, the howl of a
                  dog, was a certain omen of approaching death—and had laughed at it as a negro
                  superstition. Yet when that prolonged wail broke upon the stillness of the
                  dimly-lighted chamber, every heart quaked with vague and sudden terror
               
               "What sound is that? It must be the Banshee's cry, calling me to the Spirit-land!"
                  cried Mrs. Carlton starting wildly from her slumber. "It must be—I have often read
                  of it in Irish legends." After a pause she continued: "If it is so, God's will be
                  done! Oh my daughter! I had hoped before the hour of parting came to have seen you
                  united to one who is worthy of you. I have observed each of you closely; and I
                  cannot possibly be mistaken in the evidence of reciprocal love. I have seen his
                  eyes bent fondly upon you, and noticed that they follow your every movement with
                  delight. I can see that the simplest word from your lips will cause emotions in
                  his heart, while your tell-tale blushes and beaming eyes grow brighter at his
                  coming. Have I not divined your secret, doctor? Is it not true, my daughter?" Then
                  offering a hand to each, Mrs. Carlton anxiously awaited their replies.
               It was a strange and striking scene. That luxurious chamber with its dim, shaded
                  light, and startled occupants; Mrs. Carlton's wasted figure, with her long black
                  hair, which, in her excitement, had fallen, loose and disheveled, over her white
                  robe; Annie's shrinking form and hidden face; Dr. Clinton's noble presence; the
                  wild intensity of Mrs. Carlton's gaze, as she looked upon each, and beyond all,
                  her strange words, and the powerful emotions called up by them in the hearts of
                  her listeners, made a singular picture, and one of thrilling contrasts.
               The embarrassment of her companions was painful in the extreme; her words were,
                  apparently, but the wild utterance of delirium; yet the method of their madness
                  touched a chord in each young heart that vibrated with intense feeling. Dr.
                  Clinton, however, at length recovered himself with a great effort, and replied
                  with profound emotion.
               "You have read my heart aright, Mrs. Carlton—and the dearest hope that heart has
                  ever known is to claim the privilege of crowning my life with the peerless
                  treasure of her love."
               Then taking Annie's trembling hand in his, he continued: "This is not alone the
                  creation of a disordered intellect, Miss Sunderland, but a reality of which I have
                  long wished, yet feared, to speak. May I not now hope that your generous heart
                  will smile upon the life which henceforth will be devoted to your happiness
                  alone?" He waited in breathless silence some look or word of encouragement.
               "Do not hesitate to speak, my child—it is not just that you should waver. A
                  mother's blessing awaits your avowal, for Dr. Clinton is worthy of my
                  darling."
               "Oh, Mrs. Carlton!" said the young girl in quivering, piteous accents. "I can
                  deceive you no longer. I am not your daughter! not Alice! but Annie Sunderland—and
                  I—"
               "Not Alice? not my daughter?" the poor sufferer repeated slowly, and in broken
                  tones. "Yet you have watched beside me with the tenderness and devotion of a
                  loving child."
               The shock of this disclosure seemed in a measure to break the spell which bound
                  the fever-stricken intellect. For a few moments she lay apparently lost in
                  meditation, then heaving a deep sigh, she said:
               "Would to God you were mine in reality! But, Annie, you have no mother, and can be
                  mine by adoption; and I will transfer this hand to him, who has already won your
                  heart."
               She then placed the little trembling hand in Dr. Clitnon's, who eagerly clapsed it
                  in both his own. Mrs. Carlton placed her hand upon theirs, and said:
               "God forever bless and protect you, my precious Annie, and make you as happy as I
                  know you to be good. Love and cherish her, doctor, for a purer heart has never
                  breathed."
               
               "With her consent, I will, so help me God!" fervently exclaimed Dr. Clinton; and
                  the beaming glance from his speaking eyes carried sweet conviction to the heart of
                  gentle Annie Sunderland.
               Mrs. Carlton closed her eyes, while a silent tear trickled down her wasted cheek;
                  then, weary and exhausted, she sunk into a troubled slumber.
               The next day Dr. Clinton persuaded Mrs. Sunderland that a drive in the fresh air
                  would restore the color to Annie's cheeks; and then the history of the love that
                  had filled his heart so long was told,—his hopes and fears, and the vain efforts
                  to stifle this passion when he thought it would never be reciprocated. He then
                  added: "Suspense had grown intolerable, when Mrs. Carlton's penetration discovered
                  my secret, and brought me to a confession."
               We will leave the reader to imagine Annie's reply to this candid avowal,—suffice
                  it to say, that when next alone with her aunt, she acknowledged, with many
                  blushes, her engagement to Dr. Clinton.
               Mrs. Carlton's illness assumed a typhoid form, and for weeks she lay in a sort of
                  stupor, utterly unconscious of surrounding objects. Her anxious friends could only
                  watch and hope for a favorable termination of her illness.
               Mr. Carlton had been telegraphed for, and in a much shorter space of time than was
                  anticipated he arrived. The family knew upon which train he would reach his home
                  and were watching with anxious eyes for his return.
               As he approched the house alone, with a feeble, languid step, Robert
                  ran to meet him, and without other greeting, hoarsely whispered:
               "Where is she, father? Oh, where is Alice?"
               Mr. Carlton lifted his head, and disclosed to Robert's view a pale, haggard face,
                  over which years seemed to have passed since last his son had looked upon it, and
                  in a broken voice replied:
               "She is dead to us, my son! Never more will Alice Carlton cross the
                  threshold of her childhood's home!—but your poor mother, Robert! How is she?"
               "Oh, father, she is yet alive!—but your tidings cannot disturb her now."
               A shudder passed over the strong man. He bowed his head upon the shoulder of his
                  son, and they wept together in their bitter sorrow,—that proud statesman and his
                  noble boy, as Heaven forbid we may see men weep again.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IX.
               
                  
                     
                        The serpent coiled within the grass,
                        With open jaw and eager eyes;
                        Watches the careless wild bird pass,
                        And lures from his native skies.
                     
                  
               
               WHEN Mr. Carlton reached New York city, the first acquiantance who accosted him
                  was Mr. Harding, a merchant from his own Southern home. After expressing his
                  pleasure at this unexpected meeting, Mr. Harding remarked:
               "By-the-way, Carlton, I dined a few days since with one of the merchant princes
                  here, and was somewhat surprised at the frequent mention of your name. It seems
                  you have quite a reputation for wealth among these nabobs. I was considerably
                  puzzled to understand the import of various inquiries concerning you, and
                  particularly the interest manifested in your family by a young specimen of the
                  genus 'swell,' answering to the name of Lovell.
               "After the wine had circulated pretty freely for some time, the mystery leaked
                  out, and the fellow learning that I was an acquaintance of yours, boldly inquired,
                  'If your daughter was not an heiress in her own right?'
               "He was considerably excited by the wine which he had imbibed so copiously, and I
                  did not care to be further troubled with his curiosity, and replied, somewhat
                  testily:
               "'Yes; she is worth her weight in gold—fully one hundred and twenty thousand!' You
                  see, Carlton, I valued your daughter, and the 'net weight' of her perfections, at
                  a thousand dollars per pound, and when I saw her last, I supposed she weighed
                  about one hundred and twenty 'But, sir,' I added, 'You will find such rare birds
                  difficult to ensnare; for the father of this young lady in rather fastidious in
                  his taste!'"
               As Mr. Harding concluded this speech, he looked up, and was alarmed at the
                  expression on the face of his friend, and hastily exclaimed:
               "What is the matter, Carlton? are you ill?"
               Mr. Carlton thought it best to keep his own counsel in this affair, at least for
                  the time, and by speaking of his hurried journey and sleepless nights, he
                  succeeded in quieting the fears of his friend.
               He soon after excused himself to Mr. Harding, and with spirits greatly depressed
                  by the interview, hastened to Madame L.'s establishment, reflecting bitterly on
                  the reckless speech of Mr. Harding to young Lovell, which he had every reason to
                  fear would seriously affect the destiny of his child.
               Madame Laurie expressed much pleasure and great relief at seeing Mr. Carlton, and
                  advised him to remove Alice from New York at the earliest possible moment.
               "Parce que, entre nous, c'est la dernier
                     ressort," continued the voluble Frenchwoman, shrugging her shoulders,
                  "as I have lost all influence with mademoiselle!
                  And her actions are now controlled pleinement—entirely—by the family of Monsieur Lovell."
               This family occupied a splendid house on Fifth Avenue, and lived in showy and
                  expensive style.
               Miss Lovell was a pupil at Madame Laurie's establishment, and similarity in tastes
                  and character had cemented a strong friendship between Alice Carlton and
                  herself.
               The latter young lady was frequently allowed to visit at the house of her friend,
                  where she, of course, met the son and brother. She was charmed by the splendor and
                  luxury which surrounded her, and flattered by the attentions of the young gentleman, whose talents and virtues
                  were constantly paraded and extolled in her presence.
               A rumor of Mr. Carlton's immense wealth had preceded his daughter's introduction
                  to this household, and it was confirmed by her reckless extravagance.
               As Mr. Lovell, Senior, was on the verge of bankruptcy, and his son had already
                  arrived at that critical act in the drama of high life, it was decided in family
                  council that a union with Alice, and the consequent control of her supposed
                  fortune, would suspend certain disagreeable operations of a mercenary character,
                  and serve to support the tottering greatness of the house of Lovell.
               It was not long before a solemn declaration of love was made to their innocent
                  victim, in true dramatic style; and the poor girl, suspecting no guile, gave in
                  return the devotion and tenderness of a heart's first love.
               For reasons best known to himself, young Lovell requested Alice to conceal the
                  engagement from her parents and friends.
               Unfortunately, however, for the success of his plans, Madame Laurie had, on one
                  occasion, intercepted a letter from him to the deluded girl, and threatened to
                  divulge the secret to Mr. Carlton if this disgraceful proceeding was not
                  immediately discontinued. At the same time she commanded that Alice's intercourse
                  with the Lovell family should cease entirely.
               A promise of obedience to her wishes was unhesitatingly given, and strictly
                  adhered to for a short period; but Alice's young and trusting heart was not proof
                  to the wiles and bewildering influences by which she was surrounded; and ere long
                  constant communication was established between the lovers by means of Clara
                  Lovell's talent for finesse.
               
               Seated at a table in the saloon of a fashionable restaurant in Broadway, Adolphus Lovell boasted to a friend that he
                  could marry Miss Carlton at any hour he choose; and as a handsome fortune was to
                  be her dowry, he had concluded to do so without risking a refusal from her
                  parents.
               This modest declaration was overheard by two of Alice's numerous schoolmates
                  (personally unknown to Lovell), who, unnoticed by the young gentlemen, were
                  quietly demolishing their ices at another table not far off.
               These dutiful pupils, of course, instantly repaired to headquarters, where a vivid
                  account of all they had overheard, including the speech of le petite maitre, was repeated to Madame Laurie, who lost no time in
                  apprising Mr. Carlton of the danger to which Alice was exposed.
               When Miss Carlton was summoned to the parlor on the day of her father's arrival in
                  New York, great was her astonishment, when on entering the room, his dear,
                  familiar face met her gaze.
               For a moment, Lovell and her newly-awakened dreams of love were forgotten, as she
                  clung with unfeigned delight to her father's neck, and listened to his words of
                  fond endearment.
               But they soon returned—and with tenfold power claimed their wonted place within
                  her heart and hopes, when, after her affectionate inquiries for the dear ones at
                  home were answered, Mr. Carlton said, suddenly, and with a searching gaze into her
                  face.
               "My child, I have come to take you home! Your mother is anxious for your return.
                  She has not been in her usual health for some time past, and sighs for the
                  companionship of her daughter. I shall leave New York early to-morrow morning, and
                  will expect you to be in readiness to accompany me."
               For an instant she quailed beneath her father's piercing eye. She longed to throw
                  herself at his feet and acknowledge all—but a remembrance of her promises and the
                     toils in which she was so firmly
                  bound, came over her with a sudden chill—and she was silent.
               "Alice! you certainly do not regret to return to your home with your own father?
                  Why do you not answer me?" And the tone of stern reproach fell like ice upon her
                  heart.
               "Oh! no, father! you cannot suppose this for a moment. But your summons was so
                  unexpected—and the time so short!" she replied, in great confusion; then
                  added:
               "I wish to make some purchases before leaving the city, and will scarcely have
                  time to complete them, I fear."
               "You will have ample time this afternoon to do so, and to make all other necessary
                  arrangements," was his reply.
               Then handing her a roll of bank-notes, he took his departure, after promising to
                  return in an hour or two to accompany her on her shopping expedition.
               The moment her father left the house, Alice rushed up to her room, and throwing
                  herself upon the bed, she burst into a passionate flood of tears, the consequence
                  of the conflicting emotions which had surged her heart upon learning her father's
                  intention of removing her from the presence she had learned to hold so dear.
               "Oh! I cannot go! I cannot leave him without one cheering word of remembrance!"
                  she cried, in anguished tones. "Can it be that some malicious person has betrayed
                  us?—and so defamed the character of my Adolphus that father wishes to tear me away
                  and take me where I shall never see him again? It must be so!—for he looked so
                  cold and stern when he asked if I objected to returning home. Ah! if Adolphus
                  would only consent that I might tell father! I know he would not oppose my wishes
                  when he knows that the happiness of his child is at stake; 'his own little Alice,'
                  whom he has never allowed to appeal to him in vain!"
               At recess, when, after missing Alice from recitation and their accustomed haunts,
                  Clara Lovell sought her friendly chamber, and found her lying buried among the
                  pillows of the couch, weeping and sobbing hysterically; and when she learned the
                  cause of her distress she indignantly exclaimed:
               "This is some spiteful manœuvre of that fawning sycophant, Madame Laurie! She has
                  informed against you! and traduced the character of my brother, in such a manner
                  that your father has determined to remove you from New York,—and to separate you
                  from Adolphus forever! Oh! Alice, my dear friend, we cannot give you up! my poor
                  brother's heart would break."
               And the wily actress actually shed tears; but they were tears of anger and
                  vexation.
               It is unnecessary to repeat further what passed between the two girls. When they
                  parted, Alice was apparently calm, for Miss Lovell had left her with the
                  comforting assurance that Adolphus would certainly find an opportunity of seeing
                  her during that afternoon or evening.
               Then, after removing all traces of tears from her face, Alice made a hasty toilet
                  preparatory to accompanying her father.
               In a short time Mr. Carlton called, in a carriage, for Alice, and was somewhat
                  reassured when he met her now cheerful face, and saw how fondly she remembered the
                  tastes and preferences of each loved one in her distant home, and how eager she
                  was to gratify that preference in her selection of gifts and tokens for all; and
                  with his usual indulgence and liberality, the fond parent knew no greater pleasure
                  than to gratify her every wish.
               Finally they entered Stewart's, and at the same moment a handsome carriage drew
                  up, in which sat a young lady and gentleman, who alighted, and, after a few
                  whispered words as they stood on the sidewalk, the gentleman passed on to another door, while the lady followed in the
                  wake of Mr. Carlton and his daughter.
               As Alice was speaking to a salesman in reference to some silks, the lady brushed
                  by, and, on turning, she met the eyes of Clara Lovell, who passed on, with a
                  significant smile, to another portion of the establishment.
               Soon after Mr. Harding came in, and paid his respects to Alice; then taking Mr.
                  Carlton's arm, he led him off to a more retired portion of the apartment, and
                  said:
               "I called at the hotel to see you in regard to a private matter, and as you were
                  out, and my business pressing, I concluded to await your return. In the mean time
                  this telegram was brought in for you; and seeing you pass soon after, in an open
                  carriage, I decided to take it and follow you,—as such things will not always
                  admit of delay,—and have just now overtaken you."
               Mr. Carlton hastily opened the envelope, and read:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Mother is very ill. Return immediately.
                           
                              "ROBERT CARLTON."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               He staggered, and would have fallen but for the timely assistance of his friend,
                  who drew him to a seat, and offered him a glass of water.
               The unhappy man was almost exhausted from fatigue and mental excitement, and had
                  scarcely slept since he left his home. Under these circumstances it was not
                  strange that this startling and painful intelligence should unnerve the
                  affectionate husband. He bowed his head in silent agony, and appeared incapable of
                  thought or action.
               Mr. Harding became alarmed; and placing his hand gently on his shoulder, said:
               "What is it, Carlton? I hope you have no bad news? Cannot I assist you in some
                  way?"
               After a painful interval the answer came, in accents trembling with emotion:
               "Oh, Harding! my beloved wife is dying! Bring Alice to me instantly. We must
                  return home without an hour's delay."
               "Let me see you to the carriage first, then I will return for Alice."
               When Miss Carlton saw Mr. Harding lead her father away from the sales-room, she
                  availed herself of his absence to speak with Clara Lovell. That young lady had
                  also witnessed his departure, and hastened forward, saying: "Come this way, Alice
                  dear!" and Clara threw her arm around the shrinking girl, and led her rapidly to a
                  distant portion of the building, where she stood face to face with Adolphus
                  Lovell.
               Alice was not, as we have seen, entirely unprepared for this meeting, yet the
                  blush deepened on her cheek, and her eyes sparkled with greater brilliancy, as she
                  listened to his softly-whispered words.
               "Oh! Alice, my heart's idol! I cannot let you go!" he passionately
                  exclaimed, clasping both her hands in his.
               "Adolphus! go with me to my father,—let us confess our engagement,—he will not
                  refuse his consent. I am his only daughter, and he will always consult my wishes
                  and happiness."
               "No, my Alice! I have been told by those who know him, that your father is a
                  proud, austere man, who would spurn my proposal with contempt. If you would only
                  yield, and become mine at once,—this hour,—he then could not part
                  'two hearts that beat as one,' and I feel assured would not refuse, for your dear
                  sake, to accept me as his son."
               "You have been misinformed in regard to my father's character," said Alice, with a
                  faint effort at reserve. "He has ever been kind and indulgent to his children, and
                  for that reason do I wish you to appeal to him."
               "It will be useless, dear Alice! If I but mention the subject to him, we will be
                  parted forever. It is for that intent he hurries you away. Fly with me, beloved
                  one! Let the marriage vow bind us
                  together, then naught but death shall divide us. Come, dear Alice! a carriage is
                  waiting, and warm hearts are ready to welcome you, my peerless bride, to my
                  father's home. Oh! my darling, if you hesitate you are lost to me forever! Come,
                  sweet one! let my home be your home, my friends yours also." He continued: "Alice,
                  your own heart pleads for me I know. Come, ere it is too late! and a life's
                  devotion shall repay you for the sacrifice!" and he drew the trembling hand
                  through his arm.
               "My father! my dear father!" murmured Alice, as she was placed in the
                  carriage.
               "We will soon kneel together at his feet, my dearest, and ask a father's
                  blessing," was the ready reply of the artful dissembler, as he seated himself at
                  her side; Clara followed quickly—then the fleet horses bore them away.
               A clergyman was in attendance, by appointment, at Mr. Lovell's house, and as the
                  party entered the parlors he stood before them, and spoke a few words; then
                  joining their hands, he uttered a brief prayer, and pronounced Adolphus Lovell and
                  Alice Carlton man and wife.
               Mr. Harding returned into the department at Stewart's where he had left Alice; but
                  not seeing her, he sought her in the different divisions of the establishment, but
                  with no better success.
               He had scarcely noticed her appearance, and could give no accurate description,
                  therefore no assistance could be rendered him in his dilemma.
               At length, however, an errand boy remarked: "Perhaps, sir, you are looking for one
                  of those ladies who left the store in company with Mr. Lovell."
               "Great God! save and protect the poor child!" exclaimed Mr. Harding, in alarm—then
                  hurriedly continued:
               "How long since they left? What direction did they take?"
               "About ten minutes, I guess. Can't say exactly, sir," was the reply.
               Inquiries were made of outsiders; but no definite information could be
                  obtained.
               Mr. Harding had recently been informed of young Lovell's intentions in regard to
                  Alice, and to communicate this intelligence to her father was the cause of his
                  asking a private interview.
               The effect produced by the tidings contained in the telegram, rendered it
                  impossible for him to disclose what he had heard, and now he feared it was too
                  late to interfere. The kind-hearted man was completely at a loss; he dreaded to
                  acquaint Mr. Carlton, in his present state of mind, with her disappearance. "Yet
                  if I hesitate, Alice is lost! and though I am ready and anxious to do all in my
                  power to rescue the deluded girl," he thought, as he returned to the carriage, "I
                  am utterly incapable of action—not knowing what direction the fugitives have
                  taken."
               "Alice is not in the store, Carlton," he said, with as much calmness as he could
                  assume. "If you are willing, I will accompany you to your hotel, and then go in
                  quest of her."
               "Not in the store! Where can she be, then?" inquired her father, listlessly—his
                  thoughts wandering to his suffering wife.
               Tenderly and carefully Mr. Harding introduced the subject. He spoke of Lovell's
                  connection with Alice; of the information he had received during the day; and,
                  lastly, of the employ's assertion that she had
                  left the store with young Lovell and his sister.
               In an instant the father was aroused from his lethargy, and cried out:
               "Coachman, drive to Mr. Lovell's, Fifth Avenue. Don't spare your horses!"
               The driver knew the place, and drove rapidly, as ordered.
               
               When they arrived at the house, Mr. Harding insisted that his friend should remain
                  in the carriage, while he went in to make the requisite inquiries.
               "I think it doubtful," he added, "whether we shall find them here, though I may
                  possibly be able to obtain some information at the door, as the servants may know
                  something of their movements."
               The truth was, he feared for Mr. Carlton, who was distressingly excited, to meet
                  young Lovell; and as he concluded that the affair had probably reached its crisis,
                  he knew that nothing save blood would stay the wrath of the hot-brained
                  Southerner.
               Mr. Carlton was in no frame of mind to listen to reason, and was about to spring
                  from the carriage, when his friend grasped his arm, and sternly said:
               "For God's sake remember your dying wife and helpless children at home."
               After a moment, he replied, meekly: "For their sakes I will submit"—then fell back
                  upon the seat.
               A footman in showy livery answered the door-bell.
               "Is Miss Carlton here?—if so, take me to her immediately!" and Mr. Harding dropped
                  a bank-bill into his eager hand.
               "A lady by that name came here about twenty minutes ago, sir, but she is now Mrs.
                  Adolphus Lovell. The marriage ceremony was just over when you rang. Shall I
                  announce you, sir?" was the obsequious reply.
               "No! my visit was intended for Miss Carlton—not for Mrs. Lovell!"
               Mr. Harding left the door, hurried down the steps, and into the carriage,—then
                  said to the coachman, "Drive to the Metropolitan," regardless of Mr. Carlton's
                  breathless inquiries.
               "My dear friend," he said at last, "your interference can now avail nothing; it is
                  too late!
               "Alice is married!"
               "Merciful God! have pity upon me!" briefly ejaculated the unhappy man, as he
                  buried his face in his hands.
               In a few moments after their arrival at the hotel, a note was handed Mr. Carlton
                  from Alice, in which she informed her father of her marriage, and implored his
                  forgiveness. She wrote:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "When you know Mr. Lovell, you will commend my choice, and proudly
                              welcome him as a son to your heart and home. Let us come to you, dear
                              father! to plead our cause, and explain the reason for the apparent
                              rashness of your
                           
                              "Affectionate daughter,
                              "ALICE CARLTON LOVELL."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Mr. Carlton was very pale; his countenance had assumed the firmness and rigidity
                  of marble as he read this note.
               Then calling for paper and ink, he wrote:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Alice! It is hard to give up you up! but as you have voluntarily
                              resigned all claim to a father's love and protection, I must
                              submit—and henceforth mourn for you as for the dead. The void created
                              in my heart by the loss of a beloved daughter can never be filled by
                              the wife of Adolphus Lovell.
                           'Perhaps it may not be amiss to inform you, that your willful
                              disobedience and ingratitude has brought a devoted mother to the brink
                              of the grave. Before this reached you, I shall have obeyed the summons
                              that bids me hasten to the bedside of my heart-broken wife.
                           
                              "WILLIAM CARLTON."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER X.
               
                  
                     
                        I bent before thy gracious throne,
                        And asked for peace with suppliant knee;
                        And peace was given,—nor peace alone,
                        But faith, and hope, and ecstasy!
                     
                  
               
               IT was April, that month of smiles and tears which Shakspeare often referred to
                  with feelings of intense delight; and truly may all rejoice at the coming of the
                  glorious season that witnessed the advent of this immortal bard, whose versatile
                  genius was typical of the storms and sunshine which alternately reign throughout
                  this lovely month of spring. 
                     With tears and laughter for all time!
                   he wrote; and the world by general acclamation crowned him with laurels,
                  which will ever remain fresh and green as the emerald buds that greeted his
                  opening eyes.
               On the same day of the beautiful month which grave to England and to fame her
                  greatest original poet, he closed his eyes forever on the world he had enriched
                  with language and ideas unparalleled in its history. No less beautiful is this
                  season of "infinite variety" in the land of flowers, where Flora's reign is
                  perpetual. The sweet April wind, laden with the perfume of violets which the bard
                  of Avon loved so well, came softly through the lattice, and gently fanned the
                  fevered brow of Mrs. Carlton.
               She was sleeping; and Lula Graham sat beside her couch, anxiously watching the
                  deathlike countenance of the sufferer.
               The mocking-birds had formed a choral band in a clump of beautiful Southern "robinias," whose drooping racemes of fragrant snowy flowers hung like
                  clusters of pearls from the graceful branches which shaded the veranda.
               But the clear sweet notes of the joyous minstrels failed to arouse the exhausted
                  woman, or to recall her worldly spirit from the dream-land where it slept.
               Lula had been reading one of those soul-stirring poems of Bishop Heber's, when the
                  delicious melody of the birds recalled her to the beauty of terrestrial things,
                  and suddenly the thought flashed upon her mind that this month was the anniversary
                  of the birth and death of that poet whose sacred harp had sent forth the heavenly
                  strains, which had echoed 
                     
                        From Greenland's icy mountains
                        To India's coral strand,
                     
                   and her heart joined in nature's glad anthem that seemed to sing his
                  praise.
               She looked out upon the pleasant landscape and thought how sad it would be to bid
                  an eternal farewell to this beautiful home, which nature had adorned with such a
                  lavish hand; then turning to the sleeper, she softly exclaimed:
               "Oh! if she should die without being prepared to meet her God! She has given no
                  evidence of a changed heart; and to be hurried, thus unconsciously, into eternity!
                  Oh, it is terrible, agonizing!"
               Then falling upon her knees, the orphan girl softly murmured:
               "Oh! merciful God! spare her life—restore her in thy good time to health and
                  strength, that she may have a longer season in which to work out her salvation,
                  and be more useful in her station, if it be consistent with thy divine will. If
                  not, restore her to reason before she enters the dark and silent valley. Let the lamp of the
                  Saviour's love guide her through the gloom, and his arms, at last enfold her into
                  heavenly rest. Oh, Lamb of God! that takest away the sins of the world, hear my
                  prayer, and have mercy upon her!"
               She arose, and bent over the sleeper to remove a lock of hair which had fallen
                  over her face, and was startled by the sudden change in her countenance. A
                  pleasant smile was about her lips, and a calm, serene expression rested on the
                  brow, which before had worn a look of intense suffering.
               As the gentle nurse tenderly arranged the disordered hair, she perceived a slight
                  moisture about her forehead. Then an irrepressible, ejaculation escaped from her
                  lips. "Merciful God, I thank thee!"
               Mr. Carlton, who unobserved had heard the prayer and witnessed the whole scene,
                  suddenly stood by Lula's side. She pointed to the beaded drops which now stood
                  thickly upon the calm and peaceful brow, and softly whispered:
               "She will live."
               The anxious husband stooped and listened to the quiet, regular breathing, and
                  assured himself that she was at last in a natural slumber—then fell on his knees
                  by her side, and for the first time, since as a little child he lisped his prayers
                  in his boyhood's home, with a heart filled with gratitude and love to God, he
                  returned thanks for this ray of hope which had appeared to cheer his deep
                  despondency.
               Long and fervently did the grief-stricken man pray by the side of this wife. The
                  mercy and goodness of the great Omnipotent appeared as a silver lining to the
                  thick clouds of sorrow which had so long lowered above his defenseless head.
               His ingratitude for the innumerable blessings that had crowned his life was
                  suddenly revealed to him, and his heart cried out:
               "What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits unto me?"
               Lula was deeply affected by this scene, and was about to leave the room, when he
                  beckoned to her, and said:
               "My dear child, I thank you most gratefully for your watchful care and kind
                  attention during this long and painful illness—but more than all, I thank you for
                  that touching prayer, which I trust will be answered according to your first
                  petition. Your love and confidence in the power and mercy of God has helped to
                  bring me to the foot of the cross as a suppliant, to sue for pardon;" then added,
                  with much fervor: "May He, for Christ's sake, grant me remission of sins, and
                  henceforth I will endeavor to devote the greater part of my life to his service.
                  Lula Graham, when I am reminded of your purity and innocence, I cannot believe
                  that God will disregard your prayers. Will you intercede for me?"
               "Mr. Carlton, you are laboring under a strange delusion if you regard me in that
                  light. On the contrary, my whole life has been one of error and repentance. The
                  Bible tells us there is none perfect. No, not one." Then she added: "I have often
                  petitioned in my feeble prayers that in your distress you might be drawn to the
                  mercy-seat, where 
                     The hope of the penitent is fadeless and pure.
                   Christ has said, 'Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I
                  will give you rest.' 'Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and
                  lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls; for my yoke is easy and my
                  burden light.' God does not suffer us to plead in vain; his arms are ever ready to
                  receive us. But pardon my presumption, Mr. Carlton," she continued, blushing deeply, "in offering counsel to one so
                  much my superior in years and intellect. Whenever I speak of the Saviour or plead
                  his cause, I am strangely forgetful of my youth and ignorance."
               "My dear child, you have said nothing that does not reflect great credit either on
                  your head or your heart. I admire your zeal, and now feel forcibly the truth and
                  beauty of that verse in the New Testatment, where Jesus said, 'I thank thee, O
                  Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise
                  and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.'"
               A slight movement attracted their attention and recalled them to the bedside. A
                  gentle sigh escaped from the lips of the sleeper, and Mr. Carlton again bent over
                  her to assure himself that it was natural repose. Then seating himself by her side
                  with Hope's whispers to gladden his heart, he patiently awaited the first glance
                  of recognition.
               Lula hastened to apprise the household of the favorable change in the beloved
                  patient, and to proclaim her belief that the crisis had passed, and that Mrs.
                  Carlton would live.
               This announcement was received with great joy, and Dr. Clinton's arrival was
                  anxiously looked forward to, that he might confirm he hopes thus unexpectedly
                  given to their hearts.
               He had received a sudden summons to attend on Mrs. Grant, who had ruptured a
                  blood-vessel in a violent fit of passion, and her life was considered in imminent
                  danger. Thinking that Mrs. Carlton would probably sleep until his return, he
                  considered it his duty to obey the call, notwithstanding inclination might have
                  led him to decline.
               When at last his buggy wheels were heard on the graveled road, the eyes of his
                  patient opened, and for the first time she recognized the dear, familiar face of
                  her husband who had watched so long in silent agony by her side.
               With her weary head pillowed on the faithful bosom of her companion, Mrs. Carlton
                  rested, calmly and sweetly, as a feeble babe on the breast of its mother.
               Here let us drop the curtain, and leave them in silent communion with their own
                  hearts which are filled with gratitude to God for his great goodness is sparing
                  the life of this, the beloved wife and mother.
               Dr. Clinton, finding that his services could be dispensed with for awhile by his
                  patient, Mrs. Carlton, immediately carried out his intention of returning to Mrs.
                  Grant, as he considered her in a very critical situation.
               Helpless, powerless, deprived of strength and motion, the physician had left her
                  with no one to care for or pity her, save the poor negroes, whom she had ruled
                  with a tyrant's power, and the kind-hearted but ignorant wife of her overseer.
               He sought an opportunity of communicating with Mrs. Herbert, and informed her that
                  when he arrived Mrs. Grant was almost exhausted from the loss of blood; her
                  terror-stricken servants stood around in utter dismay, as she would receive no
                  assistance from their hands. The kind offices of Mrs. Smith, the overseer's wife,
                  were also indignantly repulsed.
               When Dr. Clinton entered her room, a sigh of relief escaped her, as she recognized
                  in him the same physician who had attended the orphan, Lula Graham, when she was
                  ill in her house.
               She was evidently in great alarm, and readily took from his hand the offered
                  draught, but would accept it from no other.
               "Do not leave me, doctor!" she feebly gasped. "They will poison me, if you do!
                  Stay with me, and I will give you gold
                  enough to blot out the cruel, bitter taunts that I heaped upon you years ago, when
                  you helped to rob me of that poor child, whose plaintive cries and pleading looks
                  are haunting me still. Oh, I can never! no, never forget that piercing cry! It has
                  tortured my heart and drives the sleep from my eyes."
               It was with great reluctance that the poor woman gave her consent for Dr. Clinton
                  to leave her, although he promised to return as soon as possible.
               As he was leaving the room, she signed for him to approach her, and with
                  considerable effort said:
               "Doctor, I cannot rest without seeing Lula Graham again,—bring her to me!" with
                  much effort she continued: "I can trust her, for she was honest and
                  true. Tell her that I cannot harm her now, for I am more helpless than she was
                  when the coffin-lid closed over her mother—her only friend.
               "Go, doctor—go quickly! and bring that child to me. She is almost a woman now; but
                  if the promises of her childhood have not been blighted, she will not hesitate to
                  come on an errand of mercy."
               Mrs. Herbert readily gave her consent for the orphan to return with the doctor,
                  and spend the night at Mrs. Grant's, promising to drive over herself the next day
                  and see the invalid.
               "Let us see, doctor, what Lula will say about going. It must be optional with her.
                  I shall not try to influence her either way. This visit, I know, will necessarily
                  be a painful one; it will revive many sad and unpleasant reminiscences, which I
                  have striven to obliterate from her memory."
               Lula was much affected, and greatly concerned when informed of Mrs. Grant's
                  situation; with tears in her eyes she turned to Mrs. Herbert, and said:
               "Dear auntie, do let me go to her! It is so sad to think of one's suffering,
                  perhaps dying, in a Christian land, without a friend to comfort her last moments.
                  Do let me go, dear auntie!"
               Mrs. Herbert kissed the pleading lips of her darling, then bade her hasten her
                  preparations for departure, as Dr. Clinton would leave in a few minutes.
               It was with mingled feelings of pity and dread that the orphan girl prepared to go
                  on her Christian mission of charity to the dismal abode of the stern,
                  misanthropical woman, who had crushed the sweet and joyous spirit of her early
                  years.
               But she refused to hearken to the voice of the tempter, who, bidding her turn from
                  such scenes, would thus allure from the path of duty, and concluded her
                  preparations for the melancholy visit.
               Though young in years, Lula Graham did not indulge in that species of piety which
                  looks to its own ease and safety, leaving suffering humanity to work alone its
                  deliverance; but like the Marys and Phebes, the Priscillas and Dorcases of the
                  apostolic age, she sought to assuage the sorrows of the sick and afflicted, to
                  reclaim the outcast, to clothe the needy, and instruct the ignorant, knowing
                  herself no greater happiness than when she had assisted in promoting that of
                  others. With her youthful heart filled with such pure and holy desires, she would
                  often 
                     
                        Seek the lonely cell
                        Where modest want, and silent anguish dwell;
                        Raise the weak head, sustain the feeble knees,
                        Cheer the cold heart, and chase the dire disease.
                        The splendid deeds, which only seek a name,
                        Are paid their just reward in present fame;
                        But know, the awful all-disclosing day,
                        The long arrear of secret worth shall pay;
                        Applauding saints shall hear with fond regard,
                        And He, who witness'd here, shall there reward.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XI.
               
                  
                     
                        Thus while we dwell in this low scene,
                        The Lamb is our unfailing screen;
                        To Him, though guilty, still we run,
                        And God still spares us for his Son.
                     
                  
               
               MANY were the painful memories that crowded about the heart of Lula Graham, as she
                  approached the house where years ago she received her mother's last kiss and
                  blessing. That mother's spirit had 
                     
                        —passed to heaven—but oh, how dark!
                        The sky from which her smile has gone—
                        No star now lives to guide my bark,
                        No fount to cheer my spirit on!
                        Yet, till my life shall cease to be,
                        Her memory shall abide with me!
                     
                  
               
               Thoughts that filled her little heart on that dark and dreary day, came rushing
                  back in their lava-tide of sorrow, as she rode along the avenue and gazed upon the
                  door through which her mother's lifeless form had been borne to its last
                  resting-place. Its solitary mourner was herself,—a poor, lonely little one, whose
                  tears and sobs of bitter anguish were the outpourings of her crushed and bleeding
                  heart. 
                     
                        'Tis past, 'tis past, but I gaze on it now
                        With a quivering breath and a throbbing brow;
                        'Twas there she nursed me, 'twas there she died.
                     
                  
               
               And a sacred thing was that silent dwelling to the heart-broken widow's only
                  child.
               When they entered the house, Dr. Clinton lost no time in seeking his patient.
               Lula remained in the hall until Mrs. Grant was prepared to receive her; and the
                  servants soon recognized in the tall, beautiful young lady, the lovely child whose
                  presence had so often been like a sunbeam on their dark, cheerless lives, and
                  flocked around her with many expressions of joy and thankfulness at her
                  return.
               Old Elsy hobbled up with her stick, and cried out, with tears streaming down her
                  withered cheeks:
               "Bless de Lord, oh, my soul! for sending de gardi'n angel once more to dis
                  benighted place."
               Dr. Clinton presently reappeared, and requested Lula to enter the sick woman's
                  chamber. It was not without considerable trepidation that she followed him into
                  the presence of one whose angry frown and harsh words had been a constant terror
                  to her childish heart.
               But when she approached the bed and saw the strong form laid powerless, and the
                  deathlike pallor of that face which had been so seldom freed from passion's purple
                  stain, her heart grew strong with sympathy, and a desire to alleviate the
                  suffering so strongly depicted in that ghastly countenance. She clasped the
                  withered hand, and exclaimed:
               "Oh, Mrs. Grant, I am so sorry to find you ill! I have come to nurse you—and if
                  possible, to repay you for your kindness in giving me shelter so long after my
                  dear mamma died."
               Dr. Clinton had urged upon Mrs. Grant the necessity for keeping silent, and for
                  some time she held the little hand in her feeble grasp, without making any
                  reply.
               At length, with much difficulty, she said:
               "Child, I cannot tell what induced you to obey my wish. You certainly have no
                  cause to love me! But, perhaps, you imagined I might die, and leave you some of my
                     hard-earned earned money. If that
                  was your reason for coming, you'll be sadly mistaken, for I have no such
                  intentions. You have never deceived me, Lula Graham, tell me why you came?"
               The old woman, almost exhausted from the effort to speak, fixed her dull, languid
                  eyes upon the orphan's truthful face, and awaited her answer.
               "Mrs. Grant, I heard that you were very ill, with no one to attend you, and I came
                  hoping to be of service; beside this, I understood you expressed a desire to see
                  me. If you had not done this, I would have come and offered you every assistance
                  in my power; because I felt grateful for your protection when I was alone in the
                  wide world, without a shelter from storm and tempest. If you suspect me of wrong,
                  or if my presence is disagreeable, I had better return."
               A tear glistened in Lula's eye as she concluded these words, and she attempted to
                  withdraw her hand from its feeble clasp.
               The helpless woman resisted the movement, and hastily replied:
               "No! no! Stay where you are, child! I believe what you say, Lula; and may God
                  forgive me for my harshness to a poor little orphan."
               She released her hold, and with her trembling hand raised a handkerchief to stanch
                  the blood, which had suddenly begun to flow from her lips.
               The usual remedies were applied, but for a long time the violence of the
                  hemorrhage defied every attempt of the physician to arrest it.
               Throughout the long weary night, Dr. Clinton and Lula watched in that cheerless
                  chamber, beside the friendless woman whose fear of treachery on the part of the
                  servants, forbade them to approach her. When the gray tints of morning began to
                  illumine the eastern horizon, the anodynes had taken effect, and the wretched,
                  conscience-stricken creature fell into a short slumber. Although faint and weary,
                  Lula continued to exert herself in behalf of the sufferer until, with her previous
                  exertions, and present loss of rest, she was ready to sink from fatigue. Dr.
                  Clinton, at length, took from her tired hand the fan which she still gently waved,
                  and led her to the door. Then with quite a decided manner, he commanded her to
                  seek rest in a distant apartment.
               She saw from his resolute manner that he intended to be obeyed, and accordingly
                  betook herself to repose. The physician returned to his vigil—watching the
                  fluctuating pulse and shortened breathing; and his thoughts passed in melancholy
                  review over the sad history of his unfortunate patient, whose whole life had been
                  spent in amassing wealth at the risk of losing her soul. Now, perhaps, the time
                  would shortly arrive when she must render an account of her stewardship, and her
                  soul would be demanded of her. Oh! the bitter remorse of the sinner, and the
                  dreadful punishment that must follow that awful sentence from the Great Tribunal:
                  "Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
                  angels."
               Such thoughts banished sleep from the eyes of this Christian physician, and bowing
                  his head, he prayed softly:
               "O merciful God! have pity and compassion upon this helpless sinner! awaken her to
                  a sense of her alarming condition, and save her from thy just wrath! Save her from
                  that dreadful sentence at the last great day! Save her for the sake of thy beloved
                  Son, who endured for us the agonies of Gethsemane and the painful death of the
                  cross."
               He lifted his head at the conclusion of this petition and found the eyes of his
                  patient fixed, with horror and amazement in their gaze, upon him.
               
               "Dr. Clinton, am I dying? Am I in immediate danger of death, and the wrath of God?
                  If so, save me! Oh! save me from everlasting torment, where the worm dieth not,
                  and the fire is not quenched," she cried, in piteous tones, as she stretched her
                  trembling hands toward him.
               "It is impossible for me to say what will be the result, Mrs. Grant. You must
                  endeavor to remain perfectly quiet, and put your trust in Him who 'doeth all thing
                  well.' And excitement may produce a return of the hemorrhage, which would probably
                  injure you seriously."
               "Remain quiet—when death, the grave, and hell are waiting to receive me?
                  Impossible!" she exclaimed, hoarsely. Then covering her face with her hands,
                  silent tears trickled through the long, bony fingers.
               Dr. Clinton endeavored in vain to calm her troubled spirit, by telling her to
                  cling to Christ,—that it was not too late: 
                     
                        To-day a pardoning God
                        Will hear the suppliant pray,
                        To-day, a Saviour's cleansing blood
                        Will wash thy guilt away.
                     
                  
               
               The poor woman struggled long to quell the inward tumult. Some time elapsed ere
                  she spoke or withdrew her hands.
               At last she looked up, and called, feebly:
               "Lula! Lula!"
               Not seeing her, she turned an angry look upon the doctor, and asked:
               "Where is that girl? Have you robbed me of her again?"
               Dr. Cilnton answered:
               "Oh, no! she is here, and will remain as long as she can be of service to you. She
                  is obeying my orders just now, by sleeping, or taking some rest in another room,
                  which is very necessary for her, after watching with you through the whole
                  night."
               "Call her, doctor! call her to me—what is one night's fatigue, compared to an
                  eternity of torture? Oh! save me from its dreadful pangs—and all of my possessions
                  shall be yours. Save me, doctor! save me, or I perish!"
               Her companion endeavored to persuade her that God alone could rescue the erring
                  soul; that he was ready and willing to pardon all for the sake of his dear Son, if
                  they would repent and believe in him.
               "There is no hope! no pardon! for a wretch like me. I have forgotten my
                  God,—despised my fellow-creatures, to worship the great Mammon! Oh! how that
                  long-neglected book rises up before me with its warning voice: 'What shall it
                  profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul?'" she exclaimed,
                  despairingly.
               "'Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be made white as snow;' ask God to
                  give you a clean heart, and 'renew a right spirit.' within you. His ear is ever
                  open to the penitent sinner's cry, my friend."
               "Call Lula! She will not deceive me,—truth and innocence are stamped
                  upon her brow, and the love of God and his spirit reign in her pure heart. Call
                  her quickly! My time is short, and the king of Terrors approaches. Bid her
                  come!"
               Dr. Clinton hastened to obey, fearing that this great excitement would have a
                  fatal effect.
               When Lula entered the room Mrs. Grant grasped the little hands in both of hers,
                  and gazing intently into the young girl's gentle face, said:
               "Child, I am dying; tell me truly if God will pardon such a vile wretch as you
                     know me to be? Is it not too late to repent after a lifetime spent
                  in league with Satan? Oh, the torture! the remorse of this hour! Oh! how the poor
                  negroes would rejoice if they knew what agony I was suffering now on account of my harsh treatment of
                  them. Tell me, Lula Graham is there any hope for me? any way of escape? Is it too
                  late?
               "Mrs. Grant. it is never too late to repent! You remember the serpent of brass
                  that was lifted in the wilderness for the healing of the Israelites, and all who
                  looked upon it were made whole. To save us, Jesus Christ, the Son of
                  God, was nailed to the cross; and all those who will look up to, and believe in
                  him, will surely be saved from endless death."
               I fear it is too late! too late! when remorse comes with the agonies of
                  death!"
               "The dying thief confessed his sin, turned his pleading eyes on his crucified
                  Saviour, and said; 'Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy
                  kingdom.'"
               "On what promise was that hope of pardon based?" the poor creature eagerly
                  demanded.
               "Jesus said unto him: 'Verily I say unto thee, this day shalt thou be with me in
                  paradise,'" was the gentle reply.
               "Lord, I believe! help thou mine unbelief!" feebly gasped Mrs. Grant as she closed
                  her eyes—then a half audible prayer was heard from her lips.
               Faint and exhausted she lay, struggling with mental and physical anguish, while
                  the sympathizing hearts by her side were silently pleading in her behalf.
               At last a ray of hope appeared to brighten her face; she opened her eyes, and
                  faintly whispered:
               "Pray for me! Pray for me!"
               Dr. Clinton saw that the arrow of conviction had entered the stern woman's heart,
                  and falling upon his knees, he plead, in touching and beautiful language, the
                  penitent's cause. Girded with the armor of faith, he fearlessly approached the
                  mercy-seat, and wrestled like Jacob, in prayer, for a blessing on the unhappy
                  woman.
               When he arose her eyes remained closed; no word or motion gave token of life; but
                  her face had relaxed form its rigid look of despair, and assumed a more gentle and
                  quiet expression, which almost assured her anxious attendants that their prayers
                  were heard and answered.
               After a lengthy interval of painful suspense, a deep-drawn sigh escaped from her
                  troubled breast,—then clasping her hands, she exclaimed, with much fervor;
               "'God be merciful to me a sinner!'"
               But the inward struggle had been too great for exhausted nature.
               A small crimson stream began to flow slowly, but with fatal effect, from between
                  the quivering lips.
               Yet with hands clasped, and eyes lifted beseechingly to heaven, the sufferer
                  heeded it not as her heart sent forth the humble publican's prayer:
               "God be merciful to me a sinner!"
               About noon Mrs. Herbert arrived, and gave a favorable account of Mrs. Carlton's
                  condition. Feeling anxious about Lula, and compassion for the lone, friendless
                  invalid, she had come to assist in the arduous duty of nursing. When she entered
                  the sick-room Mrs. Grant recognized her immediately, and offered her had; her lips
                  moved, but no sound was audible save the word.
               "Forgive"—as she clasped Mrs. Herbert's hand, and sought with her eyes the
                  forgiveness she asked.
               "As freely as I hope to be forgiven!" replied Mrs. Herbert, much moved, as she
                  pressed the feeble hand: and tears filled her eyes, as she looked on the sad
                  change which had taken place in that once strong, stern being.
               For the next few days, Mrs. Grant could only speak in monosyllables. She was
                  restless and uneasy, if Lula left the room; and would hold out her hand to the
                  orphan whenever she returned; then with the white slender fingers imprisoned in
                  her coarse, rough palm, which had so often given the stinging blow, she would remain quiet,
                  with her eyes riveted on the fair young face.
               One day she requested Lula to read a chapter form "the previous Bible;" and,
                  occupying the position just described, the following words fell gently and
                  soothingly on the ear of the anxious listener:
               "'Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe in God, believe also in me.
               "'In my Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so I would have told you.
                  I go to prepare a place for you.
               "'And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive your unto
                  myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.
               "'And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.'"
               When the chapter was ended, Mrs. Grant exclaimed, with much feeling:
               "Thank you, thank you, sweet lamb of the flock of Christ! You have
                  made the way clear to me. Go now and send Dr. Clinton to me."
               Soon after this, a messenger was dispatched to the city, and in a short time
                  returned, accompanied by a well-known lawyer, together with several other
                  gentlemen. When Mr. Harris, the attorney, was seated with his writing materials at
                  Mrs. Grant's bedside, she then released her hold of Lula's hand, and said:
               "Leave me for a few moments, dear child; but promise that you will return when I
                  call."
               The promise was readily given; and signing for others to follow Lula from the
                  room, the sick woman was left alone with the man of law.
               Scarcely thirty minutes had elapsed, when the gentlemen were summoned to return
                  and witness the last will and testament of Mrs. Grant. When they entered, she held
                  the sealed document in her hand, and silently directed each one to place his
                  signature upon it. After complying with her request, it was given into Mr.
                  Harris's charge, and its contents were to remain inviolate until some time after
                  the testatrix should be numbered with the dead.
               For nearly a week after this, Mrs. Grant lingered on the threshold of eternity.
                  The grace of God had wrought a thorough reformation in her singular character.
                  Although the nature of her disease prevented any oral evidence of this change of
                  heart, yet her gentleness and fortitude during the last painful days of her
                  illness gave certain manifestation of divine aid.
               The day preceding her death, she expressed a desire to see and bid farewell to her
                  negroes.
               It was hard to say with spirit this unexpected request was received by her
                  degraded subjects; but with becoming gravity they formed themselves into a
                  procession and marched slowly and solemnly thorough her room.
               One by one the sable forms approached the bedside, and the one dreaded mistress
                  meekly offered her hand, and said:
               "Farewell!"
               It is a singular fact, that a death-bed or funeral possesses a peculiar
                  fascination for the negro race; and no distance is too great to deter them from
                  witnessing a scene of this nature. But the present was one to call forth every
                  latent feeling of sympathy, as they gazed for the last time on the breathing
                  though prostrate form of their mistress.
               At the first sight of that face on which death had placed his awful signet, their
                  tears began to flow, and soon the house was filled with sounds of wild and noisy
                  lamentation.
               "Farewell! Forgive my harsh dealings with you. I leave you all in good hands. You
                  will not regret me!" were the last sounds of her failing voice which met their
                  ears.
               Mrs. Grant still clung with special fondness to Lula, as if she were the support of her dying pillow, and a
                  connecting link between earth and heaven; and when the last sad agony was over,
                  and those gray eyes closed on earth forever, that cold, lifeless hand was still
                  held by the affectionate girl, who shed tears of real sorrow for her who had
                  cruelly embittered the first sad years of her lonely orphanage. 
                     
                        And such the child whose early feet
                        The paths of peace have trod;
                        Whose secret heart, with influence sweet,
                        Is upward drawn to God.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               
                  
                     
                        And on that cheek, and o'er that brow
                        So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
                        The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
                        But tell of days in goodness spent,
                        A mind at peace with all below,
                        A heart whose love is innocent.
                     
                  
               
               ANOTHER year has rolled around, and we find Mrs. Herbert and Lula Graham seated in
                  one of the delightful parlors at Belvoir.
               Not one of those rooms kept closed and in Cimmerian darkness to preserve their
                  cheap, gaudy furniture, but one fitted up with substantial elegance and comfort,
                  combined with exquisite taste and refinement.
               On entering this room, the eye will be attracted by a splendid painting of
                  Raphael's faultless "Madonna della Seggiola," with the infant Saviour in her arms.
                  A sweet maternal tenderness is beaming from her soft hazel eyes, as her cheek is
                  fondly pressed to that of her holy child. St. John stands by her side in meek
                  adoration of the infant God, and his look implies: "It is he whose shoes I am not
                  worthy to bear." This painting is supported by a beautiful slab of Parian marble
                  which is resting on the heads of graceful flower-girls in Caryatic attitudes,
                  whose of Italy. At a little distance is seen a copy of Titian's daughter lifting a
                  plate of fruit; in this picture, his peculiar talent for representing the female
                  form, and the magic of his coloring, are developed to the fullest extent. A
                  morning landscape of cattle fording a stream, by Claude Lorraine raine; its warm sky, admirable distances, and the
                  glassy surface of water have often been imitated, but never equaled. There, too,
                  is an exquisite specimen from the pencil of our own poet-painter, Washington
                  Alston, besides others of no ordinary cast. Handsome Svres vases, filled with sweet flowers, were placed on rosewood
                  tables of the Louis Quatorze style; crimson silk
                  curtains were looped back from the open windows, displaying an inner network of
                  richly embroidered lace; a velvet carpet of the same glowing hue as the draperies
                  covered the floor, and gave a character of quiet yet luxurious repose to this
                  favorite parlor. An elegant grand piano-forte, with its long row of glittering
                  pearl keys, and a graceful French harp, often send their cheering notes over the
                  hills and far away.
               A few specimens of exquisite statuary gleamed amid the rich draperies—conspicuous
                  among which, and placed in the recess of one of the large bay-windows, its
                  beauties enhanced by the shading of misty lace,—was the celebrated group by
                  Wickman, of Berlin, "The Fortune-teller," two female figures, models of grace,
                  refinement, and navet, which had been purchased
                  some time before by Mr. Herbert, from the "Exhibition" in London.
               Handsome rosewood etageres were filled with rare oriental curiosities—delicate
                  carvings in ivory, sandal-wood, and mother-of-pearl; and beautiful shells, glowing
                  with all the colors of the rainbow, gathered from the silver strand of the far-off
                  isles in the Indian Sea.
               Other specimens of art and articles of virtu
                  might engage the attention, were it not for the superior attraction of the
                     tableau vivant near the open bay-window.
               Mrs. Herbert, with a calm, sweet face, expressive of dignity and gentleness, is
                  attired in a simple robe of white muslin, with a tiny cap of delicate lace, which
                  rests gracefully on her finely shaped head with its coronal of dark glossy hair.
                  On the table beside her is placed that sine
                  qua non of the Southern matron—a key-basket.
                  Like a full-blown flower she appears, to the budding loveliness of Lula
                  Graham.
               Yet perfectly unconscious of possessing any claims to beauty, sits the orphan
                  girl,—her fair, transparent complexion contrasts exquisitely with the azure tint
                  of her morning dress. Her dark-brown hair is rolled in wavy masses from her broad
                  forehead, and wound in a rich heavy coil at the back of her head. Her sweet mouth
                  is expressive of great sensibility, her nose is finely shaped, and beautifully
                  arched eyebrows and long silken lashes shade deep-blue eyes, which are large and
                  dovelike, with a singular, almost holy expression beaming from their depths. Her
                  form is rather above the medium height, and 
                     
                        Whate'er she does, where'er her steps she bends,
                        Grace on each action silently attends.
                     
                   Altogether there is a peculiar fascination about Lula Graham which few could
                  resist.
               Mrs. Herbert inquires:
               "When does Annie Sunderland's wedding take place?"
               "It is not yet determined, I believe; Dr. Clinton hopes ere long to be able to
                  provide a handsome establishment, and, although Annie cares so little for the
                  luxuries of life, she prefers waiting a few years, rather than encumber him at
                  present with a dowerless bride."
               "Perhaps it is best," was the reply, "for Annie is too young to be burdened with
                  the cares of a household. Yet I should rejoice to see her comfortably settled in
                  life."
               "Mr. and Mrs. Sunderland are strongly opposed to her marrying so early," said
                  Lula; "they insist that she should wait until the doctor has amassed more wealth,
                  and they positively refuse to give their consent until this has been done. Annie
                  is perfectly willing to abide by their decision cision, but Dr. Clinton is importunate, and pleads
                  for an early consummation of his hopes."
               "Love has perhaps blinded his judgment," said the elder lady, with a smile; "I
                  have no doubt that Mr. Sunderland's ideas are correct, and I hope they will
                  respect his opinions and be guide by him in this affair."
               Just then Mr. Herbert and Charlie entered the room. Lula vacated her seat, and
                  invited the former to take her place at his wife's side; then slipping to a table
                  she filled a silver goblet with ice-water and offered it to him.
               "Thank you, darling! This is quite refreshing after a drive through the sun this
                  warm morning. I have been quite busy all day, and unusually excited, consequently
                  I find your attentions doubly acceptable."
               "Charlie, shall I wait on you?" asked Lula, as he threw himself upon the sofa,
                  feigning great weariness.
               "I think you may, Birdie! for I am completely exhausted by my great mental
                  exertion this morning."
               "Why, what can the matter be? I am filled with wonder and anxiety," cried Mrs.
                  Herbert.
               "Oh, I had an intricate law case in hand, which perplexed me beyond measure."
               "What was it? Do let us know the particulars!" exclaimed his mother and Lula in
                  the same breath.
               "Well, last night Mr. Jones's hogs committed trespass on Mr. Smith's garden,
                  completely demolishing his valuable potato crop, besides doing various other
                  damage of a serious nature. Then Mr. Smith's dogs were set on aforesaid hogs, by
                  some person or persons unknown, which dogs, in a vindictive spirit of the lex talionis, made such fearful onslaught on said
                  hogs, that they were all minus one ear, some had 'no ear at all,' while others had
                  their caudal extremities terribly mutilated. On hearing the row, the said Jones
                  armed himself to the teeth, and with murderous thoughts intent, cut short the
                  brilliant career of the finest dog that ever 'treed' a 'possum!. Shocking
                  inhumanity!
               "Knowing that I had but recently returned from the law-school, with my head full
                  of valuable legal lore, they concluded that the fittest and most proper thing to
                  be done was to call on Charles Herbert, Esq., Attorney-at-law, to obtain a redress
                  of grievances."
               "There, there, Charlie!" Mrs. Herbert laughingly cried, "we will not trouble you
                  to go into further details; from appearances, however, we might suppose that your
                  father had been employed to contest the matter with you"
               Mr. Herbert and Lula joined in the laugh, but the young gentleman maintained his
                  gravity.
               "This is certainly a brilliant opening," said Lula, teasingly; "such ample scope
                  and field for talent! but you are annoyed because they scarcely wait for your
                  'sign' to dry before they rush to your office; each party anxious to secure the
                  services of the eminent pleader. They perhaps see in prospective the woolsack and
                  gown, and in you 
                     
                        A Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel!—
                        Oh, wise young judge, how I do honor thee!"
                     
                  
               
               "Enough said; we will close the subject sine
                     die, after that august prophecy, Birdie, and allow father to
                  enlighten you in regard to the real cause of his excitement, which will certainly
                  prove interesting to all concerned."
               "Do let us hear, Mr. Herbert!—I am very impatient," exclaimed his wife,
                  playfully.
               "I am perfectly aware of that fact, my dear, and would have informed you some
                  moments ago, but for Charlie's nonsense!" he remarked, smiling; then added:
               "It is just twelve months since Mrs. Grant died; and to-day, according to her
                  directions, the will was opened and read, and, to my great surprise, I find that
                  she has appointed me one of her executors. Her estate is worth over two hundred thousand dollars, and it will be
                  quite a heavy charge."
               "How singular! Why did she not appoint some of her relatives, or Mr. Harris, who
                  has the management of the estate since her death?" asked Mrs. Herbert.
               "Perhaps she had no relations to whom she cared to intrust her property, as none
                  are mentioned in her will. And I understand that Mr. Grant's daughter died several
                  years ago without issue."
               "Indeed? Who, then, is to inherit her property?"
               "Dr. Clinton, and—Lula Graham!"
               The last name was spoken in a low tone, and only reached the ear of Mrs.
                  Herbert.
               Immediately upon hearing Dr. Clinton's name Lula clasped her hands, and exclaimed,
                  with great joy:
               "Oh! I am so glad, so glad! no one deserved it more!"
               "Why, Birdie! Has your sojourn with Mrs. Grant created in your heart a love of the
                  filthy lucre, that you give such lively demonstrations of delight?" gravely asked
                  Charlie, with a look of sorrowful surprise.
               "No, indeed!—but I was just wishing, as you and Uncle Walter came in, that some
                  kind fairy would reward Dr. Clinton for his many good deeds by presenting him with
                  a beautiful home and countless thousands, so that Annie and he might be made
                  supremely happy," was her reply.
               "It is very commendable and characteristic of your noble and generous nature, thus
                  ever to seek the good of others. But, my dear child, Dr. Clinton does not inherit
                  the whole of Mrs. Grant's estate, but only one-half. The other portion she has
                  bequeathed to one equally deserving."
               "Indeed, uncle! To whom?"
               "To our own precious darling, Lula Graham."
               "To me! Uncle, surely you are jesting?"
               "No, my child; I was never in more serious earnest."
               "It appears incredible! What can I do with so much money?"
               "Dear little Inexperience! buy toys and sugarplums for you and Charlie!" said that
                  young gentleman, laughing, as he came forward—then bowing with great respect, he
                  added:
               "Let me be the first to offer my congratulation to Miss Graham, the heiress!"
               "Oh, Charlie, do spare me, if you please!" she cried; then turning to Mr. Herbert,
                  she said:
               "Uncle, let Dr. Clinton have it all; he needs it! I do
                  not. You are all so very kind, and love me so truly, that I am far happier for
                  being dependent on your bounty!"
               "My daughter, we shall never love you the less for having won this inheritance, as
                  you have, by deeds of kindness and Christian love, which older heads might strive
                  in vain to emulate."
               Mr. Herbert placed his arm around the orphan girl, and kissed her brow; then left
                  the room.
               "May the possession of this wealth, as you have by it so much more power to do
                  good, only incite you to greater acts of Christian charity; and to grow in those
                  graces which have ever been the greatest ornaments of your mind and heart," said
                  Mrs. Herbert, with solemn emphasis, as she folded the child of her adoption to her
                  bosom.
               "Oh, auntie! I feel that I am utterly unworthy of such kindness. If Mrs. Grant had
                  lived, I might have given her some little proof of my gratitude; but I feared, and
                  neglected her so long! Now she will never know how anxious I was to serve her."
                  And tears fell rapidly from the eyes of the gentle girl.
               Charlie looked toward the window to conceal the moisture in his own eyes; but his
                  thoughts seemed suddenly turned into a very different channel as he caught sight,
                     far down upon the sloping lawn,
                  through an opening in the foliage, of an approaching horseman.
               A look of displeasure flitted over his handsome face, as he recognized the
                  visitor; and, turning to Lula, with an effort at playfulness, he said:
               "Fly away, Birdie, to your pretty bower; and remove those tears from your bright
                  eyes! I see your devoted and gallant knight, Alfred Raymond, is seeking your
                  gracious presence. His daily visits are beginning to appear rather ominous!"
               The tone, and searching glance which he bestowed upon her, brought a deep and
                  painful flush to Lula's cheek as she hastily left the room.
               "My dear son, why is it that of late you manifest such dislike to Alfred Raymond?"
                  said his mother, in a tone of grave earnestness, as she seated herself at his
                  side. "Your father and I esteem him highly; and have always considered him your
                  best friend until your return. Have you heard—do you know anything derogatory to
                  his character that should warrant such coldness on your part?"
               "No, mother; nothing! He is the soul of honor—an ornament to society—just and
                  upright in all his dealings. He is worthy of the proudest lady in our land, and
                  his name would confer honor and dignity on any."
               Charlie spoke slowly and gravely; not as one youthful, joyous friend would
                  eulogize another—rejoicing in the praises he was happy in bestowing—but as though
                  this generous admission pained his own noble heart.
               "Well, Charlie—still I do not comprehend; you are a perfect enigma?"
               "Oh, mother! Can you not understand it all? How can you be so blinded? Are you
                  willing to resign Lula into his keeping forever?"
               "Charles! What can you mean?" cried Mrs. Herbert, starting from her seat in great
                  agitation.
               "I mean that Raymond is desperately in love, and he will soon demand Lula's hand
                  in marriage!"
               "Oh, my son, surely you mistake!" exclaimed his mother in painful perplexity.
                  "Why, she is a mere child, and has never dreamed of such a thing! Alfred is too
                  honorable to take advantage of her youth and inexperience, or to abuse our
                  confidence by making such a demand."
               "Bride is seventeen; and if I have not been misinformed, that was my mother's age
                  when she married," said he, with a bow and faint effort at a smile. "I have no
                  fears that Raymond will ever forfeit his claim to our friendship or the character
                  of a gentleman. But he is handsome, brilliant, and clever; just the qualities to
                  fascinate a girl of Lula's ardent temperament. She can appreciate his worth, and
                  will probably reciprocate his attachment. This is the fear that tortures me,
                  mother! and I cannot divest myself of it, and the painful thoughts which are
                  consequent, even in his presence."
               "Perhaps your suspicions are correct as far as Alfred is concerned; but I cannot
                  think that she will ever regard him as a lover."
               At this moment the door-bell rang, and Mr. Raymond was announced.
               Lula had for some time past observed with pain Charlie's unnatural behavior toward
                  Alfred, and now, as she detected something unusual in the manner of her aunt, she
                  was pained and perplexed to interpret its significance.
               "Surely," she thought, "something serious must have occurred (which they are
                  concealing from me), to create this singular and marked change in their conduct.
                  What can it be?"
               This question annoyed the gentle girl extremely, and the thought that they did not
                  confide in her, pained her sensitive nature and east a restraining influence on
                     her own actions which did not escape
                  the vigilant eyes of Mrs. Herbert and Charlie, and was attributed by the later to
                  a far different cause.
               Mr. Herbert was the only member of the family who welcomed their guest with
                  unalloyed pleasure, or who looked upon him without suspicion. He had always been a
                  firm friend of Alfred's, and considered him a young man of no ordinary capacity;
                  therefore, at his earnest solicitation, the visitor consented to dine, and spend
                  the evening at Belvoir.
               Late in the afternoon another guest was added to the hospitable circle. Miss Julia
                  Stanly unexpectedly arrived.
               After kissing Lula, and making every demonstration of delight at meeting her
                  again, Julia said:
               "I have come, darling, to spend the night with you, provided Mrs. Herbert has no
                  objections. I have been so distracted to see you for the past week, that mother
                  concluded rather than I should spoil my eyes forever with crying, she would let me
                  come and persuade you to return with me to-morrow, as it had been such a long time
                  since we had been favored with your charming presence. Where have you buried
                  yourself for these ages past? Brother John says, that if you don't return with me,
                  he will not be able to survive the terrible disappointment. He is wonderfully
                  smitten with you, Lula. I never saw such a taking on!—but, dear me! Don't blush
                  so, darling! I'll not betray your secret!"
               "What secret is it, Miss Julia, that causes such bright roses to bloom on her
                  cheeks?" asked Charlie, eagerly. He had overheard the last remark as she intended
                  he should, although she lowered her voice, and pretended to whisper—a very stage
                  aside.
               "Charlie, you know very well I have no secrets," Lula hastily remarked in great
                  confusion; then turning to Julia, she said:
               "Excuse me for a moment, if you please; I will inform auntie of your arrival."
               Instantaneously, as the lurid lightning from the midnight cloud illumines the
                  darkened landscape, and for a brief space brings it in palpable distinctness to
                  our startled gaze, the thought flashed with all the fiery intensity of her
                  passionate nature upon the mind of Julia Stanly:
               "This is my long sought opportunity! Here is the moment for which I have toiled so
                  unceasingly: now my meek innocence! Let triumph be the
                  the test of power!"
               Wary, yet daring; cool, but surpassingly bold, this schemer from her cradle, she
                  who had been accustomed to plot for the pleasures of a day, stood blandly smiling
                  as she mentally gauged each minute peculiarity of the ingenuous natures before
                  her, and knew that she could mould them like wax in her unscrupulous grasp, and
                  saw each point of her game already won.
               She could scarcely conceal her exultation and delight as these thoughts ranged
                  themselves in her mind, but with admirable dissembling, she sank languidly into a
                  low seat at Charlie's side a few moments after Lula had made her timid exit, and
                  said, with playful and bewitching sweetness:
               "Now, Mr. Herbert! if you will promise me to keep this momentous secret inviolate,
                  I will reward you by imparting it."
               "I am grateful for your kindness, Miss Julia," Charlie answered, rather gravely;
                  "but the affair seems to annoy Lula—and if she does not wish it known, I would
                  prefer to remain in ignorance."
               "You provoking creature! I think it best that you should know it
                     now—as it may save you from embarrassment possibly in the future,
                  or from making some friendly trespass on the rights of others! Lula
                  Graham, I am certain is mortgaged property. Did you not observe her
                     embarrassment barrassment and
                  crimson blush when I mentioned a certain name a few moments ago?"
               Charlie was startled out of all complaisance,—he sprang up indignantly, his dark
                  eyes flashing.
               "Miss Stanly, is this true, or only a surmise?" he exclaimed, in a
                  tone so loud and strange that it attracted the attention of Alfred Raymond, who
                  was then in the midst of an absorbing political discussion with Mr. Herbert, on
                  the opposite side of the room.
               "The fiend is surely plotting some mischief again," thought that young gentleman,
                  as he resumed the conversation.
               "Mr. Herbert, this is but a gentle warning from one who holds your happiness—oh!
                  how sacred!—and whose highest interest would be to serve you. Do you
                  doubt my word?" She spoke in tones of mournful reproach, and her beautiful dark
                  eyes were lifted in tender sadness to his face for one moment, and then cast
                  timidly down, while a tear glistened on the heavily-fringed lid.
               That glance—those words—touched young Herbert's heart as some strange spell. Like
                  a proud war-steed suddenly pierced in some vital part, he sunk to his chair,
                  trembling, powerless, utterly at the mercy of this beautiful schemer.
               Julia Stanly deserves more than a passing notice at our hands. A considerable time
                  has elapsed since we parted from her in the concert-room at Dr. Hall's, and this
                  period has developed more fully that peculiar beauty which then attracted every
                  observer. She is a brilliant brunette, with sparkling black eyes, ruby lips, and
                  luxuriant hair of a midnight hue, cheeks on which the richest tinge of vermilion
                  mingled with its delicate olive, and a form of exquisite proportion, all unite in
                  rendering her a most striking and magnificent woman—one who might have been
                  transported hither from the fervid clime of "Araby the blest."
               She brought the art of dress to perfection. No artist ever studied more
                  assiduously the effects of chiaro'scuro than did she to heighten the beauties and
                  conceal the defects of her person. The most becoming colors were always selected
                  and adjusted with perfect taste and harmony; nothing was ever seen in the ensemble of her toilet to shock the eye or offend the
                  fancy of the most fastidious connoisseur.
               Her mirror had taught her how to smile and how to languish; before its unerring
                  surface she had practiced bewitching graces, heart-piercing glances, and faultless
                  attitudes. And when she condescended to level the whole battery of her charms
                  against some unsuspecting victim, invulnerable must be the heart and stoical the
                  nature which could resist the electric beams, or more dangerous still, the humid
                  softness in the orbs of this star-eyed Georgian.
               Her greatest ambition was to excite admiration and universal homage, the brilliant
                  vista closing, at some "indefinite future time," with the ultimatum of a marriage,
                  combining boundless wealth and an establishment of princely luxury. Consequently,
                  in the fulfillment of two or three of these modest aims, she had directed her
                  attention to-ward Charlie Herbert, as the one who came nearest, in her present
                  field for generalship, to possessing all those essentials which she considered
                  indispensable to her happiness. His wealth and position in society were powerful
                  inducements, and these, linked to his handsome person, intelligence, and rare
                  graces of mind and heart, rendered him a tempting prize in the estimation of the
                  fair Julia.
               But Charlie had not forgotten the prejudices which he had imbibed against her
                  during the school days,—the never-to-be-forgotten examination at Dr. Hall's, and
                  instinctively kept aloof from her influence.
               As the full extent of her treachery was not then known at Belvoir, her visits were tolerated, though she
                  was by no means a favorite.
               To insure the success of her plans, she had pretended a strong attachment to Lula;
                  and since Charlie's return from the law school Julia was frequently an uninvited
                  guest of the Herberts.
               Lula's amiability was often sorely tested by these visits, for her unerring
                  instinct, and a knowledge gained of the girl's character at school in former days,
                  compelled her to doubt the sincerity of Julia's protestations of affection. She
                  was proverbially cold and haughty to others; but of late she was all love and
                  gentleness to the orphan, who, when thus compelled to endure the embrace and
                  receive the kiss, was instinctively reminded of Judas and the divine query:
                  "Friend, wherefore art thou come?"
               Her present visit was the first that had not found Charlie with a pressing
                  engagement, which required his immediate personal attention from
                     home.
               
               Her cunning device in regard to Lula's engagement had so coincided with his
                  suspicions, that while it startled and unnerved his proud heart, it bound him with
                  a mesmeric influence to the side of the beautiful deceiver.
               A short time previously, he had accidentally discovered Raymond's love for
                  Lula—and then his own passion in all its strength, depth, and resistless power
                  revealed itself—when another essayed to rob him of his idol!
               Unconsciously, this love had grown with his growth, and strengthened with his
                  strength, until his heart and soul seemed involved in the fearful struggle.
               Knowing and acknowledging as his generous nature freely did, that Alfred was
                  worthy of Lula in every way, Charlie's high sense of honor forbade any
                  interference—though his own love, like a raging volcano, might over-whelm and
                  destroy every dream of happiness—nay, his very hopes of peace! Had he been more
                  calm—had reason held her wonted sway in that now tumultuous realm of thought, her
                  dauntless powers would have pierced the malignant tissue of falsehood by which she
                  was surrounded and caused it to melt into air.
               But the cause of his sorrow wrought against him; and disdaining to pry into the
                  affairs of those, however dear, who seemed to withhold their confidence, he
                  generously forbore, and like the unhappy, deluded wretch, who seeks to drown his
                  misery at the fountain of Bacchus, he sought in the depths of Julia's bewildering
                  eyes some Lethean balm to soothe his heart in its corroding anguish.
               Well did Julia play her part; not for one moment did she forget herself or the
                  object she had in view. This, the first act in this drama of deception, had been
                  prepared with great skill, and not Mrs. Siddons, in her palmiest days, could have
                  fascinated an audience more completely than did Julia Stanly her solitary devotee,
                  on this eventful evening.
               Finally—and with a touch of consummate skill—she spoke of herself, with no sweet
                  sister's cherishing affection—without a bosom friend among her sex.
               "The world calls me proud and haughty; but oh, it does not know how my heart
                  yearns for love and sympathy! I would freely sacrifice wealth and all its
                  benefits, for the fond and pure devotion of one true heart. I would be content if
                  Lula returned more fully my sincere affection to her; but I have tried in vain to
                  win her to forget and forgive. I fear she remembers too seriously some of our
                  childish disagreements, ever to reciprocate my affection with warmth. If humility
                  and remorse could atone for the follies of the past, or bitter tears through
                  sleepless nights could blot out its painful memory, then do I deserve absolution
                  and a place in her heart!"
               She spoke so humbly!—and her dark eyes flashed in their crystal depths, while drops like melted
                  diamonds sparkled on the silken lashes.
               The artful spider is weaving imperceptibly the gossamer web around her unconscious
                  victim; and time must show whether the wisdom and prudence of Charlie Herbert can
                  resist the cunning wiles of the beautiful enchantress.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII
               
                  
                     
                        I know a maiden fair to see;
                        Take care!
                        She can both false and friendly be;—
                        Beware! Beware!
                        Trust her not,
                        She is fooling thee.
                     
                  
               
               THE sweet Southern breeze, laden with the exquisite perfume of the olea fragrans, floated softly over the beautiful
                  grounds at Belvoir, as figures were seen quietly strolling through the winding
                  walks,—occasionally hidden from view by the drooping boughs of the wild
                  olive-trees, whose varnished leaves glistened with silvery sheen as they reflected
                  the moon's mellow radiance.
               Gay voices, rippling laughter, and "snatches of sweet song," enlivened the evening
                  stillness, as the youthful promenaders lingered on the fairy scene. At length one
                  couple fell behind the other, loitered apart; and finally entered a pavilion
                  belonging to the grounds, beneath the sequestered shadow of a group of grand old
                  oaks. The graceful architecture of this structure seemed fashioned from some
                  oriental temple, with its octagonal form, airy columns, and slender minaret,
                  towering high above the pagoda roof. In the enchanting hour of radiant moonlight,
                  we might almost fancy some magician's hand had transported hither a miniature
                  mosque from the "Gem of the Orient" where the Golden Horn winds through the city,
                  and terminates in the Valley of "Sweet Waters." From the encircling galleries, one
                  almost listened for the muezzin—shouting his
                  "Mashallah! Mashallah!" No devout
                  Mussulman ever worshiped his God more fervently than did Alfred Raymond the lovely
                  girl who sat beside him.
               With trembling eagerness, he whispered into the ear of the astonished orphan girl
                  the history of his great love, as though life itself depended on the issue.
               She knew, from the quivering lips, from the icy clasp of his hand, and the varying
                  color on his cheek, that every word he uttered came from his heart, in the depths
                  of its first and passionate love.
               When the full moon, which for a moment had veiled its radiance in a silver mist,
                  shone forth again in its glorious splendor, the sweet face of Lula Graham was
                  bathed in tears.
               "Oh, Alfred," she exclaimed, "I do not merit such love as this—I am unworthy to
                  fill the place you have given me in your noble heart! Yet I cannot endure the
                  thought that you should cast me entirely off, but as a brother would cherish a
                  sister, let me still claim a place in your regard. Do not seek a nearer tie! and
                  do not waste a sigh of regret on one so greatly your inferior!" She paused
                  briefly; then continued:
               "Another and a far worthier heart will soon beat for you, and your last love will
                  be happier than the first."
               "Lula! I have been too abrupt—I see I have startled you by this rash avowal—wait!
                  You are not now prepared to answer me. And, ah! deliberate, earnestly, before you
                  doom me to life-long misery! Mine is no way-ward fancy! Assumed to-day, and thrown
                  aside to-morrow. Heaven is my witness that never since I first met you as a little
                  child, has a day or hour passed that this love did not reign paramount in my
                  heart. Your eyes like load-stars have guided me through the perilous journey of
                  youth; the truth and purity that shone from them have restrained me when
                  temptation and danger threatened to blight the hopes of a sainted mother for her
                  only child. Your influence, Lula, has caused me to be esteemed, and
                  fitted me to occupy an honorable position among my fellow-men. Jacob never toiled
                  so faithfully for Rachel as I have to become worthy of you. Let me go on toiling
                  and hoping, but, oh! my darling! do not doom me to despair. If you but wish, I
                  will surmount every difficulty—climb to the loftiest height in the temple of fame,
                  that I may place you above the proudest in the land. All—everything—that human
                  power can do to promote your happiness, I will do, if you will but smile upon my
                  efforts, and your love is given to cheer and strengthen me through life."
               He paused; and with suspended breath awaited the doubtful sentence.
               "Oh, Alfred! I wish that you had spared me this bitter trial! Let a sister's
                  constant unselfish love suffice. I cannot think of you otherwise than as the
                  dearest and best of brothers; my heart claimed you as such when we first met as
                  orphans, and never since that hour have I felt destitute of a brother's care and
                  protection. Do not destroy this sweet illusion! strive to forget what you have
                  said! and let us maintain the same happy relationship which has ever existed
                  between us. In after-years, when you meet with one more worthy of your noble
                  heart, you will thank me for this momentary disappointment, of which it pains me
                  far more to cause you the suffering than you can ever know."
               As she concluded, her soft eyes, with the truthful, earnest soul beaming through
                  them, sought the face of her discarded lover.
               For an instant Raymond gazed with speechless agony into those pleading eyes; then
                  bowed his head upon the railing, as if to still the pangs of his bleeding heart.
                  The cherished hopes of years were suddenly blasted, "his idol had vanished, his
                  earth-star fled."
               
               As one amid some fairy vision is rudely awakened to find himself alone upon the
                  billows of a raging sea, without one ray of hope, he yielded to his fate in mute
                  despair. So long and so motionless did he remain in this attitude of despondent
                  grief, that the silence became insupportable, and each moment was adding to the
                  pain and terror of Lula. She softly murmured his name—but he did not respond.
                  Again she spoke in trembling tones:
               "Alfred, dear Alfred! will you not speak, and say that you forgive me for causing
                  you this distress? I might possibly have prevented it had I suspected your
                  intentions; but indeed I did not until this evening imagine that you would ever
                  honor me so highly! Speak, dear Alfred, say that you will not refuse me a sister's
                  place in your noble and generous heart?"
               After a long interval he raised his pale, haggard face; then seizing one of her
                  hands, pressed it frantically to his lips, and in a husky, unnatural voice
                  said:
               "Lula, my darling! pardon me for presuming in my mad folly to occupy a nearer and
                  dearer place in your affections than the one you offer! I will strive to conquer
                  this hopeless love—and may God help me to endure the painful ordeal, and in
                  boundless mercy forgive me, that I have worshiped the creature more than the
                  Creator. I must seek in some distant scene to forget the delightful visions which
                  have made a paradise of my Southern home; now its shining portals seem closed
                  against me forever! the home that knew me shall know me no more, until I can
                  return and find in my heart for you only the calm, disinterested love of a
                  brother. I know too well your gentle, truthful heart to doubt now the nature of
                  your affection for me. I know you will never be indifferent to my welfare, and
                  will pray that peace and happiness may dwell again in this crushed and bleeding
                  heart." Then rising, he concluded:
               "Until your petition is granted, beloved one, farewell! My darling, my angel, my
                  lost one, farewell!"
               He stood for an instant trembling in every nerve, then convulsively folded the
                  frightened girl in his arms, and kissing her again and again, he released her and
                  rushed from the pavilion.
               Charlie and Julia had been for some time searching for the fugitives, and at last,
                  attracted by the sound of voices, had approached their retreat—when suddenly,
                  through a broad opening in the shrubbery, Charlie Herbert witnessed the tender
                  embrace and passionate farewell.
               With a heart bounding wildly in its conflicting emotions, he stood for one instant
                  tranfixed—spell-bound—then hurried his companion to a distant portion of the
                  grounds, just before Raymond had made his hurried exit.
               Lula escaped unseen into the house, and rushing into Mrs. Herbert's presence,
                  threw her arms around her neck, and with her throbbing head pillowed upon the
                  bosom of that dear friend, who had so often soothed her childish sorrows, she wept
                  as if her heart would break.
               Mrs. Herbert was filled with alarm at this singular out-burst of feeling, and
                  endeavored by gentle caresses and affectionate entreaty to find some clew to her
                  distress. But the convulsive sobs which threatened to rend the troubled breast
                  were her only response.
               At last, after many fruitless attempts to suppress her tears, she said:
               Oh, auntie! I am so unhappy! Alfred has gone—gone perhaps never to return! Lide me
                  from Charlie and Julia, for indeed I cannot brook their looks of wonder and
                  inquiry, should they witness my unconquerable distress to-night; besides, my head
                  is aching dreadfully."
               Mrs. Herbert saw that this was all true, and after accompanying the poor girl to
                  her chamber, she left her for a few
                  moments in order to make the necessary apology to her guest.
               On entering the parlor, she found Julia standing beneath the full blaze of the
                  chandelier, radiant with beauty and animation, while she conversed with all her
                  matchless power of brilliancy and fascination.
               Charlie stood near, apparently entranced, gazing on the bewildering creature, as
                  would a connoisseur on the entrancing creation of some painter's or sculptor's
                  dream.
               He seemed unconscious of the words that fell from her coral lips, or indeed of
                  aught else save the presence of the syren.
               Mrs. Herbert hastened to inform them that Lula was suffering intensely with
                  headache, and was unable to appear again in the parlor during the evening.
               "Why, mother, this is a very unexpected announcement! She appeared quite well
                  after tea. Where is Alfred?" eagerly demanded Charlie.
               "Alfred left before you returned to the house, my son," was the gentle reply; then
                  turning to her guest, Mrs. Herbert said:
               "Lula required my attention, I regret exceedingly to be compelled to leave you,
                  but hope you will pardon my detention."
               "Certainly; but dear Mrs. Herbert, do let me go to my sweet friend! mother says I
                  am an excellent nurse, do let me go, for I shall be miserable until I know that
                  she is relieved."
               "Thank you, but I must decline your offer, as I shall remain with her." was the
                  unmoved reply; then Mrs. Herbert added:
               "Lizzie is in the vestibule and will attend you to your apartment whenever you
                  wish to retire."
               "Oh! do let us remain here awhile, and then you can send word how the poor darling
                  is; for I shall not be able to sleep for an instant unless I hear that she is at
                  rest," was the artful rejoinder.
               This conversation had partially restored Charlie from his bewilderment.
                  Notwithstanding Julia's dazzling charms, he could not be indifferent to Lula for
                  one moment when he knew that she was suffering; he sighed to be alone that he
                  might commune with his own heart and still its conflicting emotions. Julia heard
                  that sigh, and believing it to be the feeble cry of an aching heart burdened with
                  unrequited love, she recklessly resolved to sunder another link in the chain that
                  bound him to her rival.
               With tenderest pity she said:
               "Poor dear Lula! how gladly would I share her suffering if it were possible!" then
                  after an interval she continued in tones of dulcet gentleness:
               "Do you know, Mr. Herbert, that until the assertion was positively denied by
                  herself, I was convinced that you were devotedly attached to each other, and"
                  (with the daintiest hesitation and timidity) "probably engaged? I have frequently
                  bantered Lula on this subject, and once asked her how it was possible
                  for her to have resisted the temptation of falling in love with one whom
                     I considered so much superior to other gentlemen of our
                  acquaintance? And the artless girl replied that 'Charlie was a dear, good brother,
                  but much too frivolous for a lifetime companion!' I exclaimed against
                  such puritanical taste, in one so young particularly, and replied that 
                     
                        A little nonsense now and then,
                        Was relished by the wisest men."
                     
                  
               
               "I thank you, Miss Julia, for your kind defense, and for enlightening me in regard
                  to the true nature of her esteem! Had I been apprised of it at an earlier day,
                  perhaps I might have been more successful in conforming to her fastidious tidious ideas of manly perfection!" he
                  said in an agitated voice, and making a sad attempt to smile.
               "Lula is a dear, affectionate creature, but somewhat peculiar," said Miss Julia,
                  patronizingly. "I rather think she admires the proud and stately manner of Mr.
                  Raymond. Others think very differently of you, Mr. Herbert!" and her
                  starry eyes were lifted timidly to his face.
               "You have succeeded admirably in your attempts to soothe my wounded vanity, Miss
                  Julia, and I shall endeavor to merit the good opinion, in future, with which you
                  are so kind as to favor me," he replied, with a great effort to appear calm and
                  indifferent.
               Alas, poor Charlie! that you should suffer this cunning sorceress to poison your
                  heart against the gentle Lula, whose truth and purity, through childhood and
                  youth, you deemed almost rivaling the angels in heaven.
               But could he have been deceived, possibly? (and he was startled at the import of
                  these thought). Had not his excessive love blinded him to defects which were now
                  made so glaring by the disinterested and timely interference of Julia? had she not
                  gently warned him that the object of his affection was the betrothed of another?
                  and was not this assertion proven beyond a doubt? Had not his own eyes witnessed
                  Raymond's passionate adieu, which none but an accepted lover would have dared to
                  bestow? That instant's glance toward the pavilion had stamped upon his memory a
                  scene which had destroyed his last hope,—which would ever rise, specter-like,
                  between him and happiness, changing the sweet spring-time of anticipation to the
                  winter of despair.
               Julia's humble confession and evident remorse for her girlish indiscretions
                  appealed strongly to his generous heart, and prepared him to be sacrificed, a
                  ready victim to her unscrupulous vanity and ambition.
               At this moment the bewildering maze of our hero's contemplations templations was
                  broken by the entrance of Lizzie, the attendant, who said:
               "Miss Stanly, as it is getting quite late, mistress thinks perhaps you would like
                  to retire."
               This was a hint that could not possibly be misunderstood, so throwing as much
                  tenderness into her manner as the occasion permitted, she bade Charlie an
                  elaborate "Good night," and followed the servant from the room.
               When about to ascend the stairs, she discovered suddenly that something had been
                  forgotten, and requested Lizzie to wait there until she could return for the
                  missing article.
               When she re-entered the parlor, Charlie was leaning his head on his arm, which
                  rested upon the mantle, both attitude and expression indicative of the deepest
                  despondency; and gliding to his side, she said, in accents of sweetest
                  tenderness:
               "Mr. Herbert, it is beyond measure distressing to me to see you thus dejected.
                  What can I do to charm away the gloom? Let me assure you that there is ONE warm
                  and faithful heart that can appreciate you!"
               "Thank you, thank you, dear Miss Stanly!" was the reply, in agitated tones, as he
                  turned—and her brilliant beauty again met his dazzled eyes. And then—poor deluded
                  Charlie grasped her jeweled hand and pressed it to his lips.
               A triumphant smile illumined her face, as she returned the warm pressure of his
                  hand. Then, after another whispered "Good night and happy dreams!" she glided from
                  his sight.
               She ascended the broad stairs and crossed the hall, the floor of which was a
                  mosaic-work of polished wood, and entered the elegant apartment prepared for her;
                  then casting her eyes around with a satisfied air, she sank into a luxurious
                  arm-chair before the mirror, and commenced to release from their confinement the lustrous black
                  locks, while Lizzie adjusted the rich lace curtains, which fell in graceful folds
                  to the floor.
               "Can I assist you, Miss Stanly?" said the well-trained servant, who had previously
                  arranged the room, and prepared everything with reference to the comfort of the
                  guest.
               "No, I thank you! I will not detain you. However, tell me about Lula before you
                  go?"
               "Mistress said that she was still suffering with her head, ma'am."
               "You all seem to be very fond of Miss Lula?" was the rejoinder.
               "Oh yes, ma'am! everybody loves her, they can't help it—she is so kind and good!
                  Why, ma'am, the old folks down at the plantation says that when she goes into
                  their houses, they feel like falling down to worship her; that 'tis the presence
                  of an angel!"
               "I don't wonder that you should love her, indeed. She is a dear, sweet creature,
                  and I hope she will be quite well by morning. Good night, Lizzie!"
               As the girl left the room and closed the door, a smile of supreme contempt curled
                  the lips of the proud beauty, and she thus gave vent to her thoughts:
               "An angel, forsooth! Well, when I am Mrs. Charles Herbert—whom I
                  intend to be very soon—this angel will be shorn of her wings, I
                  fancy, and ejected from this paradise! A pretty scene, truly, she has gotten up
                  here to-night, only because she was vexed at Charlie's devotion to me. This is not
                  the first time I have defeated her plans; and if I mistake not, she will have many
                  a heartache, as well as headache, ere we arrive at a final settlement. Her sweet
                  baby face is no match for Julia Stanly's regal beauty; these starlit eyes have
                  done me good service to-night! And Master Charlie has avoided me, heretofore, to
                  no purpose."
               She stood gazing admiringly into the mirror, toying with the night-like hair,
                  which fell in shining waves far below her girdle; then continued her
                  soliloquy:
               "What matter is it to me, if Madame la Mere does
                  conduct herself toward me like an imperial iceberg? A little more tact, a little
                  more generalship, will thaw her frigidity; for Charlie is her
                  darling, and then I will wield the scepter in my own fair hands. Then this
                  unfledged foundling may say: 
                     
                        Farewell happy fields!
                        Where joy forever dwells,
                     
                   and gladly seek refuge with Alfred Raymond, or some other love-sick swain—I
                  care not who or where, while she sighs to leave the paradise, 
                     
                        —these happy walks and shades,
                        Fit haunt of gods;
                     
                   where she fondly hoped to spend her days in luxury and elegance, which would
                  have contented Cleopatra or the Queen of Sheba!
               "But I must not dim the brightness of these eyes, nor pale the roses on these
                  cheeks, by keeping this midnight vigil before the mirror; so I will to bed and
                  dream of Charlie and his handsome—fortune!
               
               "Another day at Belvoir, and my fortune is made!"
               
               When Mrs. Herbert returned to Lula's chamber, she found the poor girl had wept
                  herself really ill, and was resting her head upon a table, while her hands tightly
                  pressed the throbbing temples. Notwithstanding Mrs. Herbert's anxiety in regard to
                  this distress, she acted with her usual discretion and forbearance, and made no
                  further inquiry in relation to its cause.
               She raised the drooping head and kissed the heated brow; then gently brushing back
                  the soft hair, said:
               
               "My darling, you must let me prescribe for this dreadful pain. You will be much
                  more comfortable in a recumbent position, and then a few cold applications will
                  soon drive the heat from your head."
               Lula submitted passively to the gentle hands which assisted in disrobing her, and
                  was soon resting on the luxurious couch while Mrs. Herbert bathed her burning
                  forehead. At last the tears ceased to flow, and the look of pain left her lovely
                  face. The kind nurse saturated a napkin with iced water, and placed it softly over
                  the brow and closed eyes; then taking the Bible from its stand, she read a
                  selection from its sacred page, and, kneeling, she prayed that divine assistance
                  might be vouchsafed the sufferer to support her in every trial, that it might
                  guide her in difficulties and sustain her in sorrow,—and commended her to the care
                  and protection of her Heavenly Father and his beloved Son.
               When the prayer was ended, Lula raised her tearful eyes, and throwing her arms
                  affectionately around Mrs. Herbert's neck, said:
               "Dear auntie, I feel so much better! You are so patient with my weakness, so
                  lenient toward my faults—never chiding, but always so gentle and affectionate. How
                  can I ever repay your kindness?"
               "By striving always to maintain the same loving, unselfish soul, the same pure and
                  guileless motives, which have endeared you to every heart, my darling!"
               "My dear auntie! you all think far better of me than I deserve. You do not know
                  how many sinful, wicked thoughts find entrance to my heart! I often despair of
                  conquering them, for their name is legion. And it pains me to think that I am
                  acting a falsehood by passing for more than my real worth.
               "But, ah! my suffering to-night should go far to subdue any feeling of gratified
                  vanity I may have had at possessing the good opinion of others who persist in
                  endowing me with imaginary qualities to which I have no right or title. Even
                  Alfred, who is so good and noble, was laboring under the same delusion, when he
                  offered me his hand and heart, asking me to guide him through life, and ascribing
                  to me his success and high position in society.
               "Auntie! I shall never, never forget his ghastly face and look of intense anguish
                  when I refused that kind and generous heart."
               A remembrance of the trying scene completely unnerved her, and again she wept
                  bitterly.
               When she was sufficiently composed to relate the details of her interview with
                  Alfred Raymond, Mrs. Herbert could not wonder at the effect produced upon the
                  sensitive and affectionate girl.
               Although it was painful in the extreme,—nay, even alarming to contemplate the
                  serious consequences which might ensue to the character of Alfred from this
                  rejection, yet Mrs. Herbert could not but feel a weight lifted from her heart, as
                  a sigh of relief escaped her, to know that her darling was still her own; and for
                  the present, at least, safe from the influence of a handsome, fascinating
                  lover.
               Mrs. Herbert found it necessary to administer an opiate before the troubled heart
                  would still its tumultuous throbbing, or the quivering nerves calm themselves in
                  sleep.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIV.
               
                  
                     
                        What is a fair or noble face
                        If the mind ignoble be?
                        What though beauty, in each grace,
                        May her own resemblance see!
                        Eyes may catch from heaven their spell,
                        Lips the ruby's light recall;
                        In the Home for love to dwell
                        One good feeling's worth them all.
                     
                  
               
               THE tinkling of the silver breakfast-bell summoned the party to the table, where
                  the aromatic fumes of Mocha coffee from the hissing urn, the light steaming rolls
                  and muffins, the tender steaks and plump broiled chickens, swimming in their rich
                  sauces, besides various other concomitants, were mingled in generous profusion,
                  the sight of which was enough to fill an epicure with delight, and compel an
                  anchorite to forswear his cell. It was a bright, cheerful-looking room, with its
                  glittering array of china, silver, and glass, notwithstanding that without, the
                  rain pattered against the windows and flowed in crystal streams down the
                  plate-glass, while dark leaden clouds veiled the sky.
               Lula's absence was dwelt upon and regretted in terms of tenderest hyperbole by the
                  fair Julia, who, glancing through the window at the increasing rain said:
               "I doubly regret that she should be forced to play the rle of invalid to-day; for, dear Mrs. Herbert, judging from external
                  appearances, I shall be obliged to trespass still longer on your delightful
                  hospitality, as mamma will consider the day too inclement to send out for me."
               "It certainly is; and furthermore, we never allow a guest to leave our house when
                  the weather is so unpropitious," was the courteous reply.
               "We are threatened with imprisonment for the day," said Mr. Herbert; "but with the
                  assistance of music and books you may probably escape a dangerous attack of
                     ennui, that dreary but fashionable
                  malady."
               "As I am not often annoyed by such visitants, I think it probable I shall escape
                  entirely to-day, as my captivity will be shared by such unexceptionable company as
                  Mr. Herbert and family."
               "Thank you, Miss Julia! You are recognized as a lady of superior taste, therefore
                  we must value your graceful compliment accordingly. I shall not doubt your
                  capacity for endurance after that pretty speech."
               Charlie sat moodily stirring his coffee, without any apparent desire to
                  participate in the luxuries of the table or to join in the conversation, when he
                  was aroused by his father, who said:
               "My son, have you read that new romance, by a country-woman of ours, which has
                  caused a furore throughout the country?"
               "Yes, father, and its perusal has given me great pleasure," replied the young man,
                  his animation, in a measure, returning with this genial theme. "It is the effusion
                  of a noble-hearted woman—one who has passed through some fiery ordeal and come
                  forth refined as pure gold. The language is chaste and elegant, beautiful in its
                  simplicity, without bombast or pedantry, yet charming in its practical reasoning.
                  You feel, while reading it, that you are in the presence of one whom to know would
                  be to love. None could read that book without desiring to become a better man or
                  woman. I am sure the writer had some nobler object in view than a mere desire for
                  empty fame when she launched her lone bark upon the uncertain waves, for faith and
                  hope are inscribed upon the pennon at its mast, and appeal irresistibly to the reader's heart.
                  Unconsciously the better feelings of our nature are brought into play, while the
                  involuntary promptings of your heart compel you to offer a helping hand, and bid
                  her 'God speed' in her noble work."
               "I am truly rejoiced to hear you speak so highly of this work, for if young people
                  must indulge in light literature, let it be something which will tend to elevate
                  their thoughts, refine their natures, and call forth the ennobling qualities of
                  their hearts."
               "By whom was this book written?" asked Mrs. Herbert.
               "The publishers have baffled every attempt of the curious to discover the name of
                  the fair authoress, saying it was her particular desire to remain incognito. Suspicion, however, rests strongly on a
                  young friend of ours."
               "Indeed! I cannot imagine any young friend of ours who could have been thus
                  successful in so arduous an enterprise, nor one whose talents would warrant my
                  attributing to her the authorship of a work which has been such a decided
                  success."
               "Yes, mother! you do know one who is capable of doing all this—nay, who has done
                  it. But her modest, unassuming grace, her refined taste in manner and appearance,
                  have shielded her from that odious sobriquet, bas
                     bleu,—a term derisively applied to all ladies who have any literary
                  proclivities. But as this fair authoress shrinks from public gaze, we will respect
                  her wishes, and trespass no further upon her secret."
               "My son, I am completely mystified! You have almost led me to think that it was
                  written by Lula or Annie, so enthusiastic are your encomiums—but in either case it
                  seems impossible."
               "Or perchance Miss Julia has concluded to come to the rescue of Southern
                  literature," said Mr. Herbert, gallantly, bowing to his fair guest; "and will lend
                  her redoubtable aid to release us from the cruel animadversions so frequently cast
                  upon us by the Northern press."
               "Indeed, no! I am far too shrinking and timorous to undertake such a crusade,—it
                  is not my sphere. The brightest vision of my ambition is not to stand
                  in the world's broad glare a second 'Corinne,' but to dwell simply a modest
                  priestess at the shrine of home; my chosen pleasure, the keeping ever pure and
                  bright its sacred altar-fires, to make that home the 'dearest spot of earth,' by
                  cultivating such graces and accomplishment as will add to the comfort and
                  happiness of its treasured circle."
               The beaming look of admiration which Charlie cast upon the beautiful speaker—more
                  eloquent than words—showed how cordially he approved her truly feminine sentiment.
                  And although his parents, from a more intimate knowledge of her character, might
                  possibly have questioned the genuineness of these charming assertions, they were
                  too thoroughly well-bred to manifest aught save the most unhesitating faith in
                  them. Mr Herbert remarked:
               "That speech is worthy of Lucretia! Such aims are highly commendable, and deserve
                  the respect and admiration of every sensible person. One might almost suppose,
                  Miss Stanly, that you had been tutored by a Roman matron, to have thus imbibed
                  such rigid ideas of woman's true vocation, and I doubt not you have uttered the
                  heart felt sentiments of the majority of Southern ladies. Still, the iron hand of
                  circumstance sometimes converts, with its stern touch, this beautiful trait of
                  timid worth into the most unhesitating and self-forgetful courage. Necessity
                  sometimes compels a woman to assume a career repugnant and distasteful to her
                  exalted ideas of shrinking delicacy, in order to obtain the 'mere material things'
                  requisite to build up that sweet shrine of home to which you pay so graceful a tribute, and which is so dear to every
                  true heart; or perhaps to supply the helpless and unfortunate belonging to its
                  circle with the very staff of life. Should such duties accrue, I know of no class,
                  in my widely-extended field of observation, who are more capable or more willing
                  to make this peculiar sacrifice than the educated women of the South."
               "While I extol Miss Stanly's admirable sentiments, I must concur with you, father,
                  in believing it obligatory upon women sometimes to sacrifice their inclination in
                  this peculiarity to duty. The book which we were just discussing, I consider an
                  illustration of this principle. I insist that it was penned by some devoted,
                  unselfish wife, sister, or mother, in behalf of loved ones whom she is striving to
                  exalt in the social scale, or to shield from the withering touch of want or
                  care."
               "If such be the case, it is the duty of every Christian to assist and encourage
                  her in the noble work. To show my own appreciation of her praiseworthy effort, I
                  will order immediately a dozen copies of the book for distribution among our
                  friends."
               "Thank you, father, for this evidence of your reliance on my judgment. I think
                  after a careful perusal of the work you will still acknowledge yourself her
                  debtor."
               After the conclusion of the meal, Mr. Herbert invited Julia into the library to
                  inspect some foreign engravings which he had recently received. Charlie was about
                  to follow, when a word from his mother caused him to resume his chair. She then
                  asked:
               "By whom was that book written, my son?"
               "If you will read it, mother, there will be no necessity for me to inform you!
                  Instinctively you will be convinced that it is the work of Annie Sunderland."
               "May Heaven bless her noble heart!" ejaculated Mrs. Herbert, her eyes filling
                  tears at the thought of the unselfish spirit of the gentle, loving heart, which
                  could thus nerve itself with Spartan strength, and battle alone with the world to
                  serve her orphan brother.
               She then added, with much feeling:
               "Charlie, the commendation which you bestowed so lavishly on that book, just now,
                  I thought too extravagant; but if Annie is the authoress, your praise was
                  extremely meager."
               "It was indeed; particularly when we consider the motive she had in view."
               "I know that it is some noble, generous impulse, induced by her desire to promote
                  the interest of her brother, but I cannot realize its nature, since her previous
                  exertions have already placed him in a lucrative situation."
               "You know his scholastic duties were suspended for want of funds, and refusing
                  assistance from her friends, she placed him in Mr. Harding's mercantile
                  establishment. Yesterday I heard that gentleman say, he wished to employ another
                  clerk, as Harry Sunderland would leave at an early day to commence his collegiate
                  course."
               "Then it is to Annie alone that he is indebted for the privilege of those
                  advantages? May God reward her labors! 'Many daughters have done wisely, but thou
                  excellest them all.'"
               They arose from the table, and were leaving the room, when a heavy sigh from
                  Charlie arrested his mother's attention.
               "Charlie, what is the meaning of that sigh? Are you still jealous of Raymond?" she
                  smilingly asked.
               "No, mother, not jealous; but I am miserable! Deceived, betrayed, by one who wears
                  the semblance of an angel!" he replied in accents of bitter sadness.
               "My son, appearances are often deceptive. Be sure that you do not condemn a friend
                  unheard, or give credence to the voice of detraction, particularly if it comes
                     to you through a medium whose
                  honesty of purpose you have ever had cause to doubt."
               "Mother, I have seen enough convince me that the warning which I received from a
                  disinterested person was given solely through motives of friendship to me, and
                  without any desire to traduce the character of others. Although thus forewarned, I
                  was utterly unprepared for the cruel blow; it came with fatal force, and left my
                  wretched heart well-nigh broken. Oh, mother! I do not hesitate to tell you how
                  helpless and faint I was with the evidence of this terrible treachery before me!
                  And the gentle, delicate sympathy of Julia Stanly fell like soothing balm upon my
                  wounded spirit!" Then he added:
               "Perhaps through her instrumentality the wound may heal, but the scar will ever
                  remain to remind me of the subtle blow dealt by an enemy under friendship's
                  smiling mask."
               "Charlie! you are certainly non compos mentis. I
                  feel provoked beyond endurance at this folly. Surely you are not silly enough to
                  be deluded by the arts and blandishments of heartless girl, and one too whose
                  character is so well understood?'
               "Mother, how can you repeat this? She has been basely traduced."
               "My son, beware of the syren's protean wiles! They are 
                     
                        —mere decoys
                        Trepanning seamen with their tuneful voice,
                     
                   and their machinations are always very nicely adapted to the temper and
                  inclination of the victim. No acquaintance of this beautiful girl can prove by
                  word, deed, or action, that she is otherwise than false, designing, and
                  selfish!"
               "Mother, I think you are cruelly prejudiced; characters often change materially;
                  some degenerate, but hers has perfected nobly. I must say, however, that she has
                  never received justice in this house. All I ask, in conclusion, is
                  that you observe her impartially, and you will find her not only worthy of my
                  admiration, but of yours also."
               "Charlie, surely you have not arrived at man's estate without learning to
                  distinguish pure gold from its counterfeit, although the worthless metal may
                  assume for a time the brilliancy of the genuine! I had given you credit for more
                  discrimination. At a proper time and place, I will explain a certain affair d'amour, which may probably change the tenor of
                  your meditations. In the mean time go and ask the fair enchantress to sing for you
                  that celebrated little ballad, 'The Spider and the Fly,'" she laughingly concluded
                  as the servant entered to remove the breakfast service.
               Mrs. Herbert, with a singular feeling of depression, ascended the stairs, and
                  directed her steps toward Lula's chamber. Charlie entered the parlor, and seating
                  himself at a table, he turned listlessly the leaves of an illustrated volume of
                  Shakspeare.
               Soon approaching footsteps were heard, and then Mr. Herbert's voice, saying:
               "Walk into the parlor, Miss Stanly; I think you will find Mrs. Herbert already
                  there, so I shall not hesitate to leave you in her care while I look over the
                  morning papers; be sure I will be able to render a faithful chronicle of marriages
                  and deaths, or other items of gossip for your especial delectation, when I return
                  to the parlor."
               Julia was agreeably surprised at finding Charlie alone. By his invitation she
                  seated herself at this side, Shakspeare was again resorted to, and Charlie
                  descanted eloquently of the immortal bard 
                     
                        On whose forehead climb
                        The crowns of the world!
                     
                   striving to rouse, and interest himself with "a feast of reason" spread by his fair enslaver; hoping thereby
                  to test the power of her colloquial gifts, and prove that her mind was as lovely
                  as her person.
               But he was destined to be baffled. Julia Stanly was far too great an adept in the
                  art of concealing her deficiencies to be thus unwarily decoyed into a field so
                  open, where the very first manœuvres would have resulted in her utter
                  discomfiture.
               Shakspeare she knew had written plays or poems of some kind, but whether he was
                  the author of Hudibras of the Lady of Lyons, a "Divine Comedy," or Gertrude of
                  Wyoming, she could not possibly have told.
               Therefore assuming an air of utter dejection, she suddenly appeared like a fair
                  lily drooping after a storm; with her eyes cast down, her white hands clasped, she
                  continued to gaze abstractedly on the carpet. So very miserable and woe-begone was
                  her appearance, that Charlie's compassionate heart was moved to painful
                  degree.
               He closed the book hastily, but the movement did not arouse her, just then a
                  tear-drop glistened and lingered upon the jetty lashes; she raised her head and
                  met his tender, inquiring glance.
               Poor Charlie! have you forgotten the fifth commandment and its wholesome
                  inculcations? that willful disobedience certainly will bring punishment?
               And why not obey literally your anxious mother's injunction and bid the charmer
                  sing the "Spider and the Fly?" for mentally she breathes the witching lay. We must
                  not anticipate, but will content ourselves with watching the artful girl as she
                  spreads her net and softly says:
               "Mr. Herbert, will you kindly pardon my inattention? I am so deeply mortified when
                  I review my conduct toward you last evening, and think of the illiberal
                  construction you may place upon it, that I can think of nothing else, until I
                  offer an apology and receive forgiveness. I fear you think me sadly deficient in
                  maidenly reserve, and although I am troubled at the idea of your thinking lightly
                  of me, I can make but one excuse, truthfully; which is, that I was irresistibly
                  attracted toward you, and followed the warm and untutored impulse of my heart in
                  offering sympathy unsought."
               Her large lustrous eyes, melting with tenderness, and filled with mystic power,
                  were lifted beseechingly to his face.
               "Dear Miss Stanly! You deeply pain me by this cruel imputation. Do you suppose the
                  poor wretch who was suffering agony by the wayside, could have repulsed or doubted
                  the intentions of the good Samaritan who came with wine and oil to heal the
                  bleeding wounds? No, no! you are unjust to doubt my gratitude. Dear Julia, how can
                  I repay such disinterested kindness?"
               He pressed the jeweled hand which lay carelessly upon the table at
                  his side.
               "By numbering me as one of your truest and best friends!" she exclaimed, with—but,
                  alas! the look of bewitching tenderness, the tones of intense pathos, were
                  interrupted by the inopportune entrance of Mrs. Herbert.
               An hour or two later, Mrs. Herbert accompanied her guest into Lula's apartment,
                  and, after some pleasant conversation on general topics, she proposed that the
                  invalid should dress, and return with them to the parlor. Her charge timidly
                  remonstrated, but Mrs. Herbert insisted that it would make her feel better, and
                  more cheerful, and finally left the room, saying:
               "I shall expect you down in a few moments—do not disappointment me, darling."
               Lula smiled, faintly, a reluctant assent, as the kind lady was closing the door.
                  Had the orphan consulted her inclinations, she would have declined promptly; but
                  as her actions had ever been controlled by the wishes of her aunt, she abandoned the selfish desire to remain in
                  solitude, and arose to prepare her toilet.
               After Julia had exhausted her stock of news and gossip, she asked abruptly:
               Lula, do you intend to marry Alfred Raymond?"
               "Why, no certainly not!" stammered the poor girl, changing color, and trembling
                  with emotion.
               "Well, I must say, you are hard to please; any other girl would have accepted him
                  at a moment's warning. If I were in your place, I would marry him, just to stop
                  people's months."
               "I can't imagine any one who is at all concerned in the matter. If you have heard
                  anything unpleasant about me, please don't mention it now, for I feel so weak from
                  that attack of headache, that an unkind word or harsh remark would completely
                  prostrate me."
               "The dear little head,—does it ache still? then let me arrange your hair; the
                  exertion would be too much for you."
               Julia arose, and stood behind Lula's chair; then lifting the rich soft hair that
                  had fallen around the sweet pale face and graceful form, she remarked:
               "What beautiful hair you have! it feels like a mass of soft chenille. I'm sorry
                  that my careless speech should agitate you so much, but still, as your friend, I
                  think it's my duty to let you know that the gossiping world says you will not
                  marry Raymond, brother John, or any one else, because you wish to become Mrs.
                  Charlie Herbert."
               She fixed her eyes on the mirror before them, to note the effect of her words, and
                  saw the crimson flush mount with fearful rapidity to the pale face of her
                  companion.
               In an instant Lula sprang from her seat, and, with flashing eyes, confronted the
                  artful girl.
               "Julia Stanly! how dare you insult me by such cruel insinuations? Would you drive
                  me mad, and force me to leave the house that has sheltered my helpless childhood?"
                  she cried, indignantly, then burst into tears.
               "Pshaw, child! what need you care, if there is no truth in the silly gossip?" was
                  the careless rejoinder.
               "You are right. I will not care; for my conscience acquits me of any such design,"
                  and she forced back the tears, as she continued her preparation.
               Although Lula struggled hard to conceal her agitation, Julia saw, with secret
                  satisfaction, that her words had produced the desired effect, and then said:
               "I will go and smooth my own disheveled locks before going down stairs," and left
                  the room.
               Presently a rap at the door, followed by a feeble "come in" from Lula, caused Mr.
                  Herbert to enter the room.
               "How is my dear child?" then going up and kissing her, he put his arm around her,
                  and looked anxiously into her troubled face.
               "I am almost well, dear uncle and am going down stairs," she replied, in a choking
                  voice.
               "Indeed! then you deceive your looks, my darling; for your hands are as cold as
                  ice, and you are quivering like an aspen leaf."
               "I have heard it said that cold hands indicate a warm heart," she replied, with a
                  sickly smile.
               "My dear child, you are no adept in deception; so do not attempt it now, but
                  confess that you are suffering mentally and physically. What troubles you,
                  darling? your eyes are filled with tears."
               The drooping head pillowed itself upon his bosom, and unbidden tears flowed
                  freely.
               "Lula, my precious child! do you regret so much this parting from Alfred? I so, we
                  will recall him. Although I should have to resign one of the dearest treasures of
                     my household, it shall be done if it
                  will promote your happiness."
               "No, no, dear uncle; I cannot give you up for Alfred! Do not suppose for a moment
                  that I would. Another and a much greater trial threatens me, and I am not prepared
                  for the emergency."
               "God will not lay upon you a greater trial than you are able to bear. Put your
                  trust in Him and all will yet be well! But there is an air of mystery about you
                  that I would like to fathom; for your aunt left you a short time since, and
                  thought you had quite recovered; and now I find you a fit subject for Dr. Clinton.
                  What secret influence has Miss Stanly used to bring about this change? You must
                  make a confession, or Mary will investigate the matter."
               "Oh, uncle if you love me! please say nothing to auntie about my weakness. I will
                  soon overcome it, and will meet her as usual. Promise, dear uncle, that you will
                  not mention it to her!"
               "I cannot refuse your request, dear child; but my promise must be conditional. If
                  I see any more tears or pale cheeks, I will not only divulge my suspicions in
                  regard to Miss Stanly, but will take the matter in hand myself. I will not have
                  any wolf in sheep's clothing prowling about my premises, seeking to devour my
                  lamb, without raising my arm in its defense."
               "Thank you, dear uncle! you shall have no cause for complaint."
               Then, by a strong effort, she subdued her emotion, and soon pronounced herself
                  ready to go down. She entered the parlor with a firm step, leaning upon Mr.
                  Herbert's arm, and took possession of the luxurious fauteuil which he placed for her near his wife.
               Charlie nodded his head carelessly to her, and then turned to join Julia, who
                  stood under the arch of the bay-window, looking over a photograph album.
               As he approached her, she raised her eyes, and with a bewitching smile said:
               "Philopena, Mr. Herbert!"
               "Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my
                  kingdom," he replied, smilingly.
               "Then you must abide by my decision, for I ask the head of Charlie Herbert;" and
                  taking his photograph from Lula's album, she slipped it into her pocket.
               "Since my own rashness has condemned me, I must submit," he replied, carelessly;
                  and then turned to welcome Robert Carlton, who was just entering the room.
               This young gentleman was quite a favorite with the family, and was welcomed by
                  them with great cordiality.
               Mr. Herbert remarked:
               "Your presence is particularly agreeable to-day, as we are all weather-bound. Even
                  Lula has been affected by the gloom; she has moped all day in her cage, and has
                  not cheered us with a song."
               "The prospect was certainly dismal enough in the forenoon; but the adage that 'a
                  morning shower is like an old woman's dance, soon over,' will be verified in this
                  instance; for the clouds are rapidly dispersing, and there will be a glorious
                  sunset," Robert replied.
               As if in fulfillment of this prophecy, a brilliant sunbeam soon darted through the
                  window, and settled like a halo around the head of Lula as she reclined against
                  the crimson cushion.
               The eyes of the entire party were fixed with silent admiration on her lovely face,
                  which seemed to glow with celestial brightness beneath the touch of an artist,
                  immortal and invisible.
               She made an effort to move her seat; but Mr. Herbert insisted that she would
                  remain still for a moment.
               
               "If Raphael could have looked upon you thus, he would have desired no greater
                  surety of immortalization, than to have handed down to posterity the counterpart
                  of such a faultless model," he said, gazing with genuine admiration on the artless
                  girl.
               A sweet musical laugh involuntarily burst from Lula at the conclusion of this
                  speech; then, hastily escaping from the chair, she exclaimed:
               "Oh, uncle, who would ever have suspected you of trying to foster a spirit of
                  vanity and pride in a silly girl, by such palpable flattery!"
               "And where have you learned so much impudence, young lady, as to cast that
                  imputation on your old uncle and guardian?" he replied, playfully, as he threw his
                  arm around her, and cut off the retreat.
               Robert Carlton's admiring look plainly indicated that he considered it no
                  flattery; he turned to see the effect of this brilliant tableau vivant upon Charlie, whom he had long suspected of
                  entertaining for the lovely orphan more than a brother's regard. His gaze, also,
                  was transfixed on the blushing girl, but with an expression so strange and sad,
                  that Robert was completely puzzled. Then looking toward Julia, he was startled to
                  see her beautiful face distorted with hate and envy, while her bright eyes gleamed
                  with a fiendish glare upon poor gentle Lula.
               Turning hastily, he said, in a low tone:
               "Mrs. Herbert, don't you think Miss Julia would make a splendid Judith? I never
                  saw her character more truthfully depicted. That glance is enough to have murdered
                  Holofernes without the aid of the falchion. Donatella would have demolished his
                  work in despair, and pronounced it a failure, if he could have seen determined
                  vengeance so truthfully portrayed."
               They sat opposite a mirror, and as Julia was in their rear, Mrs. Herbert suddenly
                  looked up, and was shocked by the expression which was reflected from its polished
                  surface, and had called forth the remark from Robert.
               She made no reply, but left her seat to hide her perturbation; then looking from
                  the window, said:
               "Robert, I think you were correct in your supposition about the weather. The
                  prospect without looks cheering. I am truly rejoiced it is so, as I shall drive
                  into town this afternoon."
               Then turning to her fair guest, she remarked:
               "Julia, if you accompany me, it will prevent the necessity of your mother
                  troubling to send for you."
               "Thank you, Mrs. Herbert. If you go, I shall be pleased to accompany you; but are
                  you not afraid to venture out? Mother has always charged me to guard against
                  dampness."
               "I have no fears on that score. I resided long enough in England to learn the art
                  of exercising, even in wet weather."
               Robert Carlton saw that Julia was quite disconcerted at the thought of having her
                  visit terminate so speedily, and was cruel enough to rejoice at her discomfiture.
                  He even determined to add to it by recalling a reminiscence of her school days,
                  and said:
               "Miss Julia, did your mother ever tell you about my calling at your house, the day
                  after Dr. Hall's examination, and her ordering a servant to bring some new books
                  from your room, that I might amuse myself while she replied to a note? Through
                  mistake your old Algebra was brought, but your mother was too much interested in
                  writing to notice it, or to see me take from the book a document which was of
                  considerable importance about that time. I thought the loss would not
                  inconvenience you as much as it did others, and you would probably forgive the
                  theft, especially when I tell you it is still in my possession, subject to the
                  owner's order. But excuse me, Miss Julia, you are not well!" he added, as the fair culprit turned, deathly pale, and
                  trembled before him.
               Charlie had not heeded Robert's speech, but, observed her agitation, and supposing
                  that it was produced by sudden illness, handed a goblet of water, which
                  fortunately stood near. The draught partially restored her, and returning the
                  goblet, with a tender glance, she remarked:
               "I suffer frequently from severe paroxysms in my side, and for this reason mamma
                  thinks I should be very careful, and not expose myself to the weather."
               She arose and crossed the room; then asked:
               "At what time will you ride, Mrs. Herbert? I am anxious to return home, for I
                  shall be in constant dread of another attack."
               In leaving the room, she passed near Robert, and in scarcely audible whisper
                  said:
               "I'm afraid, Mr. Carlton, you are laboring under a strange mistake with regard to
                  that paper. I wish you would call to-morrow, and give me an opportunity of
                  removing any false impression you may have formed relative to its being in my
                  possession."
               Then bowing her head, she left the room.
               "Robert, I hope that your fun-loving propensity has not caused you to rob Miss
                  Stanly of some amatory epistle," said Mr. Herbert, when they were alone.
               "No, indeed, sir! The paper I referred to was Miss Lula's composition, which you
                  may remember was lost or misplaced two years ago. Dr. Hall expected that it would
                  take the first premium, and has never ceased to regret its disappearance. Alfred
                  Raymond told me at that time that he had good reasons for thinking that Julia
                  filched it from the doctor's desk, and his suspicions were confirmed by my finding
                  it soon after in one of her school books. I would have mentioned this circumstance
                  to Charlie, immediately, but he was absent; and then our own troubles commenced
                  about that time, and I was diverted from my purpose. I left for college soon after
                  mother recovered from that severe attack of illness, and since my return the
                  affair has never occurred to me, until I saw Miss Julia's envious, jealous look
                  bent so savagely on her unsuspecting victim. Then I could not resist the desire to
                  remind the guilty creature of her former treachery."
               "Is it not probable that it was placed there accidentally by some one else? Surely
                  one so beautiful could not be guilty of such depravity!" was Mr. Herbert's
                  reply."
               Robert then related to him what Alfred had seen and heard after the examination,
                  and Mr. Herbert was convinced.
               The carriage was soon announced, and Julia appeared prepared to leave. Before her
                  departure, she found occasion to say to Charlie:
               "You will come soon, and let me in some measure supply the place of the loved and
                  the lost."
               "I will," was his reply, as he took the hand held out to him.
               He watched the carriage until it passed out of sight, then turned and walked
                  slowly into the house, indulging sad and gloomy thoughts, believing himself the
                  most unhappy of mortals.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XV.
               
                  
                     
                        Alas! they had been friends in youth!
                        But whispering tongues can poison truth;
                        And constancy lives in realms above,
                        And life is thorny; and youth is vain;
                        And to be wroth with one we love,
                        Doth work like madness is the brain
                     
                  
               
               IMMEDIATELY after the departure of the two ladies, a telegram was received
                  demanding Mr. Herbert's or his son's presence is New York, and before Mrs. Herbert
                  returned, it had been decided that Charlie should leave on the night train.
               He was glad of an opportunity to absent himself from home, and to seek, amid the
                  busy scenes of life, relief or forgetfulness of his present suffering.
               The assertion of Julia in regard to Lula's clandestine engagement might have
                  passed unheeded, after its first startling announcement, if he had not been
                  convinced of its truth by that tender scene between the lovers. This was
                  sufficient proof that Miss Stanly had spoken advisedly; and in his distress and
                  despair, poor Charlie could scarcely resist the temptation of offering himself to
                  the beautiful girl who so earnestly tendered her sympathy to him in his
                  sorrow.
               In communing with himself, he asked:
               "What better evidence could I desire to test the sincerity of her attachment to
                  me, than the confession which had fallen involuntarily from her lips, and was
                  afterward tearfully, blushingly repented?"
               But in taking this important step, he would certainly incur the displeasure of his
                  parents, and therefore prudence demanded that he should at least wait until his
                  return, and then seek to conciliate them.
               Although it might require time to remove their prejudices, he felt sure of success
                  in the end, as they had never unreasonably opposed his wishes; and would not now
                  allow their hastily formed opinions to destroy the happiness of their only
                  child.
               "Let them see her divested of that habitual cloak of proud reserve, and they
                  cannot fail to love the gentle confiding heart which tenderly and warmly beats
                  beneath its cold armor," he said, mentally.
               Smile not, reader, at this absurd conclusion of Charlie's, for he is by means the
                  first, nor will he be the last sensible young gentleman who has been or can be
                  hood winked by a beautiful and artful woman. Notwithstanding some quaint old
                  writer has said that a "man's cranium contained one more cell than that of the
                  weaker sex," perhaps his own vanity prevented his knowing that the extra cell was
                  often a vacuum.
               Shakspeare did not incline to the opinion of this old writer, for, among the
                  assembled wisdom of the Venetian court, there was not sagacity enough to extricate
                  the amiable Antonio from Shylock's savage bond. Yet how easily was it accomplished
                  by a woman!
               We are no advocate for woman's rights, nor do we insist upon the superiority, or
                  even equality of the sex; but wish to show any young gallant, who is disposed to
                  pronounce Charlie Herbert a silly fellow for being so easily entrapped, that he is
                  not a solitary exception by any means. For when a woman goes forth to conquer,
                  endowed with beauty, and panoplied by art, her victim must make an unconditional
                  surrender, or escape under some rival's banner.
               Mr. and Mrs. Herbert, with Robert Carlton, were in the hall, to take leave of Charlie, who stood
                  moodily but-toning his gloves, glancing occasionally around as if expecting some
                  one, whose coming would precipitate his departure.
               The watchful eyes of his mother had observed this uneasiness, and interpreting his
                  meaning, she said:
               "Lula was anxious to come out and bid you good-by, but I persuaded her to remain
                  quiet, as she is far from being well."
               These words were scarcely out of his mother's mouth before he darted off toward
                  the parlor.
               The poor girl was reclining on the sofa, with one little white hand shading her
                  eyes; so still and quiet did she appear, that Charlie supposed her sleeping, and
                  stood for a moment gazing sadly upon the still figure.
               A silent tear came trickling down from beneath her hand, and he dropped on his
                  knee at her side.
               "Birdie, poor little Birdie! are you still suffering?" he asked, tenderly, as he
                  kissed her forehead.
               "My head aches very badly?" she replied, faintly, and her tears began to flow
                  rapidly.
               Then she added:
               "Charlie, you have scarcely spoken to me to-day. Are you vexed with your
                  sister?"
               Every generous feeling of his heart was brought into action by this simple,
                  touching appeal. Julia Stanly was forgotten for the time: he only remembered that
                  he had failed to act a brother's part—that he had broken his allegiance to the
                  gentle orphan whom he had promised to love and cherish as a sister.
               "Forgive me, my darling! my sister, forgive me! I was unhappy, and did not suppose
                  that you would notice my neglect, when your heart was filled with love for
                  another. Raymond is a noble fellow; he is worthy of you, my sister," he said,
                  heroically.
               "Charlie, if you don't hurry, the cars will leave you," cried Mr. Herbert, from
                  the hall.
               The unhappy young man kissed Lula's sorrowful face again, and hurried from the
                  room, before she could reply.
               A strange startled expression from those dark-blue eyes had greeted his last
                  remark, and haunted him through the long and tedious journey.
               Mrs. Herbert's suspicions soon became aroused in regard to Robert Carlton's
                  intentions. His admiration for Lula was very evident, and the watchful guardianess
                  feared that another treasured friendship must be sacrificed. She thought how
                  difficult it was for an unsophisticated girl, who possessed beauty and amiability,
                  upon entering society, to steer safely between Scylla and Charybdis. If she is
                  interesting and strives to please and be pleased, every conceited fop will
                  pronounce her a flirt and coquette if she does not accept his addresses instantly,
                  and promise to love, honor, and obey him. Or if quiet and reserved, she is
                  neglected like the modest violet, and often left to blush unseen.
               Robert Carlton was no senseless fop, but a wild, impulsive young man, who had
                  never been taught restraint or self-denial. His parents had ever indulged him to
                  the fullest extent, and from the time he could mount a pony, he was permitted to
                  rove ad libitum, with his gun and dog, to the
                  terror of his gentle mother, and the admiration of his thoughtless father. True,
                  he possessed noble and generous traits of character, which, with proper training,
                  might have brought him forth as pure gold from the furnace; but the firm and
                  gentle rein so much needed to guide him in the path of rectitude, was never drawn
                  to the right nor the left, and the way ward youth was left to his own freedom and
                  pleasure.
               In his own home, Robert's will was the supreme law, and all were compelled to
                  succumb to his wishes, for it was well
                  understood that he could brook no disappointment. Although too generous to take
                  advantage of friend or foe, he did not possess sufficient moral courage to bear a
                  defeat. This morbid sensibility had increased with his years, and when his heart
                  was engaged in pursuit of an object, no honorable means were left untried by which
                  he might accomplish his purpose. But should his efforts prove unsuccessful, he
                  would sink into despondency and imagine himself an Ishmaelite, with every man's
                  hand turned against him. During these uncontrollable fits of depression, when
                  tortured by imaginary disgrace and mortification, he would resort to the sparkling
                  wine until the ruddy liquid brought back warmth to his sinking heart, and life and
                  vigor to his sluggish spirits.
               Since the elopement and marriage of his sister, to whom he was sincerely attached,
                  he had utterly depreciated woman's character, and never allowed an opportunity to
                  escape when he could manifest his contempt for the weakness and inferiority of the
                  sex. He made some few exceptions to this rule. His mother he loved devotedly; yet
                  he saw and deplored her deficiencies; but Mrs. Herbert he honored and revered. He
                  could have knelt and worshiped at her feet with as much reverence and holy love as
                  Romanist would before some patron saint. He believed that the mantle of her truth
                  and wisdom had fallen upon Lula, and thought it fitted with bewitching grace this
                  lovely girl who unconsciously occupied the inmost shrine of his adoring heart.
               A few days after Charlie's departure, the family at Belvoir were agreeably
                  surprised by a visit from Annie Sunderland.
               After greeting Mrs. Herbert affectionately, she turned to Lula and expressed great
                  concern at her pale cheeks and languid appearance, and said:
               "You remind me of some exquisite statue fresh from the sculptor's hand, in that
                  pure white morning dress. What is the matter, darling?"
               "I have been a little indisposed for several days. I think it is the warm weather
                  which completely enervates me; but now that you have come, I mean to be quite well
                  again."
               "You look almost as white as Alfred did the other morning when he came down to
                  breakfast like a specter, and told us he was obliged to leave immediately, and
                  perhaps would never see us again. Oh, Lula! he appeared so miserable, and would
                  give us no clew to his distress. I sometimes think he was committed suicide, for
                  we can hear nothing whatever of him. My noble cousin, I fear he will never
                  return!"
               "Oh, Annie! have pity on my poor child!" cried Mrs. Herbert in alarm, as she
                  sprung toward Lula, who had fainted.
               "What have I done? Oh, Mrs. Herbert! tell me what is the matter with Lula?"
                  exclaimed Annie, as she instantly aroused herself and flew to her friend's
                  assistance.
               "Hush! not another word about Alfred. I will explain when she recovers," was the
                  hurried reply.
               
               When at length Lula opened her eyes, she gazed into her aunt's face with such
                  pleading, yearning tenderness, that in spite of Mrs. Herbert's efforts to control
                  herself, the tears fell from her eyes, and she clasped the suffering girl
                  convulsively to her breast.
               "My poor, suffering child! tell me what distresses you? what can I do for you?"
                  said she.
               "My head aches a little, but it is passing off now. Don't worry about me, dear
                  auntie; I shall soon be well. Please tell me what Annie said about Alfred? Is he
                  really dead? What did she say?"
               
               "She only mentioned that he left home suddenly. That is all she knows about him.
                  Don't let it annoy you, my dear child! I am certain we shall hear from him very
                  soon."
               Mrs. Herbert could not be convinced that Lula was in no danger, until Dr. Clinton
                  came and prescribed for her.
               After she had fallen asleep, the anxious lady thought it necessary to inform Dr.
                  Clinton and Annie of what had passed between Alfred and Lula, of his unexpected
                  proposal, his strange manner and sudden flight, and Lula's uncontrollable grief,
                  at being the cause of his distress.
               Of the poison administered by Julia Stanly in the form of gossip, fabricated by
                  herself to further her heartless designs, Mrs, Herbert could not speak, as this
                  had escaped her watchful ear.
               After a quiet night's rest, Lula was so much refreshed, that she was left during
                  the forenoon to Annie's care.
               Taking advantage of this favorable opportunity, the orphan gave her friend an
                  account of Julia's unexpected visit, and the cruel reasons which that young lady
                  said the gossips had assigned for the refusal of Raymond and others.
               "Oh, Annie, please advise me what to do! I cannot go to auntie, and am at a loss
                  what do to or how to act. I am certain Charlie has heard something unpleasant
                  about me, from his singular conduct the day before he left home."
               "Poor, artless, unsuspecting child! Can't you see through the plot? It is a ruse
                  of Julia's to catch Charlie herself, and she hopes by appealing to your pride that
                  you will be provoked into accepting some one else, and leave the way open to her,"
                  was Annie's laughing reply.
               "Oh! you certainly cannot think that she has any designs of that nature?" said
                  Lula, in tremulous tones.
               "Indeed, I do! and now I remember, Sallie Ridgly mentioned on yesterday, that
                  Julia had his photograph, and pretended to value it very highly 'for certain
                  reasons,' which would astonish the beau monde
                  soon; she said also, that she corresponded with him; for Sallie saw an envelope
                  directed to Mr. Charles Herbert, Fifth Avenue Hotel, New York. When this was told
                  me, we had a good laugh at her expense, thinking that Charlie understood her
                  character too well to be caught by any of her arts. But since you have spoken of
                  her visit and its consequences, I must believe she has made great progress in his
                  good graces. To do this, she would not hesitate to slander and traduce father,
                  mother, brother, or sister. But do not give her another thought, dear Lula, she
                  cannot injure you. Let us talk of something else. I came to congratulate you on
                  your good fortune in being co-heiress to Mrs. Grant's valuable estate, but your
                  indisposition has prevented my saying anything about it before," said Annie,
                  wishing to divert the thoughts of her companion from unpleasant subjects
               "Yes, I had forgotten poor Mrs. Grant and her kindness to me. Did you ever know of
                  anything so strange and unexpected? To think that I may probably end my days under
                  the same roof where my sainted mother's last lingering look of love rested on her
                  poor little orphan child!" was the sad reply.
               "Lula, I did not wish to awaken any painful reminiscences by referring to your
                  good fortune; but since you are disposed to melancholy this morning, allow me to
                  divert your thoughts, by informing you that Dr. Clinton has designs on that house
                  himself. His idea is to have it thoroughly renovated, and to commence housekeeping
                  there very soon." Then she added, with a heightened blush:
               "I suppose it is not necessary to tell you whom he has engaged as
                  housekeeper?"
               "Oh, Annie! I am delighted to know that it has all been arranged so satisfactorily at last; and if
                  uncle and auntie are anxious to get rid of me, I can live with you and occupy my
                  same little room, if you can't spare me a larger one."
               "You shall always have the best room in the house, darling, and it would be
                  charming to have you there always; but if I mistake not, those dear friends you
                  have just mentioned will not allow you to occupy it very often. We will arrange
                  this matter at another time, Lula dear; but you must excuse me, if I speak of my
                  own affairs at present."
               Then she continued:
               "Dr. Clinton insists that out wedding shall take place one month from to-day.
                  Consequently, I have but little time to consult with Mrs. Herbert and yourself in
                  regard to the purchase of my trousseau. You are
                  to be first bridesmaid, remember."
               Mrs. Herbert entered the room, and soon all were deep in the mysteries of fashion
                  and the toilet.
               Douglas Jerrold says, "Ask a woman to a tea-party in the garden of Eden, and she
                  will say, 'I can't go without a new gown.'"
               As matrimony and a wedding are to many an Eden in prospective, it is not to be
                  supposed that a young lady could be indifferent to an event of this kind,
                  especially when she is to act a part so important as that of our friend Annie.
                  Therefore we will not intrude longer on the privacy of Lula's boudoir, but leave
                  them to discuss the absorbing topic.
               Previous to her departure, Annie took occasion to apprise Mrs. Herbert of Julia
                  Stanly's secret attempt to poison Lula's happiness.
               The high-toned matron turned pale with indignation at this new evidence of the
                  heartless girl's envy and malice toward the artless, unoffending orphan, and
                  determined to guard her treasure still more faithfully in future from such
                  dangerous companionship.
               About three weeks after young Herbert's departure his father entered the parlor,
                  and said:
               "My dear, I received a letter from Charlie this morning. He thinks it probable
                  that he may return in time for Annie's wedding;" then added:
               "Here is one for you also, of a later date I presume, as mine should have been
                  received on yesterday."
               "I hope he may return in time," replied Mrs. Herbert, as she opened the envelope
                  and eagerly read its contents.
               Immediately an exclamation of astonishment escaped from her lips, which attracted
                  her husband's attention, and caused him to lay aside the paper he was reading and
                  inquire:
               What does Charlie write?"
               "He says that Alice Carlton is a widow, and in destitute circumstances, her
                  husband having died of mania-a-potu some time
                  since. Her father-in-law failed soon after the unfortunate marriage, and the
                  mother is now keeping a boarding-house, while poor Alice is doing the drudgery of
                  the family. Charlie says also, that when she met and recognized him on the street
                  she was so agitated at the sight of one from home that she burst into a flood of
                  tears. He walked with her and gathered these facts. She had never heard directly
                  from home since her marriage, and this meeting with him caused her real pleasure.
                  He says further, she is the most complete image of hopeless despair he has ever
                  seen—that her voiceless woe and her beautiful statue-like appearance attracted his
                  attention before he was aware of her being his former friend. He wishes me to see
                  Mrs. Carlton and intercede for poor Alice, that she may be allowed to return
                  home."
               "Truly, the way of the transgressor is hard," remarked Mr. Herbert.
               
               "Poor Alice! she must return home. I will go immediately and plead for her. A
                  mother will never turn a deaf car to the cry of a penitent child."
               Mrs. Herbert took up her letter again, and read it carefully; then sighing
                  heavily, said:
               "Mr. Herbert I cannot imagine what strange infatuation has possessed and
                  influenced Charlie recently. In the first place, he was jealous of Alfred Raymond,
                  and treated him with marked coolness. His next freak was a pretended admiration
                  for Julia Stanly, and almost a dislike to Lula, whom he scarcely noticed on the
                  day he left home, although she was suffering so much at the time. I understand
                  that Julia makes no secret of her love or fancy for him, and displays his
                  photograph as a great treasure, besides letters, which she boasts of having
                  received from him during his absence. In his letter to me he writes: 'I suppose
                  the length of my absence is a matter of perfect indifference to Lula; but I know
                  there is a pair of bright black eyes that watch for me, and will grow brighter at
                  my coming.'"
               "Why, the boy is absolutely crazy! I have a great inclination to order a straight
                  jacket put on him, and post him off to the lunatic asylum as soon as he returns
                  home. Though I think Robert Carlton might tell him something about his inamorata
                  that would change the current of his fancy. That girl is a perfect Sybarite in her
                  taste, and loves nothing but wealth, luxury, and herself. Narcissus was never more
                  deeply enamored of his own image than the heartless beauty is with her charming
                  person."
               "I understand her character so thoroughly that it is particularly mortifying to
                  hear Charlie's name in connection with hers. The idea of his entertaining the
                  slightest regard or admiration for Julia Stanly is too absurd and ridiculous.
                  However, I will not allow it to vex me any further, but will drive over to Mr.
                  Carlton's and intercede for poor Alice."
               When this amiable lady returned from her visit, she informed Mr. Herbert and Lula
                  that her mission had been quite successful, and added:
               "Mr. and Mrs. Carlton were overjoyed at the thought of having Alice at home, since
                  the only obstacle to her coming had been removed by death. They both shed tears at
                  the idea of their beautiful, tenderly-nurtured daughter performing a menial's
                  duties in a boarding-house; and Mr. Carlton immediately telegraphed for Charlie to
                  bring her home without fail."
               A few days after the events recorded above, Mr. and Mrs. Herbert welcomed with
                  great pleasure their young friend, the Hon. Mr. Gordon, a son of Lord Huntington,
                  to Belvoir.
               As he is a personage of considerable importance, he will be formally introduced to
                  the reader in the next chapter.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVI.
               
                  
                     
                        The light of love, the purity of grace,
                        The mind, the music breathing from her face,
                        The heart whose softness harmonized the whole,—
                        And oh! that eye was in itself in soul.
                     
                  
               
               "LET us walk into the exhibition rooms. I am anxious to see that picture of
                  Charles Hamilton's which has turned the heads of all who look upon its rare
                  beauty. It is said to be the finest thing he has ever painted; if so, it must
                  rival the celebrated portraits of Reynolds and Lawrence," said Lord Huntington to
                  his friend Arthur Leslie, as they wended their way along one of the crowded
                  thoroughfares of the great British metropolis. "Hamilton is a countryman of yours,
                  Leslie," he continued, "and has recently returned from a residence among the works
                  of art, in Italy. He is an artist of considerable merit and brilliant imagination;
                  his admirers, among whom are the most noble in the land, place him on an equality
                  with Reynolds, Lawrence, and Van Dyke. In brilliancy and truth of coloring, he
                  displays that perfection and freshness which is peculiar to the productions of
                  Titian. The piece now on exhibition he calls the portrait of an American lady, but
                  our people are disposed to be incredulous upon the subject, and always speak of it
                  as the artist's dream. I understand that he refused to part with it for three
                  hundred pounds, which was offered by the Duke of Bedford. It is said that he
                  cannot be prevailed upon to part with it for any amount of money."
               "We will hasten then to behold this embodiment of the painter's dream, and award
                  to it the palm of beauty, if it is only half so lovely as your glowing description
                  of the artist has led me to expect," replied Leslie.
               They entered the gallery whose permanent beauties were well worthy of note,
                  independent of the exquisite specimens fresh from the easels of modern
                  painters.
               There is Michael Angelo's superb painting of the Raising of Lazarus, which is
                  considered by some the most important specimen of the Italian school in England.
                  The embarkation of the Queen of Sheba, by Claude, an Adoration of the Shepherds,
                  by Rembrandt, and many others of the same class will claim the attention, but our
                  friends are attracted in another direction by the words:
               "Beautiful! exquisite! divine!" repeated by numbers of the vast crowd, and
                  Huntington and Leslie soon stood before a picture of one of the most angelic and
                  beautiful nymphs that ever emanated from a poet's pen or artist's pencil.
               It was a full-length portrait of a lovely girl, just verging into womanhood. Her
                  face was of the Grecian type and exquisitely delicate, her forehead broad and
                  fair; eyebrows finely arched, eyes soft and dovelike, beaming with happiness and
                  fixed confidingly on the spectators, while the sweet lips curved like Cupid's bow
                  ready to send the fatal arrow into some victim's heart. Her dark hair waved with a
                  golden ripple over the temple, and the pearly shell-like ears were peeping from
                  beneath the shining mass. A wreath of geranium leaves was gracefully twined around
                  her classical head and trailed upon a neck of exquisite mould and purity. Dignity,
                  sweetness, and simplicity were blended so beautifully in the picture, that the
                  spectators were completely enchanted. The corsage of her dress displayed to the
                  best possible advantage the finely turned throat and tapering shoulders. One
                  beautifully rounded arm rested lightly on a table of antique shape, while the
                  other hung carelessly at her side. The gossamer texture ure of her white dress gave to the whole picture an
                  ethereal look, and that, together with an indescribable expression about the face,
                  caused the worshiping crowd to fancy themselves in the presence of the maiden
                  queen of heaven.
               Huntington and Leslie had stood with others before that divine creation of the
                  artist in must astonishment; and as if mesmerized by the powerful influence of
                  those serene and tender eyes, they heeded not the flight of time, nor appeared
                  conscious when they were left alone in that spacious gallery. Leslie was the first
                  to recover speech; the wild look of astonishment had gradually passed from his
                  face, and a peculiar smile of intense delight had usurped its place. Turning from
                  the picture to his friend who stood with folded arms and a gaze of rapture, fixed
                  upon the spiritual beauty of that pictured face, he said smilingly:
               "Huntington, how long will it be before your faculties are restored? Shall I leave
                  you, and make an excuse to Lord Montague for your non-appearance at dinner? But,
                  before I go please exert yourself sufficiently to introduce me to the artist whose
                  magic pencil has transfixed us to this spot for thirty minutes or more. I must
                  make his acquaintance, and if he should demand the half of my estate in exchange
                  for this portrait, I must have it. Evidently it is the likeness of one who is very
                  near and dear to me, and I cannot suffer it to remain here exposed again to the
                  gaze of the vulgar crowd that has flocked around it to-day. But where this artist
                  could have met with the original of that picture, is a mystery which I am unable
                  to solve."
               "Leslie, you certainly cannot mean to imply that this is portrait, and of one
                  known to you? If I thought that possible, I would traverse the entire globe, only
                  that I might kneel before, and worship so much loveliness."
               "Look upon this picture, and on that," replied his friend, taking from his bosom a
                  miniature, which was an exact counterpart of the painting. "Introduce me now, and
                  then you can return and trace the resemblance between them at your leisure," he
                  added, placing the miniature in the hand of his friend.
               "Leslie, let me be the purchaser. Offer him anything—everything, that the painting
                  may be mine; the miniature is yours, and the lady is perhaps your affianced bride.
                  If that is so, I envy you indeed; but the portrait must be mine. It shall be held
                  sacred in my possession, so do not hesitate."
               "If you will cross the Atlantic with me, Huntington, you shall see the original of
                  that superb picture, and if you are not then disenchanted, we will allow the lady
                  to decide who shall become the possessor of that master-piece of art."
               "I would go on a pilgrimage to Mecca—to Jerusalem—to the antipodes—anywhere, to be
                  allowed that priceless privilege," was Lord Huntington's reply.
               They turned to search for Hamilton, the artist. In a distant part of the room he
                  sat, pale and motionless, with one thin white hand supporting his noble brow, and
                  his melancholy eyes fixed sadly on that lovely face, the unrivaled production of
                  his own powerful genius. A visible emotion was perceptible in his countenance,
                  when Huntington presented Leslie as an American.
               Was it the name of Leslie, or the idea of meeting one of his countrymen only, that
                  caused such agitation?—thought Huntington, as he returned to offer again his
                  idolatrous worship before his newly found goddess.
               When Leslie rejoined his friend, he said:
               "It has been purchased for four hundred pounds, and is to be sent to Huntington
                  House for the present. I had great difficulty in persuading him to sell it. It
                     appears that he first met this lady
                  at some public assembly, and her beauty and artless grace made such an impression
                  on his heart and memory, that her appearance on that memorable occasion will never
                  be forgotten. Although he met her frequently afterward, he never sought an
                  introduction, and he thinks the lady has no knowledge whatever of his appearance.
                  A sort of Platonic love on his part, which is truly romantic, but which an ardent
                  temperament cannot endure quite so philosophically," said Leslie, as they walked
                  from the gallery.
               "But how did you prevail upon him to part with it?"
               "He did not intend to do so, but a presentiment has warned him that he will never
                  reach his native land, where an invalid mother and a young sister, who are almost
                  dependent upon him for a support, await his return. It is true that he refused to
                  sell it to the Duke of Bedford for three hundred pounds, and would never have
                  allowed it to pass into a stranger's hands, but he congratulates himself that it
                  is now in the possession of a friend of the original. I offered him four hundred
                  pounds, which he insisted was more than the value of it as a work of art; but for
                  the sake of his mother and sister, I urged him to accept my offer."
               Arthur Leslie was a young American, who, in travelling through Europe, had met
                  Lord Huntington, and as each were bent on a tour of observation and pleasure, they
                  found much that was congenial between them, and had pursued the same route
                  together.
               They had stood beside the classical lakes of Switzerland, and mounted the hoary
                  summit of Mount Blanc,—they stood side by side on the brink of Vesuvius, and
                  looked into its fearful burning lake of fire,—through the ruins of Pompeii and
                  Herculaneum they had passed, and beheld in lonely grandeur the ruins of the
                  Coliseum and Pantheon. The blue waters of the Adriatic had met their gaze; and
                  they had, 
                     
                        —in Venice, on the Bridge of Sighs
                        A palace and a prison on each hand;
                        Look'd to the winged Lion's marble piles,
                        Where Venice sate in state, throned on her hundred isles.
                     
                  
               
               A friendship formed under such agreeable auspices was not to be easily sundered,
                  and on their arrival at London, Leslie was importuned by his friend to take up his
                  abode at Huntington House, until his departure for the United States.
               Lord Huntington willingly consented to accompany his friend—to brave the fury of
                  the ocean's foaming waves, and gratify a long-wished purpose to visit the young
                  Republic that was making such rapid strides toward obtaining the mastery of the
                  world.
               In a few days his arrangements would be complete, and then adieu to Britain's
                  coast, welcome Columbia's free and happy land.
               A short time previous to the day appointed for their departure, Leslie received a
                  summons to attend the death-bed of the young artist, Charles Hamilton. Distressed
                  and shocked by this unexpected call, he hastened to the apartment of his
                  compatriot.
               Pale and attenuated, Hamilton lay on his couch; death had placed its dread signet
                  on his brow, but failed to rob his features of their intellectual beauty. The
                  clear blue veins could be easily traced on his pure white forehead, which appeared
                  more marble-like from its contrast with the soft black hair that shaded it. A
                  celestial light beamed from his large dark eyes, and the calm, holy expression of
                  his handsome face indicated a heart at peace with God and man.
               "Excuse the liberty a dying man has taken in sending for you," he said, as he offered his emaciated hand
                  to Leslie; then added:
               "Knowing that you were to leave Europe shortly, I thought I might perhaps induce
                  you to see my poor, dear mother and sister, and impart to them the sad
                  intelligence which they must shortly receive. On me their earthly hopes depended.
                  I was the strength and stay of my fond mother's declining years, and the only
                  guardian and protector of an affectionate young sister. My poor Mary! when I think
                  of her gentle nature, of her artlessness, her innocence and beauty, I almost doubt
                  the wisdom and justice of God in taking me from her,—my sweet sister."
               He covered his face with his hand, and wept for the blighted hopes which a
                  knowledge of his death would cause to the loved ones in his distant home.
               Tears of heartfelt sympathy fell from the eyes of Leslie as he listened to the
                  plaintive voice of the affectionate son and brother, who feared not the terrors of
                  death, nor dreaded to meet his God, but wept and sorrowed for the aching void his
                  loss would create in the hearts of his mother and sister, and he attempted to
                  comfort the dying man by offering to fill, if possible, his place in their love
                  and affection.
               "Thank you, thank you, my dear friend, for this delightful assurance. May God
                  reward you for your kindness,—for the comfort you have given to the heart of an
                  expiring mortal," fervently exclaimed Hamilton as he grasped Leslie's hand.
               After a short interval his feeble voice was raised in prayer.
               "Oh! God of the widow and fatherless, bless and protect the dear ones, teach the
                  submission to thy will, and may they look to thee for consolation in the
                  afflicting dispensation of they providence,—may they humbly bow before the throne
                  of mercy and say 'Thy will be done.' Forgive me, Almighty God! for murmuring at
                  thy just pleasure, and receive me into thy presence, for Christ my Redeemer's
                  sake."
               This effort appeared to exhaust his waning strength; his eyes gently closed, and
                  Leslie feared that the meek spirit had departed. But presently his earnest gaze
                  was fixed on the face of his friend, and he said:
               "I must endeavor to explain to you the mystery of the portrait now in your
                  possession. At one time my father was a wealthy merchant in Columbia, South
                  Carolina. My sister attended a seminary in Charleston, while I was sent to a
                  Northern college. Frequent letters from Mary acquainted me with the names and
                  characters of several of her school-mates. Among them was her particular friend
                  Annie, the youthful belle and beauty of the city. She was the delightful theme
                  that constantly filled these letters, and I gladly welcomed each one that
                  contained ought of that lovely girl. Suffice it to say I loved her before I ever
                  saw her. Previous to the termination of my collegiate course my father encountered
                  severe losses, which threatened to dissolve his mercantile career and bring ruin
                  to his family. When this news reached me I hastened home, and arrived at
                  Charleston on the evening of a splendid fete given by a relative of ours. Mary,
                  who was ignorant of father's embarrassment, was delighted to have me attend her,
                  and I was compelled to do so, as no apology would be received. My mind was too
                  much harassed with the deranged affairs just alluded to for me to mingle with the
                  gay and happy throng, and I remained a silent spectator. My heart soon grew faint
                  at the sight of so many bright and cheerful faces around me, when poverty, with
                  its ghastly smile, was mocking at my pleasant home. I was about leaving that
                  brilliant scene when the words beautiful—lovely—angelic—and various other
                  adjectives of a similar nature, caused me to look in the opposite direction tion. Then I saw the glorious being who
                  for months past has been my spirit's idol. No formal introduction was necessary to
                  tell me that the lovely creature who had riveted my gaze was Annie. Mary's graphic
                  pen, and the description of her friend was accurate. The wild throbbings of my
                  heart proved her identity. It was the same sweet face that had appeared to me in
                  dreams, and inspired me with a desire to compete for the first honors in college,
                  that I might lay them at the feet of her I adored. 'The ancient Greek did not
                  worship the beautiful statue, but the spirit of beauty it enshrined.' It was thus
                  I looked on her peerless form, into her dovelike eyes, and saw the noble purity of
                  her heart. Long and earnestly did I gaze,—and longer still would I have watched
                  her, but the voice of my sister aroused me from further rudeness. She said, with
                  astonishment:
               "'Brother, I never knew you guilty of a breach of etiquette before; come, let me
                  introduce you to Annie.'
               "'Not to-night, Mary, at some other time I will accept your offer; now I am
                  feeling too sad to interest a stranger,' was my reply.
               "Again and again did Annie cross my path, like some visitant from a heavenly
                  sphere; but our private affairs were in such a sad condition, that I never dared
                  to seek her notice. My sister had an indifferent likeness of Annie: this I copied,
                  but her features are too deeply impressed upon the tablet of my memory for time
                  ever to have erased them. Yes," he continued, "for nearly three years, her sweet
                  image has been the bright star that guided me; day and night have I toiled to win
                  laurels that would enable me to seek her heart and hand. But God has ordained it
                  otherwise, and I submit—his will not mine be done. Tell her, Leslie, that if
                  spirits from heaven are permitted to watch over the destiny of mortals, I will
                  protect her from every evil."
               In vain had Leslie entreated him not to exhaust his strength by relating this
                  painful history; but he felt this explanation was due his friend, and struggled
                  hard to appear calm, while he feebly related his sad story of unrequited love. His
                  strength was gradually declining; but, after a much longer interval than before,
                  he continued his story.
               "From my earliest childhood, I displayed a taste for painting; as I grew older it
                  became a passion, and after my father's failure, I determined to turn to good
                  account that talent which God had given me. By practicing the most rigid economy,
                  I was enabled to remain and study in Italy for two years, when I was informed of
                  the death and entire insolvency of my father. My health had begun to decline
                  previous to this, and my only hope was to reach the United states and breathe my
                  last upon the bosom of my dear mother. When I reached London, I found that I could
                  proceed no farther. The few paintings I possessed were the only legacies I could
                  bequeath to the dear ones at home; and by following the advice of a friend, who
                  obtained permission for me to exhibit them in the Royal Academy, I succeeded in
                  disposing of them for their real value.
               "The portrait I intended to forward to my sister; but chancing to hear of your
                  arrival with Lord Huntington, whom I knew to be an admirer of the fine arts, I
                  thought to attract your attention by exhibiting that also. My plan succeeded, and
                  your noble, generous conduct has been the means of cheering the desolate heart of
                  a stranger, in a strange land, far away from kindred and friends, and of adding
                  largely to the poor mite intended for the widow and orphan."
               Hamilton lingered for a few days, but Leslie could not be induced to leave him. He
                  esteemed it quite a privilege to be
                  allowed to administer comfort to that child of God Who patiently waited the call
                  of his Master to enter the realms of eternal rest. If any other inducement was
                  necessary, the artist was the brother of Mary Hamilton, Annie's friend, of whom he
                  had so often heard yet never seen. Hamilton's last day on earth was spent in sweet
                  conversation with his friend. With his own hand, he severed two locks of hair from
                  his head, and placed them in an envelope for the dear ones he was never more to
                  behold on earth.
               "Take them, Leslie," he said, "with my Bible to my mother; tell her I first prized
                  that book because it was her gift; but it became dearer still when I learned its
                  precious truths. It has shielded me in the hour of temptation, and brought me an
                  humble supplicant to the throne of Mercy."
               Another long interval elapsed, and he feebly articulated the words of the holy
                  Simeon:
               "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy
                  salvation."
               His friend soon observed that the gentle spirit was about to take its heavenward
                  flight, and leaned over to catch the last farewell:
               "Mother! Sister! Leslie! Annie! farewell!"
               The words sounded sadly sweet, as fainter and fainter grew the sound, until the
                  last seemed to echo from the gates of heaven.
               
               We must pass over an interval of a few weeks, and welcome our friends, Leslie and
                  Huntington, to the hospitable shores of the United States. With a proud step, and
                  a heart filled with gratitude to God for a prosperous voyage, Leslie sprang to the
                  wharf at Charleston.
               "Come, Huntington," said he, joyously, "let me welcome you to
                     
                        My home, my home, my happy home,
                        Spot ever dear to me!"
                     
                  
               
               Then, in defiance of the hackmen and omnibus drivers' boisterous invitations to
                  the various hotels, they proceeded quietly to the splendid mansion of Leslie's
                  uncle, Colonel Eaton.
               There the favorite nephew and his friend were received with every demonstration of
                  delight. The following day, Leslie bid a short adieu to Lord Huntington, leaving
                  him to the care of Colonel Eaton, while he hurried to his mother's residence,
                  several miles from the city, promising to return with his mother and sister in
                  time for the festival, which Mrs. Eaton determined to give in compliment to her
                  nephew and his friend.
               "Remember, Huntington, you are to see the original of the portrait on the evening
                  of my aunt's party; so amuse yourself in the interim by manufacturing sonnets and
                  pretty speeches to be delivered on that occasion, if not to that particular lady,
                  to some other pair of bright eyes which may enslave you," smilingly said
                  Leslie.
               "Am I to have no clew to the residence and name of this beautiful unknown? Tell me
                  to whom these brilliant sonnets must be addressed."
               "Impossible, my dear friend! I am not at liberty to divulge her name, and besides,
                  she may have concluded to change it during my absence."
               "God forbid!" exclaimed Lord Huntington, laughingly, as he turned from the
                  carriage and entered the house."
               The festive night arrived, and with a style of magnificence seldom witnessed in
                  our republican land, were the saloons of Mrs. Eaton's mansions furnished. Their
                  floors were covered with elegant carpets from the looms of Turkey, on which the
                  heavy warrior's tread cloud scarcely be distinguished from the light footsteps of
                  a tiny child. Curtains tains of the
                  richest silk-damask hung from gilded cornices. Divans, ottomans, and fauteuils of delightful softness invited the weary to
                  repose, and on tables of exquisite workmanship were prettily arranged flowers of
                  the richest fragrance and beauty. Splendid bronze chandeliers with long glittering
                  pendants hung from the frescoed ceiling and threw a bright but softened radiance
                  over the fair scene.
               The beauty and fashion of the city had assembled, and Lord Huntington eagerly
                  watched the face of every newcomer, hoping to trace some resemblance to the
                  painted beauty, but in vain. Disappointment was plainly depicted in his expressive
                  countenance as he turned to meet Leslie, who was then entering for the first
                  time.
               "We met with some detention on the route and could not arrive sooner," Arthur
                  remarked as he grasped the offered hand of Huntington, who said:
               "I have been cruelly disappointed, Leslie, in not seeing among the many beauties
                  present the lady whom I hoped would be here this evening."
               "She will certainly appear directly, as I have been informed, but it is quite
                  early yet."
               "Ah, she is here, it is herself!" exclaimed Huntington, in a strange and excited
                  tone.
               There indeed was the lady, who looked as if she had just stepped from the gilded
                  frame, leaning gracefully on the arm of Colonel Eaton.
               "But more beautiful, more lovely, than the portrait!" his lordship added in an
                  undertone.
               Without waiting for him to recover from the surprise her sudden appearance had
                  occasioned, Leslie took the arm of his friend and hastened to meet the lady, then
                  increased his astonishment by saying:
               "Allow me to introduce, Miss Leslie, my sister, to Lord Huntington."
               Colonel Eaton with his nephew enjoyed the confusion of the elegant lord as he
                  stood awkwardly blushing for the first time in his life before a lovely woman. He
                  was not long, however, in regaining his presence of mind, and said smilingly:
               "Leslie, I was not prepared for this startling announcement. During our long
                  intimacy I never heard of any other than a little sister, and expected to have met
                  a child, and certainly not the familiar face before me."
               "Pardon the stratagem, my dear friend! I have had great difficulty in keeping the
                  secret, and was compelled to call on my uncle and aunt for assistance. Without
                  them I could have had no occasion for presenting Annie to you in a dress similar
                  to the one worn by her three years ago." Then to his sister he said: "Well, Annie,
                  do not look so inquisitive, as if you would read this mystery. Some other time I
                  will explain how I wished to punish an incredulous friend by teasing you to appear
                  in that particular dress. Now I must go to my aunt, who I see has been observing
                  us closely."
               On this fascinating scene we must not linger, nor attempt to describe the
                  happiness of the young nobleman as he promenaded the spacious halls with the
                  beautiful original of that superb portrait by his side, greatly to the annoyance
                  and chagrin of a number of beaus present.
               After participating for a few weeks in the gayeties of the city, the Leslies
                  returned to their home, accompanied by the Eatons and Lord Huntington.
               The latter gentleman appeared delighted with that special locality, and seemed in
                  no haste to commence his tour through the United States. Many were the long walks
                  and drives taken with Annie, and Arthur playfully whispered to her, "that the
                  important question about the portrait would soon be decided."
               
               Soon after his return home, Leslie with his mother sought the residence of Mrs.
                  Hamilton. They found that amiable lady sinking fast under the heavy afflictions
                  which had befallen her. She had long been an invalid, a victim of consumption, and
                  on the reception of the letter containing the sad tidings of her son's death, her
                  feeble nature sunk under the burden of her misfortunes. After a lingering illness
                  she died, calmly, peacefully, resting her hope on the glorious promise of a union
                  in heaven with the dear ones who had gone before, and leaving her gentle Mary, her
                  lovely daughter, the child of sorrow, and of many tears, to the affectionate care
                  of Mrs. Leslie.
               As Leslie and Huntington had determined to remain together during the stay of the
                  latter on this continent, a proposal was made for the whole party to join them and
                  travel through the Northern States into Canada. This plan was readily agreed to,
                  and soon put into execution.
               Mary Hamilton was included in the party. Her consent was reluctantly obtained; but
                  Mrs. Leslie and Annie had decided for her, thinking that an entire change of
                  climate and the excitement of travel would do more toward restoring her health and
                  spirits, than all the drugs of sculapius. The poor orphan struggled hard to
                  suppress her grief and be amused and interested according to the earnest desire of
                  her friends; but the forced smiles and tearful eyes told the sad story of her
                  lonely, troubled heart. Nothing seemed to arouse her to an appreciation of
                  life—its important realities and duties—until she gazed with awe-struck wonder
                  upon the grand and imposing Falls of Niagara. 
                     
                        With head upraised, and look intent,
                        And eye and ear attentive bent,
                        And locks flung back, and lips apart,
                        Like monument of Grecian art,—
                     
                   she stood and gazed with mute rapture upon the glorious spectacle. Then,
                  after some moments, her suspended breath escaped with a deep, quivering sigh, and
                  apparently oblivious of all others, she repeated in a calm, sweet voice: 
                     
                        The thoughts are strange that crowd into my brain
                        While I look upward to thee. It would seem
                        As if God pour'd thee from his hollow hand,
                        And hung his bow upon thy awful front;
                        And spoke in that lov'd voice that seem'd to him
                        Who dwelt in Patmos for his Saviour's sake,
                        The sound of many waters; and had bade
                        Thy flood to chronicle the ages back,
                        And notch his cent'ries in the eternal rocks!
                        Deep calleth unto deep. And what are we
                        That hear the question of that voice sublime?
                        Oh! what are all the notes that ever rung
                        From war's vain trumpet by thy thundering side?
                        Yea, what is all the riot man can make
                        In his short life, to thy unceasing roar?
                        And yet bold babbler, what art thou to Him
                        Who drown'd a world, and heap'd the waters far
                        Above its loftiest mountains? A light wave
                        That breathes and whispers of its Maker's might.
                     
                  
               
               The travelers returned toward the latter part of September with every anticipation
                  realized in regard to the pleasure and benefit of their tour. Lord Huntington
                  parted from Annie Leslie, as his affianced bride, and after an absence of twelve
                  months returned to his home in England.
               The heart of Arthur Leslie was not proof against the beauty and many amiable
                  qualities of Mary Hamilton; and before she had long been an inmate of his mother's
                  family, he surrendered heart, hand, and fortune to the lovely girl. Had it been in
                  the power of Mrs. Leslie and Annie to have chosen from the whole world, their
                  selection for a companion and wife of the son and brother would have been dear
                  Mary Hamilton.
               
               A few months rolled away, and then a large and fashionable party were assembled at
                  the mansion of Mrs. Leslie, to witness the double wedding of Arthur Leslie and
                  Mary Hamilton, followed by Lord Huntington and Annie Leslie. Various were the
                  opinions expressed in regard to the beauty of the two brides. Some gave preference
                  to the composed and dignified Lady Huntington; and others to the gentle, blushing
                  Mrs. Arthur Leslie. The bridal parties embarked for England. Amid smiles and
                  tears, the beautiful Lady Annie bid farewell to her childhood's home and the
                  treasured scenes of early years, to brave the world with him who had won the
                  affection of her heart.
               From the clear blue eyes of Mary Leslie there beamed a quiet happiness, which the
                  tears shed at this brief parting from home could not conceal. The weight of
                  loneliness was removed from her young heart, and she now had the strong affection
                  of a devoted husband to support and strengthen her in every future trial. For the
                  purpose of visiting the resting-place of her artist brother, she decided to
                  accompany Annie to her distant home.
               Long, long years have passed since then, which had strengthened the bonds and
                  accumulated joys and but few sorrows for the bridal pairs; and now after a long
                  interval, the Hon. Mr. Gordon, a son of Lord Huntington and Annie Leslie, had come
                  to the United States for the purpose of visiting his mother's relatives and to
                  view the wonders of the great republic. As Mrs. Herbert and Lady Huntington had
                  been friends in Charleston during their girlhood, their intimacy was renewed in
                  London, and promises were made to exchange visits whenever circumstances would
                  permit. Mr. Gordon had fulfilled his promise, and was now the welcomed and
                  delighted guest of the Herberts.
               The hospitable doors of Belvoir were thrown open to a select circle of congenial
                  friends, and each day and night witnessed some delightful reunion of choice
                  spirits, where conversation, music, and dancing reigned, and whiled the hours
                  away.
               The sports and amusements of the Southern planter's guests during the day were
                  varied, and parties were formed and left to do whatever their inclination might
                  suggest. The smooth and well-trodden roads invited evening rides and drives, which
                  were often extended for miles through the grand and heavily timbered forests,
                  where the silence and stillness of nature were wonderful and awe-inspiring. Game
                  of various kinds abounded, and those who were disposed to hunt added to the varied
                  profusion of the table on their return by the trophies of the chase, and were
                  refreshed and invigorated by the sport and excitement. As evening advanced to its
                  close, a flotilla of light and airy boats enticed them to an exhilarating sail on
                  the beautiful river; and as the parties in picturesque costumes floated gently
                  down the embowered stream, inhaling the perfumes of bays and magnolias, while
                  rich, full voices in softened melody chimed sweetly with the splashing oars, they
                  reminded one of a fleet of gay gondolas.
               Each day's sport and pleasure was concluded by the party assembling en masse at some hospitable mansion, where a gracious
                  welcome and every comfort and luxury awaited them.
               So perfect seemed the machinery that guided these well-ordered establishments,
                  that whether the additional party numbered more than the muses or less than the
                  graces, no perceptible difference was ever apparent to a critical observer. The
                  servants had their particular duties assigned to them, and prided themselves on
                  the skill, order, and system that prevailed in their respective departments,
                  consequently no confusion or disorder ever occurred to disturb the pleasure and
                  quietude of the surprise parties which frequently graced the halls of the Southern
                  planter.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVII.
               
                  
                     
                        All the world's a stage,
                        And all the men and women are merely players;
                        They have their exists, and their entrances,
                        And one man in his time plays many parts.
                     
                  
               
               THE theater was crowded from pit to gallery with a courteous and select audience.
                  The attraction was "The Lady of Lyons."
               When Julia Stanly entered with her party, she immediately became a rallying point
                  for opera-glasses. Of this fact she was perfectly conscious, and as she stood for
                  a moment before taking her seat, and threw a sweeping glance over the assembly,
                  the expression of her face plainly said: "Look and admire! You will find none here
                  to compare with me."
               She seated herself, and brought into requisition her own lorgnette, which was
                  carried by quite an elderly would-be young gentleman, who appeared exceedingly
                  uncomfortable in a new suit of broadcloth, fresh from the hands of a fashionable
                  tailor. He was simpering and giggling like some great shame-faced school-boy, as
                  he endeavored to rehearse the agreeable nonsense and pretty speeches that had been
                  forgotten for more than a quarter of a century. Julia enjoyed admiration—indeed it
                  was the one pleasure of her existence—and in lieu of better company, she listened
                  with pleased attention to his silly flattery, scarcely deigning to notice the
                  entrance of Robert Carlton and Sallie Ridgly, who seated themselves near her.
               The curiosity of the new-comers was aroused to the highest est pitch by the sight
                  of Julia's venerable smirking beau, who was evidently acting a new rle, from the vigorous manner in which he flirted the
                  dainty fan before the face of his inamorata, and gazed admiringly upon her
                  beautiful face. They looked on smilingly and wondered, then at each other, and
                  asked simultaneously:
               "Who can it be?"
               Robert laughed and said:
               "Some old nabob just from the gold diggings;" but not satisfied with this
                  solution, he added:
               "Miss Julia knows of old that you and I were children of inquiring minds,
                  therefore she will not think it strange if we wish to be enlightened in regard to
                  this fossil remain to which her beauty has imparted new life. Ash her?"
               Sallie leaned forward and whispered softly:
               "Julia, if Charlie Herbert was present he might be jealous of your devoted
                  attendant. Who is he?"
               "Mr. Rivers, from Louisiana, a millionaire. Charlie would have no reason to
                  complain if he was here, for then I should have no eyes nor ears for any one
                  else."
               "When did you hear from him, and when will he return?"
               "Don't try to bring me to a confession in public. He says he will not linger."
               Just then there was a general commotion, and lorgnettes were directed toward a
                  party who were entering. Julia Stanly turned to look, and her eyes flashed with
                  wonder, envy, and malice, as she watched Lula Graham glide gracefully into a seat,
                  followed by a gentleman of remarkable personal attractions and decided foreign air
                  who placed himself by her side.
               Julia turned hastily to the party in her rear, and asked abruptly:
               "Mr. Carlton, who is that handsome aristocratic-looking foreigner?"
               
               "It is probably a Prince Royal of England, the Czar of Russia, or the Sultan of
                  Turkey,—I can't locate him precisely," replied Robert Carlton with a quizzical
                  smile, as he noticed her astonishment. After a moment's pause, he added:
               "You may have heard that these rival suitors were contending for the hand of Miss
                  Graham, the queen of beauty and of song. You must play your cards well, Miss
                  Stanly, for probably our republican queen may promote you to the post of maid of
                  honor, as you love and admire her so truly. Then I hope you will endeavor to
                  forward the interest of your humble servant, who aspires to the exalted position
                  of boot-black to his imperial majesty. I always apply myself to the
                     understanding of a person when I desire to secure my own
                  advancement."
               The curtain rose, and very soon Madame Deschappelles says to Pauline:
               "You are born to make a great marriage. Beauty is valuable or worthless according
                  as you invest the property to the best advantage."
               Julia turned to Sallie, and said softly:
               "Those are my sentiments; you had better take them into consideration and profit
                  by the madame's advice."
               "But I cannot find another Charlie Herbert," replied Miss Ridgly.
               "No, that is true, I know; but you may invest with Mr. Rivers,—let me introduce
                  you."
               "Excuse me, if you please; I would advise you to secure the old gentleman for
                  yourself, for fear that Charlie may fly the track; he is young and exposed to a
                  thousand temptations."
               "Oh, he is securely caged, and I hold the key! see for yourself."
               Julia raised her chatelaine and opened a locket,
                  which revealed his photograph, and whispered:
               "Is that tale Robert Carlton told me about Lula Graham's royal suitors really
                  true?"
               Sallie gave a little musical laugh, and answered:
               "How can I tell? He spoke seriously, and is intimate with the family; I should
                  think he ought to know."
               She fell back into her seat, while an amused and irrepressible smile continued
                  upon her lips to the close of the first act.
               The Robert inquired with much interest:
               "What has transpired to disturb your equanimity?"
               "Oh, Julia is very much exercised in regard to Lula's illustrious suitors, and
                  wished to know if your information respecting them is reliable."
               Her companion laughed outright, and his mischievous eyes actually danced with glee
                  at the success of his silly hoax. He said:
               "She believes it implicitly, because she knows Lula merits a superior destiny; but
                  at the same time she would prefer seeing her ferried by Charon over the River
                  Styx, rather than have her sail across the Atlantic in a royal vessel to occupy a
                  throne, and wear the richest crown that the Old World could offer. Did I not see
                  her exhibit a photograph just now as indifferently as an Indian would the scalp of
                  his murdered victim?"
               "Yes," was the laughing reply.
               "Tell me who the unfortunate creature is, that I may ask the prayers of the Church
                  in his behalf."
               "I'm afraid you would not survive the announcement."
               "Try me; I will nerve myself for the startling disclosure"
               "I think you will run a fearful risk, but I would sacrifice my present hopes of a
                  lover to find out how she got it in her possession."
               "If you don't tell me quickly, these good people will be treated to a tragedy which the bill does not call
                  for, as I shall expire from curiosity."
               "Then brace yourself for the trying ordeal. I am given to understand that it is
                  the photograph of her betrothed lover, Mr. Charles Herbert."
               "Great Jupiter! Who?"
               His loud exclamation and merry laugh startled the entire assembly as the curtain
                  rose for the second act. At length, after many ineffectual attempts to subdue his
                  laughter, he finally succeeded in a measure, and divided his attention between the
                  stage and the actors before him.
               The old gentleman appeared completely fascinated with Julia's brilliant beauty,
                  while he ogled and simpered incessantly as he plied with energy and perseverance
                  the delicate snowy-plumed fan, which being totally unfitted for such vigorous
                  handling, was growing beautifully less as the white down arose from the wreck and
                  floated in the air.
               Julia sought to attract the notice of Lula's distinguished escort by engaging her
                  in conversation, but this attempt was met by the orphan girl with such frigid
                  politeness that the artful creature was completely foiled, and forced back upon
                  her antique admirer for companionship.
               In the second act, Claude Melnotte, in passionate tones, paints 
                     The home to which, could love fulfill its prayers,
                   he would lead Pauline. 
                     
                        A palace lifting to eternal summer
                        Its marble walls, from out a glossy bower
                        Of coolest foliage musical with birds,
                        Whose songs should syllable thy name! At noon
                        We'd sit beneath the arching vines, and wonder
                        Why Earth could be unhappy, while the Heavens
                        Still left us youth and love! We'd have no friends
                        That were not lovers; no ambition, save
                        To excel them all in love; we'd read no books
                        That were not tales of love—that we might smile
                        To think how poorly eloquence of words
                        Translates the poetry of hearts like ours!
                        And when night came, amidst the breathless Heavens
                        We'd guess what star should be our home when love
                        Becomes immortal; while the perfumed light
                        Stole through the mists of alabaster lamps,
                        And every air was heavy with the sighs
                        Of orange groves and music from sweet lutes,
                        And murmurs of low fountains that gush forth
                        I' the midst of roses!—Dost thou like the picture?
                     
                  
               
               During this recital Mr. Rivers ceased to wave the fan, and fixed his dull eyes on
                  the speaker. When it was ended, his gaze was again riveted on the lovely face at
                  his side, and he said, in a quick, nervous, husky voice:
               "'Tis thus I would Woo thee. Dost thou like the picture?"
               Then, as if ashamed of expressing his feelings so ardently, he blushed like some
                  overgrown school-boy, fell back upon his seat, and renewed the fanning process
                  more vigorously than before.
               Julia looked up to his face, and remarked, softly and tenderly:
               "Beautiful, beautiful. Who could not be won by such a picture?"
               This speech had on the elderly swain the effect of a plunge into the fabled
                  fountain of Ponce de Leon: his courage was restored, his tongue was unloosed, and
                  he chatted and giggled until Robert Carlton exclaimed indignantly:
               "I really believe the old Snap's tongue is fixed on a pivot to run at both
                  ends."
               Sallie laughed, and said:
               "Robert, unless you hold your own tongue I shall disgrace myself, and you too, by
                  laughing. Almost every eye in the house
                  has been on us, and I have scarcely been able to hear a word of the play. I fear
                  they will hiss us presently."
               "Fiddlesticks! the actors on the stage are humbugs compared to those in front of
                  us. I believe the next is the last act, and I shall be strongly tempted to give
                  that old coon a silent nudge to listen and heed when General Damas vents his
                  indignatien on the fickleness and faithlessness of woman, for Miss Julia is
                  willfully leading him on into the broad road to destruction. Alas! poor Charlie!
                  friend of my childhood and youth! My heart bleeds in secret for the woes that
                  await thee," he added in mock-tragic tones; then burying his face in his
                  handkerchief, he laughed immoderately.
               Sallie tried to maintain her gravity, and when his paroxysm was over, she asked,
                  artlessly:
               "Robert, how do you suppose she possessed herself of that photograph?"
               "Not honestly, I can assure you. I have given the matter serious consideration,
                  and the result of my cogitations is that she is in league with the Evil One, and
                  if Charlie gave her his likeness, she has visited him in slumber and anointed his
                  eyes with some magic ointment, thereby blotting out all remembrance of the past
                  and causing her to appear to him as beautiful in mind as she is in person. But
                  after her cruelty toward Lula, whom she has reviled and backbitten until his
                  Satanic Majesty might have vetoed the slander, to see his photograph dangling from
                  the chatelaine of that treacherous girl, is
                  enough to make the Pope of Rome rend his pontifical robes and swear like a
                  trooper, or cause the Angel Gabriel to give a sudden blast of his trumpet in order
                  to stop such absurd and outrageous wickedness. The idea is so perfectly ridiculous
                  that I can only laugh at it, and I suspect that if Charlie was aware of the fact,
                  he would be as much amused as ourselves."
               They turned their attention to the stage, and listened quietly until Damas was
                  convinced that Pauline had consented to a divorce; then Sallie arrested Robert's
                  hand, as he threatened and made a feint of asking the enamored old gentleman to
                  give his attention to the following soliloquy: 
                     
                        The man who sets his heart upon a woman
                        Is a chameleon, and doth feed on air!
                        From air he takes his colors, holds his life,—
                        Changes with every wind,—grows lean or fat;
                        Rosy with hope, or green with jealousy,
                        Or pallid with despair—just as the gale
                        Varies from north to south—from heat to cold!
                        Oh, woman, woman! thou should'st have few sins
                        Of thine own to answer for! Thou art the author
                        Of such a book of follies in a man,
                        That it would need the tears of all the angels
                        To blot the record out!
                     
                  
               
               Robert had watched the actions of the venerable gallant during this speech with
                  evident interest, and saw that it had fallen unheeded upon his listless ear, and,
                  turning to his companion, he remarked:
               "It was like casting pearls before swine. The unfortunate old man is done for; he
                  is as crazy as a loon, and a fit subject 
                     For treason, stratagem, and spoils.
                   To win her, he would, if she asked it, rob the corpse of his father, strangle
                  his mother to get the gold plate from her false teeth, and lead his brother or
                  sister to the gallows. When an old fellow like him falls into the clutches of an
                  artful, designing young woman, he is more to be dreaded than a pack of hungry
                  prairie wolves, or the wild beasts of the Coliseum. Its effect, at least, is fatal
                  to all former friendship. God pity the deluded old creature! for she never will.
                  It is the old story of the moth caught by glare being enacted again; he will never know his danger
                  until he loses the liberty of action."
               When the play was ended, Lula Graham stopped in passing out to speak with Robert
                  and Sallie, and invited them to meet a few friends at Belvoir on the next
                  evening.
               Julia heard the invitation, and manœuvred in vain to secure one for herself; but
                  Lula was proof against her cunning wiles, and drew coldly back from the proffered
                  kiss and cordial embrace which the treacherous girl was prepared to give in order
                  to extort the coveted wish that she would compose one of the party.
               Robert Carlton was an amused spectator of this interesting scene; and as Lula drew
                  back with the grace and dignity of an empress from the heartless beauty, he could
                  scarcely resist the impulse that prompted him to applaud with rapture the movement
                  of righteous indignation on the part of the lovely orphan. After leaving the house
                  with his companion, he remarked, laughingly:
               "I suspect Miss Julia has learned a lesson this evening that will probably make a
                  lasting impression, and cause her to look before she leaps into a lady's arms
                  again. I am glad to find that Miss Lula had sufficient courage to administer that
                  rebuke in public. It was a severe chastisement to the pride and dignity of the
                  haughty girl, who will from henceforth proclaim guerre
                     mort against our gentle friend. If a few ladies would follow the
                  example of Miss Lula, a cessation might be put to this abominable practice of
                  promiscuous kissing in public. I have seen sober matrons, sentimental young
                  ladies, and tiny school misses kiss apparently with genuine fondness, and then
                  turn away and abuse each other as they would some pickpocket or hardened,
                  impenitent convict."
               "Oh, Robert, in mercy, do not suppose Julia Stanly to be a criterion of our sex!"
                  was Sallie's reply.
               "No, I acknowledge there are few exceptions; but still there are many of the same
                  type as herself. I believe the Bible mentions one woman out of whom seven devils
                  were cast, and the supposition is that others of the sex were similarity
                  afflicted."
               "Take care: you are foiled by your own weapon; for the sacred book just alluded to
                  speaks of a man who said his name was Legion—you know the rest. This would
                  indicate a superior wickedness in the sterner sex."
               The thought that Robert Carlton has witnessed with gratified pleasure this
                  mortifying repulse, added to Julia's chagrin, and with flashing eyes and increased
                  hatred toward her rival, she mentally exclaimed:
               "The pauper may queen it over me awhile longer; but whether that story about her
                  foreign lovers be true or false, her reign at Belvoir will soon be over, or my
                  name is not Julia Stanly!"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               
                  
                     
                        Though fools spurn Hymen's gentle powers,
                        We, who improve his golden hours,
                        By sweet experience know
                        That marriage, rightly understood,
                        Gives to the tender and the good
                        A paradise below.
                     
                  
               
               MR. CARLTON was waiting at the depot for Alice, who returned with young Herbert
                  late in the afternoon of the day of Annie Sunderland's wedding.
               The affectionate father folded his weary, heart-sick child to his bosom, while
                  perfumed zephyrs fanned her pale face, and mocking-birds trilled forth their glad
                  songs from the bowing trees, as if to welcome the exile back to her childhood's
                  home.
               Charlie was agreeably surprised on his return to find Mr. Gordon, whom he had
                  frequently met in Europe, a guest at Belvoir.
               Lula was with Annie, and no time was allowed for a tte--tte with his mother, and after a hasty toilet he left with the
                  party for the wedding.
               They arrived at Mr. Sunderland's just in time for Charlie to take his place as
                  groomsman amid the brilliant cortege, which soon
                  passed into the brightly illuminated parlors.
               The rustle of footsteps was heard on the India matting, and down the vista of open
                  rooms, "snowy draperies, like fleecy clouds in the distance," were seen
                  approaching, as Dr. Hall arose and stood in the center of that airy suite of
                  parlors, which were redolent with sweet flowers.
               The cortege formed a semicircle around him, and after an affectionate address, and
                  a solemn, impressive prayer, which drew tears from the eyes of many, he pronounced
                  "Dr. Henry Clinton and Annie Sunderland husband and wife."
               The soft lace veil was thrown back, and exposed the sweet blushing face of the
                  bride, radiant with delicate loveliness.
               Congratulations were showered upon the bridal pair from every quarter, and the
                  noisy hum of pleasant voices soon produced delightful confusion in the rooms.
               Miss Clinton, the doctor's sister, a stylish, interesting-looking girl, and a
                  stranger to the company, had been assigned to the care of Charlie Herbert,
                  consequently it was some time before he could leave her to speak with his
                  friends.
               Finally, other gentleman were introduced to the lady, and just then an agreeable
                  smile and bow of recognition from Lula, who stood on the opposite side of the
                  room, conversing with Mr. Gordon, attracted our hero's attention. He was crossing
                  the floor to speak with her, when Julia Stanly appeared suddenly before him, and
                  adroitly dropped her fan.
               She had watched him with that keenness of vision peculiar to the hawk, when about
                  to pounce upon its victim, gradually contracting her circular movements until a
                  fit opportunity occurred for securing and taking possession of the prize.
               Ostensibly, she appeared to be leaving the room, but in reality her object was to
                  attract his notice.
               As he stooped for the fan, she remarked:
               "Ah, Mr. Herbert! I am delighted to welcome you home again. I find the heat of the
                  parlor somewhat oppressive, and was about seeking the fresh air."
               He offered his arm—a promenade on the front gallery was proposed, and acceded
                  to.
               
               Charlie was not at all averse to be entertained by the cheerful gossip of this
                  dark-eyed Georgian, glorious in the wealth of her regal charms.
               As they stepped out on the veranda, he said:
               "Miss Julia, the reception of your photograph was an agreeable surprise to me in
                  New York. It has been a constant reminder of your generous sympathy."
               "As I intended it should be," she replied.
               While they walked to and fro before the open window, his watchful eye continually
                  sought one bright, particular divinity, who was arrayed in a gauzy robe of virgin
                  white, with a rich circlet of pearls around her lovely neck, which rivaled them in
                  purity. She stood with graceful composure and queenly dignity beside Mr. Gordon,
                  the aristocratic young Englishman, who looked with intense admiration into her
                  dark-blue eyes. Other admirers approached her also, with as much respect as loyal
                  subjects would their sovereign. Yet Alfred was not among them.
               "What could this truant knight be thinking of, to expose his peerless fiancee so long to the admiration of that handsome
                  stranger?" thought Charlie, and he vainly sought among the assembly for the
                  missing lover.
               Mr. Herbert soon came to the rescue, and said:
               "Charlie, I cannot allow you to monopolize Miss Stanly any longer, for I desire to
                  introduce her to my young friend, Mr. Gordon;" then to Julia he observed
                  smilingly: "You cannot object to making his acquaintance, Miss Stanly, as he is
                  handsome, wealthy, and wise, besides being one of the noblemen of his native
                  land."
               He drew her hand within his arm, and they walked into the house.
               Charlie followed in their rear, and soon clasped, with genuine affection, the hand
                  of Lula, who said:
               "Oh, Charlie! I am so glad to see you; so glad that you came in time for the
                  ceremony. I have been harassed by a hundred fears that some accident would prevent
                  your reaching here at the appointed time."
               Her voice was so artlessly sweet that he was convinced of her sincerity.
               "And I am so happy to meet you, Birdie."
               He spoke with more real pleasure than he had experienced for weeks.
               But some painful memory soon appeared to cast a shadow over his cheerful face. He
                  had striven to take an unselfish view of her engagement with Raymond, and to
                  maintain toward her that fraternal love which had ever characterized his
                  intercourse with her, but his efforts were in vain; yet he determined to conceal
                  the rebellious emotions of his heart, and meet her as a brother should after so
                  long an absence.
               In an agitated voice he asked:
               "Where is Raymond, Lula? I have not seen him tonight."
               He waited in breathless silence for her reply, but none came. The little hand
                  which had rested lightly on his arm pressed more heavily, and he saw her cheeks
                  suddenly pale beneath his gaze.
               At last she gasped, in scarcely audible tones:
               "Don't ask me, Charlie; he has gone—I know not where."
               As painful as this brief reply was to her, it sent a thrill of joy, with electric
                  speed, through his heart. It was to him the "elixir of life." Happiness might
                  return, and radiant hope was weaving sweet garlands of peace for the future.
               He pressed her hand silently, and said:
               "Come with me on the veranda, Birdie; this room is too crowded and warm for
                  you."
               He led her through the open window, and scarcely waited for her flowing train to
                  clear the low sill before he asked, in tremulous tones:
               
               "Birdie, are you engaged to Alfred Raymond?"
               "Why, Charlie, certainly not."
               Her truthful, eyes were filled with wonder and amazement as she looked up to his
                  face.
               Just then Robert Carlton suddenly appeared before them, and said:
               "Ah, Miss Lula! don't think to elude my vigilant eye by hiding beneath this
                  vine-clad bower! I saw Charlie lead you out, and came to frustrate his design by
                  claiming a fulfillment of your promise to sing that exquisite air from Flotow's
                  opera of Martha, 'M'Appari-Tutt-Amor.'"
               "Wait a few moments, Carlton. The heat was rather oppressive in the parlors, and I
                  brought her out to breathe the pure air. Besides, you should remember that this is
                  the first time I have seen or spoken with her since my return," remarked
                  Charlie.
               "Nonsense, Herbert! The parlors are delightfully cool. See how the sweet south
                  wind, laden with the perfume of a thousand flowers, comes through the open
                  windows, and wafts those richly-wrought lace curtains to and fro. In answer to
                  your last objection, you have only to look, and see that she is well and as
                  charming as ever. 'Veni, vidi, vici,' is written of her brow; and that proud,
                  aristocratic young Englishman is as ready and willing as any of our backwoods
                  gentry to throw himself at her feet."
               "Hush, Robert! I will comply with your request immediately, in order to check this
                  absurd flattery," she said, taking his arm and walking away.
               Julia Stanly was standing with Mr. Gordon near the piano, when Lula took her seat
                  before the instrument—and Robert noted the look of withering scorn which the proud
                  beauty cast upon the gentle girl—and said, laughingly:
               "Miss Stanly, you have wounded a great many silly fellows' hearts, but until you
                  number music among your accomplishments you cannot be a successful man-killer. I
                  have heard it said that when the negroes of Madeira wish to catch lizards they
                  always accompany the chase by whistling some tune, which has the effect of drawing
                  great numbers to them. I could tell you of venomous serpents being charmed by the
                  voice of a siren, and if the small animals are affected by the magic of music, you
                  cannot wonder at its fatal power on the hearts of men."
               Julia felt herself at the mercy of her tormentor, therefore wisely concluded to
                  smother her wrath, and mildly replied:
               "I regret exceedingly my deficiency in that respect, but really it requires so
                  much time and patience to become a proficient in the delightful art, that I
                  decided long since to abandon it, and devoted my leisure hours to something more
                  practical."
               "Your decision is truly commendable, and accords with your well-known utilitarian
                  ideas," was Robert's ironical reply.
               Here this amusing by-play was interrupted by the sweet rippling notes of the
                  prelude from the piano, which instantly produced a lull throughout the gay and
                  cheerful party.
               Julia again plead the heat of the room, and Mr. Gordon courteously accompanied the
                  artful out into the open air.
               When Charlie was left alone he turned to gaze on the starlit heavens, and to
                  analyze the tumultuous joy that was throbbing in his breast, as he listened to the
                  enchanting melody of Lula's voice. Louder and louder grew the strain, until the
                  whole atmosphere seemed full of delicious sounds. "Like an exhalation of rich
                  distilled perfume," it rose higher and higher, until his fancy bore it beyond the
                  skies, where angels caught the sweet strain,— 
                     And God lends his ear, well pleased to hear.
                  
               
               
               Alone in the starlight, bright random thoughts of a conflicting nature dashed
                  rapidly through his mind.
               "Not engaged to Raymond! Oh, what joy!"
               What peace now reigned in his heart! But why? Could she ever be more than a sister
                  to him? He remembered her own admission, which was repeated to him by Julia
                  Stanly, had placed this question beyond the shadow of a doubt.
               He fell again into the "slough of despond."
               Yet Julia had said that Lula was betrothed; and he asked himself: "Could the
                  beautiful girl possible have spoken falsely in uttering those words also which had
                  pierced his heart as a barbed arrow?"
               This suspicion of her veracity came with lightning-force upon his doubting mind,
                  and caused his spirits to mount immediately above zero; and the memory of Dr.
                  Hall's examination, and Raymond's suspicions of Julia's treachery toward Lula at
                  that time, suddenly arose like a taunting specter before him, and he stood
                  appalled as he thought of being duped by the artful girl.
               He was aroused from his reverie by voices neat him, and soon recognized the
                  presence of Mr. Gordon and Miss Stanly—then heard the former remark:
               "What an exquisite voice Miss Graham has! for power and sweetness I have heard it
                  surpassed by an amateur."
               "Yes, she sings well, but one could expect nothing less from the daughter of a
                  music teacher."
               "What! Miss Graham the daughter of a music teacher!" cried Mr. Gordon, in
                  amazement. "Surely, Miss Stanly, you mistake. She has nothing of the plebeian in
                  her appearance. Perhaps you have been misinformed in regard to her descent."
               "No, indeed! I know her well. Her mother was quite poor, and unable to pay her
                  board—she died, and left her child to work out the debt. Mrs. Herbert found her
                  occupying a servant's position in some obscure family, and after paying the
                  mother's bills, the good lady was allowed to take the child, and I believe has
                  adopted her. More than this I cannot say—of her ancestry I know nothing, nor does
                  any one else; but the young lady is tolerated and admitted into society on account
                  of the Herberts," was Miss Julia's contemptuous reply.
               Charlie's ears were opened, the scales had fallen from his eyes, and he saw that
                  her magnificent form concealed the black heart of a fiend.
               Stepping from beneath the shadow of the vine which had concealed him from their
                  sight, he approached her, every nerve quivering with suppressed anger, and
                  said;
               "Miss Stanly, allow me to enlighten you in regard to the history of Miss Lula
                  Graham. Her mother was an accomplished and handsome woman, the belle of
                  Charleston, south Carolina, until her marriage with Mr. Graham, a prominent
                  merchant of that city; and her father, Mr. Wilmot, was among the most wealthy and
                  influential men of that State. My mother was an orphan, who was reared in his
                  house as a child of his own, and as a sister of Mrs. Graham. I know of no one who
                  has reason to be prouder of her ancestry than has Lula Graham. They were all noble
                  men and women, without a stain upon their escutcheons. Furthermore, she is heiress
                  to a handsome estate, independent of my father, who claims her by love and
                  adoption."
               Then, after a pause, he continued:
               "I imagined these facts were well known in the community, but it appears that I
                  was mistaken as regards Miss Stanly, her professed friend."
               Then bowing, he entered the house a wiser man than when he left it.
               Julia was overwhelmed with shame and confusion, and the following thoughts revolved in the mind of the
                  crest-fallen girl:
               "Oh! Would that the earth could have opened and swallowed me before that base
                  falsehood blackened my heart in his presence! Oh, hateful tongue! I could almost
                  wrench you from my throat for giving vent to such envious, malicious lies before
                  him—for blasting my cherished hopes of reigning over Belvoir. Oh! curses on the
                  head of that baby-faced creature, who is continually tempting me to sin, which is
                  followed by open shame!"
               But she determined to conceal her chagrin from the handsome stranger, and with a
                  careless toss of her head, said:
               "I am very sorry Mr. Herbert heard my remarks, but I told the tale as it was told
                  to me. There is no doubt about Mrs. Graham having been a music teacher in this
                  city,—hundreds can testify to the fact, though I will not pretend to unravel the
                  mystery. He cannot deny, however, that Lula is an accomplished coquette, Mr.
                  Gordon, and my advice to you is: 
                     
                        Beware of her smile, for many a wile
                        Lies hid in the smile of Miss Graham."
                     
                  
               
               "Forewarned is forearmed. I am fully aware of my perilous position, yet am not
                  able to decide whether I shall be in greater danger from the soft eye of blue or
                  the brilliant black, which says: 
                     
                        Come and worship my ray,
                        By adoring perhaps you may move me,"
                     
                   he replied, pleasantly, bowing to her.
               Then the brilliant blacks darted a lightning glance to ward him, of
                  such splendor that it might have tempted a cowled monk to forsake his cloister,
                  with forbidden thoughts of Cupid and Hymen.
                     
                        Oh what a depth of witchcraft lies
                        In the small orb!
                     
                  
               
               As they continued their promenade, Mr. Gordon remarked:
               "I know of no man who has a surer prospect of happiness before him than Dr.
                  Clinton. Just see with what a proud, contented look he watches the graceful
                  movements of his lovely bride! Her bright, cheerful, spiritual face will prove a
                  certain panacea for the ills of domestic life and an antidote for every trouble.
                  To me she appears 
                     
                        A perfect woman, nobly plann'd,
                        To warn, to comfort, and command;
                        And yet a spirit still and bright,
                        With something of an angel light,"
                     
                  
               
               "I think she seems no less satisfied with her choice," said Julia.
               "Marriage is regarded in society as a lottery, but I should imagine that she had
                  drawn a prize of immense value, for Dr. Clinton is a noble-looking man, and one of
                  sterling worth, I judge, whom neither temptation nor ridicule could sway from the
                  path of duty. Miss Stanly, you must observe that I am a firm believer in the
                  science of physiognomy; but excuse me, I weary you with this catalogue of your
                  friends virtues, which of course is nothing new to you," he said, as he noticed
                  her abstraction.
               "Not at all, I am all attention."
               Still doubting the sincerity of her assertion, Mr. Gordon sought to amuse his
                  companion, and said:
               "Speaking of marriage as a lottery, I am reminded of a certain handsome Irish
                  friend of mine, who was the owner of a very slim purse, and no prospect ahead
                  except a tedious term of service in the army during a long interval of peace. One
                  evening, at a crowded assembly, where he was a general favorite, he bewailed his
                  unhappy condition in serio-comical
                  comical tones, and offered himself as a grand prize in a lottery of five thousand
                  tickets. The novelty of the scheme created quite a sensation among the belles, and
                  tickets were in great demand. Some bought a half dozen or more. A pretty little
                  heiress, who engaged in the wild freak for amusement, drew the prize. Thereupon
                  young Patrick threw himself at her feet and vowed eternal allegiance; and Cupid
                  hurled a dart from his bright, pleading eyes into the fair lady's heart, and they
                  twain became one flesh, and, so far as the world knows, have never repented of
                  their reckless game of chance."
               "Perhaps they were contented with their lot, but I think no prudent and sagacious
                  woman should submit her prospect for future peace and bliss to mere chance," said
                  Julia.
               Before the close of the evening Robert Carlton offered his heart and hand to Lula
                  Graham.
               Lula was in despair. Her first affaire d'amour
                  was one of painful, bitter remembrance, and she feared and trembled at the thought
                  of another. She refused him gently but firmly.
               He did not urge his suit with the frantic desperation of Alfred, but yielded at
                  once to her decision, replying, sadly:
               "You are right, Lula, I am indeed unworthy of you. Let us remain friends
                  forever."
               "Oh, Robert! you can never find a better or a stancher friend than your little
                  playmate will ever be to you," she exclaimed, with great fervor.
               Poor Robert appreciated the kindness of the gentle girl in wishing to soothe his
                  mortification, and endeavored to conceal from her the terrible wound that his
                  sensitive nature had received.
               He wrapped the soft shawl carefully around her, and followed her to the carriage,
                  then pressing the little hand, he bade her "good night" as tenderly and cheerfully
                  as he would have done his sister.
               He watched her until the carriage was out of sight, and turned with a sigh and
                  aching heart in another direction—away from home.
               Lula went on her way rejoicing in the thought that Robert Carlton was content to
                  remain forever her sincere and esteemed friend.
               During that midnight drive to Belvoir Mr. Gordon was enthusiastic in expressing
                  his admiration of the beautiful array of grace and fashion which had greeted him
                  in this republican land, where true merit formed its aristocracy. He saw that
                  although every lady was a queen she bore her regal honors with meekness and grace;
                  and observed among the gentlemen, genuine specimens of nature's noblemen, that
                  courtly pomp and display, which attract the attention and gratify the fancy of
                  travelers in continental. Europe as well as in his own loved island, were
                  counter-balanced by the tasteful and beautiful arrangement characteristic of
                  Southern hospitality.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIX.
               
                  
                     
                        Father of Light! great God of Heaven!
                        Hear'st thou the accents of despair?
                        Can guilt like man's be e'er forgiven?
                        Can vice atone for crimes by prayer?
                        Father of Light! on thee I call!
                        Thou see'st my soul is dark within;
                        Thou who can'st mark the sparrow's fall,
                        Avert from me the death of sin.
                     
                  
               
               INSTEAD of returning to his home on that memorable night after the wedding, Robert
                  Carlton sought refuge in one of those fashionable drinking saloons, earth's
                  pandemonium, 
                     
                        The high capital
                        Of Satan and his peers,
                     
                   where the young, thoughtless, and gay, the heart-sick and world-weary, are
                  enticed to seek oblivion from its sparkling fountains, and 
                     
                        Drink night away
                        Till rising dawn.
                     
                  
               
               The history of these fashionable dens of modern civilization is written in blood,
                  and no other institution has entailed so much misery on society. There the
                  affectionate husband, son, and brother imbibe the fatal poison of domestic
                  happiness, which converts the quiet home into an earthly purgatory. There the
                  deadly stab is often given to honor and reputation. The habitue of these luxurious resorts finds it necessary to partake of
                  the tempting ruby or amber-colored liquors before each meal, and returns peevish
                  and discontented to a pleasant home, where a loving ing wife and bright, joyous
                  little ones have eagerly watched his coming. But, alas! their fond caresses are
                  embittered by the odor of strong waters, and words of endearment are met by him
                  with fierce and bitter reproaches. Then, discontented and unhappy, this man, who
                  was fashioned after God's image, returns to the tempter, until self-respect is
                  lost, and he mingles only with degraded companions. Reputation suffers, public
                  esteem is withdrawn, and the hopeless inebriate, after a course of folly and
                  sinfulness, sinks into an untimely grave, unloved and unregretted, entailing
                  misery, penury, and want upon innocent children, who will blush for the tarnished
                  name of their father. Nor are the evils confined to them alone, but entire
                  families are made to suffer from this selfish indulgence. Devoted parents, who
                  fondly hoped that the noble boy, whom they had reared with vigilant care, would
                  become the staff and support of their declining years; the sisters, who had
                  watched with pure and disinterested pride the expansion of his intellect
                  anticipating for him a brilliant career of usefulness; the blushing bride, who had
                  sundered every tie that bound her to her childhood's home, trusting to the promise
                  that he would love and cherish her, have all seen their hopes blighted by the
                  intoxicating liquids which flow from these fountains of Bacchus.
               There the unhappy, unwary, Robert Carlton was waited upon by the obsequious
                  attendant of the saloon, and soon was partially under the influence of the
                  tempter.
               Some frivolous remarks passed between himself and an inmate of the house of the
                  name of Harper, and immediately afterward abusive language and high-sounding words
                  were bandied.
               Harper was completely under the influence of the "riotous god," but Robert's
                  reason had not entirely deserted him, and he endeavored to effect an honorable
                  retreat. But his antagonist refused to
                  let him escape, and followed him into the street with a loaded pistol.
               Harper's friends finally induced him to return to the house, and used every
                  argument in their power to convince him that no insult was offered by young
                  Carlton, but it was all in vain.
               The suspicious agrarian swore vengeance against his adversary, and said: "I will
                  have the blood of that purse-proud aristocrat yet."
               As Robert strolled leisurely along the deserted streets he was surprised to see
                  Harper approaching him from the opposite direction, with his hand grasping a
                  pistol within his bosom, and a loathing, vindictive scowl darkening his brow.
               Robert betrayed no emotion, but walked on, and fearlessly met him.
               As they passed each other Harper's unsteady hand drew his weapon, and it flashed
                  before the eyes of Carlton.
               He was in the act of firing a second time when Robert instinctively drew his
                  pistol and fired with deliberate aim.
               The ball entered the unfortunate man's shoulder, and he fell wounded.
               Robert gazed horror-stricken on the deed he had committed, and was about kneeling
                  to soothe the suffering his own hand had caused, when a coarse but friendly voice
                  called out:
               "Fly, Mr. Carlton! fly! the blood-hounds of the law will soon be on your track. To
                  the river! to the river—quick! You served him right, for he is a meddlesome,
                  hot-headed fellow; but be quick—I'll see you safe across the river."
               Robert recognized the voice of Mr. Jones, an honest man and faithful friend, and
                  saw the necessity of following his advice at once; and they walked off hurriedly
                  to the river.
               The report of fire-arms soon attracted a crowd to the spot, and among them was a
                  friend of Harper, who had followed him from the saloon, hoping to prevent a
                  difficulty, but unfortunately was too remote from the scene of action to
                  interfere.
               Notwithstanding the crowd and excitement, young Carlton with his friend passed the
                  policemen unmolested, and effected his escape.
               Some one who had gone to Harper's assistance remarked:
               "This is a mortal wound, and young Carlton must not be allowed to escape
                  punishment."
               "It was a d——d cowardly act, for he fired after Harper passed," said another.
               "Yes, that is plainly seen, for the wound is back of the shoulder," cried a
                  third.
               "Why don't they arrest the murderer?" exclaimed several voices—and the excitement
                  and confusion usually attendant upon such a catastrophe were manifested throughout
                  the crowd.
               Still nobody ventured to pursue him.
               The suffering man was carried to his home, and the house was soon filled with
                  sounds of weeping, lamentation, and woe, for the unfortunate husband and
                  father.
               The surgeons were called in—they examined the wound, and after a grave and lengthy
                  consultation, decided that the ball must be extracted. This was accordingly done;
                  but, alas! the wounded man sunk under the operation.
               Toward the close of the next day he breathed his last.
               Then the excitement among his friends became intense to arrest the murderer. Their
                  revenge called for his immediate execution under the code of Judge Lynch, rather
                  than await the slow process of the common law.
               But their intended victim could not be found.
               
               Scouts were sent out in every direction, rewards were offered, but without
                  effect.
               The unfortunate Robert, who had only obeyed the first law of nature in protecting
                  himself, was more sinned against than sinning, in the commission of the awful
                  deed; and now with a broken heart and contrite spirit, was a wanderer far from his
                  native home.
               "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us."
               It was thus that some of the dead man's friends prayed night and morning, at the
                  family altar and in the house of God on the Sabbath. Then rising, they would go
                  out on the thoroughfares, and eagerly inquire, with brutal vengeance in their
                  hearts, "If there were any tidings of Carlton, the murderer?"
               That poor storm-tossed wanderer, who, only to spare the feelings of his
                  high-minded father and heart-broken mother, had consented to fly from the cruel
                  wrath of his persecutors.
               Oh, ye Pharisees! take care; that prayer is an abomination in the sight of the
                  Lord. He will reject it with abhorrence unless you will freely forgive.
               "For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your Heavenly Father will also forgive
                  you: but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive
                  your trespasses."
               
               On the morning after the unfortunate occurrence alluded to, as the family at
                  Belvoir lingered over their late breakfast, in pleasant conversation respecting
                  events which took place at the bridal reception, the door-bell announced a
                  visitor.
               A servant appeared, and handed Charlie a note, saying:
               "An immediate answer is requested."
               Young Herbert glanced hastily at its contents and turned pale; then leaping from
                  his chair, said quickly:
               "Robert, order my horse immediately."
               After the servant left the room, Charlie said:
               "Father, let me speak with you."
               Father and son left the apartment together, leaving the others trembling with
                  doubt and anxiety in regard to the contents of the mysterious missive.
               The letter was from Robert Carlton, informing his friend of the sad affair, which
                  would probably brand the writer as a murderer.
               The unhappy young man begged that Charlie would come to him immediately, and that
                  Mr. Herbert would go to Mr. Carlton and give a true version of the matter. He
                  wrote:
               "Let Mr. Herbert say to my dear parents, that I do solemnly declare before God and
                  man, that up to the moment when this deed was committed, I had no-thought of
                  malice, much less of murder, in my heart, although I had borne so much from this
                  man, only that I might spare their loving hearts sorrow and trouble.
               "But when he approached, I saw him grasp some concealed weapon, and fix his eyes
                  on me with deadly hatred. I instinctively seized my own pistol, and turned to look
                  after him as he passed. Just then he fired, and his murderous weapon flashed
                  before my eyes.
               "O father! O mother! forgive your son; could human nature stand more? Could any
                  one with the least spark of manhood resist the first law of nature in attempting
                  to defend himself? While his pistol was again pointed at my breast I fired—and he
                  fell."
               The letter continued:
               "Father—mother—I know you will credit the statement of your unhappy boy; for he
                  has never told you a falsehood. I would freely give my life if I could restore
                  Harper to his family. But for your sake I will not surrender myself into the hands
                  of an excited populace, otherwise I
                  would be utterly indifferent as to the result, for the charms of life have
                  departed forever."
               Mrs. Herbert was taken into the confidence of her husband and son, and hastily
                  dispatched each one his special mission.
               Charlie was attended by Robert's trusty messenger, and Mr. Herbert proceeded to
                  announce the sad tidings to Mr. Carlton, his friend and neighbor.
               Unpleasant rumors usually travel with telegraphic speed; hence Mr. Herbert was not
                  surprised to find the family overwhelmed with grief and anxiety, and in the utmost
                  consternation for the safety of their son. Extravagant accounts of the difficulty
                  had reached them the previous night, and the afflicted parents were almost frantic
                  with fears that he might be arrested by a furious mob.
               Mr. Herbert immediately quieted their anxiety, and assured them that their boy was
                  entirely beyond danger for the present; and furthermore informed them that he
                  could not be arrested unless a requisition was made on the governor of another
                  State. This of course would require some time, and ere it could be done Robert's
                  location could be changed to one of entire safety.
               Mr. Carlton grasped the hand of his kind neighbor, and exclaimed fervently:
               "God bless you, my friend! You have indeed brought comfort to an afflicted
                  family."
               Then, after reading Robert's letter, he handed it to his weeping wife, and
                  said:
               "Dear, noble boy! the act does not criminate him, unless his heart was guilty. Let
                  others say what they may, I know him to be innocent; for the youth who never
                  allowed a falsehood to sully his lips, would not condescend to act the part of an
                  assassin," and added: "Cheer up, my dear wife, drive back your tears, we have good
                  reason to be proud of our son, who would suffer a thousand deaths rather than
                  perjure himself. If I were asked the dwelling-place of truth, I would point to the
                  heart of Robert Carlton, notwithstanding. Democritus feigns that she lies at the
                  bottom of a well."
               Mrs. Carlton, after reading a portion of the letter, clasped her hands, and with
                  tears streaming down her face, ejaculated:
               "My child is innocent!"
               When quiet was restored to the household, and the alarm with regard to Robert's
                  safety had somewhat subsided, Mr. Carlton remarked:
               "My dear friend, I do not intend that Robert shall be a wanderer over the face of
                  the earth, with the mark of Cain indelibly stamped upon his noble brow for envious
                  tongues and wicked hearts to wreak their venomed darts against; but he must come
                  forward like an honest, upright man should do, and demand justice at the hands of
                  his fellow-citizens. The laws of the country will free his honor and his name from
                  every stain, and place him above the reproach of his enemies. When this excitement
                  is quelled, I shall order him to return and surrender himself to the legal
                  authorities."
               Mr. Herbert agreed that this was the wisest plan; but cautioned his friend not to
                  reveal his intention until time should soften the exasperated feelings of the
                  multitude, and Robert's friends could produce sufficient evidence to prove that
                  the deed was done in self-defense.
               Mr. Herbert afterward found that the community generally were highly incensed and
                  prejudiced against young Carlton, on account of the position of Harper's wound,
                  which led to suspicion of treachery and cowardice. Unfortunately, no evidence
                  besides Robert's statement could be found to refute the serious charge. This,
                  indeed, was sufficient to justify the act in the estimation of his immediate
                  friends; but Mr. Herbert was well aware that it would avail nothing before a jury when
                  circumstantial evidence bore so strongly against a prisoner.
               Notwithstanding every effort was made by this able jurist and his compeers to
                  substantiate their belief in its being a case of justifiable homicide, the sad
                  affair still remained in statu quo; and poor
                  Robert was left to roam with a heavy heart, friendless and alone, in a distant
                  land.
               His father's silver-threaded locks, and once proud, manly step, began to show
                  evidence "that hope deferred, maketh the heart sick;" and the gentle mother's pale
                  cheeks were growing paler and thinner day by day, while Alice's sad face seldom
                  brightened with a smile. Yet she was untiring in her efforts to administer comfort
                  to the afflicted parents, who thanked God for restoring to them their beloved
                  daughter in this dark and gloomy, hour of trial.
               But such are the consequences to him who indulges in wine or strong drink. He will
                  find that at last "it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder."
               In relating this sad event and contemplating its unhappy result, we are reminded
                  of the everyday practice of carrying concealed weapons. Though statute after
                  statute has been enacted against it, no good effect has resulted. The entire
                  community constitutes one vast armory; almost every man violates the laws of the
                  land in this respect. And though during the existence of war, or when in a
                  revolution every one deems his person exposed to the violence of an enraged mob,
                  such a course of conduct might be approved and justified, we cannot but deplore it
                  as an evil that in time of peace, when communities are quiet and their members are
                  pursuing their daily avocations for support, that this practice should be
                  indulged. Many a time, simple quarrels and misunderstandings between individuals
                  would pass off with a blow, or a bruised eye or cheek, and the peace and quietude
                  of a neighborhood suffer no further disturbance, were it not that deadly weapons
                  are brought into requisition—the death of one or the other party ensues, and
                  untold misery is brought upon a once happy and peaceful household. It is to be
                  hoped that the refining and holy influence of Christianity, if nothing else, will
                  effect a cessation of this barbarous habit, and bring men to a just appreciation
                  of the divine injunction, "Thou shalt not kill."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XX.
               
                  
                     
                        Oh, come to the South, 'tis the home of the heart—
                        No sky like its own can deep passion impart;
                        The glow of its summer is felt in the soul,
                        And love keepeth ever his fervent control.
                        Oh, here would thy beauty most brilliantly beam,
                        And life pass away like some delicate dream;
                        Each wish of thy heart should realized be,
                        And this beautiful land seem an Eden to thee.
                     
                  
               
               LULA, here is a volume of poetry which Charlie requested me to give you, but I had
                  quiet forgotten it until this moment," said Mrs. Herbert, entering the room, and
                  interrupting a conversation between that young lady and Mr. Gordon.
               The book was received with evident pleasure, and Mrs. Herbert left the
                  apartment.
               After examining the title, Lula turned the book, and it suddenly opened itself,
                  disclosing to her astonished gaze a beautiful photograph of Julia Stanly. Her
                  dark, bright eyes, soft as moonlight waters, were turned to the opposite page, as
                  if heart answered to heart in the fond confession there recorded.
               The orphan sickened, as the painful truth of Charlie's love for Julia forced
                  itself upon her, while reading the following lines: 
                     
                        Do I love thee?—ask the flowers
                        If they love the breath of spring,—
                        Ask them if the morning hours
                        Fragrant dew and freshness bring,—
                        List their answer!—Such to me
                        Is the love I feel for thee.
                     
                     
                        Do I love thee?—If devotion
                        Be of love the surest test,—
                        If the rivers love the ocean,
                        Drawn by instinct to its breast,—
                        Then my heart in homage see,
                        All its currents flow to thee.
                     
                  
               
               Mr. Gordon watched Lula's varying countenance as she read, and asked:
               "What envied bard is he, whose rhythm can stir such deep emotions in your heart,
                  Miss Graham, causing the lily to usurp the rose's place upon your cheek?"
               "Oh! it is a delightful volume of Songs and Poems of the South,' by Meek, of
                  Alabama, and they will naturally strike a sympathetic chord in the bosom of every
                  true-hearted Southerner. He sings of our Sunny Land,—brilliant skies—its charming
                  scenery, and its sweet flowers, with a truth and purity that almost persuades me
                  that I have a personal interest in them."
               She closed the book and held it firmly in her hand, then added:
               "Some of his poems have been widely circulated over fictitious names, and one of
                  them, entitled Balaklava, won an extensive reputation, and was attributed by many
                  to Alexander Smith, one of your British poets."
               He drew near to examine the book; but she retreated a few steps, and said:
               "If you will excuse me for a few moments, Mr. Gordon, I will go and speak to my
                  aunt, then return and submit the volume to your inspection."
               Lula left the room, and taking the photograph from the book, handed it to Mrs.
                  Herbert, saying:
               "Dear auntie, I think that Charlie must have forgotten he had added a tenth Muse
                  to the little volume when he directed you to present it to me—therefore I have
                  taken the liberty of dissolving her connection with the faithful nine, for fear that she might share the fate of the
                  conceited Thamyris, who presumed to challenge the Muses to sing and was defeated;
                  then deprived of his harp and his eyes. I have brought the picture to you, because
                  I thought you would not like for Mr. Gordon to find it in Charlie's
                  possession."
               Mrs. Herbert received the photograph, and at once recognized the likeness. An
                  indignant flush arose to her face, and she inquired:
               "What singular infatuation possesses the boy, Lula? I cannot comprehend his
                  actions. I have been frequently annoyed recently by hearing of his engagement with
                  this girl, and some of our friends speak of her as my son's beautiful fiancee; but I suppose with such convincing proof as
                  this before me, I must submit to further annoyances, and let Madame Rumour bandy
                  his name with pleasure."
               Lula turned with a smothered sigh, thinking that she, too, had seen and heard
                  enough to convince her that the gossiping dame had not heralded this connection
                  without good foundation.
               On re-entering the parlour she offered the book to Mr. Gordon, then seated
                  herself, with some light fancy work in her hands, at a distance from him, hoping
                  that he would examine the poems and leave her to reflection.
               He very soon put the volume aside, and remarked:
               "Books are a great comfort in solitude, a solace in sickness and sorrow. Hood, our
                  prince of punsters, while an invalid, writers: 'That when his physicians condemned
                  him, like Sancho Panza, to Lenten fare, denying him all animal food, as well as
                  fluids stronger than that which lays dust, he still had a feast of reason and a
                  flow of soul. Denied beef, he had Bulwer and Cowper;
                  forbidden mutton, he had Lamb; and in lieu of pork the great Bacon
                  and Hogg.' Such philosophy may do in cases of emergency, but in the
                  present instance I greatly prefer an oral entertainment."
               Lula observed:
               "I think authors can be best appreciated when read in certain localities. Fred
                  Saunders says: 'Milton should be perused in some old cathedral, whose dim,
                  religious light will harmonize with the lofty and sublime musings of the great
                  Christian poet; take Wordsworth by the margin of some rippling stream or lake,
                  with mountains in the horizon and caroling birds overhead; Scott should be read in
                  an apartment hung with relics of the feudal ages; to sympathize with Byron, seat
                  yourself on a rock by the seashore when the sky looks wild and stormy; it is only
                  Shakspeare who can be read and enjoyed at all times and all places, for all things
                  have inspired his universal genius.' I think these Poems of the South should be
                  read in some sweet-scented grove, where the 'mock-bird's melody rings beneath
                  cloudless skies."
               "I will take a copy with me to merry Old England, and while reading it shall be
                  reminded of my delightful sojourn in this land of flowers, where crystal streams
                  flow beneath forests of perpetual green, and luscious fruits ripen and perfect as
                  they did in the garden of Eden.
               "I have been quite a rover for one of my years—over the white cliffs, mountains,
                  and valleys of my native land, through the Emerald Isle, and over Scotland's hills
                  and dells; I have seen Helvetia's flowery fields and icy mountains, the vine-clad
                  hills of France, and classical Italy, with its glowing skies—yet none have equaled
                  this bright and beautiful sunny land, where the grace and beauty of its daughters
                  are surpassed by those of no other clime."
               "You are complimentary indeed, Mr. Gordon, but having never passed beyond the
                  limits of my native land I am utterly unable to discuss this subject with you,
                     although I am perfectly willing to
                  believe that the sunny South, the home of my heart, is the most favored on the
                  globe."
               "You must know, Miss Graham, that I have always been prejudiced in favor of the
                  United States, and particularly the South, for my mother was born and reared
                  beneath its brilliant skies, and her loving heart still fondly clings to her
                  native home. She is now, beyond doubt, the most beautiful and fascinating woman in
                  England, at least this is the opinion of my father and his children. She partially
                  prepared me for the pleasures which awaited me in the New World, but I find that
                  the half was not told, so greatly has every expectation been surpassed."
               After a short pause, he continued:
               "If I could follow the example of my father and transplant one of these
                  bright-eyed daughters of the South to Albion's distant shores, it would be very
                  gratifying to my parents, and establish my happiness for the remainder of
                  life."
               As Mr. Gordon concluded, his gaze rested on the lovely girl in a manner that
                  plainly indicated a wish and desire to make the experiment.
               Just then the large white petals of a magnolia fell over and around Lula from the
                  vase above.
               She stooped to pick them up, and holding them in her hand, said:
               "Mr. Gordon, has tradition ever informed you that the youth and maidens of this
                  flowery land communicate their loves to each other by means of these fragrant
                  tablets? They trace with some sharp-pointed instrument their hopes and wishes on
                  the mystic leaf, and confide it to olus, who bears the perfumed missive safely to
                  its destination. The words written upon it are at first scarcely discernible, but
                  they soon appear in bold relief, and remain legible, even when the petal grows
                  dark and crisp from age."
               "Perhaps the trusty god has wafted you a billet
                     d'amour. Do let me examine the airy mall. Though a novice in the arts
                  of Flora, you will find me an apt and faithful scholar," he smilingly said, coming
                  forward.
               Charlie had gathered the flower early in the morning, before his departure, and
                  given it to her. In collecting the scattered petals, her watchful eye had detected
                  certain cabalistic characters on one of them, and instinct caused her to placed
                  them in her work-basket for further inspection. Though her quick reply was:
               "Oh, on! that flower has been here a week or more. It was only half blown when it
                  was placed there, and this morning, when I replenished the vases, it still looked
                  fresh, and I allowed it to remain."
               Mr. Sunderland and Harry called just them, greatly to Lula's relief. Mr. Herbert
                  was summoned from his library, and conversation became general.
               After the usual compliments were exchanged, Mr. Sunderland said:
               "Well, Mr. Gordon, how does this bright, sunny land compare with foggy Old
                  England? I suppose you must have left it in winter, when there was 
                     
                        No sun—no moon!
                        No morn—no noon—
                        No dawn—no dusk—no proper time of day—
                        No sky—no earthly view—
                        No distance looking blue—
                        No roads—no streets no t' other side the way!"
                     
                  
               
               "I did leave it very much in the condition you have described, sir,—when the fog
                  was so thick that it seemed as if one might have cut his way through with a
                  knife," was the laughing reply.
               Then he added:
               
               "But at this season of the year, it will compare as favorably with the young
                  Republic as sturdy manhood would with promising youth; England is now in her
                  glory; presenting the appearance of one vast landscape-garden, under the highest
                  state of cultivation. Vegetation is as far advanced as it is here, but it will be
                  much longer in maturing. This country surpasses ours in natural beauties—its
                  forests are larger, and of a brighter green—the trees taller, more graceful and
                  feathery—the air clearer, and much higher perfumed—and the landscapes more
                  distinct."
               "I have observed in European paintings that the trees—roots, trunks, and
                  branches—were of a sturdy John Bull form and stature. But our ladies—God bless our
                  noble women!—how do they rank with Anglo-Saxon beauties?" asked Mr.
                  Sunderland.
               "Ah! there I must yield you the palm again. I have seldom seen your ladies
                  equaled, and they are not to be surpassed. The rosy, healthy beauties of Great
                  Britain cannot match the delicate features and ethereal grace of American
                  women."
               "Well, give me your hand, Mr. Gordon, for you are the first sensible Englishman
                  that I have seen for many a day. They usually come to us with thier eyes
                  jaundiced; thinking that 'nothing good can come out of Nazareth,' but you have
                  given honor where honor was due."
               Harry Sunderland said:
               "Mr. Gordon, I should like to know your impression of the pic-nic that you
                  attended last week, as I believe those moonlight festivals are institutions
                  peculiar to the Sunny South."
               "Oh, it was gloriously beautiful! I felt as I ascended the hill, with the
                  fire-flies, like Fairy torch bearers, flying about me, that I had entered
                  enchanted ground; and where the lofty trees interlaced their branches overhead,
                  sheltering the platform on which the joyous revelers with merry feet kept time to
                  the inspiriting strains of the orchestra, it appeared like nature's royal saloon,
                  in which were assembled her noblest knights and fairest ladies for a contest of
                  beauty. The splendor of the scene bewildered me for a few moments—then my eyes
                  became riveted on the exquisite fairy-like forms, who glided through the dance as
                  gracefully as a curl of smoke from the amber pipe of a turbaned Turk, or the
                  thistle down which floats over the hills and dales of Scotland. I never saw the
                     rle of poetry of motion so perfectly
                  portrayed as be those Southern maidens. The full moon threw a silvery phosphoric
                  light over meadows and fields, but the dancers seemed to float in a golden mist,
                  as the glare from the bonfires of rich Southern pine, and the light of a hundred
                  hanging lamps, threw their gorgeous radiance over the scene."
               Mr. Herbert said:
               "As Harry has remarked, these moonlight festivals are, I believe, peculiar to the
                  South. The heat of the sun during the day is intense, though the nights are often
                  cool and exhilarating. The moon casts a bright and lovely light over the
                  landscape, and the shadows of the surrounding objects dart about and play with
                  each other in a manner truly gay and attractive. It is during these seasons that
                  the young assemble in high glee, and each Benedick and Beatrice play their part to
                  perfection. The merry dance is indulged, promenades enjoyed, and candies, nuts,
                  fruits, ice-creams, sherbets, and cakes contribute to the gayety and pleasure of
                  the evening."
               Mr. Sunderland proposed that Messrs. Herbert and Gordon should accompany him in a
                  ride, as he wished to see what progress the workmen were making with Dr. Clinton's house. The proposition was
                  accepted, and the merry old gentleman then added:
               "I know, Mr. Gordon, that the English are generally famous equestrians—even your
                  ladies excel in this accomplishment, and can sit on horseback, stand fire, and
                  leap a ditch or hedge as fearlessly as any veteran cavalryman. I remember to have
                  read an amusing anecdote in some old review of Lady Mary Pierrepont, who afterward
                  became Lady Wortley Montague. She invited a timid lover to take a ride with her,
                  and offered for his use a mare which was apparently very gentle. The enamored
                  youth accepted the flattering invitation, and with the assistance of a groom
                  mounted the spirited animal, and away went her ladyship on her fleet pony, the
                  quiet mare following suit with a will. The timid lover could no longer hold on by
                  his bridle, so, like Gilpin, 
                     
                        He grasped the mane with both his hands,
                        And eke with all his might,
                     
                   screaming with terror, as the mare made straight for a five-barred gate,
                  which she had leapt a hundred times. The rider held on until the fearful leap was
                  made, and then was shot out of the saddle like a stone from a sling."
               Mr. Gordon left the room to prepare for his ride, and Mr. Sunderland said:
               "Herbert, I understand we are to have another wedding soon—that your boy is to
                  marry that beautiful elfish-looking daughter of Stanly's. If so, my advice to
                  Charlie would be to make her join the Romish Church beforehand, so that she may
                  obtain absolution at least once a week for her misdeeds. It may afford as great
                  relief to her as to my neighbor, Pat Mooney. He is fond of a 'drop of the creature nate,' and has a frolic regularly once a week, which ends in
                  a 'tarin ruction' with his wife and a brush of shillalahs. When he becomes sober
                  they both rush off to the priest, and he settles the difficulty and sends them
                  home billing and cooing like a pair of doves until the next spree. The other day
                  he came over in great distress to borrow a horse from me, saying that he had
                  forgotten it was Friday, and had eat a thundering chance of meat for breakfast,
                  and must go to the priest immediately. I told him he would save time and trouble
                  by taking an emetic, but he posted off like Ichabod Crane when the goblin was
                  after him in Sleepy Hollow."
               A general laugh followed this amusing account of the devout Irishman, and Mr.
                  Sunderland again asked:
               "What about the wedding? I have heard the rumor repeated, yet shall not believe it
                  unless it is confirmed at headquarters."
               "I do not think it can be true, as Charlie has not consulted me about it. When he
                  does, I shall advise him for the best, and leave him to act for himself," replied
                  Mr. Herbert.
               "Ah, then, there is no truth in the report! for your son has too much good sense
                  to be wheedled into matrimony by this heartless beauty, who would play with men's
                  hearts as a cat would with mice. The girls all say it requires as much pains and
                  labor to get her up for exhibition as it did King George IV., who was trussed and
                  braced by stays to keep his flesh in proper trim; though when the arduous duties
                  of the toilet are over with, she is certainly well paid for her trouble, and looks
                  as charming as Cleopatra did when she robbed Mark Antony of his honor and put upon
                  him the chains of Pluto. Sidney Smith said he must have recourse to an umbrella to
                  protect him from the 'Norton rays;' and if Charlie's optics are at all dazzled by
                  the Stanly rays, I should recommend the shelter of his own roof, for no brighter eyes can be found elsewhere."
                  As he concluded, Mr. Gordon entered the room, and the three gentlemen took their
                  departure.
               Then Harry Sunderland remarked:
               "Your friend will find my uncle a comparative man, Mrs. Herbert, for
                  he seldom speaks of persons without likening them to some prominent historical or
                  fictitious character."
               "He will find him very interesting and amusing—candid and liberal in his opinions,
                  and free from all malice or national prejudices," was the reply.
               While they conversed together, Lula took occasion to examine the petals of the
                  magnolia which lay in her basket, and found written on one of them, "Je ne cherche
                  qu'un," in Charlie's handwriting.
               She replaced them with a smothered sigh, and thought of the beautiful photograph
                  which had revealed the object whom he sought, supposing that he had adopted this
                  method of imparting his secret to her.
               But when alone in her own room, and the restraint which had bound her heart as
                  with metallic bands had been thrown aside, she cried aloud in bitter anguish:
               "Oh, I cannot, cannot witness their happiness, nor see him resign his noble heart
                  so fondly, so trustingly, into the keeping of that cold, selfish, and untruthful
                  girl! I shall die if compelled to stand calmly by and behold the dreadful
                  sacrifice! I must, I must fly from scenes that will ever remind me of the happy
                  past, for I am no longer needed here! But where, oh! where can I go?"
               She knelt at the Mercy-seat and prayed for strength and guidance.
               Mr. Gordon's presence had been a pleasure and relief during this trying ordeal,
                  and when he spoke of his departure, and in low, eager tones inquired: "If I come
                  again, will you welcome me kindly to Belvoir?" her eyes drooped for a moment; then
                  raising them to his face, she answered frankly:
               "Yes;" and then added immediately: "The associations connected with your visit are
                  all of an agreeable nature; and should you at a future time be induced to honor us
                  with your presence again, I doubt not that the acquaintances you have made here
                  will hail your coming with no ordinary degree of delight."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXI.
               
                  
                     
                        To you my soul's affections move
                        Devoutly, warmly true;
                        My life has been a task of love,
                        One long, long thought of you.
                     
                  
               
               AFTER several weeks' absence Charlie returned home, and, in a private interview
                  with his father, informed him of Robert Carlton's locality, and of his distressed
                  state of mind, which bordered almost on frenzy in regard to the unfortunate
                  affair, and the effect it might have on the happiness of his parents. The unhappy
                  young man, conscious of having acted justifiably in defending himself, had fully
                  determined to return and surrender his person to the legal authorities and abide
                  the consequences. No advice could alter this mad determination, and his appearance
                  might be looked for at any moment.
               Robert had said:
               "Rather than remain an outcast, roaming uselessly over the world, and hunted like
                  some wild beast, he would return and show his friends how fearlessly an innocent
                  man could die; that under existing circumstances, life would never be
                  desirable."
               After Mrs. Carlton was assured by Charlie of her son's safety, she decided to
                  follow Dr. Clinton's advice, to take a trip to the Springs, as her feeble
                  constitution required a more bracing atmosphere, after the intense excitement of
                  the last few weeks.
               At the urgent solicitation of Alice and her mother, Mrs. Herbert willingly
                  consented for Lula to accompany them, hoping that a change of climate would be
                  beneficial to the gentle girl, whose pale cheeks and nervousness gave indications
                  of declining health.
               Since his return, Charlie had resumed his accustomed easy and fraternal
                  intercourse with Lula. His mother had given him a full and satisfactory account of
                  Alfred Raymond's last visit and its serious result, which had driven that
                  promising young man from a home where he was loved and appreciated.
               Charlie was painfully affected in contemplating the probable destiny of his
                  friend, yet he felt that a burden had been taken from his own heart, and he could
                  once more breathe freely. Then he acknowledged his weakness in being so easily
                  duped by the artful duplicity of Julia Stanly, which she unwittingly betrayed on
                  the evening of Dr. Clinton's wedding.
               Lula had never manifested any curiosity about the photograph being in his
                  possession, and Mrs. Herbert did not think it necessary to refer to it, as the
                  matter had been a source of deep mortification to her. Therefore the orphan left
                  home under the painful delusion that Charlie was unconditionally engaged to Julia
                  Stanly.
               A few days afterward, young Herbert was sitting in the library, leaning back, with
                  his feet resting upon the window-sill—a favorite position of smokers—indulging a
                  cigar and enjoying blissful dreams of the future. As the fumes were gracefully
                  wafted above by the breeze that fanned his tranquil brow, his spirit took its
                  flight and was holding sweet communion with that of Lula, who was far away among
                  the gay throng who frequent the watering-places, to while away the long and sultry
                  days of a Southern summer.
               He was aroused by his father, who, folding the letter he was reading,
                  remarked:
               "I suppose, my son, you know that Mr. Gordon will probably return to us in the
                  fall or winter; he tells me that Lula
                  had promised to welcome his coming, and asks my permission to address her."
               Charlie threw away the cigar, and staring wildly at the speaker for a moment,
                  buried his face in his hands, exclaiming:
               "Oh, father! spare me another trial!"
               "My dear boy, act like a man. You remind me of sop's fable—Canis jacebat in prsepi. You will not ask her to marry you, nor will
                  you let any one else have her," said his father, laughingly, and then adding more
                  seriously: "You have manifested a decided preference for Miss Stanly, by writing
                  to her from New York, and seeking her first on your return; and in robbing Lula's
                  album of your photograph, your mother tells me, that the black-eyed beauty might
                  boast of her conquest, which she certainly has done, in a manner that has
                  convinced every one she is to be the future mistress of Belvoir. What possible
                  objection then can you have to Mr. Gordon? If you marry Miss Stanly, I think it
                  would be advisable to let him remove Lula from here, for there is no congeniality
                  between the two girls, and but little happiness would fall to the share of my
                  precious, pure-minded darling from such intimate companionship"
               "Oh, father, have mercy on me! do not taunt me so cruelly! I have no idea of
                  marrying Miss Stanly."
               After a pause, he asked:
               "Do you suppose that Lula was under this impression when she gave Mr. Gordon
                  permission to return?"
               "She had every reason to think so; for no one ever saw her without proclaiming
                  your engagement with Miss Stanly. Yet I do not know that it influenced her in
                  regard to this affair with Mr. Gordon, for he is a most estimable young
                  man—intelligent and wealthy; and, in truth, an eligible offer in every respect.
                  The temptation to accept his hand would be irresistible to any girl whose
                  affections were not otherwise engaged. I would suggest that you first disabuse
                  Lula's mind of this fancied engagement of yours, and then come out frankly and ask
                  her to decide between the patrician and plebeian.
               "I think the fact of his belonging to the former class will not influence her in
                  the least, for her good sense has taught her that merit alone constitutes true
                  nobility. Still, if Mr. Gordon should be preferred, you must be contented to see
                  her happy, and console yourself with the knowledge that he is a gentleman whose
                  like we shall rarely see again, and that he will appreciate her."
               Charlie had fully decided to follow his father's advice.
               He would go to the Springs immediately, and have his weal or his woe determined at
                  once; though fears overshadowed his hopes, for the young Englishman was indeed a
                  most formidable rival. The suspense was intolerable, and he could endure it no
                  longer.
               "Man proposes, but God disposes."
               The next mail brought letters of vital importance concerning some intricate
                  lawsuit, and Charlie was to be dispatched in lieu of his father to some other
                  portion of the State. He was perplexed beyond measure at this sudden change in his
                  programme, but as the law business would admit of no delay, necessity compelled
                  him to submit to its stern mandate, and prepare forthwith for his journey.
               However, he wrote a letter explanatory of his connection with Julia Stanly—the
                  manner in which she had possessed herself of his photograph, and of her surprising
                  him by sending her own to him in New York.
               This hastily written epistle, which only breathed fraternal affection, was posted
                  with the utmost care previous to his departure.
               On returning after a lengthened absence, he found the whole country in a ferment
                  of excitement caused by the sudden
                  return of Robert Carlton. His friends were paralyzed with fears for his safety,
                  while his enemies were mute with admiration and amazement at the bold, reckless
                  daring which defied their fierce land angry threats.
               A heavy bond was given for his appearance at court, and fearlessly he walked,
                  unmolested, through the thoroughfares of his native city.
               Notwithstanding Robert's indifference to life, he regretted, when too late, his
                  hasty coming, after seeing its unhappy effect upon his father.
               It was indeed Mr. Carlton's wish that his son should return at some future time,
                  and go through the form of a trial, but that period had not arrived.
               The events connected with Harper's sudden death were too recent for the prejudices
                  of the people to have subsided into rational opinions. As the important day
                  approached, he trembled with fear, lest his noble, generous boy should be
                  compelled to suffer an ignominious fate. It was painful to witness the torturing
                  effect of this dreadful excitement upon the manly form of the affectionate father,
                  whose raven locks were gradually hiding beneath network of silver, to watch the
                  quivering motion of his lips, and the moisture which often dimmed his bright eyes,
                  as they fondly rested on his first-born, his noble, courageous boy.
               The ablest counsel in the country had been employed his behalf, and friends were
                  indefatigable in seeking for evidence to establish his innocence; but alas! their
                  efforts were unavailing. Even the man Jones, who witnessed the whole affair, and
                  assisted Robert in making his escape, had disappeared mysteriously, and had
                  neither been seen nor heard of since he parted from him. Search was made in every
                  direction; rewards were temptingly offered for any information concerning him, but
                  without success; and strong suspicious that he had been treacherously dealt with
                  at length settled despondingly upon the minds of Mr. Carlton and his friends.
               Fortunately Mrs. Carlton and Alice were away, and in ignorance of this uneasy
                  state of affairs; but unpleasant rumors at last reached the Springs, which caused
                  them to hasten homeward with anxious, troubled hearts.
               Ah, who can tell the depth of that mother's woe, as she meditated, through long,
                  weary days and sleepless nights, on the probable destiny of her child—the bright
                  and handsome boy whose existence was her own! Cold and selfish is every human
                  feeling compared to the love of a mother. Other affections may wither from
                  carelessness or neglect—crime land disgrace may weaken and sunder other ties, but
                  will strengthen and render more secure the link that unites a mother to her
                  child.
               In its devotion, unselfishness, and purity it approaches nearer to that divine
                  love displayed by Christ on the heights of Calvary for sinful, unregenerate man,
                  than has ever since or before stirred the hearts or mortals. Its impress is holy,
                  its origin is from above, and neither sorrow, sin, shame, nor death can conquer a
                  mother's imperishable devotion.
               "The fate of a child," said Napoleon Bonaparte, "is the work of a mother."
               If this be true, it is a fearful trust imposed upon woman, and Mrs. Carlton felt
                  now that this confidence had been abused—that she had neglected to train up her
                  child in the way he should go—that she had restrained him not; and the fate of
                  Eli's hapless sons murdered sleep and haunted her waking dreams.
               Yet the poor mother bore up with true heroism during this distressing ordeal for
                  the sake of her husband and son. She had learned to draw strength from that
                  fountain which flowed from "Immanuel's veins," and knew that
                  
                     
                        With pitying eyes the Prince of grace
                        Beheld our helpless grief;
                        He saw, and oh, amazing love!
                        He ran to our relief.
                     
                  
               
               Meek, gentle Alice was the unselfish, untiring minister to the comfort of the
                  household. She too had found peace, and could 
                     Look aloft, and be firm and fearless of heart,
                   and now sought eagerly to brighten with sunny hope the dark cloud of
                  despondency which threatened to burst with maddening fury over their heads.
               Lula returned from the Springs invigorated in health and strength, and her
                  improved appearance was attributed to the efficacy of the mineral waters, whereas
                  all merit should have been ascribed to Charlie's letter, which had quieted her
                  fears with regard to his marriage with Julia Stanly.
               As Dr. Clinton and Annie were in possession of Mrs. Grant's late residence, they
                  petitioned for Lula's company a portion of the time, and had fitted up an elegant
                  suite of rooms for her exclusive use and benefit, the doctor alleging as a reason
                  that it was necessary for the young mistress to form the acquaintance and study
                  the peculiar disposition of her dependents; showing them by her frequent presence
                  that she was interested in their welfare and comfort, and did not view them merely
                  as machines for putting money into her purse.
               The Herberts acknowledged the propriety and justness of this course, and
                  reluctantly yielded their consent for her to spend a week occasionally with them,
                  but no longer period would be allowed her to occupy the "State apartments," as her
                  rooms were laughingly called.
               Charlie said:
               "You know, Birdie, the old mammies say you are the guardian angel of
                  the plantation, so your visits must be like angels'—few and far between."
               Again the orphan renews her acquaintance with the scenes of her childhood, and
                  makes daily visits to the aged and afflicted negroes, among whom are her old
                  friends Elsy and her "John Anderson, my Jo John."
               All who are cognizant of the relationship existing between negroes and their
                  owners, know that the affection of the former for the latter descends with
                  unchanging fidelity to their children; and nurses of the white parents are always
                  held in high regard by their offspring when they grow up, as is shown by numerous
                  acts of kindness and love toward the old negroes. The little children of the two
                  classes when young play together, and any little toys that either may possess are
                  regarded as common property. The old negroes usually become pensioners, existing
                  without labor—supported by the owner in idleness—are regarded as a privileged
                  class, petted and favored by all who know them. Many now living can recall with
                  delight the figures of the old daddies and mammies as
                  they were seen idling and basking themselves in the sunshine around the old
                  homesteads.
               Even, as in the case of Lula, when they descend to those who were not bound by
                  ties of consanguinity to the owner, they manifest for them the same fondness and
                  reliance, and hence it is not to be wondered at that her visits afforded great
                  delight and satisfaction, she being regarded as their future friend and
                  mistress.
               As she was performing her accustomed round of duty, she called at the house of the
                  couple before mentioned.
               "How are you to-day, Aunt Elsy?" she asked.
               "Thank de Lord, I'm poorly yet; though the misery most done gone clean out ob me
                  back, and I kin walk three miles to de Cool-Spring Meetin'-house, and praise de good Lord as loud an' long as any ob
                  um. Couldn't do dat in old mist'es time, thank de Lord! But you see, Mars Doctor
                  done gib me something nudder one Saturday, and tell me 'twill make me back strong
                  and make me lib long, and I tried it. Sure nuff, I got up nex morning and put on
                  dat new frock what you sent me, and went to meetin' as spry as any ob de colored
                  folks."
               "I am glad to find you doing so well."
               Then she asked:
               "How is your health, Uncle John?"
               "I'm 'bout, thank ye, mist'es; Mars Doctor done me a powerful chance of good, too;
                  de rumatiz is done most left my poor bones, an I kin walk to the river and set and
                  fish dar all day, if I have good 'bacca to smoke. Dat money you gib me, when you
                  come over here 'fore, bought de best 'bacca I eber seed in all my born days, but
                  it's most done gone now, and I don't know what I gwine do; I ain't get no more
                  money."
               Lula took the hint, and gave the old man some money to replenish his
                  tobacco-pouch, and proceeded to the next cabin, followed by a profusion of
                  blessings from the happy, idle old pensioners.
               All were glad to see her; many were the remarks made upon her beauty and dress,
                  and she retired amid a profusion of compliments; and many a "long may you live
                  mist'es," greeted her ears as she entered the house.
               
               In the mean time Charlie Herbert was studiously applying himself to his law books,
                  in order to defend the life and honor of his friend, Robert Carlton. The case
                  still presented a dark and gloomy aspect, and fears that he might be condemned on
                  circumstantial evidence only, prevailed to an alarming extent. But still Charlie
                  determined to fight vigorously, and leave no stone unturned by which he might
                  benefit the noble but impulsive young man. As the faces of the older lawyers began
                  to assume a more dubious aspect, and a silent conviction seemed to settle upon
                  other minds that the law would be rigorously enforced, according to the testimony
                  adduced by the prosecuting party, Charlie would return to his studies with renewed
                  vigor, and exclaim:
               "He must, he shall be saved!"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXII.
               
                  
                     
                        I know you lawyers can with case
                        Twist words and meanings as you please;
                        That language, by your skill made pliant,
                        Will bend to favor every client.
                     
                  
               
               THE important day at length arrived, and long before the hour appointed for the
                  opening of court, the vast hall was filled to overflowing, and the large concourse
                  which thronged every approach to the temple of justice was positively appalling to
                  the friends of the prisoner. The case had excited universal interest on account of
                  the popularity and prominent position of Mr. Carlton, and visitors had collected
                  from various directions to witness the trial of his son.
               Robert advanced with habitual self-possession, and took his stand within the bar;
                  his face was pale and careworn, but serene, on which "mens qua in arduis" was
                  legibly written, as it was on the brow of Warren Hastings when he was impeached
                  for "high crimes and misdemeanors" in the great hall of Westminster.
               The preliminary stages of the trial passed with absorbing interest. The witnesses
                  were examined, and the prosecuting attorney arose. By a bitter, vindictive speech
                  he produced a strong and unreasonable feeling in the minds of the people against
                  the prisoner, and as he continued the fierce invective against the so-called
                  "midnight assassin," his listeners were moved with indignation, and the grave
                  looks and prophetic shaking of heads indicated which way their opinion leaned.
               Then came the elder counsel for the defendant, who forcibly expounded the law,
                  seized the defensible points of the case, pressed them with power and eloquence
                  upon the jury, and concluded with a highly-wrought eulogium on the character of
                  young Carlton.
               As its close, some indications of a change in sentiment were plainly visible on
                  their countenances.
               Other speakers followed in the same strain, but no additional light was thrown
                  upon the important subject. The patience of the audience appeared to weary with
                  the length and monotony of their arguments, and signs of restlessness were
                  manifested in every part of the room.
               Charlie Herbert arose.
               It was his first appearance before so large an auditory, and, notwithstanding the
                  impatience displayed by the crowd toward the close of the preceding speech,
                  silence was again restored, as all were eager and curious to hear the youthful
                     debutant in defense of his friend and
                  companion.
               The first sentences fell falteringly, and almost inaudibly from his lips, and his
                  friends hung their heads, abashed at this unpromising beginning.
               Their discomfiture, however, was of short duration; for he caught the pleading eye
                  of Mr. Carlton, and Robert's pale face reproached him sadly for his loss of
                  self-possession, and acted like magic in restoring his equilibrium. He appeared
                  suddenly to be endowed with supernatural strength and courage, and all of the
                  surroundings were forgotten.
               His voice, action, and style immediately assumed a grandeur that electrified and
                  thrilled the hearts of the people. With a magician's power he decoyed their minds
                  from the unfavorable impressions produced by the witnesses and opposing counsel,
                  and led them to believe that by some "ignis
                     fatuus" their convictions had been led astray, and they were about to become murderers
                  themselves. One by one their former conclusions were swept with a tornado-like
                  force from their minds, and they were aghast at the horrid picture he drew of
                  their own shameless depravity in wishing to condemn an innocent man.
                  Uncontrollable tears fell from their eyes, and they were actually indignant at the
                  idea of being so easily duped by Harper's counsel. So terribly were these vivid
                  word-paintings of Charlie Herbert's impressed upon the hearts of the jurors, that
                  one of them afterward remarked, if he had not been fascinated, and irresistibly
                  chained to his seat by the eloquence and brilliancy which gleamed from the
                  speaker's eye, he would have rushed headlong from the room, in order to escape the
                  stings of remorse for suspecting Carlton of murder. A death-like silence reigned
                  throughout the assembly, and Charlie continued:
               "Blackstone, supported by Coke, says 'murder is where a person of sound memory and
                  discretion unlawfully killeth any reasonable creature in being and under the
                  king's peace, with malice aforethought, either express or implied.'
               "Gentlemen of the jury, I see among you some who have known my friend and
                  honorable client from his earliest infancy, and appeal to your knowledge of his
                  character to know whether from your hearts you can conscientiously accuse him of
                  malice, or pronounce that noble young man a murderer? Go among the poor and needy,
                  and inquire his character! Call together the friends and companions of his
                  childhood and youth, and ask if any can recall a word or action of his that would
                  reflect discredit upon a gentleman? Though legions should proclaim him guilty, I
                  would still vouch for his innocence, if his word alone declared it; for Robert
                  Carlton's honor is dearer to him than life. The fact of his presenting himself
                  before you to-day is sufficient evidence of this truth."
               Here he read Robert's letter written to him a few hours after the difficulty,
                  which produced a decided impression in favor of the writer, and then
                  continued:
               "Had my friend been guilty, his father's wealth could have purchased
                  safety—independence for his son in some foreign land; but his honorable soul
                  rejected the life and liberty that was to be bought at the expense of his honor,
                  and the loss of your confidence and esteem. Beware! oh, beware, how you forfeit
                  the trust imposed upon you!
               "I see in this assembly Dr. Hall, that man of God, the venerable preceptor who has
                  helped to guide and direct the strong mind of young Carlton in the paths of
                  rectitude. Ask him if the fear of punishment ever intimidated his pupil, or caused
                  him to utter an untruth? He will tell you that Robert never told a lie—that to him
                  honor, truth, and conscience are worth more than life. It was the devil, and not
                  God who said, 'Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath, will he give for his
                  life'—hence it is false.
               "There is no law, legal or divine, forbidding us to take the life of those who are
                  seeking to destroy our lives, if there is no other mode of escape. The sacred lips
                  which proclaimed from Sinai the moral law, proved this by saying: 'If a thief be
                  found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, then shall no blood be shed for
                  him.' How much more justifiable in the sight of God one would be, for defending
                  himself against a murderous assault, we can easily foresee."
               Then pointing to the jury, he said with solemnity and a peculiar emphasis which
                  painfully thrilled every heart, as if he spoke by divine injunction:
               "'He that swears away the life of a fellow-creature is himself a murderer.' 'He
                  that suborns others to do the same is a murderer.' 'He who passes unjust sentence
                  of death is a murderer.'" Then, lowering his voice, he softly added: "Remember,
                  oh, remember! 'Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.'"
               
               Breathless silence reigned throughout the hall as he ceased to speak and every eye
                  was fixed with admiration and apparent awe upon the young orator who had so
                  eloquently and vigorously defended his friend.
               At length an old gentleman, who had been stooping forward to listen with suspended
                  respiration, drew a sigh of relief, and exclaimed, in the homely style of the old
                  Virginians, "He is almost equal to Patrick when he plead against the parsons."
               Mr. Herbert had listened with pleased surprise and deep emotion to this able
                  defense; and when it was concluded, he bowed his head and wiped a tear from his
                  eye, while an audible "Thank God," escaped from his lips.
               It was plainly visible that the feelings of all had undergone a complete change.
                  Even those who had been most bitter in their feelings toward the prisoner and
                  called for his execution, were now convinced of his innocence. It was evident that
                  the case would be decided in his favor. Just at that moment appeared Alfred
                  Raymond upon the stage of action.
               After a courtly obeisance to the court and bar, he addressed himself to the jury,
                  and "remarked that his friend Herbert had left him but little to say; yet duty,
                  inclination, and friendship compelled him to join his feeble voice to those who
                  had plead so eloquently in defense of one whose esteem would exalt the dignity of
                  an emperor."
               He continued to address them with a power, eloquence, and pathos which at one
                  moment would draw tears from their eyes, and the next would bring the flush of
                  indignation to their faces. All felt themselves again under the magic spell of a
                  superior intellect. The weary, careworn look had passed from his countenance,
                  which shone with splendid grandeur as he swayed the feelings of the multitude at
                  his will and pleasure. Burst after burst of eloquence rolled from his inspired
                  lips, as freely as water from some inexhaustible fountain, and not until the
                  feebleness of his voice forbade further utterance did he cease speaking.
               Then, seating himself, he said: "Let William Jones be called as a witness."
               At this one simultaneous cry of gratitude arose from Robert Carlton's friends.
               "Thank God, my boy is saved!" exclaimed his father, bursting into tears, as
                  Jones's name greeted his ear.
               Jones's evidence was conclusive.
               He had been watching a sick friend on the night of the difficulty, and was
                  returning home when he noticed Robert Carlton walking leisurely along the street.
                  Fearing that something unusual occasional his appearance at this late hour of the
                  night, Jones was about to address him, when he saw Harper pass and fire his
                  pistol, and was in the act of pulling the trigger again over his shoulder, when
                  young Carlton, standing almost in the same position, fired, and Harper fell. The
                  jury left the room for a few minutes, and returned with a verdict of justifiable
                  homicide.
               Friends rushed around the late prisoner with sincere congratulations, and the
                  proud and happy father, taking the arm of his son, bore him off in triumph to his
                  home and his anxious mother, followed by the profound respect and admiration of
                  the rejoicing crowd.
               The faithful Jones had accompanied Robert Carlton to a place of safety, and
                  remained with him until Charlie Herbert arrived.
               Disregarding every remonstrance of his two friends, the unhappy Robert determined
                  to return home and undergo a trial. He had repeatedly mentioned, in Jones's
                  presence, that if he could only have Charlie Herbert and Alfred Raymond to defend
                  him, there would be no doubt about the result. But Raymond's whereabout was a
                     mystery which preyed upon his mind
                  to such an extent, that it affected Jones also, causing him to believe that unless
                  the absent friend could be found, the case would be certainly decided against
                  Carlton.
               Jones had received many favors from Robert and his father, and decided to manifest
                  his gratitude to them by seeking Raymond and urging him to come to the rescue of
                  his unfortunate friend. This intention he imparted to no one for fear of exciting
                  false hopes, as he might fail to find the object of his search. By making various
                  inquires, he learned sufficient to induce the belief that Raymond had probably
                  returned to his former home in Virginia.
               He accordingly set out for Richmond; but there disappointment awaited him.
                  Thinking and saying that "where there is a will there is a way," he gathered fresh
                  courage and commenced his pursuit anew.
               Through various towns, villages, and cities the same fate attended his efforts,
                  and he felt that the search must be given up in despair, as there was scarcely
                  time sufficient for him to return before the opening of court, when accident
                  revealed to him Raymond's location in Baltimore.
               Thither he went as fast as steam and the locomotive could carry him, and there his
                  hopes were crowned with complete success.
               Any less reason than the imminent peril of a beloved and treasured friend would
                  have caused Raymond to decline returning at this early day to the far South; but
                  laying aside all selfish feelings he immediately hastened his departure. By
                  traveling day and night, without rest or scarcely taking time to cat, he arrived
                  with the stanch and faithful Jones in time to hear Charlie Herbert's masterly
                  effort in behalf of their mutual friend.
               Around Charlie and Alfred friends and companions soon clustered, pouring into
                  their ears compliments, the nature of which was sufficient to have intoxicated
                  much older heads; but Charlie playfully warded off these remarks by saying:
               "It was the object alone which inspired us. Raymond can at any time issue an
                  improved edition of his speech, but I shall never do the like again, unless some
                  of you, my dear friends, get into trouble as Robert did, then Herbert will be at
                  your service."
               We will take one glance at the Carltons before closing this chapter. From the
                  first joyful meeting of the united family we will not lift the sacred veil for
                  curious eyes, but present them under auspices that must gladden every Christian's
                  heart, and produce joy among angels in heaven.
               In that house a family altar was erected on this memorable night, and grateful
                  hearts devoutly poured forth thanks to God for his kindness and mercy. The large
                  Bible, which had been so rarely used, was placed upon the stand, and Mr. Carlton,
                  with tear-dimmed eyes, read, by the light of the midnight taper, its blessed
                  promises. 
                     
                        Then kneeling down to heaven's eternal King,
                        The saint, the father, and the husband prays;
                        Hope springs exulting on triumphant wing,
                        That thus they all shall meet in future days;
                        There ever bask in uncreated rays,
                        No more to sigh or shed the bitter tear,
                        Together hymning their Creator's praise,
                        In such society yet still more dear,
                        While circling time moves round in an eternal sphere.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               
                  
                     
                        I love thee, and I feel
                        That in the fountain of my heart a seal
                        Is set, to keep its waters pure and bright,
                        For thee.
                     
                  
               
               IT was toward the small hours of the morning when Mr. Herbert and Charlie returned
                  from the court-house and entered the grounds of Belvoir, startling the
                  mocking-birds, which, with sweet ringing notes, shook off their drowsiness, and
                  sprang affrighted from downy couches among the thick laurel branches, to seek
                  higher refuge on the boughs of some feathery elm, where the lonely whip-poor-will
                  sung his plaintive solo, and remained lord of the lofty domain.
               Light shone from the windows, and figures were seen passing to and fro, as if
                  sleep had flown from the dwelling.
               As the sound of horses' feet and wheels was heard approaching, the door opened,
                  and Lula glided through, then swiftly descending the steps, she followed the
                  direction of the sound, and breathlessly accosted them:
               "Oh, uncle! oh, Charlie! tell me quickly! what was the decision of the court? Is
                  Robert free?"
               The carriage stopped immediately, and Mr. Herbert replied:
               "Yes, free! without a stain upon his honored name."
               Charlie leaped from the carriage, and supported the excited girl with his arm, as
                  she appeared ready to sink to the ground from excessive joy, and Mr. Herbert drove
                  on to relieve the anxiety of his wife.
               "And did you speak, Charlie?"
               "Yes, Birdie, I plead for Robert and for you, as I shall never plead again, except
                  for myself."
               She looked into his face with amazement, and Charlie continued:
               "The noble fellow had in confidence informed me of his love for you, and of your
                  firm but gentle refusal of him on that fatal night. He saw that you kind heart was
                  troubled at the thought of giving him pain, and endeavored to conceal his torture
                  under a promise of perpetual friendship. But as soon as you passed from his sight
                  the mask was thrown aside, and in order to bear the misery of that dreadful night,
                  he sought aid from the sparkling liquid which brings madness with oblivion, and
                  then the difficulty originated which destroyed one life and threatened another. I
                  know that you were totally ignorant of this before, but it has weighed heavily
                  upon my spirits, as I feared the Carltons might visit their misfortunes on your
                  innocent head; therefore I felt in pleading for him I was shielding you from
                  reproach, and clearing your life from the blighting shadows of remorse."
               "Oh, Charlie! if I had suspected myself of having in any way caused this great
                  trouble and anxiety, I believe I could never have survived this trial."
               "I knew that a knowledge of this fact would affect you seriously, therefore would
                  not reveal it until his fate was favorably decided. Thank God! he is once more a
                  free and independent man, and will, I hope, prove a noble son to a noble
                  father."
               After a slight hesitation, he continued:
               "But something must be done with you, my dear little mischief-maker! it will never
                  do to allow you to be disturbing the peace and quietude of families, and the
                  community generally, as you have been doing for the last year. If some one does
                  not take you in charge, the public authorities may arrest you as a disturber of
                  the peace."
               
               "Why, Charlie! what do you mean? I am unable to comprehend your enigma. With what
                  other offense can you charge me?"
               "I charge you also with being accessory to the sudden and mysterious disappearance
                  of Alfred Raymond, attorney-at-law; causing thereby great distress among his
                  relatives and friends, and producing consternation in the minds of his clients.
                  Also I charge you with having alienated the affection of the Hon. Mr. Gordon from
                  his family and his country, which has caused untold trouble and anxiety, both at
                  home and abroad, in regard to the final result."
               "You are too cruel! One would imagine that you considered my presence as
                  deleterious as the proximity of the Upas-tree. What would you have me do? Go into
                  a convent and take the veil?"
               Her words instantly arrested his footsteps, and looking intently upon her sweet,
                  inquiring face, as if he hoped to find written there permission to reveal the
                  hidden secret, he followed the impulse of his heart, and said, with visible
                  emotion:
               "No, indeed, my precious darling! If you ever take the veil, let it be a
                  bridal-veil—let Belvoir be your convent, and allow me to be the high priest, who
                  will minister unceasingly to your comfort and happiness."
               Then Charlie plead for himself: with a fervor and eloquence not inferior to that
                  which he had displayed before the court, he urged his suit.
               Then taking her little hand, which trembled in his grasp, he listened eagerly for
                  some reply.
               None came, but her hand ceased to quiver, and rested calmly in its prison.
               "My darling! my idol! my life! only speak one word! say that you love me—more than
                  you do Mr. Gordon—better than all the world," he said, beseechingly.
               They had reached the house, and the full light of the chandelier shone through the
                  window upon her glowing face, as she looked up and answered, truthfully:
               "Yes, Charlie, you know that I do."
               Then clasping with each of his own the little hand that had rested so trustingly
                  in his grasp, he pressed it fervently to his lips, and exclaimed:
               "Thank God! it is mine, and mine only."
               Although he had in former days clasped her in his arms, and bestowed upon her the
                  kiss of brotherly love, yet so pure and lovely did she appear, looking up to him
                  with her calm, blue eyes, that he dared not profane her vestal beauty by a more
                  tender embrace.
               Just then his mother came to the door for the purpose of calling them into the
                  house.
               Lula sprang from his hold, ran up the steps, and pausing only for a kiss and good
                  night to Mrs. Herbert, rushed into her own room.
               The amiable lady looked at her retreating figure, and exclaimed, with
                  amazement:
               "Why, what is the matter with Lula? She seems strangely agitated—her face is
                  crimson and her lips are actually feverish. I fear this anxious waiting and
                  watching to hear the result of Robert's trial has been too much for her; but I
                  suppose that Alfred's unexpected return has affected her. Did she complain of
                  being ill, Charlie?"
               "Oh, no, mother; but she needs rest, and so do you. I imagine that father has
                  given you a graphic account of the proceedings in court."
               "Yes, my son! I feel extremely gratified at the happy termination of the trial,
                  and am delighted to hear that you acquitted yourself so handsomely. I was afraid
                  that the formidable array of talent in the house might intimidate and disconcert
                  you; but the object at stake was sufficient, it seems, to overcome any bashfulness
                  you may have felt in making your first appearance at the bar. Come in, Charlie, and take a cup of tea—then you
                  must sleep off this intense excitement which has caused so many wakeful
                  nights."
               Charlie's appearance at that moment certainly did not indicate weariness, and with
                  a peculiarly bright and cheerful expression incomprehensible to his mother, he
                  replied:
               "Mother, I shall rest sweetly and calmly now, as I have not for months. This has
                  been the happiest and most eventful period of my life; and I shall close my eyes
                  tonight with the blissful thought of having crowned your life with the best and
                  purest blessings."
               As Charlie received a cup of tea from his mother's hand, he asked if Lula had
                  taken any during the evening.
               "No, she has not: nor could I persuade her to eat, so painfully excited has she
                  been all day."
               Mrs. Herbert ordered Lizzie to carry tea to her young mistress, and Charlie added
                  a plate of edibles to the little silver waiter which the girl was taking from the
                  room, and said:
               "Tell Miss Lula that I insist upon her taking some refreshment before she retires,
                  and that we shall expect to see her bright and cheerful in the morning."
               The sun was shining bright and high from a cloudless sky on the following day, and
                  the feathered minstrels had long since ceased their matin songs, and sought among
                  the clustered trees temporary shelter from the solar rays. From a shady nook in an
                  apple-tree, which had been the domicile of its ancestors, a favorite blue-bird was
                  sending forth a soft, agreeable warble, when Charlie Herbert entered the parlor,
                  where his father and mother had preceded him.
               After bestowing the customary morning kiss upon the latter, he took a card from
                  the escritoir, and wrote upon it, "Come, my darling! I am waiting for you."
               Then ringing the bell for a servant, he dispatched the card to Lula.
               Mrs. Herbert endeavored to engage him in conversation concerning the events of the
                  trial, but his thoughts seemed to be abstracted, and his eyes were fixed immovably
                  on the staircase, as he stood facing them in front of the door.
               Presently his listening ear caught the sound of a light footstep slowly descending
                  the stairs, and he rushed from the room.
               His mother watched him with much concern, and remarked:
               "Mr. Herbert, I think our Scottish friends would pronounce Charlie daft, this
                  morning. Indeed he has not appeared like himself since his return home last
                  night."
               Her husband smiled, and replied:
               "The compliments which were so lavishly bestowed upon him after the adjournment of
                  court last night were sufficient to turn the head of any ordinary young man; still
                  I do not think they made much impression on him, and doubt whether he has thought
                  of these since. I am inclined to think his mind is occupied with quite a different
                  subject at present."
               Before his wife could inquire further, Charlie re-entered the room, looking
                  surprisingly happy, with Lula leaning upon his arm, blushing, and radiantly
                  beautiful.
               Mr. and Mrs. Herbert gazed with amazement as they approached, and stood before
                  them, when the young gentleman merrily said:
               "Father—mother—allow me to present you a daughter of whom you may well be
                  proud—the future bride of your son."
               His parents were for a moment mute with astonishment.
               Lula lifted her soft eyes timidly to Mrs. Herbert's face, and the delighted mother clasped the lovely girl
                  convulsively to her bosom, and vociferated:
               "My darling, precious child! my daughter! God bless you, if this be true."
               Mr. Herbert twined his arm caressingly around the blushing fiancee, and kissing her, said:
               "Look up, my pet, and tell me truly, if I may indeed call you my own dear
                  daughter."
               "If you will," was the soft reply.
               "My precious child, it is the one earnest desire of my heart. May God bless you,
                  my daughter! And if Charlie does not make you happy, I shall be tempted to
                  disinherit him." Then, turning to his son, he said:
               "My dear boy, I believe you will prove yourself worthy of the treasure which you
                  have won. God bless you!" and with tearful eyes turned away.
               Mrs. Herbert kissed Charlie, and remarked:
               "My son, you have made me happy. Why did you not inform us of this important event
                  before retiring last night, that we might have bestowed our blessings immediately
                  upon this union of hearts, which has ever been the dearest but unuttered wish of
                  your parents?"
               "My dear mother, the temptation to do so was very strong; but I saw that you all
                  were weary with anxious waiting and needed rest, and any additional excitement
                  would have banished sleep from your pillow. Furthermore, my bird escaped
                  immediately after I caught her, and I concluded it would be best to entrap her
                  again, so that she might be presented in person as my long-coveted treasure to our
                  beloved parents."
               The mail arrived soon afterward and was distributed; but no one save Mr. Herbert,
                  who had returned to the room, seemed inclined to disturb the blissful quietude
                  which had settled on their hearts by seeking elsewhere for pleasure or
                  entertainment.
               In looking over the morning news, a smile of agreeable surprise brightened the
                  countenance of Mr. Herbert, and at length he said:
               "Allow me to read the report of Robert Carlton's trial."
               He then read an account of proceedings, which have already been given, followed by
                  an exceedingly complimentary notice of Mr. Charles Herbert's speech, in which the
                  writer predicted a glorious career of fame and usefulness for the brilliant and
                  eloquent young orator.
               Charlie watched the expression of Lula's face as it glowed with surprise and
                  pleasure during the reading of the article, and inwardly pronounced himself "truly
                  blest," as he witnessed this undisguised manifestation of her affection for
                  him.
               As his father paused for a moment, his son laughingly remarked:
               "'Coming events cast their shadows before.' Last night I had dreams—sweet
                  dreams—of a bright and happy future, and this morning I find myself suddenly
                  famous, beside being the happiest man alive."
               His father responded mildly:
               "My son, let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not
                  thine own lips. Remember it is a divided honor which you receive from the press;
                  all the laurels are not bestowed upon you. Here is a well-deserved eulogium on the
                  splendid effort of Alfred Raymond." Mr. Herbert commenced to read again.
               Charlie turned a troubled glance on Lula at the sudden mention of Alfred's name,
                  and saw her grow deathly pale and gasp for breath as she listened; he hastily
                  threw his arm around her, and exclaimed, frantically:
               "Oh father, stop, for God's sake!"
               In an instant all were in the wildest confusion. Mr. and Mrs. Herbert were
                  entirely at a loss to comprehend the nature of this sudden attack which Charlie's
                  alarm had construed into something
                  serious, as they were under the impression that he had informed her of Raymond's
                  return.
               She recovered herself in a few minutes, and said:
               "I am sorry that you were all unnecessarily frightened; but I did not know that
                  Alfred had returned, and as nothing had been heard of him since he left home, I
                  imagined, as Annie did, that he was dead, until uncle surprised me greatly with
                  the account of his appearance at court."
               They were not, therefore, astonished at its effect upon the gentle girl, and
                  reproached themselves for neglecting to apprise her of his advent more cautiously.
                  Charlie's remorse was very great, and it was difficult to persuade him that Lula
                  was not seriously ill; he would insist that she must confine herself to the sofa
                  for the day and allow him to administer to her comfort.
               His father said:
               "Nonsense, Charlie! I do not intend you shall make a hot-house plant of my lily;
                  take her out into the fresh air."
               His advice was acted upon.
               Beneath embowering shades that excluded the noonday beams, beside the pellucid
                  stream and under the vine-clad arbor, 
                     Whose spreading height with purple clusters crown'd
                   they roamed and exchanged their vows of mutual love; hoping that in this
                  blissful home they would contentedly repose, performing their allotted duties with
                  grateful hearts to the bounteous Giver who so many blessings and bestowed. From
                  his inmost soul, Charlie repeated: 
                     
                        With thee the charm of life shall last,
                        Although its rosy bloom be past;
                        Shall still endure when Time shall spread
                        His silver blossoms o'er my head.
                        No more with this vain world perplex'd,
                        Thou shalt prepare me for the next;
                        The springs of life shall gently cease,
                        And angels point the way to peace.
                     
                  
               
               When they returned to the house some time afterward, and Mr. Herbert saw the fresh
                  bloom on her cheeks, he was assured his surmise was correct, and said:
               "My daughter, your air-bath has had a happy effect in restoring your color, and I
                  hope your walk has quite refreshed you."
               Going up to her, he put his hand under her chin, raised the lovely face, and
                  kissed it, and with a significant smile, asked:
               "What shall I write to the Hon. Mr. Gordon, my darling? Shall I tell him to
                  come?"
               "Oh, uncle! spare me if you please—ask Charlie."
               The young gentleman, with an air of conscious pride, responded:
               "We will send him our cards, joined together with a silver link or silken tie, and
                  bid him 'come, haste to the wedding!"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               
                  
                     
                        Sweet are the joys of home,
                        And pure as sweet; for they,
                        Like dews of morn and evening, come
                        To wake and close the day.
                     
                  
               
               AFTER the excitement of the trial had passed away, the friends of Alfred Raymond
                  observed his wan shadowy appearance, his pale, transparent complexion, and
                  wondered what secret sorrow could have left such deep traces on every lineament of
                  his face.
               With superior tact and skill he managed to evade their questions, and silently
                  nursed his grief. It had been his intention to return to his new home immediately
                  after the accomplishment of the important object which brought him to Georgia.
               His plan was strenuously opposed by his friends and acquaintances, who insisted
                  that he should not dissolve the ties which had bound them together during so many
                  happy years; that having entered upon a career of usefulness, he might serve with
                  credit to himself the land which had welcomed him so kindly when a friendless,
                  homeless, orphan boy, and should now remain at his post, and discharge with
                  fidelity the duties devolving upon him as a citizen and defender of the South.
               This argument staggered his resolution, and he promised to give the subject proper
                  deliberation before coming to a final decision; but as he had left Baltimore
                  without an hour's notice, he must necessarily return there: his sudden
                  disappearance might arouse suspicion in the minds of his newly made friends in
                  that city.
               Mr. Carlton would not allow him to carry this purpose into effect until his wife
                  had seen and thanked the generous, unselfish young man for his manly efforts in
                  behalf of her son. Therefore he was compelled, nolens
                     volens, to comply with his urgent request, and postpone his departure
                  for a short time.
               As the Carltons poured forth their thanks from grateful hearts to Charlie Herbert
                  and Alfred Raymond the next evening, and acknowledged their obligations by
                  numerous delicate acts and attentions, Alfred was irresistibly attracted toward
                  the exquisite, statue-like beauty, and soft, dreamy eyes of Alice.
               A strong impulse arose in his kind and generous nature to speak words of
                  compassion and comfort to the sad widow, upon whose life the night-shades of
                  remorse had settled with fearful gloom. As the evening wore on, the desire
                  increased to such an extent that his own sorrow was partially forgotten in intense
                  sympathy for her. He saw that the tempest of grief had passed away, and its
                  purifying effects were evident in her regenerated character. The brilliancy and
                  vivacity of her youth, which had sparkled like diamonds in sunshine, had given
                  place to softer, better, and more ennobling qualities, which interested him as she
                  had never done before. To him she now appeared 
                     
                        A being breathing thoughtful breath;
                        A traveler betwixt life and death;
                        The reason firm, the temperate will,
                        Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill,—
                        A perfect woman. Nobly planned,
                        To warn, to comfort, and command!
                        And yet a spirit still, and bright
                        With something of an angel light.
                     
                  
               
               "There is but one who can surpass her in loveliness," he said, mentally, as Mr.
                  Carlton interrupted the current of his thoughts, by asking:
               
               "Alfred, what is your opinion in regard to Robert's adopting medicine as a
                  profession?"
               "I think he would become an ornament to the fraternity. But why not follow the
                  law, Robert? With such talents as you possess, honorable distinction must soon be
                  yours."
               "Pardon me, Alfred; but I must decline further honors before the court, or among
                  the bar, as I have already gained sufficient notoriety there."
               He replied with a touch of his old humor, and added more seriously:
               "As I have been instrumental in destroying the life of one man, I desire to show
                  my contrition of heart by assisting in keeping others on terra firma as long as possible, and will begin the study of the
                  healing art, under the supervision of Dr. Clinton, forthwith."
               "Well," said Alfred, laughingly, "the art of medicine is held in high repute by
                  mankind—has engaged the attention of many very able men, and its adoption by you
                  may lead to the acquisition of an honor similar to that enjoyed by one of the
                  craft. It is said, that the death of a crowned-head created so great joy, on one
                  occasion, that, after his decease, the door of the dwelling of the attendant
                  physician was decorated with garlands, and the following inscription: 
                     
                        To the deliverer of his country."
                  
               
               Robert replied:
               "The medical profession, though laborious, is, I think, engaging—full of honors,
                  and affords the mind full scope for activity and entertainment."
               "Why not try the practice of hydropathy?" said Alfred, still inclined to indulge a
                  little humor with his friend.
               "Oh no!" said Robert; "Lamb says, 'it was tried in Noah's day, and it killed more
                  than it cured."
               Then soberly continued:
               "I can no longer be content to remain a pitiful drone in society, but will devote
                  the remainder of my life to the happiness and good of my fellow-creatures."
               Young Herbert remarked:
               "Young motive is truly commendable, Robert; and you could not have chosen a more
                  worthy or capable instructor than Dr. Clinton. He is indeed an alleviater of
                  life's miseries, and his name may be added to Harvey's, Garth's, Mead's,
                  Abernethy's, Velpeau's, and Mott's beside others of the same class, as a blessing
                  to mankind. Independent of his skill as a physician, his benevolence land
                  Christian example enable him to exert as great an influence in the community as
                  any minister of the gospel. The healing art has produced some noble heroes, whose
                  names and virtues will descend with unfading luster to the latest posterity. Pope,
                  notwithstanding he said, on one occasion, 'I am dying with a hundred good
                     symptoms,' bore honorable testimony to the skill of the faculty, and
                  many others have acknowledged their indebtedness to the medical profession for
                  prolonged pleasures and usefulness in life."
               That night, in dreams, Alfred Raymond saw the bright particular star, which had
                  ever appeared to be the star, of his destiny, retreat with undiminished radiance
                  from his wistful gaze, and another of mild luster appeared, and shed a soft,
                  soothing light upon his dark cheerless existence.
               He arose next morning, refreshed and hopeful, feeling that some invisible chain
                  still bound him to the sunny South, which he had scarce the power or inclination
                  to break asunder. He received a note from Lula, and read, with more calmness than
                  be could have done hitherto, the following lines:
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "DEAR ALFRED, whom I so honor and respect, words can convey to you no
                              adequate idea of the painful anxiety which your protracted absence has
                              occasioned the orphan girl, who has ever confided in your noble,
                              generous heart, as trustingly as a sister would in the pure unselfish
                              love of an affectionate brother.
                           "Since we first met, long years ago, no joy or pleasure was ever
                              complete unless shared by you. My youthful fears and disappointments,
                              when confided to you, were ever soothed with such skill and
                              gentleness, that bright hopes would spring from their ashes to cheer
                              my drooping heart. Thus I became dependent upon your affectionate care
                              and wiser judgment.
                           "Now, dear Alfred, I shall make a confession which I dared not do when
                              we parted. The love you then sought was given to Charlie Herbert,
                              before I ever met you, although I was unconscious of its nature, until
                              I believed he had offered his heart and hand to another. But in this
                              new relation my happiness will still be incomplete without your
                              sympathy, my dear brother; and hoping that you will not refuse it in
                              the present instance, I shall subscribe myself your affectionate
                              sister,
                           
                              "LULA GRAHAM."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               He pressed the letter to his lips, and exclaimed:
               "Heaven bless her dear truthful heart! I should be a fiend indeed to refuse the
                  request of such an angel. Blind idiot that I was not to have foreseen this!
                  Charlie, alone, is worthy of her, and I will yield willingly to his superior
                  claim."
               Then sighing, he seated himself with the air of Napoleon when meditating the
                  abdication of his crown and empire at Fontainebleau.
               After an interval, a tranquil expression, like soft moonlight light rising above
                  dark, leaden clouds, appeared on his face; then seizing a pen, wrote a long,
                  affectionate reply.
               He congratulated her on the superior choice she had made, and assured her of his
                  undying regard—his cordial sympathy—and his fraternal love, which neither time nor
                  circumstances could alter.
               After this letter was dispatched, Alfred decided to make Annie Clinton a
                  visit.
               In approaching the house, his eye was attracted in every direction by evidences of
                  reform, and refined taste in the improvement of the grounds. The undulating lawn
                  had been thinned of its matted undergrowth, and trees now stood in picturesque
                  groups over a bright green surface, where curved walks wound gracefully,
                  terminating at various places of beauty and interest. Sculptured vases of Maltese
                  stone decorated the grounds, and the rippling stream, fringed with a mosaic of
                  wild flowers, rolled here and there like sparkling diamonds, forming miniature
                  cascades.
               Annie saw Raymond as he drew near, and rushing out to meet him, exclaimed,
                  joyfully:
               "Dear Alfred, I am delighted to see you! I am indeed content, now that you have
                  returned. It was impossible for me to be entirely happy, while your fate was
                  involved in so much doubt and obscurity."
               "My sweet cousin, I am rejoiced to find you looking so bright and cheerful, and to
                  know that you preside over this Arcadian landscape, surrounded by every comfort
                  and elegance necessary to make life desirable.
               "The place is so completely metamorphosed, that I should never have recognized it,
                  had I not been aware of its precise locality. I feel as if I had been mysteriously
                  transported to land of painters and fine arts, so complete is every arrangement
                  here. And the Italian verandas—the ornamental chimney tops and irregular
                  sky-outline of the building—all
                  harmonize perfectly with the charming scenery."
               "The doctor has shown himself to be quite an adept in landscape gardening—he has
                  brought order out of chaos, and made this wilderness blossom as the rose. Walk
                  into the house; I rushed out very unceremoniously to meet you, leaving Robert
                  Carlton and Alice in the parlor with Dr. Clinton. Robert has petitioned to be
                  received into the doctor's office as a medical student."
               During his visit, Alfred made inquiries about various friends and
                  acquaintances—among others, Julia Stanly.
               At the mention of her name, Annie laughed, and said:
               "Oh! I must tell you a piece of news which I gleaned on yesterday from my friend
                  and ally, Sallie Ridgly. She informed me that Julia Stanly had positively made a
                  conquest of a wealthy widower, who numbers his dollars by the hundred thousand,
                  and his children by the half dozen. Her elegant trousseau is actually being prepared, and the corbeille presented by the expectant bridegroom is as
                  rich and handsome in some respects as the one given by General Junot to
                  Mademoiselle Permon, on the eve of their marriage."
               "I suppose she had despaired then of winning Charlie Herbert," observed Dr.
                  Clinton.
               "Yes, she pretends to have given him a touch of her slipper," was the laughing
                  reply.
               Robert exclaimed, ironically:
               "Poor Charlie! He seems to bear his defeat with wonderful composure. I rather
                  think this infatuated widower in the course of time will give the same experience
                  as the man who said that, for the first six weeks after marriage, he wanted to eat
                  his wife up, because she was so sweet, and had been sorry ever since that he had
                  not done it."
               "It is to be hoped she will prove a better stepmother than she has a friend; if
                  nor, the poor children will be greatly to be pitied," observed Dr. Clinton.
               Alfred Raymond was again subjected to the mesmeric influence of Alice's soft
                  dreamy eyes, and after she had left the room with her brother, Annie asked:
               "Is she not perfectly lovely, Alfred?"
               "She is indeed!"
               Then lapsing into silence he appeared lost in thought, until Dr. Clinton inquired
                  if he had fully decided to make his home in Baltimore.
               "No; I shall return here in a few weeks and link my destiny for weal or for woe
                  with the sunny South."
               "You have decided wisely, for I am certain that you will never find stancher
                  friends elsewhere; and from the favorable impression produced in the community by
                  your speech in court, I may safely predict that your fortune is made."
               Annie exclaimed with great delight: "Oh, Alfred! I am quite relieved by your
                  change of purpose. Now that my mind is entirely at ease on this subject, I can
                  employ my leisure hours, during the doctor's absence, with my favorite amusement
                  of castle-building for you, Charlie, and Robert; and the heroines of my airy
                  palaces shall be Lula, Alice, and lastly, though by no means the least in this
                  catalogue of choice spirits, is Mary Clinton, the doctor's lovely sister, who is
                  to spend the next winter with us. Oh, Alfred! you must see and know Mary to
                  appreciate her. 
                     
                        Sweet thoughts are mirrored in her face,
                        And every motion is a grace."
                     
                  
               
               Here the conservation was interrupted by a waiting-maid, who entered the room and
                  said to Annie:
               "Missis, I want to speak wid you a minute."
               Annie excused herself and left the room.
               
               Just outside the door the girl spoke again to her mistress.
               "Aunt Chloe told me to ax you what you gwine to have for dinner. She say how she
                  thought bein' as you had company, you might want to have a chicken killed or
                  sumtin' nother besides what you have every day. She say how bein' as you's so
                  young she must think for you."
               The young housekeeper smiled, and replied:
               "Tell Aunt Chloe, I shall expect her to have a very nice dinner—such as she has
                  every day; but I think it is too late now to kill a chicken; and besides, we shall
                  have sufficient without that addition."
               Then, returning to the parlor, she renewed the conversation which has been
                  abruptly broken off.
               In a few minutes the girl returned and requested another audience.
               Annie followed the servant, who said:
               "Aunt Chloe says you better have some fritters or sumtin' nother; that when
                  company come in onexpected, old missis use to always have fritters or hasty
                  pudding, or sometin' nother got up in a hurry."
               "Tell her it is not necessary: the dinner I ordered this morning will do very
                  well; and Sally, you must have it served up immediately, for the doctor is
                  compelled to visit his patients at the usual hours."
               Annie had scarcely seated herself again, when another voice called to her from
                  under the window:
               "Miss, oh miss! can't you make dese childin' quit fiting out here? Joe's done hit
                  Bill and made his nose bleed like all forty; and he's done fall down flat on his
                  back, bellowin' just like somebody dun kilt him."
               There arose such a deafening chorus of frightful screams from the yard, that the
                  inmates of the parlor rushed to the window in alarm.
               A dozen or more little black urchins were hallooing with all their might, and
                  scampering away in great haste; while old Elsy, with her left hand on her back and
                  a stick in her right, was after them at full speed, striking away and sparing
                  none, until she was outstripped in the race. Then she stopped almost breathless,
                  and called out:
               "Neber mind, you young rascals, I'll ketch you yet, and make you know how to come
                  'bout white folks' house makin' all dis racket."
               After the tumult had subsided in the distance, Alfred remarked, laughingly:
               "Well, Cousin Annie, I think if you undertake to civilize these barbarians, you
                  will have but little time left for literary pursuits."
               "I agree with you, and have often thought there was no class of persons whose
                  duties were so onerous and so complicated as those of a Southern planter's wife.
                  She must he mistress, maid, housekeeper, and nurse; besides, she must maintain her
                  dignity as a lady, even while she is necessarily the companion and friend of the
                  negroes, or they will neither respect nor obey her. If these qualities are not all
                  concentrated in the person of the mistress, the whole establishment will be in
                  constant turmoil and confusion. Still I hope for better days in future, and by
                  exercising patience and perseverance, I may be able to train them to observe some
                  degree of order and system, as they appear amiably disposed, and are willing to be
                  taught by me. Indeed, they have improved astonishingly since we have had them in
                  charge."
               Dr. Clinton observed:
               "They have never been accustomed to the attention of refined persons, and served
                  Mrs. Grant through fear alone, but they seem devotedly attached to Annie and
                  myself, and often annoy us with their attention. They appeal to us in every
                  dilemma and on all occasions, that they may show their confidence and knowledge of
                  our superior judgment. The negro having been controlled and thought for, for generations past, is a mere child
                  as regards mental vigor and activity. He succumbs readily to a superior
                  intelligence, yields implicit obedience to the enlightened opinions of his owner,
                  and manifests an abiding faith in his ability and willingness to watch over and
                  protect him. It is this that secures and strengthens the strong feeling of
                  attachment that exists between the master and servant, and tends to rendering his
                  condition that of happiness and contentment."
               They who understand the peculiarities of the negro character will readily assent
                  to the truth of Dr. Clinton's observations; they who do not, have, much to learn,
                  in order to comprehend his nature and the influences that are brought to bear on
                  him.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXV.
               
                  
                     
                        Marriage is a matter of more worth
                        Than to be dealt in by attorneyship.
                     
                     
                        The treasures of the deep are not so precious
                        As the concealed comforts of man
                        Lock'd up in woman's love.
                     
                  
               
               THE glorious sunset had declined into the soft shadows of twilight, and silently
                  the sparkling eyes of night glistened in the azure dome as the sonorous tones of
                  the church-bell broke upon the stillness of the evening air, inviting a willing
                  audience to assemble within the house of God.
               The beautiful church was brilliantly illuminated, and soon filled with a gay and
                  fashionable throng, among whom splendid costumes and sparkling jewels glittered
                  with a thousand dies. Eager, expectant eyes were constantly turning toward the
                  chief entrance, as if the object which attracted them to that consecrated place
                  had not appeared.
               At length the deep solemn notes of the organ reverberated through the vaulted
                  roof, and there was a lull in the restless congregation, as a long and elegant
                  bridal procession passed up the center aisle—then with alternate couples diverging
                  to the right and left, formed a semicircle around the sacred altar.
               The venerable Dr. Hall, with silvery locks and face beaming with benevolence and
                  holy love, stood before them like some saintly priest of old, in majesty and
                  dignity, as the guardian of the holy temple.
               
               For a moment he gazed fondly on the fair young bride, and his bright eye glistened
                  with a tear—his voice quavered with tender emotion as he placed the broad circlet
                  of gold upon the small tapering finger of Lula Graham, his favorite pupil, whom he
                  had tutored with loving care. Then, in the presence of God and the vast
                  assemblage, he sealed her heart's contract with Charlie Herbert.
               The eyes of the bridegroom dwelt proudly and fondly upon his beautiful bride, and
                  as his fervent, manly response broke through the stillness of that crowded church,
                  every heart present indorsed his sacred pledge to love and cherish the pure and
                  priceless treasure which had been trustingly confided to his care and his
                  honor.
               Among the spectators there was a shrouded figure which darted lightning glances of
                  deadly hatred from a pair of magnificent black eyes, and when friends rushed
                  around the newly-wedded pair with blessings and congratulations, the veil was
                  excitedly thrown aside from the face of that crouching form, disclosing the
                  features of Julia Stanly distorted with envy, rage, and malice. From her heart
                  came fierce imprecations upon the lovely bride who had won the affection of
                  Charlie Herbert, thereby causing her to assume the woeful wreath, and accept the
                  hand of one whose hoary locks were concealed by the artful dye which hides the
                  frost of age, and whose willful, ill-tempered children were the bane and torment
                  of her life.
               Plato says "that the affections are as the wings and chariots of the wind, in
                  which, if properly directed, we may, like Elias, be carried toward heaven; but if
                  left to the guidance of inexperience and the evil passions, we may, Phton-like, be
                  driven about madly and hurled head-long into ruin and destruction."
               Julia had followed her evil passions, and was reaping the bitter fruit of her
                  sinful folly. In giving away to impulse, she had, in an unguarded moment, betrayed
                  her duplicity to Charlie Herbert, and when, like Tantalus, she was reaching forth
                  her hand for the coveted prize, it had eluded her grasp. Mortified and chagrined
                  at her shameful exposure, she determined to accept the antiquated lover, whose
                  golden charms would hide a multitude of faults, and dazzle with her splendor and
                  magnificence the friends and companions of her youth.
               But alas, for her brilliant, golden dreams! Her husband proved a miserly despot,
                  and had exhausted his liberality in spreading a costly net and forging gilded
                  chains for his beautiful captive. When this was accomplished, the mask was thrown
                  aside, and he appeared in his true colors, showing himself a competent and
                  experienced general—a strict disciplinarian, who required unconditional obedience
                  and perfect submission on the part of her who had promised so lightly to love,
                  honor, and obey until death should separate them.
               His children had been humored and indulged to excess by injudicious relatives and
                  friends of his former wife, who taught them to look with suspicion upon the young
                  step-mother, and from the first poor Julia's best intention respecting them was
                  doubted and repulsed.
               Finally, she became weary and discouraged in her fruitless efforts to conciliate
                  them, and gladly left these immortal jewels of a dead mother to their willful
                  course.
               She had returned on a visit to her childhood's home, a disappointed and unhappy
                  wife, to pour out her anger bitter grievances into the ear of her weak, doting
                  mother, who regretted with sighs and tears that her beautiful daughter had sold
                  herself for filthy lucre into a bondage most hateful and degrading.
               Mrs. Stanly was totally unconscious of any existing cause for a personal dislike
                  toward Charlie Herbert or Lula Graham, and wishing to divert the mind of her
                  unhappy daughter from her personal affairs, insisted that she should witness the marriage at church, which
                  had for weeks past created an immense excitement in the community.
               Julia was not averse to this plan, provided she could remain incognito; therefore, separating herself from the
                  family party at the church door, and drawing a veil over her face, took a position
                  behind one of the columns which supported the gallery, where she could see but
                  remain unseen. There she sat, grinding her beautiful white teeth and clinching her
                  hands until the nails were pressed into the tender flesh, listening in hopeless
                  despair to the plighted vows of mutual love.
               When Charlie Herbert and Lula Graham were pronounced husband and wife, the
                  miserable Julia gave one faint, smothered cry and sprang to her feet; then like a
                  hissing serpent did she send forth low curses from her vindictive heart upon the
                  heads of the married pair.
               As the cortege was leaving the church, she saw
                  the young wife, in her innocence and dazzling beauty, look up to him who held her
                  destiny for this world in his hands, and the glance was trusting and fearless, for
                  the eyes that met her own so tenderly were noble and true.
               The wretched woman, who crouched again beneath the shadows, knew that the gallant
                  young man would peril his life to save his peerless bride from pain or sorrow.
               Poor, miserable Julia! her own sad condition arose in painful contrast before her,
                  and in mental anguish she cried:
               "O God! It is more than I can bear! Let me die!"
               Marriage is an institution of divine origin, ordained by God and sanctioned by
                  Jesus Christ, whose first miracle was performed at Cana of Galilee, where he
                  appeared to witness this holy bond of union between man and woman. Other contracts
                  may be sundered by mutual consent of parties who form them, but the divine
                  Lawgiver has forbidden bidden the dissolution of that sacred tie which was formed
                  in the garden of Eden before the tempter seduced man to his sinful state.
               The holy mandate proclaims: "For this cause shall a man leave father and mother
                  and shall cleave to his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh.
               "Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined
                  together, let no man put asunder."
               This bond is perpetual on earth, and nothing but crime or death can dissolve the
                  connection.
               Dr. Johnson says:
               "Marriage is the strictest tie of perpetual friendship, and there can be no
                  friendship without confidence, and no confidence without integrity; and he must
                  expect to be wretched, who pays to beauty, riches, or politeness, that regard
                  which only virtue and piety can claim."
               Woe to those who from base and dishonorable motives will perjure themselves with
                  sacred vows and false lips, hoping thereby to secure permanent pleasure or worldly
                  aggrandizement! The vengeance of Heaven will fall with blighting force upon their
                  guilty, sacrilegious hearts, and bring to naught such unholy schemes of
                  happiness.
               Let us leave the wretched, perjured Julia to the bitter, corroding reflections on
                  her sinful folly, as with tear-stained face she pursues her homeward way, while
                  the unspoken thought of that aching heart was, 
                     
                        A bird of free and careless wing,
                        Was I, through many a smiling spring;
                        But caught within the subtle snare
                        I burn and feebly flutter there
                     
                  
               
               
               As the sentinel on duty at the gates of Belvoir gave notice of approaching
                  vehicles, the word of command was given in a loud magniloquent tone by some sable
                     satellite of the house, and hundreds
                  of brilliant flaming torches, borne by black, stalwart forms, with shining rows of
                  ivory between their vermilion lips, suddenly margined either side of the
                  carriage-way and encircled the mansion.
               The golden light flashed like magic about the elegant structure with its graceful
                  verandas, and through the open windows, displaying the rich adornments of its
                  interior, and over trees, flowers, shrubbery, and statuary. The waters of the
                  stream and fountains caught the reflected light and sparkled like liquid silver,
                  as it dropped into marble basins or dashed merrily over cascades, presenting a
                  scene of enchanted beauty. Myriads of golden stars gleamed from the tranquil sky,
                  but the magician's wand seemed to have touched the earth, and, for the moment,
                  rendered it more gorgeously beautiful.
               As the carriage containing the bridal pair entered the portal of their home, a
                  loud simultaneous shout arose from the torch bearers, and was echoed from hill and
                  dale.
               "God bless young master and his beautiful bride!"
               Then with stentorian voices they sang: 
                     
                        Strew the pathway with flow'rs,
                        And deck the lovely bow'rs,
                        For the young wedded pair,
                        Who are both good and fair.
                        Let blessings rich and rare
                        Come unburden'd with care,
                        On the groom and the bride
                        Whom we welcome with pride.
                        Oh! welcome, welcome home;
                        Fair bride and noble groom;
                        Oh! may you never roam,
                        From loving friends at home.
                     
                  
               
               As Mr. Herbert listened to this unexpected and humble tribute of affectionate
                  regard toward the young couple, from his faithful negroes, he remarked to his
                  wife:
               "This is quite an agreeable surprise, for which I suppose we are indebted to
                  Robert, our efficient butler, as it has been arranged with his usual good taste
                  and proper ideas of decorum."
               "Yes, he is the prime mover and chief instrument in getting up this grand
                  reception, and I rather suspect he is the poet-minstrel also, who has celebrated
                  this auspicious event in our family, as his penchant for verse making is proverbial among Charlie's
                  friends."
               When Charlie's carriage drew up before the door, he sprang out, but before he
                  could assist his bride in descending, he was besieged by an innumerable number of
                  rough black hands, and forced to hear noisy, but heartfelt congratulations, that
                  fell upon his ear like the confusion at the tower of Babel.
               Before he could extricate himself from the grasp of his colored friends, Lula was
                  taken from the carriage, folded in a pair of stout arms of dusky hue, and forcibly
                  hurried into the house.
               "Do you 'xpect I'm going to let you niggers devour this angel? If you do, you's
                  mighty mistaken. You shan't put the weight of your hands on her to-night." Such
                  was Betty's laughing remark, as she bore off her fair captive in triumph.
               "That's right, Aunt Betty, for these plantation folks don't know the difference
                  between Brussels lace and factory homespun, and were just ready to tear her to
                  pieces, and she wouldn't have been fit to receive the company," was Lizzie's
                  joyful observation. Turning to the disappointed and crest-fallen negroes, she
                  added: "Now you all go and look in the drawing-room windows, and you'll see the
                  bride come down presently like an angel from heaven."
               The femme de chambre's suggestion was adopted,
                  and they thronged around the doors and windows, watching with delight every motion of the lovely bride, as
                  she welcomed and received the congratulations of her dear "five hundred
                  friends."
               With graceful ease and composure she stood in their midst, arrayed in a robe
                  exquisite Brussels lace, which floated like a fleecy cloud over a soft Turkish
                  satin of silvery brightness. A richly-wrought veil of the same gossamer texture as
                  her dress was confined by a wreath of orange-buds and flowers, beneath which were
                  seen the glossy ringlets that were rolled from her fair brow and gathered in a
                  heavy mass behind the head—drooping over neck and shoulders that would have
                  rivaled the masterworks of Praxiteles and Canova. No jewels marred the ethereal
                  purity of the dress; no diamonds save those which sparkled beneath the long silken
                  lashes; no pearls save those that glistened between the ruby lips adorned her
                  person; but fair and pure as a lily, before the first kiss of the morning sunbeam
                  has robbed it of the dewy freshness, she appeared to her admiring friends.
               As Charlie stood apart, gazing fondly and proudly on his lovely treasure, Robert
                  Carlton approached, and throwing his arm over the shoulder of his friend,
                  said:
               "Ah, Herbert, you are indeed a happy fellow, and deservedly so! If my friendship
                  for you did not equal, that of Damon and Pythias, I could not have stood so calmly
                  by and seen that glorious creature link her destiny with yours."
               "Thank you, Robert! But if I mistake not, you would object more to Miss Clinton's
                  bestowing her hand on any other than my noble friend, Dr. Carlton. I feel to-night
                  as if some prophet's mantle had fallen on my shoulders, and I could lift the veil
                  which hides the future from other eyes. There I see the love of Mary Clinton
                  pouring sweet incense over your life, and twining garlands of peace, joy, and
                  happiness around your heart, which is continually tinually blessing and asking
                  blessings on her who scattered 
                     
                        Roses of bliss on your thorn-covered way,
                        Roses of paradise sent from above.
                     
                   My dear friend, happiness is within your grasp. Do not let it escape."
               "She is indeed a prize worth winning; and I sincerely hope you may be correct in
                  your predictions, for I have never seen but one other whom I wished to call my
                  wife."
               "If Miss Clinton will consent to unite her fate with yours, I will insure your
                  future happiness; for it will then be established on a solid and immovable basis,
                  which will defy and successfully repel the tempter's wiles.
               Dear Robert, take my advice and follow the dictates of your heart, and my word for
                  it you will never regret the step."
               "The temptation to do so is very powerful; but oh, Charlie, I fear the result may
                  again drive me to despair!"
               "'Faint heart never won fair lady,'" was the reply, as they were suddenly
                  interrupted by a request to repair to the banquet hall.
               Gentle reader, the far-famed and generous hospitality of the South will justly
                  condemn the writer if she should fail to introduce you to the sumptuous feast
                  prepared for this occasion, the profusion and elegance of which would have cause
                  Cleopatra to blush with mortification for the unstateful coarseness
                  of her entertainments to Mark Antony. Cicero and Pompey would have refused a
                  second invitation to sup with Lucullus if they has been favored with a sight of
                  this delightful repast; and the guests of Caligula would have returned with
                  disgust from his valuable pearls dissolved in vinegar, to have partaken of the
                     luscious cious strawberries
                  smothered in cream, which were heaped in crystal stands over the festive board
                  that literally groaned under its luxurious burden. There were the boned turkeys
                  and oysters; hams which surpassed in flavor the famous Westphalia's; juicy
                  tongues, sardines, lobsters, and salmon; fowls and game of every description;
                  barbecued pigs which constituted the special pride and delight of our friend Joe,
                  the chief cuisinier at Belvoir. Delicious
                  salads, that 
                     
                        Would tempt the dying anchorite to eat;
                        Back to the world he'd turn his fleeting soul,
                        And plunge his fingers in the salad bowl.
                     
                   Pyramids of jelly, that vied in hue with bright, transparent rubies and pale
                  amber; exquisite fairy-like temples formed of crystallized oranges, and decorated
                  with dark-green leaves of the same golden fruit; pine-apples of delicious aroma;
                  apples, pears, and the famous Chinese peaches, the latter of which were of a size,
                  flavor, and juiciness unsurpassed, and of miraculous weight. Luscious grapes of
                  various kinds—fresh white, purple, and black figs, placed on large silver epergnes, were conspicuous among this rare and
                  tempting profusion, as was "the blest sherbet sublimed with snow," and towers of
                  ice-cream, of unique mould and lovely proportion. Rich cakes, of every form and
                  variety, were covered with a delicate frosting of wreaths and bouquets, that, in
                  their pure and artistic beauty, appeared as if Flora alone had designed them for
                  the bridal feast.
               But confident that no description can do justice to this elegant repast, which was
                  worthy of the luxurious Romans or their gods, your attention is invited to the
                  magnificent display of flowers that decorated the tables, from which arose
                  delicious perfumes that would have sufficed to regale the voluptuous senses of
                  Nero or Heliogabulus. If, as some among the Greeks and Romans believe, the odor of
                  flowers will counteract the effect of wine and brighten the action of the brain,
                  we doubt not that on this occasion the guests were amply fortified against the
                  effect of the rich, rare, and sparkling wines that were freely offered to them by
                  the hospitable proprietor of Belvoir.
               Later in the evening, when Robert Carlton approached Mary Clinton, her tell-tale
                  blushes and modest, winning smile indicated to other eyes than Charlie Herbert's
                  where she had placed her affection.
               Robert said, in speaking of this meeting afterwards: 
                     
                        "Then through my brain the thought did pass,
                        Even as a flash of lightning there,
                        That there was something in her air
                        Which would not doom me to despair;
                        And on the thought my words broke forth,
                        All incoherent as they were—
                        Their eloquence was little worth,
                        But yet she listen'd—'tis enough—
                        Who listens once will listen twice;
                        Her heart, be sure, is not of ice."
                     
                  
               
               Then he added: 
                     
                        "I loved, and was beloved again,
                        In sooth it is a happy doom."
                     
                  
               
               Some days after the wedding, during a confidential tte--tte with his sister,
                  Robert Carlton informed her of his engagement with Mary Clinton, but regretted
                  that he was forced to serve out a twelvemonth's probation, according to the
                  doctor's urgent request. Then Alice, who had doffed her widow's weeds, and was
                  looking as bright and cheerful as in the happy days of her girlhood, blushingly
                  acknowledged that Alfred Raymond had won her heart, with a promise of her hand at
                  some future day. She confessed fessed
                  that once before, without a moment's reflection, and in a paroxysm of delirious
                  excitement, she had resigned herself to the keeping of another; but as that person
                  had proved himself unworthy of respect, she soon repented of her folly.
               Now, in justice to Alfred and herself, she had determined not to enter into the
                  sacred covenant of matrimony again, without proper reflection and due
                  deliberation.
               Robert caught her in his arms, pressed her to his bosom, and exclaimed:
               "I thank God it is so, my darling sister! Now I can take you freely to my heart
                  again, and Alfred Raymond's honored name will blot all remembrance of your former
                  error. God bless you, my sweet sister! You have indeed won a glorious prize, and I
                  am impatient to receive him as a brother."
               In due time the two weddings were celebrated with customary splendor, and in
                  witnessing the happiness of their children, Mr. and Mrs. Carlton thanked the Lord,
                  who had blessed their latter days more than the beginning, and ascribed all praise
                  and glory to Him who giveth every good and perfect gift.
               "These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes,
                  and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."
               Such was the happy condition of affairs in our favored land, when the trumpets, 
                     Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death,
                   proclaimed the existence of war between the North and South.
               We forbear to speak of the causes that produced the long and sanguinary
                  struggle—of the trials and hardships endured by our people—the brilliant victories
                  won by our gallant troops against overwhelming numbers—the destruction of life and
                  property, and the poverty entailed upon children. Suffice it to say our cause was
                  lost; and truly did the bard of Olney speak when he said: 
                     
                        The State that strives for liberty, though foiled,
                        And forced to abandon what she bravely sought,
                        Deserves at least applause for her attempt,
                        And pity for her loss.
                     
                  
               
               
               The scenes depicted in the foregoing pages are true, as every native Southerner
                  well knows. The pictures of wealth and hospitality may hereafter be referred to in
                  history, poetry, and song. The confidence and familiarity that once existed
                  between the master and servant—the happy condition of the latter, as shown prior
                  to the war, together with the delightful associations connected with plantation
                  life—belong to the past and will never be revived.
               That was a beautiful system of worship among the ancients, that converted every
                  grove, every fountain, and every rock into the dwelling of a Nymph, a Naiad, or a
                  God. Almost every object was assigned to the guardianship of some supernatural
                  being, and the romantic associations connected with them by the people of
                  antiquity afford a delightful theme for contemplation.
               Let our associations of our country be those of holy remembrance—let our
                  historians, orators, and poets invest every hill, valley, and dell, from the
                  Potomac to the Rio Grande, with hallowed feelings, and remember that Pliny is
                  still read with delight, that the soul-stirring appeals of Tully are yet echoed
                  over the hills of Italy, and that the stanzas of Tasso are not forgotten in
                  Venice.
               
               The present condition of the South gives rise to feelings of mistrust and
                  discontent, causing the thoughtful to pause and reflect as to what the future may
                  reveal; and many have thought of abandoning the haunts of youth, and seeking an
                  asylum abroad.
               To such I would say, Beware! forsake not the inheritance of your fathers. The
                  exiled Swiss becomes melancholy and depressed when he hears the Rans-de-Vanche of
                  his Fatherland; and should the spirit-stirring notes of Dixie greet your ears on
                  foreign shores, you, too, will sigh for the home of your heart—your native
                  land.
               Though the clouds of anarchy and strife now lower and darken the political
                  horizon, though you are bound like Ixion to the wheel, and condemned like Sisyphus
                  to roll a stone to the mountain's top, put your trust in Him who does all things
                  well, and hope for the time when the land of our birth may rear its head proudly
                  above the other powers of the earth—when she will exhibit to an admiring world a
                  government lovely in its proportion and symmetrical in its parts—one in which the
                  States will revolve in their respective orbits, in a manner as grand and as
                  magnificent as Herschel's dance of the Sidereal system.
            
            THE END.
