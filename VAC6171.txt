            INTRODUCTION.
            FOR forty days and forty nights the rain poured down from the open windows of the
               heavens, until the flood covered the earth, and the sun, after the storm, smiled down
               upon the watery waste, where a world lay entombed. Solitary and alone, without helm,
               mast, or sail, like a speck on the world-wide ocean, floated the ark with its
               freight. The olive branch, borne upon a weary but glad wing, proclaimed the subsiding
               of the deluge. The sunbeams kissed the vapors as they rolled up from the retiring
               waters, and the bow of promise lifted its arch into the clouds.
            Noah went out and planted a vineyard. He partook of its fruits, and lay in his tent
               in the slumbers of drunkenness. The frailties of a good man, are used to justify the
               drinking usages of to-day. The scourge of a world passed away had commenced its progress again in the new. From that
               vineyard the tide has swept on, gathering in depth and power, until the debris of
               human ruin has been left on every shore where human foot has trodden. Stream has
               mingled with stream, and wave followed wave, until every land and people has been
               scourged. In the hamlet, the city, the country, or wilderness, the influence has been
               the same. Nations have been drunken to madness. New woes and keener sorrows have been
               sent out to stalk through the world, followed by red-handed crime and ghastly death.
               Beneath those oblivious waves, the brightest hopes of earth and Heaven have gone
               down, and up and down the world the stricken millions have wasted away, and
               prematurely mingled with a mother dust. North, east, south and west, the plague has
               spread. The white sails of commerce have borne it across oceans. The pioneer has
               carried it across the wilderness. The trader has scaled the mountain range, and thus,
               in civilized and savage clime, the noon-day scourge has sped on in its mission of
               ruin. In the hut of the savage, or where science, letters and art have elevated and
               refined, the effects have been the same. The very heart of human society has been
               poisoned, until along every artery of health and strength, the hot currents have
               swept in their blighting power. The shadow has fallen across every hearth-side, and
               at the altar's base, and lingered there like the foot-prints of unutterable woe.
               Every house has had one dead in it—every circle has been broken. Homes are ruined and
               deserted, and fields turned to waste. The wife and the children are driven out from
               the home-roof, and to-day the mothers of America, like Niobe of old, as they weep at
               their broken altars, are attempting to shield their offspring from the shafts which
               fall thickly around, and quiver in the tender hearts they love. It is Intemperance
               that we speak of, the history of whose desolations has outstripped the wildest
               imagery of tragic fiction, and laughed to scorn the efforts of the tongue, pen, or
               pencil. If hell has one more potent enginery of human degradation and crime upon
               earth than another, it is Intemperance. Its very sound sends a thrill back to the
               heart, and a Gorgon monster slowly rises up from its feast of blood among the
               graves.
            The gloomy night of Intemperance long rested upon the world, and no day-star in the
               horizon. The death slumber was deep and profound. Like the fabled city which was petrified into stone, no
               trumpet blast rang out to awaken to life. Wo and Want went hand in hand, Vice and
               Violence stalked unobstructed, and Crime laughed and reeled in its drunkenness of
               blood. Alone in the sky, the malign light of the death-beacon followed man from the
               cradle to the grave. The monster sat at every gathering. At the birth, marriage, or
               death; in the home, shop, or field; at the social re-union, or the festive day—in
               hut, palace, or council hall, it plied its work. The mother fed rum to her babe with
               her own hand, or through the resources of life. The fair young bride stood at the
               altar in the light of her bright life-dream, and handed the goblet to him she had
               chosen to accompany in the pilgrimage of life. At the social board, the father
               followed the marriage prayer with a glass. In the silence of the night, where the
               living had just passed to the rest of death, the decanter kept its watch with the
               watchers. The friends of the deceased came to look once more upon the dead, and
               stopped at the sideboard as they passed out. The pall-bearers tipped the bottle and
               bore away their burden to the home in the churchyard. The father of the writer once
               lost a loved young brother. With a heart heavy with grief, he took the jug, and at
               the rumshop, which was beggaring the family, purchased rum to treat the friends at
               the funeral. What wonder, then, that Intemperance, like the red plough-share of ruin,
               went under every hearth.
            A missionary once found a heathen mother in tears. She wrung her hands as she left
               her hot kisses upon the bloodless lips of a beautiful child, calm in the slumbers of
               death. The little treasure had been bitten by a serpent. The woman was one of the
               serpent-worshippers, and the reptile, which had robbed her of her first and only
               child, lay coiled at the hearthside of the home it had made desolate, safe from the
               avenging hand of the superstitious mother. She would not destroy it. Need we wonder
               at the superstition of the benighted heathen? To-day, America is a nation of
                  serpent-worshippers. We look around us, and how many homes are there where
               the serpent is coiled, yet madly cherished by those who have mourned the loved and
               the good, poisoned to death by its fangs! And at the same time we see a great and
               free people hesitating about crushing these serpents! The darker rites and fearful
               religion of the poor Pagan, can but share our sympathies.
            
            We are proud of our country and its institutions. There is no land like our land; no
               people like our people; no lakes like our lakes; no streams like our streams; no
               prairies like our prairies, or mountains like our mountains, as they sit upon a
               continent and nod to each other in the clouds. American enterprise and American
               genius, inventive and literary, is startling a world from its slumbers. The heart of
               our Republic throbs upon two shores; and yet, at the heart of all our free
               institutions a cancer is tugging with never-resting energy. For its removal,
               Christians and philanthropists are marshaling.
            It is but little over one-quarter of a century since a land so favored groaned in a
               bondage unbroken. No light had broke in: no star had beamed out to guide our wise men
               to a Saviour. Humanity wept over the desolations. Patriotism saw its first stars pale
               and set in darkness. Religion saw its most gifted ones fall to rise no more. The
               strongest were in shackles, and the friend of his country and of man looked out sadly
               upon the scene, and saw no morning light in the dark night. Foreigners stigmatized us
               as a nation of drunkards. Thus, unobstructed, the work went on. The great deep of
               popular opinion had not been stirred by a single breath, but lay in its stillness
               until miasma had bred in its sluggish bosom, and rolled up to sicken and destroy. The
               thunder of popular will slumbered uninvoked in the ballot-box, or like the
               three-mouthed dog of hell, sleeplessly guarded the wrongs there entrenched. A scourge
               was abroad in the land, yet a free and Christian people slept over their wrongs, and
               yielded, without an effort, to the annual conscription of Intemperance.
            But a better era was to dawn upon our country. A brazen serpent was lifted. The
               trumpet blasts of a Beecher and a Kittridge startled the petrified city into life.
               The plume tossed in the conflict, the war-horse plunged and chafed, and in the light
               of the coming morning the BANNER OF TEMPERANCE rolled out like a beacon of hope and
               promise to gladden a world. A breath has swept the valley of Hinnom, and the sleepers
               arise. The ocean is swept by the storm, and hope springs up in the human heart. The
               light comes slowly, but it bears healing upon its wings, and heralds redemption to a
               rum-scourged world. There is joy in heaven and upon earth. The mother weeps tears of
               joy, and clasps her child to her bosom with a prayer of gratitude for the promise
               which speaks of a better day for her and
               hers. And so the great moral revolution has commenced—a war of extermination, ending
               only when the rum traffic shall exist no longer. A free people are girding for the
               conflict with a hoary curse, saying to its armies, as they wage the strife from
               pillar to pillar—"Thus far, and no farther."
            The history of the Temperance Reformation is not yet written. The strife is yet in
               progress. But that history will occupy the brightest pages of our country's annals,
               and command the admiration of the world. We look back with a full heart and kindling
               eye upon that history. There is a moral sublimity and beauty in the record. It is
               like the beaming of the setting sunlight across the ocean. Storms may have swept the
               surface, and its waves dashed angrily upon the shore; but in its calm there is a wake
               of crimson and gold—a beautiful pathway, where angels might tread. The course of our
               reform has been marked by the most important results. It has carried blessings to
               myriads of hearts and homes. There is an angel in its waters, and peace, happiness
               and hope spring up where desolation has withered up the greenness of earth. It is
               destined to revolutionize the sentiment of a world. It enlists all that is lovely and
               noble in the human heart—the eloquence of poetry, and the inspiration of genius; the
               fervor of patriotism, and the zeal of religion. Its principles are as plain to the
               mind as the sun at mid-day, and as just as God. It is the gospel of redemption to a
               rum-cursed world—the John the Baptist of the Christian religion. Like the Christian
               religion, its fruits bear full evidence of its blessed character. When John heralded
               the coming of the Saviour, he did not startle the world by the brilliancy of his
               promises. He did not announce that Christ was coming with a crown of gold upon his
               head and a monarch's sceptre in his hand, with legions of conquering warriors
               bristling in armor, and in his train the kings and princes—the rich, and powerful,
               and elite of earth. No: the dumb should speak, the deaf should hear, the blind see,
               the lame walk, the dead be raised, and the gospel be preached to the poor. And thus
               along the pathway of Christianity, wherever its spirit has gained a foothold, there
               are eloquent records of its principles and influences. So with the Temperance Reform.
               The heralds did not announce that the fashionable and the wealthy, the titled great,
               the monied aristocracy of the land, would exclusively lend it their countenance. But
               the blind have seen, the deaf have heard,
               the stone has been rolled away from the grave of drunkenness, and the lost restored;
               devils have been cast out of those cut among the tombs, and its gospel has been
               preached to the poor. The reform was designed by a kind God to lift up and restore
               poor fallen humanity, and not to add brilliancy to fashion, or popularity to men. The
               prodigals, who have wasted all in riotous living and hungered for the husks, have
               turned back from their dark wanderings, and the temperance cause has met them
               half-way, and rejoiced that the lost were found. The so-called fashionable have
               murmured and turned away with scorn from such manifestations. They would so have
               scorned the meek Saviour, because he called after the sinner, and wept with, and
               comforted the poor and afflicted.
            The hand of Providence has marked the course of our cause. Step by step it has moved
               onward, ever going down deeper into the hearts and consciences of men. It has had its
               reverses, as has every great moral revolution which has agitated the world; but its
               first standard, "torn but flying," floats out prouder to-day than ever before. There
               is a hydra influence against it—one sleepless and gigantic. But ours is the majority,
               for God is with us. At times it has been beat back—its waves have been rolled back
               and mingled with their kindred waters; but they have returned to the shock with other
               waves and deeper flow, sweeping on with the strength and grandeur of its power.
               Wealth has opposed it—fashion has sneered at it—interest has fought it—demagogues
               have stabbed it, and Iscariots have betrayed and sold it; but, like the oak matured
               in the storm, it has taken root, until its towering trunk sways defiance to the
               fiercest wrath of the tempest. And it will live, and flourish, and gloriously
               triumph.
            The blessings of the Temperance Reform are sufficient to reward for an age of effort.
               One home made joyous—one broken heart healed and made happy—one man restored to
               manhood, family, society and God—is a prouder and more enduring monument than ever
               towered in marble. What a change it has wrought in public sentiment! Look back—and
               many of us can remember it—to the time when tippling was interwoven with every custom
               of society, and infancy sucked drunkenness from the mother's breast. We know that
               intemperance yet sits like a nightmare upon the bosom of society, but there are
               millions of homes, and fields, and
               systems from which it has been forever banished. Where is now the physician that
               prescribes rum to the mother, or a mother who swallows such prescriptions, or feeds
               them to the child? Where is the family table where the morning bitters sit with the
               food which gives life and strength? Where is the mechanic who carries it to his shop?
               The farmer who furnishes it to his laborers in the field? The marriage where the
               health and happiness of the bride must be given in wine? The funeral where it must
               mingle with the tears of the bereaved? They are scarce. A blessed light has dawned
               upon community, and it is found that man can be born, married and die without the
               spirit of alcohol.
            In the progress of the reform, nearer and still nearer to the enemy, the ground has
               been broken. The first position was not the one of to-day. The old pledge was the
               entering wedge, but it did not banish the insidious tempter from our own ranks. It
               coiled still in the wine cup, and in the more common alcoholic beverages. Experience
               demonstrated the folly of chaining the mad dog, and the total abstinence pledge was
               adopted. Then came a war among temperance men, but the right triumphed; for, it was
               found that the old pledge was a dangerous ground for drinking men. Then came the
               Washingtonian movement, like a storm, and its floods swept on with startling
               intensity and power. There are ten thousand trophies where it moved; but the force of
               the torrent long since spent itself. The flames have died out upon its altars, as a
               general thing, and its legions disbanded, or enlisted in new organizations. Something
               more systematic was demanded. An organization more concentrated, and ever active, was
               called for, to retain old ground and win new fields—one which should throw a shield
               around the inebriate, and retain him by influences always appealing to his manhood
               and love of home. The exigency brought out the thing needed, and the triple emblem of
               the Red, White and Blue, was lifted to the world. Under its broad folds, an army of
               freemen has gathered, such as the world has never seen before. The tread of that army
               sounds the doom of the rum traffic.
            In the commencement of our reform, and for a number of years, the mass of its friends
               considered "moral suasion" as the only means of success. It would have accomplished
               its work, were all men susceptible to moral influences. But it would not answer the
               ends designed. While human nature is
               such as to require penal laws in the restraint and punishment of its excesses, moral
               influences will never keep man from the commission of wrong. God's government is not
               based upon moral suasion alone. His laws are prohibitory, as are the laws upon our
               statute books. And against all this array of enactments, human and divine, wicked men
               continue to trample upon the rights of others. If laws will not prevent the
               commission of wrong, who would expect moral influences alone to protect the interests
               of society from the vicious and abandoned. And more especially would it fall far
               short of accomplishing such an object, when coming in contact with evils
                  sustained and guarded by legislation. Never, while avarice has a home
               in the human heart, can bad men be influenced, by moral considerations, to abandon a
               traffic which law tolerates and protects and clothes with respectability. With a
               license law existing and shielding the seller from punishment, how long before he
               could be prevailed upon to abandon a lucrative business? Time might end and find the
               traffic in its full strength, and those engaged in it as indifferent to our
               entreaties and appeals, as they are to-day.
            It was seen that the fountain must be dried—the Upas uprooted and destroyed forever.
               Hence the idea of prohibition and protection. And this sentiment finds a response in
               the hearts of the friends of the cause, enthusiastic and unanimous. Here is the great
               battle ground, and around this banner the contending interests are rallying.
               Eloquence has been spent in vain heretofore, so far as having any effect upon those
               engaged in the traffic. God's truth has thundered against them. Facts have been piled
               on facts, until they tower in fearful judgment against them. Arguments, unanswerable,
               have been adduced, and appeals of the most earnest and touching pathos been made. All
               has been in vain. Entrenched behind law, and flanked by the unscrupulous demagogism
               of the country, they have looked unmoved upon the ruin wrought by their own hands,
               and laughed all our efforts to scorn. A new system of warfare must be adopted, or the
               strife would be for time. As in times past, so Providence, at this juncture, directed
               the movements. Then appeared a light in the east, and clear and startling above the
               din of the strife, came a new battle cry, thrilling like an electric shock, and
               everywhere arousing our wearied hosts. A new banner rolled out, and its magic words
               have filled all hearts with zeal, faith and
               hope. "THE MAINE LAW" is an emblem of triumph. It is the mystic writing upon the
               wall, announcing the downfall of the Babylon whose iniquities have so long cursed the
               earth, and political Belshazzars already look upon the record of sure coming doom,
               and tremble. The new plan is as simple as potent. It embodies, in a stringent form,
               the principles of prohibition and protection. Like all other laws for the prevention
               of crime, it strikes at the cause, leaving the streams to dry up when no longer fed
               by the fountain. It dispenses with arguments and appeals. It leaves no dripping heads
               to multiply others, but attacks the hydra in his den, and with the hot irons of fine
               and imprisonment, sears as it goes. It destroys the traffic itself. Like
               a complete battery, it has been planted under the very walls of the enemy. Broad
               breaches have already been made in the very citadel, and the flushed legions of four
               States of the Union are already pouring in for the last hand-to-hand conflict. "God
               defend the Right" in the battle.
            Various instrumentalities have operated in bringing the Temperance Reform up to its
               present commanding position. Able men have written and spoken, and from the rostrum
               and the pulpit public opinion has been educated. But the great engine has been the
               PRESS. This giant friend of man in a free country, has scattered its light, its
               facts, arguments and appeals, into millions of hearts and homes. It has invoked a
               storm slowly, but none the less effectually. The mutterings of years past are
               deepening into startling peals, and the red language of popular indignation and
               wrath, glows ominously bright across the sky. The deep of public opinion is rocking
               to its depths.
            The Temperance Press, at first struggling with almost overwhelming difficulties, has
               slowly increased in ability and power, and to-day exerts a controlling influence upon
               public sentiment. The literature of our reform is assuming a more refined and
               elevated character, and clothing great truths in purer and more attractive garb; and
               never was there a wider field for the exercise of intellectual effort. The wildest
               dreams of fiction seem tame in comparison with the stern and sober realities of our
               cause. Tragedies, more fearfully dark and startling than Avon's bard ever sketched,
               are thickly traced on the record of rum's history. Scenes which would mock the
               artist's pencil are of daily occurrence. The desolate home, with its heart-broken
               wife and mother, with her pale cheek
               channeled with tears of unutterable woe, as she bends weeping over the drunken wreck
               of her youth's idol; the child-group shivering in the blast, or clinging to that
               mother, as they moan for bread; the orphan turned out, with no friend but God, into
               the wide world; youth wrecked and palsied with premature age; manhood reeling amid
               the ruins of mind and moral beauty, the sepulchre of a thousand hopes; genius
               driveling in idiocy and crumbling into ruin; the virtuous and noble-minded turning
               away from truth and honor, and plunging into every vice; the parent and citizen
               wandering away from a home-heaven, through a devious and dark pilgrimage, to a
               dishonored grave—the home-idol shivered and broken, the altar cast down, and an Eden
               transformed into a hell; childhood and innocence thrust out from the love-light of a
               mother's eye, to wallow in all that is low and vile; Poverty and Want looking with
               pinched and piteous gaze upon the scanty tribute of charity; foul and festering Vice,
               with sickly and bloated features, leering and drooling in licentious beastiality;
               Madness, with fiery eye and haggard mien, weeping and wailing and cursing in the
               rayless night of intellectual chaos; Crime, with its infernal 'ha! ha!' as it stalks
               forth from its work of death, with its red hand dripping with the hot and smoking
               life-tide of its victim;—these and ten thousand other combinations of warp and woof
               are woven into tales of wondrous intensity and power. The hovel, the dram-shop, the
               subterranean den, and the mansion of fashion and wealth, have all furnished the
               material for tales of startling interest. When fiction even has called up its weird
               creations, they have been but copies of the facts already transpired. The moral is
               always there. Thus poetry and romance have combined to place the realities of two
               opposing principles in striking contrast. Such is the object of the following tale,
               from the perusal of which we will no longer detain the kind reader. That the Maine
               Law may triumph, and the dark shadow of Intemperance pass away, is the earnest prayer
               of him who has thus far claimed attention. The door is open, and the reader can go in
               and examine the structure of the author's fabric at leisure.

               Law"

            DICK WILSON.
            
               CHAPTER I.
               FUTURE PLANS AND PROSPECTS.
               
                  
                     
                        "Thou who, securely lull'd in Youth's warm ray,
                        Mark'st not the desolations wrought by Wine!
                        Be roused, or perish! Ardent for its prey,
                        Speeds the fell curse, that ravages thy
                           prime."
                     
                  
               
               FRIENDS of Humanity! God is in the great humanising effort which is now being made
                  against the rum traffic! He designs that this great national disgrace—this
                  plague-spot upon the pages of civil law—shall be wiped out by a bloodless
                  revolution. And the many voices of the same God, coming through unmistakable
                  agencies, are summoning you to the spot where Humanity hath erected her pure white
                  standard; and where she expects soon, by the blessing of God, and the assistance
                  of those who love peace, to do just what was done in Maine—"Rout the
                     rumseller!"
               "Ah! then, this means me, does it?" says a confident rumseller, or manufacturer.
                  "I won't read a word of it—no, indeed! It is a shame that people ple won't mind their own business. I tell you what
                  I will do—I will fight against this effort until the very death!"
               "This is agitating the subject of white slavery!" say the
                     genteel apologists for this immeasurable curse; "and we must be up
                  in arms against it; or if we do not, we and our crew will come down together."
               Yes, my friends, it is precisely so; and as Delilah said to Samson, so we would
                  say to you—the Philistines are upon you!
               
                  You know very well that Humanity, in all her forms, has appealed to
                  you, and craved your mercy—that your work is wicked, and that its tendency is
                  brutalising in the extreme. The ragged, starving, trembling child—the father, the
                  mother, the brother, and the sister, have invoked your compassion. But to what
                  purpose?
               The poor-house, the prison, the gallows, the suicide—have, with one voice,
                  besought you to desist. But to what purpose are these most fearful exhibitions
                  that can be made upon the earth, and of which you are the architect? Have they
                  moved you to mercy? No! These things have had no impression; but like a rival
                  Juggernaut, you have moved on your ponderous, crushing car! and the warm, fresh
                  blood of your victims still rises in your path, and is invoking the vengeance of
                  God upon your cruelty.
               Humanity has appealed to you in every form—by every argument—until her very
                  charity has lost all confidence; and hopeless, and in tears, she has turned to the
                  humane, the noble, and the virtuous; and when these are fairly marshaled in the
                  order of legislative battle, you must disband—disband, as your
                     brethren did, in the gallant State of Maine.
               Remember—remember the battle of Maine! for it loosened your foundations throughout
                  the dominion of civilization. The next music you hear will be the voices of little
                  children chanting in ecstacy the rumseller's doom: "The rumselling Babylon is
                  fallen—FALLEN—FALLEN—to curse humanity no more forever!"
               Friend of humanity! art thou a father, standing at the threshold of your own door,
                  and holding in your own hand, with a warm, parental grasp, the hand of your son,
                  for whom, and for yourself, the endearing associations of the past are, to a great
                  extent, to be broken up forever? You expect to remain under the
                  shelter of your own roof; but your boy—your proud, noble boy—the object to which
                  your hopes are clinging—he is going out into the "wide, wide world," of trials and
                  temptations.
               But then, why do you weep? Why do you linger, as if you were unwilling that the
                  word of parting should ever leave your lips?
               Ah, yes, father, you know why it is. The big tear starting from your eye is
                  sparkling with the interpretation. Oh! yes; it is the recognition of the
                  rumseller's ability to cut off all your expectations; and, finally, to cut off
                  your boy!—and you do well to weep. But
                  remember that timely action may save you, in your old age, those bitterest of all
                  tears—though untimely and unavailing.
               Mother!—dearest of earthly names—most precious treasure which God reserves to the
                  child on earth—mother, why do you weep, as your boy goes forth from your home? Why
                  does that silent ejaculation, which can only find an overflowing fulness in the
                  deep store-house of a mother's love, so often go out from your heart?—"God bless
                  and preserve my dear boy!"
               Brother—sister—friend! Why do you weep as your several relations in life are
                  broken up by the departure of your dear ones? These may all come back again. Yes,
                  and who knows this better, or hopes more fervently for it, than you do? Wherefore,
                  then, dost thou weep?
               Do you see—and, perchance, not far off, in the future—a loved one straying back
                  again, a wasted wreck? Ah! if tears have the power to strengthen the weak, you do
                  well to shed them freely; for the rumseller has a fearful power. He has the power
                  to crush, by his cruel machinery, the finest form and the noblest intellect, and
                  fashion the likeness of the invisible God into the similitude of a beast!
               A sense of sadness always steals its way into, and mingles freely in the
                  associations of an hour, in which loved ones are called to part.
               Such a sadness as this seldom fails to throw itself about the evening of a college
                  commencement-day; and it is natural, as well as fitting, that it should be so. In
                  circumstances like these, relations and associations, which are only to be
                  surpassed by the endearing ties of home, are to be broken up. Hearts, which have
                  been knit together and interwoven with each other by the intimate and sweet
                  communion of several years, it may be, are now to be parted. Their paths are to be
                  divided, and the pleasant seclusion of a college life, with all its local
                  associations and life-like memories, are to be exchanged for the stern warfare of
                  real existence—one for which the wisest is but poorly girded—a tournament in
                  which, often, the lance of the generous young warrior is shivered in his hand by a
                  powerful antagonist, and himself thrown prostrate and bleeding to the ground.
               It was on one of those beautiful and never-to-be-forgotten evenings, which never
                  fail to throw a melancholy, love-like radiance about the closing scenes of a
                  commencement-day, in a dear old college in western Pennsylvania, in whose history
                  many a one in this wide land mingles, and in whose affections it will never lose
                  its place.
               It was on the evening of one of those beautiful days, in the latter part of
                  September, 184—, that Frank Hamilton entered the room of Dick Wilson, to bid his
                  more than "college chum" goodbye. These young men were as warm friends—not from
                  necessity, but choice—as ever were united
                  within the dominions of that venerable enclosure, from its rude "log cabin" to its
                  stately pile of brick.
               Their time had come to part—their college hours were all lived out, to the very
                  end; and yet they lingered in the presence of that passing moment, as if they
                  would fain protract, into years again, that which just then was passing with a
                  whirlwind's haste.
               It was natural enough that these young men should feel so. This same feeling has
                  clung to a thousand partings which have taken place there. They were to part with
                  a numerous band of other young men, whom they could only hope to meet again, if
                  ever, on the stormy ocean of life; and whose huge billows, they knew, would at
                  last roll over the graves of all. But did it occur to them that some would go down
                  earlier, and some later—that some would go down in lightness, and some in
                  gloom?
               But old Dr. B——, whose kindness was a proverb, with all his excentricities—to part
                  with him—to hear that voice no more, perhaps, forever—the voice to which they had
                  been so well accustomed to listen—the same which had given them a kindly welcome
                  on their first arrival, within its walls—the same from which they were accustomed
                  to hear the truths of religion and the lessons of science; this voice—to hear it
                  no more upon the earth, was far from being the least powerful of the influences
                  with which that moment was filled to overflowing.
               Frank Hamilton and Dick Wilson were classmates mates. They had been thrown
                  together strangers; but strangeness had passed away before the mystic minglings of
                  kindred spirits with kindred tastes and sympathies, and they were friends, to each
                  of whom the good-bye was a cheerless sound.
               It was a difficult matter for them to part. They looked at each other intently, as
                  if searching for some portion of their future history. They looked about upon the
                  walls of that old room, with every square inch of which they seemed, at that
                  moment to have a wonderful familiarity. Why did these young men hesitate to go?
                  The homes, towards which they were about to return again, were waiting to welcome
                  them; and yet they wept! Was the unseen spirit of some departed one at that moment
                  communicating to them the facts in their future history? Did they see, a little
                  way off in the future, some gloomy monster upon whom almighty vengeance had
                  written fiend, rising to obstruct their path? Were they gifted at
                  that moment, with the view of the rumseller's power over human character and human
                  destiny? No! surely they were not, or the buoyant aspirations of their hearts
                  would have been chilled to icy coldness.
               "Well, Dick," said Frank Hamilton, after some evident emotion, "I have come to say
                  farewell, but, my dear fellow, I did not realize, until this moment, how difficult
                  it would be to part with you. But the fact is, Dick, our business here is all
                  over—our work here is done, and we must go, and make room for those who are to succeed us. It grieves me, Dick,
                  to think how soon we shall be forgotten on these grounds; for, with the coming of
                  the next session the stranger will come, and some one or more, as the case may be,
                  or as necessity may require, will take up their abode in this old third-story room
                  of yours, in which, we have spent so many pleasant hours together, and around
                  every part of which, at this moment, I see pleasant associations clustering. With
                  these new comers will come a train of new feeling, and new associations, and new
                  interests; and these new creations will cluster about these walls, and mingle with
                  this atmosphere, as gaily and as lovingly as ours do now. But where, Dick, shall
                  we be, when these new associations are continuing to be formed here, through many
                  future years?"
               "The Lord only knows, Frank! I hope, however, that the poor fellow who comes here
                  next may manage to keep the blues off as well as I have done; but
                  then, Frank, I am in your debt, after all, for a large share of my success in
                  doing so."
               "Well, Dick," you are no doubt right when you say that the Lord knows, but the
                  fact is, I should like to know something about it myself, if it is good; and if it
                  is not good, then I don't care particularly about being very wise, so far as that
                  is concerned. After all, Dick, I tell you this college life is rather a dreamy
                  affair. There is but little of the hard-fisted, rough-and-tumble reality about it.
                  Here we are at this moment, just going out into the world, and we know but little
                  more about it than a brace of old monks, who have been shut up in their cloisters
                  all the days of their lives, and what under the heavens do they know about its
                  wants and its strifes? Well, the fact is, we are not much wiser than they are. We
                  passed from the nursery to the school house—from the school house to the
                  academy—from the academy to this college; and I think we have kept one command
                  about as well as it is possible to keep it—'salute no man by the way.' But then,
                  with us it has been the action of necessity rather than volition. I am afraid,
                  Dick, after all, we will be forced to a conclusion to which young persons
                  generally do not wish to come; but old folks say it is true, and they cannot be
                  reasoned out of it either, that 'the ways of this world are not always as pleasant
                  as they might be.' The history of this world, if those who preceded us here and
                  elsewhere are to be believed, is a strange and checkered story, made up of
                  pleasures and pains, of success and failures, of triumphs and defeats."
               "Why, Frank," said Dick Wilson, "what on the earth is the matter with you all at
                  once? Come, come, my friend, shuffle off those unpleasant reflections; for this, I
                  am sure, is no time for them. What business have they here at such an hour? I am
                  sure, Frank, we have enough else to think about and talk about, without disturbing
                  the wisdom of our fathers. If misfortune is before us, it will be time enough for
                  us to know it when it comes. All I will
                  ask of the surly old dame is half an hour's notice of her coming. I am sure this
                  is fair, and then, if she gets her paws on me, I will surrender; but I tell you,
                  Frank, she must be ready to spring very soon after she sends her compliments, or
                  else she will find me, eyes right, and prepared to meet her. And by the powers,
                  Frank, there is another thing that I will just mention,—'we are not old monks.' If
                  there were such beings as young monks, you would be a precious sight nearer than
                  you are. But old monks! Frank, just think of that again, and you will call it
                  back; and what is more to be observed just now, is this—you had better not compare
                  anything, about these quarters, to monkery, or you may find yourself minus a
                  diploma, yet. A monk! Why, Frank, this orthodox atmosphere would strangle him,
                  just as soon as Hibernian soil would kill a snake; he could n't live here at all.
                  Monks, indeed! No, sir, I guess not. But come, shuffle off those unpleasant
                  reflections—wake up from this dream of yours; fling these grim spectres out of
                  your mind, and select for your motto, what I have selected for mine—'ad astra!!'—and Pluto himself can't keep us from
                  winning the race. But, Frank, go on; say whatever your inclination may lead you to
                  say, only don't sermonise; for you know we have had one of the usual dimensions
                  today, already.
               "Well, Dick," replied Frank Hamilton, "you have entrenched yourself pretty
                  well—better than I imagined you could, and much better than I am able to do. But
                  then let me tell you, Dick, it is folly to try to kill by sport what may come as
                  reality. You know as well as I do, that at least a few get what is called a short
                  and a merry ride through life. How merry it may be, is what I could not vouch for;
                  but there is no mistake about its being short enough, to answer those who are in
                  the greatest hurry. Several times, since we met here strangers, Dick, our hearts
                  have been made sad by the intelligence of the melancholy failure and fall of those
                  whose acquaintance we first formed here; and it is remarkable, that, without a
                  single exception, so far as I know, they were those who, when here, were amongst
                  the first in every sense, and very unexpectedly to themselves, and to us, first in
                  the grave! These dear fellows, Dick, finished here, as we have done, and went away
                  from here, as we are about to do. Their hopes were as bright as ours are now, and
                  yet they perished in the very bud, and I think it is rather natural than forced,
                  that these premature wrecks should make us thoughtful. We will leave here in the
                  morning. Our faces will once more be turned towards home; and kind friends, no
                  doubt, will greet us, as we cross the sacred threshold. But then, Dick, home will
                  be home no longer, in the sense of our boyish days. Things, you may depend upon
                  it, will have changed. The love of the household will, no doubt, be as sincere as
                  it ever was; but yet, each of us will find a change, which is both natural and necessary, although now
                  we may not be able to conceive any such thing. I think, Dick, that we had better
                  make up our minds for hard times, and make a wise selection of our armor; and
                  then, if they do come, they will find us prepared to meet them; and if, after all,
                  they should not come, why, we will still be the gainers rather than the losers. I
                  tell you, Dick, I am afraid you would find your half-hour too short at both ends,
                  to gird yourself for an encounter with even a moderate share of adversity."
               "Frank, it is more difficult for me to break away from these associations than you
                  imagine it is. In fact, it is more difficult than I thought it was. But then, I
                  know it must be done, for we can't stay any longer here. The stranger wants to
                  come; and now he is waiting to succeed us, as we succeeded others. Ah, yes! Frank,
                  my dear fellow, he is waiting for an opportunity to form such sacred associations
                  as ours have been. Yes, yes; he will spoil all their beauty for us, but then, it
                  will be to make them beautiful for himself; and surely we should not envy him
                  whatever pleasures he can get here. We have been permitted to paint, with the
                  pencil of fancy, our living households upon these walls; but the poor fellow who
                  comes here next may have nothing to paint, save what the grave has left him—the
                  recollections of the past! Let him paint them, then!—let him enjoy them, too, and
                  often, in his hours of sadness, let them cheer him, and have the power over him to
                  nerve him forward. You and myself, Frank, will be architects somewhere else. I
                  never knew until to-day, how much I thought of old Dr. B——. Those parting words of
                  his to us, this evening, were the evidence of his solicitude for our future
                  welfare. No trifling circumstance will destroy his interest in us, and his
                  affection for us; and I think if it were at all to be desired, we might be sure of
                  his prayers. I must say, however, Frank, that while I admired the touching pathos
                  of his parting benediction, that I did think he was rather too solicitous about
                  our future welfare, and especially mine. I suppose, however, that he would like to
                  see us ministers, as a very large proportion of the crop which grows in this soil
                  is of that kind. But this won't do for me. I think they are good enough, and
                  useful enough, in their places, but I am satisfied that is not my place. Why do
                  you think he made that singular allusion, to the rumsellers, Frank?"
               "I think, Dick, he has in all probability heard of some of your fun, as you call
                  it—perhaps last night's spree."
               "No, I should think not, Frank. I would rather attribute it to his hatred of the
                  rumseller's profession; and, by the by, if he had the entire control,
                  rumsellers, big and little, would soon be a rare commodity in this place. The fact
                  is, I think, he is too severe with those persons. But then, I don't want you to
                  think that I have any sympathy with them.
                  I think, when it is viewed narrowly, that in fact it becomes so small as to be
                  hardly visible. I mean the profession. These rumsellers cry 'accommodation,
                  accommodation!' and old Dungy* cries precisely the same thing. When he comes in
                  with his basket of taffa, he cries 'accommodation, accommodation!'
                  and says, it is good for colds, coughs, and consumptions, and empty heads, too;
                  and when he has succeeded in emptying his basket profitably, and has his change in
                  his pocket, I guess he could, if he would, tell who, according to his judgment,
                  was most profitably accommodated. Just so with the rumsellers here and
                  elsewhere—they are mighty free to accommodate! Oh, yes; nothing but accommodation!
                  It is their profession, and they are ready to spring, like lamp-lighters, wheenver
                  there is a prospect of a sixpence or a shilling; but the misfortune is, when they
                  accommodate in rum, the accommodation is all on their side, and no one knows it
                  better than they do. No, sir, I have no sympathy with them, and I want no place in
                  this rum army. I intend to let them alone. I will attend to my business, and they
                  may attend to theirs. Here is where I object, principally, to the old Doctor's
                  advice. He wants us, as he says, 'first of all, for our safety, to array ourselves
                  against it.' Well; first of all, I can't believe it can harm us; and then, I have
                  no disposition to do it. It is a fine idea, indeed, that two young men, who are
                  just going out into the world, and who have the profession of law in view, should
                  be called to take the unpopular side of any question, and then make it a hobby
                  upon which to ride themselves out of reach of every reasonable prospect. I won't
                  do it. I expect to be in Congress, or some where else, some day, and marching
                  after that music would lead any where else. No, no; not I! If he wants that done,
                  he must turn out the black coats, and if they fail, no one will mind
                  it. Don't you think I am about right, Frank?"
               
                  *A well-known hawker in —— College.
               
               "Dick, I must be candid with you. Words live forever, and it is better to speak
                  them wisely. I must say that I think you are wrong, all wrong in this matter. You
                  intimated that if it were a matter of importance, you thought we might safely
                  reckon on the old Doctor's prayers. Do you think, Dick, that the prayers of that
                  good old man, following us out into the world, would be likely to do us any harm?
                  For my own part, although I am not religious by profession, there is nothing which
                  I would more desire; and I must tell you, Dick, that the knowledge of the fact,
                  that I have a home, where prayers are offered for me daily, has made me feel
                  safer; and I should feel all the better if I knew that many more were praying for
                  me. Such things will not be likely to do us any harm, and I am sure that good
                  advice will be just as unlikely to injure us. I have as good an opinion of myself
                  as I ought to have. My hopes are as sanguine as I would desire them to be. I have painted my future as bright as I
                  dare paint it. There is danger! True, it may never come to us. I hope, Dick, it
                  never will. And here is where I think the prayers of that old man, following us
                  out into the world, would be likely to do us good. But then, there is danger; and
                  if it does not come to us, it will come to others. There will always be danger,
                  while rumselling is permitted—and circumstances favoring it, it will be just as
                  powerful to accomplish our ruin as that of any one else. This is one of the
                  subjects for which a fitting illustration is always furnished to hand by the
                  monster. Take those two boys to whom this evening we have given our old clothes.
                  They are sweet, lovely children. How have we pitied them, whose wants we have
                  often tried to supply. How many times have we seen them, when it was our
                  conclusion that hunger had driven them from home! Think of that, Dick—driven from
                  home by hunger! Then, who occasioned it? You know it was the rumseller. You know
                  that it was their father's familiarity with the bar-room, that made
                  poverty reign in his house—that sent the inmates out to beg. How often have we
                  looked at the apparently happy group of boys, engaged in play. But these little
                  fellows, if they were there, were generally at the outer edge of the circle. Often
                  have I looked on, when every countenance in that group was lit up with smiles but
                  theirs—every heart appeared to be leaping for joy but theirs. Every one in that
                  crowd but those two, little more than children, knew that they had comfortable
                  homes, to which, at the end of their sports, they might retire. These children had
                  a shelter—but who would call it a home?—only that a mother's love was there. When
                  I have looked at this, again and again, I have asked myself the question, 'Who has
                  robbed these children?' and my better judgment has answered, 'The rumseller!'
                  These boys were the back ground to any youthful sport in which they mingled, and
                  as sometimes a rude, unfeeling lad would taunt them for their poverty, they would
                  make no reply; but their countenances would seem to say—'Mock us not! It is not
                     our fault; we are not to blame. This misfortune is the rumseller's
                  work, and not ours. We do not love these ragged clothes; but necessity, of the
                  rumseller's creation, compels us to wear them. If we are hungry, and cold, and
                  naked, and unloved by all, save our dear mother, oh, do not reproach us for it—for
                  we are innocent! Some of your fathers are warming and feeding the serpent which is
                  stinging us to death!' To me, Dick, those little fellows, with their bright eyes
                  and pale cheeks, seemed to realize their loneliness. I have sometimes thought that
                  they seemed to feel as if they were uncared for; and if such were the feelings of
                  those little boys, I know of nothing which would so much tend to harden, to
                  vitiate, and deprave their young minds. And is this all? Oh, no! they are but two
                  out of the thousands with which the land
                  is teeming. These boys, Dick, need a defence—the most powerful defence; and where
                  are they to find it? They will not be likely to find it in the same channel where
                  they find their father's ruin. Ah! no, indeed, these are not the agencies to whom
                  they can confidently look for lessons of virtue. No, no! They must look somewhere
                  else than to the rumseller. Now, Dick, they have a right to your aid, and mine.
                  Whenever there is necessity, they shall have it! This appears to me to be a work
                  of the most exalted character in which a human being could engage—a work in which
                  talents of the most brilliant order might do honor to the possessor; and immense,
                  immeasurable good to the little unfortunates, with whose wail of
                  sadness the land is becoming vocal. In my own State there are about twenty-five
                  thousand drunkards! Most of these have families, making the aggregate number of
                  sufferers at least one hundred thousand in that single State. One hundred thousand
                  sufferers bleeding at the hands of rumsellers! What an army this, which is being
                  swept on to ruin! Collect it, Dick, in your own mind, and then look at it, and
                  then tell me what work of earthly character can be so truly noble as that which
                  would seek to restore them to happiness? You are mistaken about this matter, or
                  else I am; for I believe the finest abilities and the rarest accomplishments will
                  do their mightiest work and get their most signal renown on this very field; for
                  God will help them. The conquerors on this field will bring away with them such
                  laurels as will never fade. Their fame will be a living, cheering, soul-inspiring
                  fame! It will ascend up with morning and evening orisons—from altars whose base
                  the rumseller has caused to be saturated with tears!—the widow's and the orphan's
                  tears! From homes where children have starved, and from solitudes where beauty has
                  pined. This is the heaven-born and the heaven-given meed, which is awaiting the
                  victors in this war. Can it be possible, Dick, that you intend to plead no cause
                  for which you are not paid in money, as you once intimated to me? Is it possible
                  that you intend to leave the fate, the character, the everything belonging to this
                  class, to other hands than yours; and that you will have nothing to do in aiding
                  to heal their wounds—in wiping the tears from their eyes? If so, I tremble for
                  your future. I am convinced that it is your duty—that it is my duty—that it is the
                  duty of every man, woman and child—to war with every thing which tends to
                  disorganize human society, or taint it with the breath of putrefaction—whatever
                  may tend to depreciate morals—to squander property—to destroy health—to wither
                  reputation, or to insult God!"
               "Well, well, Frank, you will find, I imagine, and I am sorry for it, that this
                  philosophy won't be very profitable to you. It would do very well in the pulpit,
                  but it will never do anything for you at the bar."
               
               "Well, then, Dick, this is my principal philosophy, and if it should not be
                  current at the bar, I will try its currency in some other avocation. But I
                  apprehend no such difficulty; and I do believe, farther, that the best way to
                  secure our safety, is to do all in our power for the safety of others. This, I am
                  sure, will be our safest plan, and it will secure our dearest interests, and I
                  advise you to adopt this principle. But, Dick, I must go. Will we ever meet
                  again?"
               "I hope we shall, Frank; and then we will talk more about these things, and be
                  better able to tell whose philosophy was best, wisest and safest. Keep the
                  portrait my mother gave you, Frank. I know of no other person to whom she would
                  have given it. It may at some future time serve to revive bygone recollections. I
                  shall always remember you—I cannot forget you."
               "Nor will I ever forget you, Dick. Wherever you find me, you will find Frank
                  Hamilton still. Remember me kindly to your family. Tell them I shall never forget
                  them."
               The good-bye was said, and the young men parted, to meet again—they could not tell
                  when, where, or how.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               NEWS FROM HOME.—A SAD CHANGE.
               
                  
                     
                        "Fair was the blossom, soft the vernal sky,
                        Elate with hope, we deemed no tempest nigh;
                        When lo! a whirlwind's instantaneous gust,
                        Left all its beauties withering in the dust.
                     
                  
               
               How often—yes, how continually—in the midst of life's pleasantest ways and most
                  winning prospects, are we, seemingly by a Providential declaration, taught that it
                  is not in man that walketh to direct his steps. How often is it made plain, on a
                  wide scale, that the circumstances by which we are surrounded, and which we often
                  create, or tacitly endorse—be they propitious, or unpropitious—are the mighty
                  levers, under the agency of which we are impelled onward, and often with a tyranny
                  more absolute than that which presses the fainting slave through his years of
                  toil; and this, often, when the voice of a living consciousness tells us we are
                  wrong, and that destruction and misery are in the way, and its end death!
               There are none who are more frequently or more fearfully startled, in the ways of
                  life, than the young—especially the young man. He is just lifting the curtain, and feeling his way, cautiously, or
                  wrecklessly, it may be, to the stage—the stage on which innumerable actors have
                  played their part, and for whom another curtain has been lifted, and through whose
                  opening they have passed to other scenes! How fearfully variegated is the
                     comic and the tragic of this drama! Such persons have
                  no experience—their knowledge of the world is second-hand—and hence they enter
                  upon this stage, crowded with as much uncertainty as that which crowded the
                  entrance of the gladiator, when, for the first time, he braved the dangers of the
                  Roman or Ephesian Amphitheatre. He knew not how it would result. The Tuscan boar,
                  the Numidian lion, or the Hispanolian bull, after a feeble defence, might overcome
                  him; or it might be that a well aimed blow from the battle axe, or thrust from the
                  spear, might lay his savage antagonist in the dust, and win for him a conqueror's
                  meed. But everything trembled upon the wheel of a hazardous uncertainty.
               How little do those who are experienced in the warfare of life—who are rich in the
                  history of its joys and its sorrows—seem to understand how much they may do in
                  equipping a young warrior, that he may reach at last a more brilliant fame than
                  that which graced a Roman holiday!
               How seldom do we dream of the infinite, the indestructible duration, of those
                  far-reaching pulsations, which come in quivering, lisping echoes, from the slight
                  vibration which a touch may waken into life!—a touch, a breath, a faint
                  articulation—hallowed, or unhallowed, for good or for evil, for fame or for
                  infamy! Who shall measure the power which that single touch may give to one of
                  those fragile human barks on life's stormy ocean—or how it may allay its storms,
                  and assuage the fury of its madness, by carrying with it an ennobling sympathy,
                  containing the elements of "peace, be still?" The earthquake sends the tremor of
                  its wild pulsations farther when it is deepest buried in the bosom of the earth.
                  So does the element of virtue. So, too, does the element of vice.
               It is human nature's great misfortune, that its sympathies are not more generally
                  on the side of virtue. By the unhallowed touch of an ingeniously wrought mystic
                  influence, the seeds of corruption easily affiliate with the soil of the human
                  heart, and when left to act of its own accord, what fearful desolations mark its
                  path!—desolations which are not measured by days, but by the unraveling thread of
                  a whole existence.
               One year had scarcely passed away since Dick Wilson had parted with his friend,
                  Frank Hamilton. Then his countenance was expressive of the most ardent hope—now it
                  was expressive of sorrow and disappointment. Dark storms had suddenly swept over
                  the roof, and howled in the halls of his princely home, and before their driving
                  fury it had become desolate indeed. Already the stranger had named it by another
                  name, and Dick Wilson, had no home! His
                  father—a kind, indulgent, but unfortunate man—had fallen into the rumseller's
                  hands, and had changed his earthly for an eternal home. He needed no longer the
                  well-attired parlors, or the company of his brilliant guests; for his cup was
                  drained—his banquets over. Close by the side of that father—in the spring-time of
                  her existence, in the blooming freshness of her young life—reposed a lovely
                  daughter; and while other hearts were beating high with hope, her's had ceased to
                  throb. One morning's sun saw her, still in beauty, but with a deep shade of sorrow
                  on her brow: that evening's setting sun looked forth again, as it was departing,
                  through the crimson drapery of a quiet room, and again its golden tints fell upon
                  the same brow. But now, gloom had disappeared—the traces of sorrow were gone; her
                  features were clear, her heart moved not—for herform, girt about with the pale
                  livery of death, was ready to be laid by the side of her father, on whose
                  premature fall, through the rumseller's agency, the young heart had broken.
                  Fortune had failed, with her train of fickle attendants.
               All this, to Dick Wilson, had come suddenly. He had not received even his
                  half-hour's notice of its coming; and it came just at the time in which, with
                  greater buoyancy than ever, he was aspiring towards future fame; and, more than
                  ever, he was unconscious that the wings, to whose capacity he was too confidently
                  trusting, were about to be broken off.
               It was a night of merriment with Dick and some of his young law companions, at
                  C——; but it was a night of wasting sadness in his home. Wine had
                  entered the room where these young men were holding their conviviality—but
                     intense sorrow had borne itself to the doors of the home he loved,
                  to banish its joys and wipe out its happiness.
               These young men were nearly frenzied with extasy as the wine cup, the great
                  mocker, with all its deceptiveness, pictured to them a glowing future—a future, in
                  which the dullest and most stupid, as well as the most brilliant mind in the
                  throng, saw the doors of fortune and fame hard by each other, and both wide open
                  to admit them, inviting them to come at once—to come hastily—to come by the
                  nearest way, and to discard from their minds the tedious idea of building up a
                  temple for themselves, and placing and fitting each stone with their own hands.
                  Ah! yes; to come by the bleak and blighted path, along which wine has
                  led her fame-aspiring votaries.
               While these things were passing before the minds, and whirling in the brains of
                  those young men, Dick Wilson, to all appearance, felt it to be a night of cheer—of
                  rich, innocent enjoyment. But then he did not know by what a fearful voice he was
                  soon to be awakened from the embrace of the charmer; for he knew not that at that
                  moment a mother and two sisters were watching the fast glazing eyes of a dying father, whose pleasant words and
                  gentle smiles had greeted him for the last time. While he was looking
                  at the beauties of a picture which wine promised to draw for him, his
                  dear ones at home were looking upon a cheerless reality, which wine
                  had painted for them, and to which the privileged rumseller had added the last
                  touch of his scathing pencil.
               When Dick Wilson returned to his own room that night, he threw himself down, with
                  apparent unconcern, upon a lounge, and while musing there, he suddenly caught a
                  glimpse of something suspended to his mirror. He looked at this a moment without
                  rising, and then rising hastily, he advanced to examine it, and found it to be a
                  letter from his mother, which some thoughtful person had brought from the office,
                  and placed in that position, that he might the more easily find it. On opening it,
                  he exclaimed, "Why, this is from mother!—something, must be wrong." The letter
                  contained a simple request for him to come home immediately, and bring everything
                  with him. "This," said he, "is strange indeed. Mother has written to me to come
                  home immediately, and to bring everything with me, and there is not a word of
                  explanation about it. They can't have any prejudices against this school, and
                  intend sending me somewhere else. No, this can't be the reason; for in that case
                  father would have written. They can't be sick; for it was only day before
                  yesterday that I received a letter from them, and they were all well. I must look
                  at that letter again." He ran his eye over it carefully, and at length he said,
                  "Yes; here it is—little Harry is slightly indisposed. Yes, here is the secret," he
                  continued; "my poor little brother, very unexpectedly to them, at the time of
                  writing this letter, may since have become very sick, and perhaps he is dead; and
                  if this is so, my arrival at home will not be greeted, as formerly, by smiles and
                  joys, but by a heart-broken household."
               Just at this moment, and while Dick was still trembling in uncertainty, a young
                  man who had made one of the company during the evening, entered his room. It was
                  evident enough to Dick that this young man's brain was still restless, and he
                  determined to say nothing to him about his letter. After some time his friend
                  observed Dick's uneasy manner, and inquired what was the matter. Dick at once
                  informed him.
               "Well, if I were in your place, Dick Wilson," replied the young man, "I would n't
                  go—at all events, I would n't go for my mother's saying so. Yes, yes, indeed, a
                  mother—she is the last person I would think of obeying, or whose right to command
                  I would acknowledge. 'Come home, immediately, and bring everything with you.' I'll
                  tell you, Wilson, that's a sweeping command to come from a mother. But I suppose,
                  Dick, you won't be fool enough to go."
               
               "Yes, I will," replied Dick, sharply; "I will leave by the stage in the
                  morning."
               "Well, now, Dick," continued the profligate young man, "I would not go—at any rate
                  until I should receive another letter; and if they want you badly it will soon
                  come, and your father will write it, and he will give you the whys and wherefores.
                  What do you think is wrong at home, Mr. Wilson?"
               "I don't know," replied Dick; "but I fear a little brother may be very ill, or
                  perhaps dead."
               "And you will go home for that, Dick?"
               "Certainly!" replied Dick.
               "Well, I guess I would n't do any such thing—not for a mother's command, nor to
                  see a little dead brother, either. Why, my folks, I don't believe, would send for
                  me, if all the family should die; for they have come to the conclusion that I will
                  have my own way, and necessity has compelled them to give me free passes, and I'm
                  my own man, and independent of mothers and dead brothers. I'm bent on enjoying
                  myself."
               Here the conversation ended. Dick slept none that night, but busied himself in
                  making preparations for an early start in the morning. He was thinking of home,
                  and trying to satisfy himself as to what the cause of his unexplained request
                  could possibly be. And often, as he looked upon that sleeping figure, with hat and
                  boots and all on, upon his bed, the perfect picture of hardened recklessness ness,
                  did he think of Frank Hamilton, and of the contrast. And sometimes he almost
                  concluded that the philosophy of Frank should be his philosophy. He hesitated,
                  however, and excused himself by saying, "This fellow would have been a brute if
                  wine had never been made!"
               Dick Wilson arrived at home, and was greeted by the wail of a weeping family. Just
                  as he entered the door, his sister Eliza threw her arms about his neck,
                  saying,
               "Dear Dick, poor father is dead!"
               The shock was sudden and appalling. He felt in a moment how insecure were the
                  hopes of life. But he did not know until the next day that they were to be driven
                  into the street by the law which protects this species of murder, and
                  which in so many cases gives the administrator of rum complete control over the
                  estate of his victim.
               Who calls this innocent? Oh, if it be, whisper it not in the hearing of the
                  lisping child! Whisper it nowhere, but among the hopelessly depraved! Go where
                  humanity hath erected a shelter for the rumseller's worn-out victim, and if you
                  tell that poor creature that it is innocent, he will tell you that it is false!
                  Here stood Dick Wilson, with this appalling evidence staring him in the face.
                  Could he say, as he looked upon this dark picture, and saw it in all its horror,
                  that no blame could be attached to the rumseller? No! But as he saw the change,
                  for which he was unprepared, is it not
                  probable that in the depths of his own heart, bitter, burning curses were muttered
                  against the cause and the agencies which had so early blighted his fair prospects,
                  and withered the hopes of his home? It would be strange, indeed, if he did not.
                  God himself looks with abhorrence upon such agencies, whose fearful ravages cover
                  the land. And must they still go on? Is there no way to check the fearful flood of
                  ruin? There is. A light looms up in the east, full of hope and cheer to the
                  friends of humanity! By it you may read the mene, mene,
                     tekel, upharsin—the rumseller's doom! THE MAINE LAW IS ENACTED!!
                  Already have its benignant influences pervaded the border State, and have swept,
                  with electric rapidity, over every State of the Union. On this, Humanity fixes her
                  hope—a foundation firm as the rocks of its parent State.
               
               Dick Wilson had just carried into a very small house, situated in a part of the
                  city frequented by the inheritors of poverty, the last articles of their scanty
                  furniture—all that the law and the rumseller had left
                  them. Deep agitation was visible in Mrs. Wilson's countenance, as her eyes fell
                  upon the few precious relics which remained of her once ample establishment. With
                  them were connected the fondest and most endearing, as well as the bitterest
                  recollections of her life. Here was a memento of the sunny period of
                  her existence, the sight of which brought vividly and at once to view the love,
                  the devotion of him who was then the fond father, the more than devoted
                     husband,—there a relic, reminding her of the many years of
                  domestic happiness which she had passed in that house, from which she
                  had been so suddenly and ruthlessly driven.
               There may be some who cannot realize the feelings of this family at that moment,
                  and others still who may say, "It was well enough, for aristocracy ought to fall."
                  Well, you are supremely cruel. If you had been a beggar at Mrs. Wilson's door, in
                  the time of her prosperity, she would not have turned you away empty; but she
                  would have supplied your wants, and given you a kindly word. Nor would she have
                  forgotten to ask you if there were others in your home who needed her assistance.
                  Even the old drayman, with his rough exterior and sun-browned face, could feel for
                  them. He had known them in the day of their prosperity, and now, in the day of
                  their adversity, he was doing what he could to assist them, and one could see, in
                  his cheerful moments, the character of his heart.
               There is something noble in a strong man's tear. It bespeaks a cause, under the
                  influence of which it has been forced from its hiding place. A tear, denoting the
                  true nobility of his nature, stood in the eye of old Donald, as he spoke his word
                  of cheer to Mrs. Wilson, before leaving the door:
               "Many, aye, many a time, Mrs. Wilson, has ould Donald seen the likes of this. Yes,
                  sure, madam, they're sorry days, but they must be borne; but it's weel to trust in God—it's always weel to do
                  so, in riches and in poverty. Yes, madam, God will pay these workers of iniquity
                  for the sorrow they have brought to you;" and brushing the tear from his eye with
                  his sleeve, he spoke gently to his horse, and departed.
               "Mother," said Dick, as he seated himself in a house which gave unmistakable
                  evidence that for a long time it had been consecrated to poverty—"mother, dear,
                  dear mother, can it be possible that we are really in this situation, and that
                  this is all that is left to us? Is it merely in a dream that I see this misery? Is
                  this my mother, my sweet sister, my dear little brother? Then where are the rest?
                  Ah! yes; but it's not a dream. I understand it—it's only too real. The
                  rumseller—the rumseller! What a name!—what a power!—what a destroyer!"
               "My son, be calm," replied Mrs. Wilson; "let us give this dark cloud an
                  opportunity to pass over. We are here, my son, alone; and this is all that is left
                  to us. But, my dear children, you are spared to me, and we to each other, yet.
                  Richard, my son, I saw this storm coming. I saw it when it first appeared in the
                  horizon, and I labored to arrest it; but I failed. It came to me, my boy, after
                  all, nearly as suddenly as it did to yourself. For some time I vainly hoped that
                  if I could not prevent it entirely, I might at least be able to make it linger in
                  its coming; and what you see, with the exception of seven hundred dollars, which
                  was in my possession at the time of your father's death, is all that we have left.
                  But, Richard, with this you can finish your profession, and when once you are
                  admitted to the bar, I think I may hope, my dear son, that you will be able to
                  make some provision for us all. Richard, my first born, our staff and stay is
                  broken off, and we must lean upon you. You must be our protector: you
                  must be our defence. It seems to be too hard for you, my son: the load is too
                  heavy. A mother, and sister, and brother, all helpless as children. Oh! it was
                  cruel in the rumseller thus to torture us."
               "Yes, yes, dear Dick," exclaimed his sister, throwing her arms about the neck and
                  kissing the fine forehead of her brother, whose spirit seemed indeed broken; "yes,
                  my brother, you are our only dependence, and to you we must cling. You are our
                  only earthly protector, my dear brother. This change has been severe, Dick; but
                  still, it might have fallen with greater severity. God is good, for he has spared
                  you to us yet, and we will pray for you continually, that you may not be taken
                  from us. Poor dear Ellen, it is well that you are gone. I am sure
                  your gentle spirit is in heaven. I see still the sweet, serene smile which death
                  left upon your lips, and memory, dear Ellen, will ever fondly cherish it. Yes,
                  Dick, she is gone. She is done with the sorrow of this toilsome way. And I have
                  just been wondering with myself, whether it may not be entirely consistent with the divine government,
                  that the spirits of the just made perfect by the blood of the everlasting
                  Covenant, may not have some knowledge of this world still; and also whether they
                  are not sometimes sent on errands of mercy, to brighten the hopes and lighten the
                  toils of the earthly pilgrimage of their friends. If such permission is given in
                  the courts of the redeemed, then we will have the gentle spirit of a glorified
                  sister to sympathise with us in our gloomy path, and He who has been her friend
                  may be ours. But oh! Ellen, I miss you much. Your departure has loosened my hold
                  on life; but I am glad that you are safe—safe where the cruelties of earth can
                  never reach you—safe in the possession of an endearing home, where wickedness will
                  never disturb the harmony of your society. Precious sister! the cold, cheerless
                  storms of life will never beat upon thy pearly path, or damp thy fervent
                  joys."
               Here poor little Harry suddenly joined the group. It was not to be expected that
                  this child would realize the effect of the change. Indeed, it was all the better
                  that he did not. But still, he read in the expression of the rest of the family,
                  the meaning of the double inheritance of orphanage and poverty.
               "Come here, my poor child," said Mrs. Wilson, noticing the evidence of melancholy
                  which shaded his little dimpled cheeks. The little fellow sprang at once into her
                  arms, exclaiming, as if he knew his mother's need of consolation—
               "Dear mother!—little Harry loves mother."
               "Ah, my poor child," said Mrs. Wilson, "I am glad that you do not know the sad
                  realities of this hour; but if you live you will know them. I hope, my child, that
                  if God spares your life, that it will be your privilege to live and act with men
                  who will be much wiser than their fathers. I hope that in your day, the luring
                  temptation which has scathed us will be better understood; that defenders of the
                  right will band together for its extirpation. My prayer is, that my dear boys may
                  be workers it the noble cause. It would make up, in some measure, for the troubles
                  of this hour, if I could see my children safe themselves, and then, with a noble
                  magnanimity, throwing out their influence to save others. Poor child! If your
                  mother can only be permitted to keep you under her own protection until your
                  character is formed, she will try to bear up under the burdens of life with
                  resignation. But—O God!—Father in Heaven! spare, oh, spare, if in the wisdom of
                  thy counsels it may be done—spare my life, until these dear ones, whom thy
                  kindness hath given me, are safe from the tempter's snare! Teach, I pray thee, O
                  Father in Heaven! a broken-hearted mother to say 'Thy will be done!'"
               At this moment, while the eyes of that broken-hearted mother were intently fixed
                  toward heaven, as if waiting some answer, or the assurance that her prayer was
                  heard, and while mute and melancholy despair was depicted upon the countenances of
                     her orphan group, a tall,
                  well-dressed, but uncouth looking man entered the room. To this family, at this
                  moment, he was a revolting object, and they shuddered as he seated himself. His
                  swaggering air, and his cold, unsympathising countenance, pointed him out as
                  belonging to that class to which their bitter sorrows were directly traceable. The
                  manner of his entrance pointed him out at once as one who was lost to all the
                  finer sensibilities of humanity. An unannounced entrance is a privilege which none
                  but the meanest will avail themselves of, any more at the threshold of poverty
                  than at the door of munificence.
               "Is this where Mrs. Wilson lives?" inquired the intruder.
               "It is, sir," replied Mrs. Wilson.
               "Well, ma'm," continued the man, "I've had a devil of a time in finding you out. I
                  guess you don't know me, ma'm."
               "No," replied Mrs. Wilson, "I do not."
               "Yes, I see—just as I supposed. People never know me when I want to get my own.
                  This ain't the first time widows haven't known me; and this ain't the first time,
                  neither, that I've seen children holding on to their mother, as if I was the
                  devil. Your husband knew me, ma'm; yes, he did, devilish well. I wish to the Lord
                  he had made it convenient to have paid me his rum bill before he went off. But I
                  guess he didn't think of going off quite so soon. Your husband, ma'm, was a very
                  clever man—indeed, he was an excellent man; and if it hadn't been for them
                  infernal gambling scoundrels at the—, he would have stood it a good while longer.
                  I have a matter of fifty dollars against your husband's estate, Mrs. Wilson, and I
                  called at this time, supposing, perhaps, that there were some valuable articles
                  which you had concealed, and some of which, perhaps, I could get. I would take
                  anything you can give me, to make up the amount. I'll not be hard, Mrs. Wilson,
                  for God knows you've suffered enough already. Some people think it ain't wrong to
                  hide property; but I'll tell you, ma'm, its all wrong to do so—and people who do
                  it can't expect to prosper. I should think, from your appearance, Mrs. Wilson,
                  that you wouldn't do anything that's wrong, if you only knew it. Now, I declare
                  it's a God's truth, if you have anything laid away, in money or goods, it's very
                  wicked in you to do so. When I saw Mr. Wilson last he had an elegant gold watch,
                  and I tried hard to get it of him, but he said it was for his son. Now, Mrs.
                  Wilson, I suppose you are a Christian: then just think of this."
               "Then, sir," replied Mrs. Wilson, "I understand my husband was in your debt. Is
                  this the entire claim that you had against him?"
               "No, indeed, ma'm, it is not. I have recovered fourteen hundred and fifty dollars.
                  I took your piano, at the hands of the auctioneer, at three hundred dollars. It's
                  an excellent instrument, Mrs. Wilson. I think I made something there! I bid off a good many articles that I ain't a
                  judge of, and can't tell how I've done."
               "Will you have the goodness to tell me, sir, what my husband had in value to the
                  amount of fifteen hundred dollars?"
               "Well, madam, I'm an honorable man, and I wouldn't cheat; but your husband had
                  full value for the amount."
               "Will you then tell me in what business you are engaged?"
               "I am engaged in the coffee-house business, if you must know, and it's a
                  respectable business, too, as well as a living business."
               "Ah, yes, sir," said Mrs. Wilson, "you are a liquor-dealer."
               "I have my father's watch," said Dick; "we have a little money; you see our
                  furniture,—we have hid nothing. Here you see all that your traffic has left us of
                  earthly goods. Here we are, clinging to the wreck that you, in part, have made,
                  and your heartless avarice would lead you now to sink us if you could. Ah, sir, we
                  detest your vocation. You can leave as soon as possible. We are not in your debt,
                  except for the bitter cup of misery which you have placed to our lips. The
                     law has paid you too much already."
               "Richard, my dear son," said Mrs. Wilson, "suffer not this man to excite you to
                  anger."
               "My dear mother," said Dick, wiping his eyes and brushing back his hair with his
                  hand, "I am not angry—there is no room now in my heart for anger. I am only
                  telling this man what he ought to know. There are thousands in this city who think
                  as we do about his business, and who know the mischief he, and others like
                  himself, are doing; but for some reason others regard them as public benefactors!
                  I wonder, mother, that the love they bear to their own children does not compel
                  them to wake up, and make war upon this great scourge of the race, which has
                  filled every path of vice to overflowing."
               "Madam," said the liquor-dealer, drawing himself up with a peculiar dignity, "I
                  don't want to quarrel—I love peace: I only want my pay."
               "I am unable to pay you, sir," said Mrs. Wilson, "without distressing my family,
                  and that I am unwilling to do. They are now distressed, I fear, beyond their
                  capacity to endure. Besides sir, it would be paying you for the commission of a
                  crime—one which God has now charged against your soul! Have you a family, sir? And
                  if so, try at this moment to put yourself and them into our position, and then ask
                  yourself whether you would feel as you now do!"
               "Yes, ma'm, I guess I have a family, and a big one, too! But they don't give me
                  much trouble, I assure you. I have set it down as a fact, that children raised
                  about a house like mine, never amount to much, unless by accident. While I live, I
                     suppose pose they can live, and when
                  I'm dead they must scratch for themselves. I never look forward."
               "I should think not," replied Dick, sharply.
               "Well, sir," continued Mrs. Wilson, "as for my little family, they are very
                  precious to me. I love them as I think a mother ought to love her children, and if
                  it is possible to do so, I want to keep them together, that their affection for
                  each other may not be sullied, and that they may grow up to usefulness and
                  respectability. Thus far, they know nothing about a bar-room, and I trust in God
                  they never will! I hope they will learn to look upon that room, wherever it may
                  be—no matter how well its hideousness may be masked; no matter how its deformities
                  may be covered over, by the witchery of fashion—I hope they will regard it as a
                  room containing the element of every vice."
               "Now, let me tell you, madam, as a friend, you can't keep your family
                  together—that's impossible! After all, it ain't worth doing, any how; and if you
                  could do it, it wouldn't pay! Children never pay for the raising of them; and
                     natural affection—it ain't nothing at all. There is nothing in it;
                  it's all moon-shine! I suppose it's about the same kind of affection which two
                  horses, or two oxen, which are fed together, and drove together, have for each
                  other. This natural affection is off the same web with preaching, and praying, and
                  psalm-singing, and the like. It's all folly; and you find mighty few in my
                  business who are fools enough to follow in this road. Hadn't you better pay me,
                  Mrs. Wilson, and let me be going?" Without waiting for a reply, he turned to Dick,
                  and said: "That young boy sitting there would be squire, I suppose. Now, Mrs.
                  Wilson, if you would just do your duty, and get these notions of high life out of
                  his head, and let him know that he has to dig for a living now, and start him out,
                  just at once, to begin it; and that little one," pointing to little Harry; "if you
                  would give him to some one for his keeping, it would be the best thing that you
                  could do."
               Here little Harry, as if terrified by hearing his name articulated by such lips,
                  bounded at once into his mother's arms, exclaiming—
               "Mother won't let man take little boy—little Harry love mother."
               "No, my poor little son," said Mrs. Wilson, "not while life lasts! I thank God
                  fervently, my orphan boy, that you are not a little slave. If you were, you might
                  be wrung from my bosom—torn from my embrace, or flogged at my feet. But thank God,
                  you are a little freeman, and if you are the heir of orphanage and
                  poverty, the rumseller can neither buy you nor sell you. 'Heaven be praised for
                  kindness in giving to you a white skin.'"
               "Oh, yes," continued this wolfish intruder, "I've heard all this a great many
                  times. It's lost all its effect on me, I assure you it has. It's no use to argue
                  in that way with me. I say, ma'm; if you
                  will give him away, it will be better for you. He will soon forget you; and then
                  it will be just as well for both of you. And your daughter! She is big enough, and
                  I dare say old enough, to earn her living; and it is your duty, as a
                     good mother, to put her out to work, and if you do not do it, I
                  think the poor-master ought to do it for you. That girl is pretty, and after some
                  telling, she could wait at a table nicely. If it wasn't just for one thing, I
                  should like to have her in my house. If I did take her, to work out this bill of
                  her father's, I suppose she would want to stand on a level with my girls and my
                  wife. She is a real high-flier, and wouldn't stand it nohow; and what's more, I
                  wouldn't be able to get no good out of any of them. Just open the door and tell
                  them to go. I'll go bail, they will do something before they starve! What do you
                  say, Mrs. Wilson?"
               "I say, sir," said Mrs. Wilson, while her features glowed with the consciousness
                  of princely superiority, over the ruffian in her presence; "I say, sir, you are as
                  mean as you are murderous. You are as insolent as you are vile; and you are as
                  sure, as you are deserving, of your place at last! Know, then, that Mary Wilson,
                  once the wife, and now the widow, of him whom she tenderly loved; whose memory she
                  still cherishes; whose children she loves better than she does her own life, and
                  whose natural affection for each other rises far above your brutal
                  apprehension—know, then, that these dear ones, to whom your wanton agency has
                  brought a filled chalice of misery;—yes, sir, or villain, as you may
                  choose, know that only God can part me from my children! Give this boy away! Turn
                  him out into the street to beg, and force him to become a thief! Sooner would I
                  give the last drop of blood which circles in my veins! Give my
                  daughter to you, to wait at your table—to be on a level with your
                  daughter! No, sir; rather would I follow her to the grave! I want you to leave
                  this house if you will do it. Do not, I beseech you, kill us by your cruelty."
               "Yes, ma'm," he replied, "I wouldn't stay long with such dishonest folks. 'Nice
                  Christianity, this!'—but it won't pay honest debts."
               He rose to depart, but turned when he had reached the door, and fixing his eye
                  upon Dick, he muttered—
               "You young devil, you! If you had been away, I should have got my pay; but I
                  shan't loose it, I'll go bail for that. I'll get it out of some other fool—yes,
                  that's what I will. Good-day, madam. Keep your natural affection—maybe it will
                  make you rich, and then you will think of honest debts; and maybe you won't call
                  decent people rum-mongers!"
               Here Mrs. Wilson had a new insight into ways of misery, of which before she had
                  not dreamed. She knew how, and by whom, these miseries had been produced. She knew
                  very well who were the cause of her
                  sorrow, but until this moment, she did not dream that even amongst this class of
                  men, there were any who were wanton enough, willingly, much less maliciously, to
                  add a single pang to her overflowing grief.
               But Mrs. Wilson was mistaken. The path along which, hitherto, she had traveled,
                  was one peculiarly exempted from the insults of the rude and unfeeling, but now
                  the barriers of fortune were swept away, and already the beasts of the field had
                  well nigh destroyed every thing.
               "I suppose, my children," said Mrs. Wilson, we must now make up our minds to be
                  governed by the straitened laws of poverty, and we will no doubt find them severe
                  enough, until we get familiar with them. I suppose, too, that our caste has gone with our wealth, and that we will be
                  excluded from the society in which we formerly moved. This I think is cruel. I
                  have, when a child, stood by the hive, when as many bees as could find a share in
                  the work, were carrying out a dead one, but I never saw them carrying out a living
                  one, unless it were a drone, or a thief. In their misfortunes they protect each
                  other; and what a rebuke do they, by their simple instinct, give to the cold
                  formalism of reason! We are not dead, my children—neither are we
                  drones; and most of all, we are far from being thieves; but yet, I
                  apprehend we must make up our minds that there is but little sympathy for us.
                  Those whose protectors perish, as your father did, my children dren, I suppose are
                  very much like ourselves—widows and orphans, for whose
                  protection there is but little civil or social law. But it is not so with those
                  who have brought this affliction upon us; they are protected; their business is
                  legalized; they are privileged to work wickedness with greediness, and to wring,
                  even from penury, the last cherished article, around which the affections and
                  associations of the household have fondly clustered. Ah, but the widow! Where is
                  she? And where her orphan children? The fox and the wild deer can find a covert in
                  the forest's shade—but where is her's? Where the repose for her dear dependent
                  orphans? Only in Heaven! O God, preserve them! Relieve their bitter agonies, and
                  minister to their many wants!"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER III.
               LEAVING A DESOLATED HOME.
               
                  
                     
                        "And I—but ah! can words my loss declare,
                        Or paint th' extremes of transport and despair!
                        O thou, beyond what verse or speech can tell,
                        My guide, my friend, my best beloved—farewell!"
                     
                  
               
               IT was now out of the question for Dick Wilson to return to the law-school at C——,
                  where he had commenced his legal studies, and at which he had spent one year to
                  good advantage. With this impossibility before him, he had entered into
                  correspondence with a lawyer about one hundred miles distant, in a small country
                  seat, and had succeeded in making satisfactory arrangements with him; and all that
                  was necessary now was for Dick, as soon as possible, to be on his way.
               He had been from home many a time, and long. Nearly all his time, with occasional
                  vacation intervals, had been spent among strangers for several years; so that
                  Dick's empty chair and unused plate at the family meal, were no strange things to
                  the family.
               To see Dick preparing to go, and going, was nothing new. This time, however, it
                  was peculiar. When he left formerly, it was from a princely dwelling and an
                  unbroken, happy household. These now were changed. Friends, too, came forth to
                  cheer him on his way, and bid him God-speed. Now, he was about to leave, lonely
                  and alone, to seek a temporary home among strangers, and with scarce enough of
                  money to bear him to his journey's end. He was too noble to take his mother's
                  money, further than was absolutely necessary to enable him to reach the end of his
                  journey.
               "Mother," said he, "I do feel sad this morning."
               "What is the matter, my son?" said Mrs. Wilson tenderly.
               "Ah! mother," he replied, "you cannot hide your heart from me. I have noticed your
                  struggle in preparing for this hour. It has been a mutual struggle between us all.
                  I have tried to smother my feelings, but I cannot. We have all failed to hide from
                  each other the sadness with which this parting hour is necessarily filled. My
                  parting with you now is so new and so strange, that I cannot but feel it, and
                  painfully I find myself unable to banish sadness. I am going now, and I look about
                  me for my father, and am reminded that he is dead! I look for Ellen, and she too
                  is gone! When I left you last, they were here, and came out with you to cheer me
                  on my way. I look—yes, and for days I have looked for friends, who never failed
                  until now to come, and but three as yet have dared to venture within
                  this enclosure of poverty. These absent ones, mother, are not dead, but they have
                  lost their friendship for us. Why is it that no one comes to see me before I
                  go?"
               Mrs. Wilson and Eliza were mute from emotion, and Dick continued:
               "Mother—Eliza—can you tell why it is? Have I done anything to merit this? No, no;
                  you all know that I have not, and they know it too. They ought not to hold me
                  responsible, and make me and you sufferers for the rumseller's
                     crimes; for already we are suffering at his hands all that we can
                  endure. It is indeed cruel that the widow and her orphans, already sorely smitten,
                  should be still deeper wounded by the indifference of those who were formerly
                  friends. I am now about to leave the few who are dear to me—all that I have left
                  to love in the midst of averted faces—with those with whom you are as well
                  acquainted as you are with me, and who, to all appearance, but a few weeks since,
                  were your best and warmest friends. Ah! mother, where are they now? I
                  have seen enough in a few weeks—much that I have not told you—to convince, not
                  only my judgment, but my very heart, until it has sickened at the sight, that
                  whatever we may have been, it is now all over! Yes, my mother, the dark side of a
                  dark picture is shading us now, and with a few exceptions, we are friendless,
                  uncared for, and alone, only because the rumseller has robbed us. If this were
                  all, it could be endured. Oh! yes; we might afford to part with such heartlessness
                  without a tear or a regret. But this is not all. When necessity compels you to go
                  into some fashionable street, you will meet many of these persons who will take no
                  notice of you—at least they will affect not to notice you, lest they should
                  compromise their dignity! As soon as they have passed by you, they will whisper to
                  their companion, 'There goes the drunkard's widow!' And you, my dear sister, as
                     you meet them in the street, without any tokens of recognition on
                  their part, they will say, 'There goes the drunkard's daughter!' And of poor
                  little Harry they will say, 'There goes the drunkard's son!' This, mother, to us
                  is an insupportable load; for at this time a generous sympathy of that kind, which
                  I think human beings are under obligations to share with each other, is absent
                  entirely; and the voice of the multitude articulates the withering sentence,
                     'That is the drunkard's family!' To me, mother, while I hope it
                  may not be my sad misfortune to fall a victim to the rumseller, and be an
                  inheritor of the fortunes which always follow his victims to the
                  grave, it is no strange thing that the drunkard's son, with his cheerless
                  heritage, so often follows in the path of his father, and becomes a drunkard too.
                  It is vain to attempt to attribute this entirely to hereditary causes, for
                  surrounding influences are the most active agencies, and effect more than the mere
                  force of instinct. No, it is not strange. It is rather to be expected. It is just
                  that, for the coming of which those deepest read in human nature would
                     fearfully look. They would not regard
                  its coming as a mystery. There is no mystery about it. Self-respect—the guardian
                  gis of society—is withdrawn, and tempters are often but too successful. Who cares
                  for the drunkard's orphan? Only the few. Who cares for the widow? Who speaks
                  kindly? Only the few. The language of the many is the language of harshness. Is it
                  strange, then, that a pupil in such a school as this—with the tempter on the one
                  hand, enticing to ruin, and society on the other, repelling the victims—is it
                  strange that he should fall, and fall irrecoverably? Kindness and sympathy have a
                  marked and powerful influence for good over the minds and hearts of the young; and
                  if we ever hope to reclaim the erring, we shall find these the most effectual
                  agencies which we can employ for that purpose. On the other hand, unkindness and
                  indifference have directly the opposite effect: they impel its victims rapidly
                  onward in the paths of vice and crime. Yes, mother, until the drunkard's family
                  become the objects of tender sympathy, a succession of drunkards may
                  be expected. How much more cheerful would our hearts have been this morning, if
                  some kind friend, as heretofore, had come to speak words of kindness to us! What a
                  power it would have had to help this poor boy on his unforseen way! What a power
                  perhaps in shaping his destiny! Ah, mother, it is not Mr. Wilson's son, who is
                  leaving for college this morning. No, no; it's the 'poor drunkard's
                     son' who is leaving—for where and for what,
                  God only knows, and if Heaven cares no more than men, he must inevitably be
                  lost!"
               As Dick Wilson, from the fullness of his heart, was giving out these truths, under
                  the influence of which his heart was smarting, he was suddenly interrupted by the
                  entrance of one whose visits had always been welcome, but now they were especially
                  so. It was an old minister who had known the family for years, and who had always
                  been on terms of intimacy with them, and who had spent several days in searching
                  out their place of retreat. The old gentleman entered with his kind
                  'good-morning,' and seating himself hastily, he burst into tears. The transition
                  was too sudden for him. He was not prepared to witness such an entire desolation
                  as that which stared him in the face and chilled his heart as he entered. After
                  some time, letting fall his trembling hands, which covered his face, and then
                  wiping his eyes with his bandana, he slowly raised his head and surveyed the room;
                  and after a moment, he said,
               "This is surely the winter of your life. This, Mrs. Wilson, is severe;" and then
                  casting a glance mingled with love and sorrow, at each of the family, he
                  continued—
               "Mrs. Wilson, this is a severe affliction through which you and your dear children
                  are now passing. You have been made to feel the fury of a storm for which you were
                  not prepared, and you have been smitten
                  by it to the earth. But such storms as these are more frequent than you may
                  suppose. This one has carried you and your children far out upon the cheerless
                  ocean, whose billows are first created and then maddened by rum. Your position in
                  society has not given you as good an opportunity to observe and know what is
                  passing, as mine has given me. For fifty years I have been a watchman upon the
                  wall. I have been unfaithful; my heart has been harder than it ought to have been;
                  and yet, (to the praise of His grace be it spoken,) I think He has sometimes
                  enabled this stammering tongue to lift up the voice upon the wall, and win a few
                  from the paths of vice to the pleasant ways of virtue. I have seen much—much, at
                  the recollection of which I shudder. But surely, Mrs. Wilson, it is a great
                  consolation, and one with which none should fail to familiarize themselves in the
                  day of prosperity, that there is a God. It may do when fortune is smiling, and
                  when friends in name are flattering, to trust in this world; but when the long day
                  of bleak adversity gathers about our path, God then is our refuge—God, in whose
                  presence the selfish inequalities of earth dwindle into insignificance. You are
                  not alone, Mrs. Wilson, in this suffering. Would to God that you were. But you are
                  not. Thousands upon thousands of such wrecks as yours strew the beach of this
                  ocean! Yes, the land is flooded with widows and orphans whose husbands and fathers
                  perished in its bosom. But these mingling prayers and groans—these tears and
                  screams—these terrible anathemas against the rumseller, are daily
                  ascending to heaven; and God will answer them, and his avenging fury will be
                  poured out upon its authors and abettors. It has often brought sadness to my
                  heart, as I have looked at this systematic destroyer of the human family, to see
                  the influences by which it is upheld, and without which, of its own
                     rottenness, it would fall to pieces. But, Mrs. Wilson, you have yet much
                  to live for. You are not only a widow, but you are the mother of orphans, and you
                  have before you at this moment a treasure for which you would not take the world
                  in exchange. Here you see where the goodness and severity of God mingle, and
                  where, not withstanding these calamities, he still is love. Your relations to
                  these dear ones has a fearful importance; for they will wear some impression of
                  yourself throughout eternity. It is not improbable that these children, now
                  sitting by your side, will keep some memento of you throughout eternity. Poor
                  things! They are pale and dejected now; but they may become strong again when this
                  storm has entirely passed over. But still, sooner or later, like the rose on its
                  fragile stem, or he full-grained corn in the ear, they will bow their heads, and
                  lisp their mother's name for the last time upon the earth. Yes, mother of this
                  riven group, your tears, your breaking heart manifest the keen agony of your
                  grief. But it is not improbable that when sun, and moon, and stars shall fail, and when eternal noon shall
                  abide in its own sublimity—its grand manifested reality upon the engulphed wreck
                  of all physical existences—that still, far on through the mysteries of that
                  eternal being, and still on through that to which eternal being shall aspire—aye,
                  in the whispers of that still beyond—it is not improbable that in light and joy,
                  or in gloom and sadness, the name of mother, mother, MOTHER! will
                  still be lisped. As a mother, what a charge and treasure has God committed to your
                  keeping! What a fearful combination of mortal and immortal has he entrusted to you
                  for education! Then strive, as you love those immortal beings, and are solicitous
                  for their present and future welfare, so to touch the gentle chords of their young
                  being, that each vibration may have an upward tendency—that each echo may have the
                  still small voice of love for all, and they will be safe—safe from
                  the rumseller, and safe from the master of his feasts. We do not live
                  in this world for ourselves alone. No such prescribed existence belongs to our
                  being. There is no doubt that we live, in part, for the whole human
                  family—certainly for those who are walking in the same path with us—fearfully for
                  those of our own households. I pity that poor creature whose hopes and whose
                  fears, whose thoughts and anxieties all centre in himself, as if he alone were the
                  whole of creation. Mrs. Wilson, so teach these children that every aspiration of
                  their hearts may be for 'whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are
                  pure,' and they will never dishonor the sacred name of MOTHER."
               —Turning to Dick, he said:
               "And Richard, my boy, I understand that you are about leaving home again; you are
                  now leaving it as you never left it before, and you will every day get new
                  insights into its mysteries and its mischiefs. You will meet temptation in new
                  forms, and coming with new power, and the only way in which you can hope to save
                  yourself from being contaminated, is to begin at the beginning, and resist the
                     first, and this will give you new strength to meet and vanquish
                  every subsequent temptation. You cannot tell what form the temptation may assume,
                  or how beautifully it may array itself, or how eloquently it may plead, or how
                  sternly it may menace you. But remember, and be apprised of one thing,
                  'temptations will come;' and if you yield once, you will probably yield again, and
                  I may ask, but you cannot tell me, when it will end. You are one of those young
                  men, whose character I have often tried to analyze; you are fortunate, and yet,
                  you are unfortunate. Your nobleness will win for you distinction, if you live and
                  adhere to the ways of virtue—in which only is safety. But nobleness has a
                  background; and this very thing, which is so desirable in human character, unless
                  you guard it well, will give the polished viciousness of the world a great
                  advantage over you. You expect to meet temptation at the hands of the
                     rumseller, and of the wine-
                  
                  bibber, but you cannot tell how they will approach you, or how
                  eloquently they may plead for your successful distinction. If vice had
                     vice written on its forehead, if the bar-room had
                  'THE BROAD WAY TO RUIN,' written over its threshold, if the accomplished knave had
                     knavery branded on his brow, if the merely pretended friend of
                  humanity had hypocrisy stereotyped on his countenance, then there would be less
                  danger, my boy, for your future. There is but little danger that the poor degraded
                  drunkard will be able to tempt you; his influence, so far as it could go, would
                  tend to repel. He, poor fellow, an object of compassion rather than reproach, is
                  the object upon whom the rumseller has painted, in vivid colors, the fruit of his
                  vocation. Many of them have left the touch of their merciless pencils upon his
                  trembling frame; they have parched and withered and burned up his character, and
                  have imprinted their own in its stead; and no matter what he was, or what he might
                  have been, he is a blank now, and he cannot tempt you. But if you are in no danger
                  here, do not apprehend that there is no danger. You will meet the gentleman in
                     appearance—you will meet the fiend by profession—you
                  will be met by beauty in disguise, full of professions, but false at heart—you
                  will be met by those whose words are flattering, but whose influence is as the
                  poison of asps. These are terrific temptations, when the agent is bold enough to
                  filch an angel's being, the better to subserve his master's purposes. Richard, I
                  tremble as I see you going out with your noble nature to confront such agencies as
                  these, and all the advice I can give you, is to remember to engrave it upon your
                  soul, that by whomsoever the sparkling glass is urged upon you, to account
                     that individual your enemy. Ah! but do you say, 'Who is this
                  enemy?' It may be beauty in the freshness of its bloom, or it may be manhood in
                  the vigor of its prime, or it may be genteel-looking but depraved old age, in its
                  tottering imbecility. If any or all of these should conspire to tempt you, think
                  of the past—think of the future—think of those whom your going out at
                  this time will leave lonely indeed. Think, young man, of God; for after all, no
                  other power can save you. Remember this, and you will do well." And here the old
                  man, true to a good old custom, knelt down and offered up a fervent prayer for the
                  afflicted family, and for the safety of this young man, who was going out from
                  their presence to try his fortune, under circumstances which the rumseller had
                  imposed upon him.
               "Mother," said Dick, "I feel better now, and you look more cheerful too; I shall
                  leave you with a lighter heart than I expected, and oh! mother, I shall be often
                  with you, and if I only succeed, you will soon be better provided for than you are
                  now. And you, my sweet sister; and you, my dear little Harry—Dick will help you.
                  Mother, when Mrs. Livingston and Mrs. Eagleson call, remember me kindly to
                  them."
               
               The hour at length arrived which was again to separate him from his dear ones. His
                  old trunk, the same that he had often carried with him across the Alleganies, was
                  laid down at the door, and little Harry was seated upon it, looking intently at
                  his brother. Eliza was standing by his side, with her hand resting on his
                  shoulder, and Mrs. Wilson stood before him, with one hundred dollars, urging him
                  to take it, but with a filial tenderness, he refused it, saying: "I have to begin
                  sometime—I may as well do it now." His trunk was placed upon the dray of Donald,
                  the good hearted old Scotchman, who was always to be found when they needed him,
                  and already his faithful horse was moving off.
               Dick lingered for a moment, as if loath to leave the spot, and then beginning with
                  little Harry, he kissed them all, and without a word, for their hearts were too
                  full for utterance, this poor boy turned upon his unforseen way.
               They watched him until he disappeared, and then Mrs. Wilson fervently ejaculated,
                  "O God! preserve my boy from the rumseller's snare!"
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               THE CONTRAST AND ITS CAUSE.
               
                  
                     
                        "And is this all? Can reason do no more
                        Than bid me shun the deep and dread the shore?
                        Sweet moralist! afloat on life's rough sea,
                        The Christian has an art unknown to thee:
                        He holds no parley with unmanly fears;
                        Where duty bids, he confidently steers,
                        Faces a thousand dangers at her call,
                        And, trusting in his God, surmounts them all."
                     
                  
               
               FRANK HAMILTON, the former friend and class-mate of Dick Wilson, had just returned
                  from the law school at A——, at which place, without any interruption, he had spent
                  the required time, and was ready to be admitted to the bar at the next regular
                  term of court. On his return, he had received the cordial and endearing reception
                  which loved ones are sure to receive when they return home, after an absence from
                  its cherished endearments. Who does not know the inexpressible joys attendant upon
                  the return of an absent one, when death, so often the relentless spoiler of
                  domestic peace, has not been permitted to invade the sanctity of the home circle?
                  The home of Frank Hamilton was just what it had always been, and than his own
                     family there was none pleasanter on
                  the earth, and than his own sweet sister there was none whom he accounted dearer
                  or lovelier. They had all the elements of a happy and prosperous family. They had
                  wealth in abundance; but even this, without wisdom, is oftener an element of ruin
                  than of success. They were somewhat singular; for with all their getting, they had
                  managed to get understanding. Possessing in an eminent degree that
                  rare commodity, the goddess of Fashion never found in them obsequious
                  worshippers.
               Mr. Hamilton was—and Frank bid fair to be just like him—a remarkable man. He
                  usually heard all the sermons which were delivered in his own church on the
                  Sabbath day, and so did his family. No excuses were heard about that house on
                  Sabbath morning. Kate never said, "Mother, it's really too warm," or, "It's really
                  too cold," or, "I have a slight indisposition," or, "My bonnet is not in order,
                  and I believe I shan't go." No, no; when the carriage was brought to the door, Mr.
                  Hamilton was always careful to see that all the passengers were aboard. He was a
                  firm believer, according to the Scottish style, in the "covenants of promise." If
                  he dissected a sermon—and this he usually did, if it was worth dissecting—he
                  portioned it out to himself and his own family, and not to his neighbors. When the
                  gentle shadows of the evening twilight were closing the Sabbath day, Mr. Hamilton
                  would take his accustomed seat, and then the whole family knew what was coming.
                  Seated there in the usual order, Mr. Hamilton would first help himself, and then
                  from the same sermon or sermons, as the case might be, he would meet out a portion
                  to each of his family, and endeavor, by explanation, to make them understand and
                  apply it. This done, Mr. Hamilton would kneel down with his family and invoke the
                  blessing of God upon them; and here he seemed to realize that he did not live for
                  himself and his family alone. He prayed for every thing for which it would not be
                  wrong to pray. He prayed for the poor drunkard and his little helpless children,
                  and for his heart-broken wife, and that the rumseller—the occasion of all
                     this—might be brought to repentance, or else be cut off.
               When Mr. Hamilton met the poor drunkard in the street, whose appearance indicated
                  the excrutiating agony of the dread spoiler, then he had time and he had a heart
                  to stop and remonstrate tenderly with him; and often from the lips of the victim,
                  tottering upon the verge of the grave, and supported by the hand of his
                     unfed and unclothed child, did Mr. Hamilton hear the
                  interrogation, "Why do you keep these adders in the street? Why do you permit
                  these wholesale curses to exist? I cannot help it. I am the rumseller's slave.
                  This child is the rumseller's slave. My wife is the rumseller's slave. Why don't
                  you help us to break our chains?"
               When Mr. Hamilton met the boy, about whom the fruits of this curse were hanging in
                  gloomy profusion fusion, with a "Please,
                  sir, give me a penny to buy some bread," then he had an open heart and a kind
                  word. He never stopped to say to himself—"Well, I don't know. This boy may be a
                  little thief, or a little imposter," and then bid him be gone. He was always
                  careful that his influence should never mingle with the rumseller's, in driving an
                  almost infant beggar to the commission of crime. The great pity and
                  the great misfortune for the poor drunkard is that so few have a heart to do what
                  they have a plenty of time to do.
               In the midst of these associations we meet Frank Hamilton at home, enjoying them
                  to the very full, delighting himself with the pleasant and familiar appearance of
                  every thing about him, the most of which had been there from his earliest
                  recollection. While he was musing in the midst of these associations, and
                  contemplating the beneficent influence which they had exerted over his life, he
                  was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of Kate, who, with her loud, hearty
                  laugh, was making every thing ring. She approached to where Frank was sitting, and
                  laid her hand upon his head. It was plain enough from her mischievous appearance
                  that there was fun in the neighborhood, and it was just as plain that she knew all
                  about it, and couldn't keep it half a moment longer. Suddenly taking from her
                  pocket a beautifully embossed note, she held it before his eyes, saying—
               "Here, Mr. Frank Hamilton, Esquire, Junior— for this is the direction—here, I
                  apprehend, is something especially sweet for you; for it is a mark of very great
                  consideration for your precious self from Mrs. B——."
               Frank at once opened the evidence of Mrs. B——'s consideration, and then tried hard
                  to read it; and at length he said to Kate, smiling:
               "This may be my death warrant, for all I can make out of it. Suppose you take it,
                  and see what you can do with it."
               Kate took the note; but all her ingenuity could do, it wouldn't read. She turned
                  it right side up and right side down, and every other side; but to no avail.
               "Well," said Kate, "what's the use of trying? I guess it wasn't intended to be
                  read. Still, they were thoughtful enough to send the interpretation thereof by the
                  black Daniel who brought it. He said it was an invitation to attend a mighty
                     select party at Mrs. B——'s, on next Thursday evening, at half-past
                  eight o'clock."
               "Kate, who is this Mrs. B——? I have no recollection of any such person."
               "Oh, she has sprung up since you left; or at least, she has but recently come into
                  notice. They have been in the city for many years, but their business was not very
                  reputable, and hence they were not known. But they became wealthy, and retired to
                  private life. This accounts for that stubborn note."
               
               "What was their business formerly, Kate?"
               "Rumselling, Frank."
               "Ah!—rumselling? And now, because they have retired wealthy, at the expense, it
                  may be, of a thousand wretched homes, they are very respectable!
                  Kate, I don't want to go there."
               "You must go, Frank. There is no way in the world that you can get out of it."
               "Well, Kate, you havn't seen all the world yet, nor all the ways of it, either. I
                  guess I could get out of it if I set myself about it. I suppose, however, it will
                  be best to go."
               "That's right, Frank; be cheerful now about it. These people have abandoned that
                  business, and if they want to do right during the remainder of their lives, they
                  ought to be encouraged."
               "That depends on the motives by which they were prompted to give it up. If it was
                  from policy, in order to find their way into fashionable life, I wouldn't give
                  much for it. If it was from a conviction of the pernicious tendencies of their
                  business, then certainly they ought to be encouraged."
               "You will find wine there, Frank, plenty of it, and if you should be
                  taken with sudden pains, I have no doubt that you could be
                  accommodated with something stronger."
               "That's the devil's own kind of repentance, Kate. I see through the whole thing
                  now."
               "They have a beautiful daughter, Frank."
               "She has been brought up in a bad school, Kate."
               "She is rich too, Frank."
               "Her riches came through a bad channel, my sister."
               "Frank, Caroline will be there. What do you say now?"
               "Nonsense, my sister. I understand you very well. You have the same opinion about
                  this matter that I have. But Caroline!—Why, if you had seen what I have seen
                  amongst the hills of western Pennsylvania, you wouldn't speak of her in several
                  moons! I have no peculiar attachments in that way, and I don't think I ever shall
                  have."
               "Heigh-ho! Frank—you don't know what you may have before you."
               "That's true, Kate; but I know what I will try to keep from before me—anything
                  that savors of the rumseller's temptation."
               "Frank, what objection can you have to Caroline? She is rich, handsome, and
                  well-educated."
               "Kate, for several years I have been out beyond the restraints of fashion, amongst
                  those whose young spirits, when once they have tasted of freedom from its chains,
                  are too noble to be bound by it again. This is a good place to see and study human
                  nature, and I have tried to improve it. I have formed, or have tried to form, some
                  idea of what a real life is. I do not mean a sleepy, dreamy life, in which
                     formality is an abiding law; but I mean an active, sober,
                  industrious life—a life which in some sense may be beneficial to others as well as
                  to one's self. Now, my objection to
                  Caroline is precisely my objection to going to this party. As you say, she is rich
                  and well-educated; but you must excuse me when I say that I do not think her
                  beautiful. Caroline has been educated in the school of that great mocker, the
                  wine-cup. She has had the example of her parents, in this way instructing her that
                  it was harmless, and not only harmless, but reputable. I have laid it down as a
                  rule, or rather as a principle for the government of my life, that on all
                  occasions where-ever it is possible, I will fly from this temptation.
                  This, I apprehend, is the safe way; for when persons recklessly, and in opposition
                  to the dictates of their own better judgment, put themselves into the way of
                  temptation and danger, they cannot tell how it will result, or how far the
                  consequences may reach. I apprehend, Kate, that in this path you will find more
                  captives than conquerors. My sister, you love your brother, and you think that he
                  is perfect. This, let me assure you, is a great mistake. Your brother has still
                  with him the impulses of youth, with many of its indiscretions; and he could be
                  led astray—tempted, ruined, and drawn by an irresistible power to the door of the
                  lowest rumselling den in this city, if he would suffer himself to take the bait
                  which the rumseller manages to throw out, often, in the social circle of high
                  life. I believe, if it had not been for this sacred book, and what I have learned
                  from it, and the fervent prayers of my father and mother, that I should have been
                  ruined. Kate, I have thought that you prayed for me too—I know you did."
               "Yes, Frank, I have. Could I forget you? Could a sister forget her brother?"
               "Many are thus forgotten, Kate, not only by sisters, but by entire households. I
                  know many a poor young man who never heard a prayer in his father's house, and for
                  whom, in his absence, no prayers were offered. I knew that I was remembered by my
                  household. These, my sister, were the influences which heretofore have enabled me
                  to withstand temptation, and now I would not have Caroline, and risk the
                  consequences, for her weight in gold. Kate, suppose I had returned to you a
                  drunkard—for such a thing would have been possible. Many a young man returns home
                  in this way. Many an one in this way goes home again with blighted prospects and a
                  heavy heart. If this had been my lot, what would have paid you, my sister, and my
                  dear father and mother, for the sacrifice? You could not name the price."
               "Frank, you are certainly right. But do you think, my brother, that in the simple
                  form of wine, the pure juice of the grape, there can be the danger of
                  which you speak?"
               "The pure juice of the grape! Kate, there is not a more systematic
                  counterfeiting organization in the world than belongs to the rumselling business.
                     Pure wine! Why, in the whole system of adulteration, this is the
                  most poisonous and nauseating article
                  ticle they make, and yet on this miserable stuff, filthy as it is, many commence
                  their career of dissipation. Ah! Kate, if the gloomy horrors, the unapproachable
                  miseries of that dark monster mocker could be painted out before you on the
                  canvass, you would tremble. If you could hear, as they have been heard, the
                  touching pleas which misery, in all its grades, has made to the agents of the
                  monster wickedness, to cease, and spare their friends—to save them from premature
                  death and a drunkard's grave—you would more than tremble. Many an one who has
                  tasted wine for the first time in a gay group, has finished in the lowest den. I
                  suppose we had better go to that party, Kate, as it may give offence if we do not.
                  But I do most fervently hope that the time may soon come when an intelligent and
                  sympathetic humanity will no longer permit this mischievous business to be carried
                  on under the sanction of law. The Italian mode of licensing the assassin is not
                  productive of so much misery as this is; for at his hand the victim dies quickly.
                  A groan—a struggle—a gasp, and it is over; but his character survives. But the
                     rum-monger's dagger is like the lightning's fiery bolt: it selects
                  often the loftiest and finest tree in the forest, and then comes down in its fury
                  to rend it; and its beauty is gone long ere its decay. Here is the drunkard's
                  great misfortune, and the rumseller's great crime: the character dies
                     first, and often the immortal being waits the slower
                     process of constitutional decay.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               THE CONTRAST AND ITS CAUSE—CONTINUED.
               
                  
                     
                        "If hindrances obstruct thy way,
                        Thy magnanimity display,
                        And let thy strength be seen;
                        But oh! if fortune fill thy sail,
                        With more than a propitious gale,
                        Take half thy canvass in."
                     
                  
               
               THE evening on which Frank Hamilton was to be introduced to Mrs. B——, her pretty
                  daughter, and a very select party, at length came.
               "Well, Kate," said Frank, "are you ready to go? If we must go—and I
                  suppose Mrs. B—— as a special favor to us, has decreed that—I think we had better
                  be moving soon; for if possible, I should like to get there at an early hour. Some
                  persons manage to be the last to arrive on all occasions. This, I suppose, is to
                  give as good an opportunity for observation as possible."
               Frank had been peering over the pages of a late monthly, and during all the time
                  in which he was speaking to his sister, he did not once raise his eyes from the
                  page, and he started in surprise when Kate informed him, that already she had been
                  waiting his movements more than half an hour.
               
               "Well, then, if we must, let's be off quick, Kate, I'm sure I don't want to be
                  late; though the fact is, I should rather not go."
               "You would look much better, my brother," said Kate, "if you would turn your
                  attention, with as much expedition as possible, to making some arrangements in the
                  way of improving your personal appearance, before you go."
               "What's wrong now, Kate?" inquired Frank.
               "Nothing; only I would like to see you brush off a little of your 'back-woods'
                  carelessness."
               "That's the way it goes, Kate; but I do wish that you had a great many things in
                  this endless city which belong to 'back-woods' life. If you had, you would not be
                  quite so particular about shining collars, boots, &c. But, Kate, what do you
                  want me to do, it's getting late; we must be in a hurry."
               "Frank," replied Kate, "your own taste must direct you;" and off he went, to make
                  his preparations. In a few moments he returned again; and to the eye of an
                  exquisite, it would seem, not much improved; and just as he entered, he
                  exclaimed:
               "Kate, how will this do?"
               "Very well, my brother," replied Kate.
               "Now, Kate, let us go. I will try to equip myself in the robes of fashion, and arm
                  myself to the teeth with formality. But I declare, Kate, it is so long since I
                  have made any attempt to change myself into anything else than a human being, that
                  I am afraid now I shall make a failure. I am sure, Kate, that this
                     harness will be a mighty bad fit, and I don't believe that I shall
                  be able to keep it on; but perhaps I may do so.
               "Just look here a moment, Kate, and be sober about it, if you don't I'll call
                  mother. Has this collar a fashionable sit?"
               "Yes, Frank."
               "How do I look, Kate?"
               "Very well, I think."
               With this they started for Mrs. B——'s, whose wealth rather than worth had brought
                  her into notice. Frank felt uneasy, for it was the first time in several years
                  that he had made one of a fashionable party, but still, he had his 'wits,' about
                  him, and a good, well founded principle, to assist in giving point and effect to
                  them.
               "Kate," said he, as they tripped along the smooth pavements, which reflected in
                  their faces the glare of the street lamps—"Kate, if my preferences were consulted,
                  I should much have preferred to remain at our own quiet home, where we would have
                  enjoyed the free communion of kindred and congenial spirits; while here we must be
                  tortured by a cold and heartless formality—by grossness flimsily hidden by an
                  external glitter, and be compelled, by the merciless forms of social despotism, to
                  meet and mingle with those, with whom we have no sympathy, and for whom we have no
                  respect."
               "Stop, stop this nonsense, Frank, we are just at the door," said Kate.
               
               "I declare," said Frank, "Mrs. B—— has got up pretty well. By my word, this is a
                     lift for a super-anuated rumseller. How in creation, Kate, did
                  this come about? It's a perfect phenomenon to me."
               "Stop, Frank, they'll hear every word," said Kate.
               At this moment the brilliant hall, filled with fashion at the bidding of notes
                  which none could decypher, broke fully upon him, and at the next moment he stood
                  in the midst of the crowd, going through the ceremony of greeting old
                  acquaintances, and being introduced to new faces.
               At length Mr. and Mrs. B—— came to pay their respects to Frank, and as they were
                  on their way, he almost smiled to see them coming. They were elegantly dressed;
                  but their dress, their gait and their manners were perfect antipodes;
                  between them there was no agreement. Frank's eye was quick—and silk, and satin,
                  and all the rest could n't hide from him, the "old times" of their history. They
                  paid their respects and departed. He had just concluded to seat himself, when
                  suddenly a group of young ladies, numbering about half a dozen, were seen bending
                  their way towards him. He knew them every one, and Caroline A—— was of the number.
                  The ladies at length reaching him, by a kind of dead march pace,
                  said—
               "It gives us much pleasure to see you, Mr. Hamilton; we hope you are well."
               "Thank you, ladies," replied Frank, "I am glad to see you, and hope you are also
                  well. But come, girls, don't call me mister, if you please—call me Frank; I do
                  believe it is the first time in my life that I have been called Mr. Hamilton."
               "Your wish shall be our pleasure," they replied, as they turned to leave, in a
                  style which was as much as to say, 'you are not done with us yet, young
                  gentleman.' 'Perhaps so,' thought Frank.
               They were glad to see me, yes indeed, thought Frank, but they were a great deal
                  better pleased to have an opportunity at my expense of exhibiting themselves.
               "Good evening, Misther Frank," said an old man, by whom he had seated himself. "I
                  hear you're but jist now got home from the larnin'; and they tell me you're done
                  man, and that ye ain't a collegian any longer. It's a bad place for boys, isn't
                  it, Misther Frank? Faith, thin, I expect you had good times there, hadn't ye?"
               "Oh yes, Uncle Peter," answered Frank, "I guess I had fine times—finer than I
                  shall most probably ever have again."
               "I thought so, Mr. Frank. Ye see, ye had nothing to do in the first place but to
                  act the gintleman; and thin, by me soul, what's a great deal bether—ye had plenty
                  of money to do it with. You see, Misther Frank, yer father, like meself, he's
                  rich. Is it the law that ye thinks of larnin' next, Misther Frank, or does ye
                  think to be a ministher? It seems to be a great pity, Misther Frank, if ye thought
                  to be a ministher in these times. In my
                  poor ould counthry it was a brave business, and if poor men got into it there,
                  they were sure to get rich; but in this country, if rich men get into it, they're
                  sure to get poor. Now, Misther Frank, don't be a ministher! If ye have a fancy for
                  the 'law' it will do very well, and ye'll make money too—and ye'll get rich, and
                  ye'll be a great man—and ye'll be able to keep in yer house the best
                     wines in the country—and ye'll be able to do jist whatever ye may
                  like to do; indeed, Misther Frank, ye will, if ye only takes up the 'law!' But
                  Misther Frank, if ye take's up the ministhry, as it's called, thin ye'll be poor
                  all the days of yer life. Ye may git to Heaven yerself, after a while, perhaps,
                  when you've tugged and strived till yer tired of life, but ye'll not git many with
                  ye, indeed ye won't, so ye had better make up yer mind to do jist what's the most
                  doing—look after yerself first, and don't trouble the 'ould book' too much."
               "Well, Uncle Peter," answered Frank, "I cannot tell what I may make, but I have
                  studied law already, and I have studied human nature some, and the 'old book'
                  some, too, and I think it's better than any or all of them put together.
               "Thin, Misther Frank, yer going to be yer father upset, and every one to their
                  likin'," muttered Uncle Peter, apparently not satisfied that he had failed to
                  produce conviction on Frank's mind by his eloquence. Poor Uncle Peter knew all
                  about a dray and a dray horse, and how to manage a hogshead head or a large box to
                  the best advantage. Here he would have been at home, perfectly so; but for his
                  present position, he needed a whole new creation, which money could never give
                  him, and like Mr. and Mrs. B——, he was most profoundly awkward, and equally
                  ignorant.
               During Uncle Peter's harangue, Frank was by no means an attentive auditor, for in
                  another room he thought he saw a disposition manifested to bring mishap to some
                  one. They were the same persons who, on his entrance, had greeted him last, and
                  who, on leaving, had given him more than half a promise that they would call
                  again, and hence it was that he divided his attention between them and Uncle
                  Peter.
               It very often happens that temptations suddenly beset us, and come with such force
                  as, while thus unprepared, to make us their captives. Such was the object of the
                  young ladies, whose sudden presence and absence have been noticed.
               The next moment they stood before him, and there was no difficulty in reading, in
                  their manners and features, that some plot had been concocted, and was about to be
                  put into execution. They stood in such a position as to command the fullest
                  attention of the company, and one of the number, turning herself in such a way as
                  to command the best possible view of the guests, and of Frank, too, displayed a
                  goblet, in which the firy eye of wine was sparkling and delighting itself, in the prospect of
                  adding another victim to the gloomy caravan of wounded men!—she
                  said,
               "Will Mr. Frank Hamilton please to give the company a sentiment?"
               Frank replied—"It will afford me a great deal of pleasure to give you a sentiment,
                  ladies; but the company have made no such request."
               "Well then, Frank, give us a sentiment, and that will, do for the whole company;
                  it will be like saying grace at the table—all can partake!"
               "With pleasure," said Frank, fixing his eye upon the charmer, and
                  holding it there until he was sure that every one in the house, including Uncle
                  Peter, gave attention, and then he said, in a clear and distinct voice, while the
                  wine sparkled in the presence of the company—"'FOR AT LAST IT BITETH LIKE A
                  SERPENT, AND STINGETH LIKE AN ADDER'".
               The effect was electric, and the column of attack quailed for a moment, and many,
                  whose lips were thirsting for it, looked amazed. They were not routed, however.
                  They were in the house of a veteran commander, who had been in the habit of doing
                  small things for a sixpence; and they had great courage, and came
                  again, saying:
               "Perhaps, Frank, you can't relish wine."
               "You are mistaken, ladies," said Frank, "I do relish it; but I have seen so many
                  bad consequences resulting from its use, I have put myself into a school of
                  abstinence for safety; and on every occasion I will try to say what I now say—"Get
                  thee behind me, Satan!"
               "Taste this, Frank; it will do you no harm—I am very sure it won't. What! a taste
                  of wine injure any one? No, I'm sure it won't."
               "So thought many," replied Frank, "who are at this moment writhing under its
                  cruelties—who are weeping while you are laughing over it—who are cursing while you
                  are praising it."
               "It won't kill you, Frank. Just taste it."
               "So said its master," replied Frank, "on another occasion: 'Thou shalt not surely
                  die.' Did he speak the truth then?"
               Here the entire column was broken, and they retreated amidst the illy-suppressed
                  titters of the better part of the company.
               Uncle Peter, who was seated nearest Frank, looked dumfounded. It was
                  plain enough that he wanted at least to wet his lips, and he rose to leave,
                  muttering—
               "Mister Frank, that's the effect of yer rasin', and it's bad."
               Uncle Peter's place was supplied in a moment by a gentleman, who, as soon as he
                  was seated, said to Frank:
               "You are a noble fellow. You have done yourself great credit this evening."
               "That, sir," replied Frank, "is just what I want to be; and of all
                     others, that is the compliment which I would soonest merit. I am very sure that if I remain unscathed by this
                  pestilence, I must not listen to the philosophy of wine-bibbers, or put my life in
                  the keeping of the rumseller, for the one is synonymous with the other, and the
                  end of both is destruction."
               Frank had spoken firmly, but not harshly. His speech was characterized by the
                  courteous dignity of the true gentleman, and even those who were intensely
                  mortified by it could not blame him.
               "Mr. Hamilton," said the gentleman by his side, "in this case you have done your
                  duty nobly, and I think that every one present is under obligations to you for the
                  good example you have given, of principle triumphing over pride, and its
                  tendencies to vice. Will you tell me, Mr. Hamilton, how it is possible for persons
                  occupying places in such society as this, or indeed in any society, to encourage
                  the use of that which they know to be the most prolific source of crime and
                  misery? These people can hardly put their heads out of their own doors without
                  seeing the fearful consequences."
               "Well," replied Frank, "I do not know that I can give you a satisfactory answer;
                  but to my own mind it is clear enough, that this apparent recklessness is the
                  result of one or more of these causes, namely: indifference,
                     ignorance, or viciousness. Who can pass along these streets
                  and be ignorant? Who can live in the midst of these consequences, which startle
                  the stranger as soon as he enters, until his very heart sickens, and not abhor it?
                  I tell you, sir, there is something too cool about this business. Charity will
                  hardly believe that it is ignorance. I believe it is indifference; and what kind
                  of indifference? The same that may be laying the foundation of their children's
                  ruin."
               Many things, of course, had occurred during the evening; and when all was over,
                  Frank and Kate were making their way toward home. Frank was anxious to know what
                  his sister thought of his management of matters, but did not venture to ask her
                  until they were quietly seated at home, and even then he dreaded to do so. At last
                  he mustered courage and said:
               "Kate, how did I manage matters this evening?"
               "Admirably, my brother," replied Kate.
               "Upon my word, Kate," he answered, "those are comfortable words to me. I am glad
                  to hear you say that."
               "Frank, you mortified those girls almost to death, and I think they will not try a
                  prank of that kind very soon again. They had the matter pretty well arranged.
                  There was an abundance of wine on hand, and Mrs. B—— and the girls were very
                  anxious to have it going round; and they thought if they asked you for a
                  sentiment, you could not help giving it, and then that you could not avoid
                  drinking with them, and then it would have gone round merrily. I heard most of the
                  plan when they were arranging it."
               
               "Well, Kate, I gave them a sentiment—the most appropriate sentiment in the world
                  for the occasion, and I hope it will do them good."
               "But, Frank, your sentiment tumbled Mrs. B—— into perfect confusion and
                  mortification. She was very angry at the girls, and said some pretty hard things,
                  I tell you, about their destroying her select party, &c. I can't tell you how
                  she did go on. She told them that wine wouldn't be a guest at her parties any
                  more."
               "Good!" exclaimed Frank; "if she only keeps her word; but that's among the
                  doubtful things, I imagine. I am really glad, Kate, that they commenced with me.
                  It is a fine thing, my sister, to have a principle, and then to make it the
                  foundation of one's action. Here, I apprehend, is the great misfortune: too many
                  make their principle a matter of convenience, and they can put it into their
                  heads, their hearts, or their pockets, as the case may be; and then their
                  principle is never found interfering with their desires or their interests. But
                  something rich occurred there this evening. As soon as I went in, I found myself
                  seated by old Uncle Peter, the identical old Irishman who used to drive a dray for
                  father, about fifteen years ago. I recollect him very well. He is mighty
                  consequential in these days. He says he is rich, and I thought some accident of
                  that kind must have overtaken him, or he would not have been there; and I
                  shouldn't have been much surprised if we should be invited to his house to drink
                  wine before long. The old man took it upon himself to charge me straitly not to be
                  a minister—not even to think of it, and that I should not be too familiar with the
                  'old book,' as he called it. I have no doubt, Kate, that he would have taken wine
                  quick enough. I did not like to hear that old man talk so lightly of that book.
                  But it is hard on this rum business, and those who are in favor with the one are
                  but little in favor with the other. Those whose lives are governed by the precepts
                  of the Bible are armed against temptation. The rumseller's angel may
                  offer them the world, and they will withstand it. To such persons, virtue may ever
                  cling for protection. They are in no danger of becoming drunkards. They will not
                  leave widows to weep over the graves of drunkard husbands; nor children who will
                  be ashamed of their memory. Kate, I should like to see Dick Wilson. That portrait
                  is himself, exactly. I think it very strange that he has ceased to correspond with
                  me entirely. We were intimate friends at college, and he was a noble fellow, too.
                  I do not think I ever knew such a generous-hearted young man, and I should like to
                  know how he succeeds with the temptations to intemperance, which must necessarily
                  have surrounded his path. He has had to contend with misfortune, and it is more
                  the fault of his parents than his own. His home education was not what it ought to
                  have been. His mother is an excellent woman, but she was so pressed by the
                     continued calls of fashion, that she
                  was robbed of those precious hours to which her children, before all others, had a
                  claim—those hours for which you, my sweet sister, and myself can never be
                  sufficiently thankful. My mind has often been puzzled to know if, after all, there
                  are not many parents who care but little about their children. If they loved them
                  as they ought to love them, they would certainly be unwilling to send them out
                  into the world without that priceless treasure—home preparation.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               RUMSELLERS.—CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES.
               
                  
                     
                        "Whose mind can tell what the heart must feel,
                        That is doomed to die by the rumseller's steel."
                     
                  
               
               If Dick Wilson now felt, in all its bitterness, the dire results which flow from
                  intemperance, he had at least been spared the painful ordeal through which those
                  results are commonly attained. If his father had fallen a victim, and his family
                  been beggared, the result had come to him quickly, without many of those harrowing
                  concomitants which are usual in such cases. He had, in the history of his own
                  misfortunes, been spared the cheerless view of the progress of
                  intemperance. He had not seen, week by week and month by month, the inroads which
                  it was slowly but surely making into his beloved home, or marked the progressive
                  yet fearful ravages it was making upon him whose name he bore. His
                  experience of the evils of rum-bibbing and rumselling had been indeed severe—as
                  much so as he felt himself able to endure. Yet they had been too circumscribed in
                  their range to give him a just view of the aggregate enormity of the evil, or to impress him with just views
                  of its causes, or of the proper remedies.
               He thought, as many now think, that these results were in certain cases
                  unavoidable; that it was the destiny of some to be victims, and that, though the
                  consequences were deplorable in the extreme, still nothing could be done to
                  prevent them. Yet the change in his own circumstances, which had driven him from
                  those plans which he had intended to pursue, and forced him to take up his
                  residence in the village of B——, was rapidly changing his views, and showing him
                  clearly the dangerous tendency of his former opinions. In that village he had a
                  fine opportunity to witness the various manœuvres of those who were attached to
                  the rum interest, either by sympathy or by being dependent upon it for support. In
                  a village, all that is going on is generally known to its inhabitants, and there
                  are here no dark, secluded dens, into which the rumseller can thrust his victims,
                  and hide from the public gaze the evidence of the ills of the pernicious traffic.
                  Unfortunately for the village to which Dick had resorted, while it contained many
                  excellent citizens, it also contained a large number of rumsellers, and many who
                  sympathized with them in their pernicious employment. To the countenance and
                  influence of the latter, was the rum interest indebted for its
                  profitableness—indeed for its very existence here. There were many of them men of
                  wealth, and of good reputation among their neighbors. Their opinions were
                  respected, and they were among the first in seeking political preferments and
                  honors; and "help me and I will help you," was the maxim which governed them in
                  their intercourse with the rum interest. With Judge L—— for a leader, and the
                  crime-polluted Stevens for a companion, they were prepared to look with
                  complacency upon all the ills and evils which are inseparable from the rum
                  traffic, and quiet their own reflections with the pottage which their votes and
                  favor might give. In whatever might be attempted by the friends of temperance, to
                  diminish the sale and use of intoxicating drinks in the village, these men were
                  found strongly opposed, and were ever ready and prompt in argument to maintain the
                     constitutional, inalienable and natural rights of
                  those who chose to do so, to sell rum; and whatever the consequences might be, it
                  was not the fault of the wiley tempter, who held out the gilded lure,
                  but of the luckless wight who suffered himself to be enticed to his ruin.
               Dick Wilson, surrounded, as he was, by what to him appeared a new existence,
                  frequently suffered his thoughts to wander to his desolated home, and to picture
                  to himself its sadness. Unbidden it would rise before him. A mother in rags and in
                  wretchedness, lifting her streaming eyes to heaven, invoking God to send
                  deliverance! He seemed to hear the faint scream—almost the death-shriek of the
                  starving child, whose soul and body seemed to be engaged in rending the ties by
                  which they were held in their
                  mysterious union, and thus escape the cruelties of the destroyer. But Dick's image
                  of a drunkard's home did not depart.
               He was just rising to close the office, when a person whom he had frequently met
                  in the street, entered. For a moment he looked at Dick, and then seated himself.
                  There was, to Dick, in the person of this individual, at that moment, something
                  surpassingly amiable. His plain drab coat, round-breasted, according to the
                  fashion that has passed away, his broad-brimmed hat; his white cravat, with his
                  collarless shirt, and care-worn yet calm expression of countenance, pointed him
                  out to be, what Dick knew he was—a Methodist minister, of the old pioneer stamp.
                  After a few common-place remarks, the old gentleman said to him:
               "Mr. Wilson, your countenance had a very strange expression when I entered, and it
                  is not yet entirely gone."
               "Yes, sir," said Dick, "I feel so at times."
               "There must have been a fearful picture in your mind, Mr. Wilson, to have left
                  such an expression on your countenance."
               "Well," said Dick, "it may surprise you a little, but I have been trying all the
                  evening to put together, in my own mind, the picture of a drunkard's home. It is a
                  gloomy subject, sir,—one upon which peculiar circumstances only could compel me to
                  linger for a moment. I think it appeared to my imagination even more vivid than
                  the sad reality itself."
               "Then you think you have succeeded, Mr. Wilson, in painting that most horrid and
                  revolting picture?"
               "I do, sir," replied Dick.
               "Then you have done what our artists have not been able to accomplish. You have
                  painted a drunkard's home? Oh! no, sir, you have not done that. It
                  cannot be painted upon the earth. Where did you put the soul?"
               "I was only trying to paint an earthly picture," said Dick.
               "Where did you paint the rumseller?" continued the old man.
               "Nowhere," said Dick, trying to smile. "I would not have his countenance on one of
                  my pictures: it would mar it."
               "Yes, truly it would, Mr. Wilson. It mars and degrades
                  every thing it touches. The universe of God is less beautiful and harmonious than
                  it would be, were there no rumsellers. They are doing harm everywhere; and if the
                  evening were not so far spent, I would paint the double picture of a rumseller and
                  a drunkard's home, as I have seen them together. I understand, Mr. Wilson, you are
                  from P——," said the old gentleman.
               "That is my native place," said Dick.
               "I was once acquainted there," said the old minister, and then added—"Do you know
                  anything of a gentleman of your name, who was a merchant there?"
               
               "I did know such a person," said Dick, with an involuntary sigh.
               "Ah!" said the old man, "I knew him well when he was a boy, and often have I seen
                  him sporting in glee on the banks of the Delaware. Many a time have I enjoyed the
                  hospitality of his father; and although our religious views were different, yet
                  they were excellent people, and I spent many pleasant hours with them. They passed
                  away many years since, and from a brother, who tarried with me last night, I
                  learned that Mr. Wilson, their son, who had established himself in P—— as a
                  merchant, had died at the hands of the rumseller, and I was sorry, very sorry, to
                  hear it."
               "Yes, sir," said Dick, "that was my father." The old man started in
                  surprise, and said:
               "And you are the son of Richard Wilson, and one of the heirs of his
                  deep misfortune and disgrace."
               "Yes, sir," said Dick, "I am, and I feel it every day."
               "Well, young man," he replied, "I am glad that I have found you out. But you have
                  come to a very bad place. Many a young man has perished and lost every thing by
                  coming here; and still rumselling is continued here, and the annual sacrifice of
                  health, life, property, and the peace and comfort of families, goes on
                  undiminished. I have talked with most of the rumsellers here; but whatever they
                  may have been when they commenced this business, it soon blinded their eyes, and
                  hardened their hearts, so that they could neither see nor feel the mischief they
                  were doing. I have gone into a bar-room, when it was filled to overflowing with
                  men who were merry over the maddening bowl, and when women and children were
                  trying to tear away husbands and fathers from this vortex of ruin, and then I have
                  remonstrated with the rumseller, and his only reply was—'I violate no law, and if
                  I should stop, others would continue the same business.' I have asked them if God
                  would be satisfied with this answer, and I was once answered, by a poor fellow who
                  has since gone to his account—and miserably too—'It will be some time before I am
                  called upon to settle that account.' You will have to move here with great
                  caution, Mr. Wilson, or you will regret your coming to this place."
               The old gentleman said that it was past nine o'clock, and was making a motion to
                  depart, when Dick said to him:
               "If it is not too late for you to do so, I should be very glad to hear from you
                  your history of a rumseller and of a drunkard's home. I am here in the midst of
                  them, and anything that will tend to increase my fear of these men, will be of
                  service to me."
               The old gentleman was on his feet, ready to leave, but as Dick concluded, he
                  seated himself; and without promising to do so, he seemed for a moment to give
                  himself up to reflection. Dick was watching and admiring the calm, dispassionate
                  movement of every muscle in his face,
                  when the old gentleman broke the silence, and commenced by saying—
               "Mr. Wilson, fifteen years ago I was located in this place. It was then just about
                  what it is now. So far as the improvement of the village is concerned, there are
                  more religious people here now than there was at that time. I became acquainted
                  with a young man, in the prime and vigor of life. He was not what may be called
                  rich, yet his circumstances were very comfortable, and his prospects were
                  exceedingly fair. I became very much attached to him, and I had every reason to
                  think that it was fully reciprocated. During the early part of my first year in
                  this place, I was called on to perform the marriage ceremony for him, which I did.
                  His father died soon after, and left him a very handsome property, two miles from
                  this place, and every one who knew him said that he would do well. I spent two
                  years here, in an almost continual state of warfare with the rumsellers, who were
                  so intent on breaking up every thing which might exert a restraining influence
                  upon their trade, that they would employ boys to run horses by the
                  door of the church on Sabbath days. This has often been done by them. At the end
                  of two years I was removed to another field, but subsequently returned here. When
                  I came back I saw nothing of George Handy, and thought strange that he did not
                  come to see me. A few days after my return, in conversation with a gentleman, I
                  expressed my surprise that I had seen nothing of George, as he was familiarly
                  called.
               "'Ah,' said the gentleman, 'poor George is ruined! Our rumsellers
                  have overcome him; and Smith, at the Corner, has a mortgage of his whole
                  property.'
               "'How is this?' I quickly inquired. 'George Handy ruined already! How
                  does it come?'
               "'God only knows,' he replied; 'the people here can't understand it. But then, it
                  is true. It does not astonish me much; for our rumsellers, with Judge L—— to aid
                  them, have done many similar deeds.'
               "One day, soon after this conversation, I was walking along the street, and
                  happened to see George, just entering Smith's bar-room. I immediately followed
                  him, and heard Smith say, 'If you have no money, you can't have a drop of
                     whiskey! If you have any thing about your house that I can use, I
                  will exchange you whiskey for it.'
               "'You have all my property already!' said Handy.
               "'You have had pay for it,' said Smith.
               "'In what?' inquired George.
               "'That is no matter, Handy,' replied Smith, in an angry manner; 'I have the
                  mortgage, and that is the evidence that you have received value for it.'
               "'Do give me something to drink, Mr. Smith,' said George.
               "'Not a drop without the money, and for that you can have just as much as you
                  want.'
               
               "'George,' said I, 'come with me,' and he started in a moment. I suppose he knew
                  my voice, and as soon as he saw me he walked up to me, saying—
               "'Mr. Shepard, this is not George Handy!—George Handy has been in the grave nearly
                  a year. Oh no, sir, this ain't the image that God made! This ain't the young man
                  over whom, and his smiling bride, you exercised such tender care! This,' said he,
                  trying to straighten himself, 'is a poor, miserable thing, which the rumsellers
                  here have made, and this is the place of my ruin.'
               "'None of your lying here, George,' said Smith.
               "'I am not lying,' said George; 'you know what you have done, and God, and my poor
                  wife, know what you have done.'
               "I asked him how his wife was, and where she was.
               "'Her health is very poor,' said he, 'and it will never be better. She is yet in
                  our old house, but God only knows how soon this man will drive us out of it, and
                  then, if death, which would be a mercy to both of us, and to our little girl, does
                  not come, I don't know what will become of us. The thought of the poor-house makes
                  me shudder.'
               "'I asked him to go home with me, and he refused to do so, saying,'I can not see
                  Mrs. Shepard, and I tried to keep out of your way.'
               "I saw that Smith was very angry, but he did not wish to commence an encounter, in
                  which he feared he might be worsted. I was well satisfied that he hated me as
                  perfectly as I despised his wickedness, and I was quite sure that he had robbed
                  George, in a way which was more dishonorable than the direct theft of his estate
                  would have been. I told George that he had better leave with me. He came to the
                  door, and then stopped, saying—
               "'You won't ask me to go home with you, Mr. Shepard?'
               "I told him that I should be glad to have him go, but that I would not insist, if
                  he did not wish to go. I parted with him then, and without telling him I had made
                  up my mind to ride up to his house in the morning, and see if the ruin could in
                  any way be repaired. From what I saw of George, I feared that it was hopeless. He
                  said he was in the grave, and I thought it was true; and only the
                     power that raised Lazarus could raise him again.
               "As soon as I entered his house, the next morning, my heart was chilled. There sat
                  his wife, wrapt in the pale quiet melancholy of a broken heart. My entrance was to
                  all appearance unnoticed, and yet she was looking me full in the face. At length
                  she said—
               "'Mr. Shepard, I am glad to see you. Do not be frightened; all that you see is a
                  reality—there is no mockery about it. Poor George has been crushed to pieces under
                  the iron hoof of the rumseller, and every thing is gone. Oh! if I
                  only knew that sweet child was provided for, said she, pointing to a little girl,
                  a little more than two years of age, 'I should die in peace.'
               
               "I asked her where George was, and told her that I would be glad to see him.
               "'I can't tell,' said she; 'perhaps the poor fellow saw you coming, and if he did,
                  he will not come in until you are gone.'
               "I asked her if I should read a portion of scripture, and pray with her, to which
                  she assented; and after which I took my leave, with feelings such as I never
                  experienced before. For several days after this I was confined to the house by
                  indisposition; and during this time I found it almost impossible to think of
                  anything but poor George and his wife. About the middle of the third day the
                  sheriff called on me, and informed me that George Handy wished to see me. I was
                  startled at this announcement, coming from the sheriff, and immediately inquired
                  where I could find him.
               "'In prison, sir,' was the reply, 'and his heart is almost broken.'
               "'For what?' I inquired.
               "'Well, sir, I believe it is a matter of debt. Smith, the rumseller, has worked
                  himself into George's fine property, and no one believes that he did it honestly;
                  and this does not appear to satisfy him.'
               "'Do you know how much his claim against George is? I mean the claim for which he
                  has been imprisoned.'
               "'I believe it is about two dollars. Smith says he can afford to pay his board,
                  and that he intends to keep him there until he gets to be an honest
                  man!'
               "'Has George no friends here,' I inquired, 'who would do this much for him?'
               "'I think, sir,' said the sheriff, 'that but very few know it; and I do not think
                  Smith wishes it to be known.'
               "I rose, and taking from my drawer the money, which I could but poorly afford to
                  spare, and most of all to a rumseller—hastened to the prison, and was at once
                  conducted into the part where George was confined. He rose to meet me, saying,
               "'Mr. Shepard, you never expected to meet me in a prison, where none but
                     felons should ever be confined.'
               "I told him at once that he must come out, and that I had come to take him
                  out.
               "'Oh, no, Mr. Shepard!' said he, 'you cannot afford to pay the claims of
                  rumsellers against me. I would rather remain here, for my poor wife is dying at
                  home with a broken heart, and I cannot endure the sight.'
               "I took him by the hand, and told him that he must come with me; that the
                  scoundrel who had robbed him of his property, his health, and the peace and
                  happiness of his family, should not now, for the mere sum of two
                     dollars, be permitted to degrade him farther. I walked home with him,
                  and as soon as we entered, he said:
               "'Well, Mary, the cup is nearly full. I have been two nights in the county prison, on a
                  rumseller's claim.'
               "She leaped from her seat when the arrow, for which she seemed to be waiting,
                  pierced her heart, and throwing her arms about his neck, exclaimed:
               "'Poor George! poor George!—it is all over.'
               "Reason had, in the keen agony of that moment, sought a shelter in the gloomy
                  night of insanity, from which she never recovered. She is sleeping in the
                  church-yard. George—and you have seen him often in the street—is also the victim
                  of insanity, and an inmate of the poor-house; and their little daughter I brought
                  home myself, and she is with us yet—a beautiful and lovely girl. Mr. Smith, the
                  rumseller, has had his triumph. God's justice will yet have its triumph!"
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               PRACTICAL SYMPATHY.—DIFFERENCE IN CHARACTER.
               
                  
                     
                        "True dignity is hers, whose tranquil mind
                        Virtue has raised above the things below;
                        Who, every hope and fear to Heaven resigned,
                        Shrinks not, though fortune aim her deadliest blow."
                     
                  
               
               THERE is no other desolation which, for the gloom and cheerlessness by which it is
                  pervaded, can compare with that which the rumseller can make. He, more than any
                  other agency, distributes, with a wanton liberality, the bitterest
                     curses which can be mingled with the cup of human life, and before
                  which its richest hopes and tenderest associations are crushed.
               Some time had elapsed since Dick Wilson, to his little but beloved household, had
                  said good-bye; and to persons feeling, as they did, the effect of the dire
                  consequences which the rum traffic had gathered around them, there was nothing to
                  give wings to time. So far as the consolations of this world were concerned, it
                  was sadness and loneliness when he left, and excepting the kindness of a very few,
                  it was sadness and loneliness still.
               
               During the afternoon, little Harry had been scampering about with more apparent
                  pleasure than he had felt since they entered that house; and like children of his
                  age, his conversation, which was rambling, embraced many things which touched Mrs.
                  Wilson and her daughter to the heart. Often they would respond to his childish
                  simplicity with the "deep-fetched" sigh and an apparent smile, when it would have
                  been more in consonance with their hearts to have answered with a tear.
               Now this child of misfortune was sleeping, and his little sorrows, if his tender
                  heart knew any, were sleeping with him. Mrs. Wilson was reverently engaged in
                  reading, as for several months she had been accustomed to do, at stated intervals,
                  from the word of God; and Eliza was stting by her side, with her cheek pressed
                  close to her mother's. When Mrs. Wilson had finished, she said to Eliza:
               "My child, God is closing the history of another day, and oh, what heart-burnings
                  have this day ascended up, to claim a record, which shall await the judgment of
                  the great day."
               "Yes, my dear mother," said Eliza, as she approached the little window where,
                  perhaps, from other hearts, many a bitter sigh had been breathed into the ear of
                  God—"yes, my dear mother, the draymen who live on this street are beginning to
                  return from the toils of the day, to spend their hours of rest in the society of
                  their poor families. Mother, we know something about the joys of home— its
                  pleasures, its holiness, its love. Oh, mother! if God shall judge the rumseller
                  and his friends according to their criminality—according to the wrongs and the
                  outrages which they are daily committing—how withering will that judgment be! How
                  sweetly little Harry sleeps, mother. He does not appear to have any realization of
                  trouble. See how sweetly he smiles; nothing disturbs his calm, dreamy life. His
                  little lips move and quiver, as if angels—the spirits of little children, young
                  and lovely as himself—had come down to bear him company. I wonder if he has any
                  idea of his present situation, or of what he has lost! I hope he has not. Don't
                  you think, mother, he looks like father and Dick very much?"
               "Yes, my child, I do. I never look at him without seeing the image of your father.
                  Have you any idea, my child, who it was that purchased your father's and my
                  portrait, at the sale of our property?"
               "No, mother," replied Eliza, "I have not. When those precious things were brought
                  out, and handed to the auctioneer, Dick and myself left the window: we could not
                  look on while those images of those dear to us were being disposed of in that
                  manner."
               "Well, my child, I do think that was cruel. I care nothing for my own, only for
                  the sake of you and your brother; but your father's portrait I would like to have
                  kept, and one would think that respect for the dead would have deterred any one
                  from attempting to remove it. I have no doubt, my child, that at this moment they may be gracing the
                  parlor of some one of those rumsellers who have ruined us. If any respectable
                  person had purchased them, Mrs. Livingston would have known it."
               "My dear mother, don't let this grieve you. I hope poor Dick will soon be able to
                  find them, and purchase them back for us. We are wounded deep enough already,
                  without permitting these precious mementos of the living and the dead, to grace
                  such a place as that."
               "Eliza," said Mrs. Wilson, "you must write to Dick to-morrow. Cheer him up as much
                  as possible. Tell him, when you write, that the old minister comes often, and that
                  his conversation is just what we need. Tell him that Mrs. Livingston and Mrs.
                  Eagleson are remarkably kind and attentive to us. And don't forget to tell him
                  that little Harry talks much about him. These things, my child, will encourage him
                  very much. They will tend to strengthen him against temptation, and this is
                  necessary, for his path is filled with peril, and the cheerless inheritance of a
                  drunkard's son will cling with great power to his heart, but not to strengthen it.
                  Now, my child, let us note down every pleasure we may feel, and then, at the
                  beginning of every week, transmit it all to him, and it will do him good, and make
                  him feel happier."
               "Yes, mother," replied Eliza, "if Dick thinks we are happy, he will be happy too.
                  I always write to him in a cheerful manner, and somehow or other, Providence has
                  given me some pleasant thing to tell him every time I have written yet, so that I
                  have almost become selfish in this respect, and am looking for a continuance of
                  the same kindness."
               "Well, my child," replied Mrs. Wilson, "if you look in a right spirit, there is no
                  selfishness about it; but it is the evidence of faith in those precious promises
                  to which, for consolation at this moment, we are deeply indebted. 'Ask and ye
                  shall receive.' How comprehensive that invitation. It is just what we need, and
                  what poor Dick needs as much as we do."
               "Mother," said Eliza, "has it occurred to you, since our misfortunes, how very
                  easy it is to be deceived in persons?"
               "Yes, Eliza," said Mrs. Wilson; "I could hardly, in our situation, be insensible
                  to such reflections. But why, Eliza, have you asked that question?"
               "Well, mother, my mind has been running back. I am afraid, after all, it is more
                  prone to go backward than forward; but I will try to subdue this disposition,
                  except when I want to hold communion with dear Ellen. I have been thinking,
                  mother, of times past, and the changes which have taken place. There was a time in
                  our history, when the slightest indisposition in our family would have called to
                  our door those who, under no imaginable circumstances, would come now. This, I
                  think, is what we have learned,—that it is not what people wear, nor the society
                  in which they move, that gives the true
                  index to their characters. There is Mrs. Livingston and Mrs. Walston—they are both
                  very wealthy. Now, mother, there is Mrs. Walston: I do not think you can remember
                  two days together, for several years, when she has not been at our house. Many an
                  hour, mother, have I listened to her, while she was trying to flatter you in every
                  possible way. At one time she would speak in raptures of father—his wealth—his
                  fine disposition—his brilliant prospects, and so on. Then, she would tell you what
                  a fine boy master Dick was; and then she would turn to poor Ellen and myself; and
                  that dear little fellow lying there in the cradle, has not escaped her
                     praise; for she has said of him that he was the sweetest of all
                  your children. Don't you think, mother, that he is just as lovely this evening as
                  he ever was?"
               "Oh yes! my dear, surely I do."
               "And so do I, mother; but Mrs. Walston don't think so. He is now the heir of
                  poverty, and with her my dear little brother's loveliness is gone! Mrs. Walston,
                  mother, you know, was always dressed in the height of the fashion. No one could
                  recollect to have seen her when she was not. Her great business was to see what
                  was to be seen, and hear what was to be heard. She had always use in this way for
                  her eyes and her ears. She was never known to be in the nursery with her children,
                  when she was able to be out of it: all this business was entrusted to her ignorant
                  domestics. Yourself and Mrs. Walston, mother, used to call me a little girl; but
                  that little girl had her little thoughts, and those little noiseless
                     things said that it was cruel—that she ought not to do so; and that
                  mothers who were faithless to their children could not be expected to be very
                  faithful to out-door friends, only as circumstances dictated. We have not seen her
                  since our affliction; and I apprehend we will never see her in this house. We may
                  chance to meet her in the street, but I hope we shall not, for I am sure that she
                  does not want to see us. If she did, she could easily find us. Now, mother, there
                  is Mrs. Livingston, who is very wealthy. She never knew what it was to want a
                  single thing that money could purchase, and she can be fashionable, too. Indeed,
                  in every respect, she can throw Mrs. Walston into the shade. But then, Mrs.
                  Livingston does not permit these things to take the place of her family in her
                  affections. She has been often at our house; and yet she has hardly been there
                     once for Mrs. Walston's twenty times. But when she
                  did come, her demeanor was always dignified and pleasing, even to children. There
                  was nothing about her to make children dislike her coming, and if she chose to
                  caress them, as she often did, she did not appear, as Mrs. Walston invariably did,
                  as if she was afraid that her fine things would get soiled. This could not very
                  well have been avoided at Mrs. W.'s house; and she seemed to think the same kind
                  of house-keeping prevailed everywhere. Misjudging, mother, is part of our
                  experience, and a thrilling part of it, too; and to me it is a matter of astonishment how, under
                  any circumstances, we could have preferred Mrs. Walston to Mrs. Livingston. When
                  Mrs. Livingston came to our house, she had always about her a mark of true,
                  genuine affection, and she professed to be a Christian of more than mere
                  fashionable style, and I presume no one ever doubted her sincerity. I think that
                  there are places and circumstances in which religion shines with more lustre than
                  it does in the large congregation, and one place is the nursery, when a mother,
                  with a heart full of intelligent, burning love, consecrates herself to her
                  children. When Frank Hamilton was spending a vacation once with Dick, he told us
                  what his mother was in the habit of doing. He said that she spent an hour daily
                  with them in the nursery, and that nothing would tempt her to neglect it; and
                  surely this is a precious retirement, for both mother and children; but of these
                  hours, mother, you were robbed by the tyranny of a morbid fashion, which has
                  mingled itself with the rumseller's doings. For this, Mrs. Livingston was
                  remarkable; and wherever her children are seen, they carry with them their
                  mother's likeness in their faces, and her goodness in their actions. This was Mrs.
                  Livingston's character in the time of our affluence; and now, in our adversity,
                  she is, if possible, still more kind. Ah, how we were deceived! The one lit up the
                  morning of prosperity with a false light; but the other—and she the nobler one—has
                  brought peace to the evening-time ing-time of adversity; and how kind she is to
                  those, of whom poor Dick said, they would be called 'the drunkard's family!'"
               "Eliza," said Mrs. Wilson, "is not that Mrs. Livingston, crossing the street just
                  now?"
               "Yes, surely it is, mother, and she is coming here. What can have brought her out
                  at this late hour? Why, it's almost dark!"
               "Go to the door, quick, Eliza, and let her see that we love her, for indeed she is
                  a lovely woman."
               Eliza had the door open in a moment, and Mrs. Livingston drew near, with a
                  pleasant smile, saying:
               "Good evening, my dear child."
               Ah, that does not grate so harshly—it does not tear so unmercifully—it does not
                  wound every nerve and fiber of the spirit, as does the harsh,
                     ungentlemanly, and unlady-like expression, 'The
                  drunkard's family, or the drunkard's son or daughter.'
               Both were at the door to meet Mrs. Livingston, and as she entered she imprinted a
                  speaking, eloquent kiss upon the cheek of each, and then, walking directly to the
                  cradle, she looked for a moment into the little sleeping face of Harry, and with
                  her kiss she left a tear upon the little fellow's cheek, the sparkle of which
                  seemed to say, 'My poor child, your lot is the hardest!'
               "Mrs. Wilson," said Mrs. Livingston, "this makes my heart sick. I can hardly
                  convince myself that your situation is a reality; and yet, it is too fearfully plain to be a dream. But tell me if
                  there is anything I can do for you, and I hope you will be candid. Throw off all
                  delicacy about these matters, for your change is so severe, I think it would be
                  wrong in you, to wrong yourself by refusing to make known your wants. I assure
                  you, Mrs. Wilson, a reverse of fortune has not lessened my respect for you; and
                  anything I or mine can do, will be cheerfully done. Do, Mrs. Wilson, tell me all,
                  and I will try to sympathize with you, as I ought to do."
               "My dear Mrs. Livingston," said Mrs. Wilson, "you are too kind, too generous
                  already. We are deeply in your debt. In such circumstances as ours, the voice of
                  human kindness is sweet indeed; and I thank you, my hitherto unprised friend, for
                  the generous kindness and tender sympathy with which you have visited us. You have
                  preserved your affections amidst those disastrous circumstances in which others
                  have lost them, and of which loss they seem to be insensible. But, Mrs.
                  Livingston, we are not entirely destitute; and I think, by proper management, we
                  will be able to get along until Dick is admitted to the bar; and then, I hope, our
                  situation will be a more comfortable. That poor boy, Mrs. Livingston, is our only
                  earthly dependence now, and I do most fervently hope that he may be spared to us.
                  It is a great pleasure to us to receive his letters, for he tries in every
                  imaginable way, to make us feel happy. But I am sure, although he is not a child,
                  that his heart many times is sad—that he will often weep himself to sleep in
                  thinking of us. Little Harry is now our great comfort. He has been unusually happy
                  and cheerful this afternoon, and went to sleep earlier than usual. I think, Mrs.
                  Livingston, that there are for us some wise and precious lessons in these
                  afflictions, and particularly so far as my children and their best interests are
                  concerned; and if I am spared, I will try to lay unsparingly in their minds, the
                  foundation of a good and useful life."
               "I hope, indeed," replied Mrs. Livingston, "that you will do this unsparingly. The
                  training of our children, Mrs. Wilson, as mothers, responsible to God, in a
                  fearful sense, is, after all, the great consideration; and here, I apprehend, is
                  the cause in which thousands of both sexes find their ruin, and entail a fearful
                  responsibility upon unfaithful parents. It was the rumseller, Mrs. Wilson, who
                  brought this heavy affliction to your family; and while God, of his mercy, may
                  overrule it for your good. Can he suffer the cruel cause of all this
                  to prosper? Will the rumseller be permitted to go forward in his desolating work,
                  slowly but surely infusing his deadly poison into the heart's blood of the
                  community, and prostrating to the earth his myriads of husbands, fathers, sons?
                  No, no! this cannot be. I tremble even for him, when I reflect that God is just,
                  and that his justice cannot sleep forever. He has thrown a blight upon yourself
                     and your precious children—can he
                  and his escape? If there is an object of pity upon the earth, it is the child whom
                  a callous-hearted rumseller calls his own. To be a drunkard's son, is an
                  inheritance which is only rich in the thick gloom of its insufferable cruelty. But
                  to be a rumseller's son, and wear the impressions of that business; to be assured
                  that one is eating the bread and wearing the clothes which, in justice, belong to
                  those who are starving, and who are in rags! To be conscious that the very things
                  which are making their hearts glad, are making other hearts sorrowful! To be
                  conscious that these things, covetously torn from others, are the price of peace,
                  happiness and life in other homes!—homes which were once lit up by love! Yes, my
                  dear Mrs. Wilson, the rumseller has cursed you with all his fury! But will he
                  enjoy his ill-gotten gain? I think not. Mrs. Wilson, do many of your former
                  friends call on you?"
               "Oh no, Mrs. Livingston; yourself and Mrs. Eagleson, and our old minister, are the
                  only ones who have called."
               "Is it possible, Mrs. Wilson?"
               "Yes, Mrs. Livingston, only three have outlived the storm, as yet: they are all
                  who have come to see us."
               "I feared that this was the case; but let them go. I have no doubt this has
                  disappointed you severely. Let them go, for in their going you lose nothing. These
                  persons have lost more than you have, and when they meet you by accident, a sense
                  of personal inferiority will wring from them the acknowledgment in the
                  truth-telling blush. This is one of those revolutions in which, with what they
                  have lost already, it is almost impossible for self-respect to survive. Some of
                  these persons may live to hear the stern rappings of adversity at their own doors.
                  They may live to see it entering and laying its rude hands upon the domestic and
                  social relations, upon which they are now staying themselves; and if such should
                  be their fortune, I hope they will find that God is more merciful than they are.
                  With some of those amongst your former acquaintances, there is at this moment a
                  much more certain prospect of such a calamity than you had a year since. I do
                  sincerely hope it may not come to them; but they certainly seem to be rapidly
                  drifting to the same dark port. Have you been out any yet, Mrs. Wilson?"
               "I have scarcely crossed the threshold since we came here to live."
               "Now, Mrs. Wilson, remember—I will take no denial—I want yourself and Eliza and
                  little Harry to come and spend the day with us to-morrow. Mr. Livingston will send
                  the carriage for you to-morrow morning by ten o'clock, and you must come; and
                  those extra genteel folks, who suffer the rumseller to break their
                  friendship just when he has broken the heart and the hopes of his victims, will
                  see that I am not ashamed of you, at all events."
               
               "Oh, Mrs. Livingston, do excuse us."
               "I can't, Mrs. Wilson."
               "I would—,"
               "No use; no excuse taken this time. Say yes. What do you say, Eliza? If little
                  Harry were awake, I would be willing to leave it to him."
               "What would the people think, Mrs. Livingston, to see your carriage in this
                  street?"
               "No matter about the people, Mrs. Wilson—say yes, quick."
               "Mrs. Livingston, suffer me to ask you if you intend to have any other
                  company?"
               "I do, Mrs. Wilson. You would have thought it very strange, a few months since, if
                  you had come on a visit to my house, and found no other company."
               "Whom may we expect to meet, Mrs. Livingston?"
               "No person better than yourself, except our old minister—and I call him better
                  than any person else. I have been thinking that I should ask Mrs. Walston. I think
                  it might do her good."
               "Oh, Mrs. Livingston!" exclaimed Eliza, before she could control her feelings—"for
                  our sakes don't ask her."
               Mrs. Livingston looked a little surprised, and then smiling, said:
               "Why not, my sweet child?"
               "I ask your pardon," said Eliza, blushing deeply; "I ought not to have made that
                  remark."
               "Would you rather not meet her, Eliza?"
               "If I had my choice, I would prefer not meeting her; and it is as much on her
                  account as on our own."
               "Well, then, my child, you won't meet her at my house. What makes Donald stay so
                  long?" ejaculated Mrs. Livingston, as she turned to look out of the window. "Yes,
                  he is coming at last. Just let me go to the door for one moment."
               There was something in the name of Donald which brought Mrs. Wilson and Eliza at
                  once to the window, and there they saw the trusty old Scotchman, backing his dray
                  up to the door, and as might be supposed, they were a good deal surprised.
               Mrs. Livingston whispered to Donald not to leave until his load was safely put
                  away.
               "No, madam," replied Donald, "I'll na leave the house until Mistress Wilson ha'
                  all these things put to hand. Ould Donald has seen women alone with poverty
                  before, and he won't do anything that's mean."
               "Why," exclaimed Mrs. Wilson, "what have you been doing, Mrs. Livingston."
               "Not a word of blame, Mrs. Wilson; if there is anything wrong, you must blame my
                  family this time. Don't scold me; you can settle it with them to-morrow. Just let
                  Donald carry these things into the house: it will be a pleasure for him to do
                  so."
               And Donald, smiling and looking happy for the moment, like the rest, said:
               
               "Yes, Mistress Livingston, surely it will be a pleasure to me to do so. Mistress
                  Wilson's done me many a kindness."
               "Here," said Mrs. Livingston, "is a trunk, which you can open, and you will find
                  that it contains all necessary explanation in reference to its contents. When you
                  are through with it, close it up again, and Donald will call for it early in the
                  morning, before the stage starts for B——, and Mr. Livingston will see that every
                  thing in relation to its destination is arranged,"—and bidding them a
                     whole-souled good-night, she left for her home.
               "Mother," said Eliza, "what does this mean?"
               "Don't you recollect, my child, that you said a little while since that Providence
                  seemed to give you some good news to tell Dick every time you wrote to him?"
               "Well, mother, God is good! How kind his counsels are, after all. I will believe
                  him now, more than ever."
               "My daughter," said Mrs. Wilson, "we must see what is to be done with this trunk,
                  as it will be called for early in the morning. Light a candle, my child, and move
                  softly, so that you do not disturb Harry."
               In a few moments the trunk was opened, and on an examination they found it to
                  contain a number of articles for themselves and Harry, and the remainder for Dick.
                  In a package, marked 'from Mr. Livingston,' they found the material
                  for an elegant mourning dress, such as is worn by the better class; and in a slip
                  of paper in the inside, they found fifty dollars in gold, with this inscription
                  upon the paper—'The rumseller can't take this.'
               Eliza found a similar package, marked, 'from Lucy Livingston'—and
                  there was one for little Harry, marked, 'from Master Tommy
                     Livingston;' and then a good many little affairs, not marked at all.
               Dick's portion was a fine one—enough to fit him out in the best style, and
                  contained more than a sufficient amount of money to defray all expenses of making
                  up. Mrs. Wilson understood that it was not the wish of Mr. Livingston that Dick
                  should know the donor, and propriety, rather than a desire, induced them to keep
                  it from him.
               After the whole cargo, trunk, provisions, and so on, had been examined and
                  arranged, Mrs. Wilson said to Eliza:
               "My daughter, God is on the side of the afflicted; and if most of our former
                  friends were willing to abandon us, and leave us at the mercy of the rumseller,
                  let us thank him that he has kept a few for us, and best of all, that he is our
                  friend."
               After offering up a fervent prayer, in which Dick was feelingly remembered, these
                  weary ones retired to rest—rest, sweeter and more refreshing than the rumseller
                  can ever know.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VIII.
               NEW HOME.—ITS CHARACTER.—ITS DANGERS.
               
                  
                     
                        "Yet turn, ye wanderers, turn your steps aside,
                        Nor trust the guidance of that faithless light,
                        For watchful, lurking 'mid th' unrustling reed,
                        At those murk hours the wily monster lies."
                     
                  
               
               THE office of a country lawyer is generally an admirable index of the community by
                  which it is surrounded. In a good and well regulated community, a lawyer, as well
                  as all others, is permitted to have a portion of his time to himself, in which he
                  may meditate upon his own and his clients' interests. When the
                  community is of a different character—idle, inquisitive, and ignorant—attending to
                  all matters but such as strictly concern themselves, and especially if there be a
                  surplus of rumsellers or rumbibbers there—a lawyer's office becomes a mere haunt
                  of idlers.
               Here we find Dick Wilson for the first time since we left him at his mother's
                  door, with the good-bye trembling on his lips.
               The community, into the bosom of which Dick had come, was far from being what it
                  should have been. The social influences which surrounded him here were
                  unfavorable, though we find him in the office of one of the best lawyers of the
                  place. In this office, on the evening of his arrival, we find him sitting alone in
                  the shades of the gathering twilight, and dwelling with absorbing interest upon
                  the marked contrast between his present and his former home. Twilight is the hour
                  for contemplation. Then it is, as the eye of day closes and shuts out the images
                  of the external world, that the thoughts rush home from their varied wanderings,
                  and dwell with concentrated energy upon those scenes in our own history which are
                  the most impressive. Thoughts of home, sweet, sweet home, and of loved ones at
                  home, were consecrating that hour at the shrine of affection. Thoughts of home—a
                  mother, a sister, and a little infant brother, from whom this poor boy was
                  separated by the cheerless hand of poverty—had a claim, endorsed by nature, upon
                  that hour!
               He knew that at that hour they were sending forth their thoughts—the angelic
                  messengers of their hearts—freighted with love to meet his own, and together, upon
                  some intervening mountain cliff, to hold there the feast of love and sadness. And
                  it might be that a mother's and a sister's prayers were also ascending up to
                  heaven in his behalf—for the twilight hour is as sacred to prayer as it is to the
                  cherished recollections of earth.
               What a holy thing that prayer is, when it rises from the smouldering ruins of a broken heart, to
                  pour its wants into the attentive ear of Heaven! How pure it is, when it goes up
                  for a beloved one, and how mighty it is too—for, 
                     
                        "Prayer ardent opens heaven—lets down
                        A stream of glory on the consecrated hour
                        Of man, in audience with the Deity."
                     
                  
               
               Dick Wilson had now been several months from home, and although he was not more
                  than one hundred miles from it, yet from the morning he left he had not been
                  there.
               Do you think, my friend, that he had lost his love of home? Do not chide this
                  young man with indifference, for it were cruelty to do so. Remember, he was poor,
                  and that poverty has its laws, and they must be obeyed. He was unable to spare the
                  little sum which it would have required to carry him to those, for whose sake more
                  than for his own he was contending with poverty.
               The day to Dick had been one of more than usual gloom, and yet he could not tell
                  why it was so; but ever and anon, on that day, which had been one of a public
                  character, one and another of those young men of the village, with whom he seemed
                  to be a general favorite, would dash by the office where he was sitting alone, in
                  a fine buggy, or mounted on an elegant horse, a cloud of sadness—not of envy, but
                  of genuine sadness—was seen to pass over his features, and then again it would
                  disappear, leaving in its stead a strange though beautiful serenity.
               He was thinking of the time when poverty had not the power to make him a recluse,
                  and banish him from all society, and from all the enjoyments of which a
                  well-filled purse would have enabled him to partake.
               The contrast between his present and former situation deeply affected him. This
                  was not fully appreciated even by those who knew him most intimately. His hopes
                  had been high. He had felt himself equal in position, wealth and talent, to those
                  who now passed him with averted eyes, and reflections upon the change were
                  continually lacerating his feelings. Though poor, he was nevertheless proud; and
                  his sensitive and deeply wounded spirit still clung to his ruined hopes. Better
                  were it otherwise. Better if the rum traffic, while it strikes to the earth the
                  hopes of its victim, should at the same time annihilate all sense of the painful
                  fact.
               Dick's revery was broken suddenly by the entrance of several young men of his
                  acquaintance, but not his most intimate companions.
               "Dick," said Horace Stevens, "you appear gloomy this evening. What the deuce is
                  the matter with you? We have been looking for you out all day. I'm sure a chap
                  with your prospects never ought to be gloomy, and should never keep himself away
                  from the fun and frolic of the day. There is a time for
                  every thing under the sun—so says the 'big book'—and there is just as much a time
                  to spree
                   as any thing else. House myself up in
                  a law office on such days as these? By George, I guess not. It would surprise
                  every body in this village to see me doing such a thing as that; and the case
                  stands about in the same way with these other young gentlemen. 'Birds of a feather
                  flock together'—and so you see we are all here; and I'll tell you we had a round
                  time to-day. What's the matter, Dick? You look blue. Do you feel so?"
               "I do feel rather gloomy this evening," replied Dick, "but I am sure I cannot tell
                  why it is. I do not wish to feel so when I can avoid it, but sometimes a
                  predisposition in this way will get the better of me."
               "Well, Dick, you would have felt a great sight more cheerful this evening, if you
                  had gone with us to the pic-nic to-day. If Squire B—— wanted his office kept open,
                  he ought to have done it himself. We had a glorious time, Dick, and lots of fun.
                  Judge L—— and my old fellow was there, and they got up three sheets
                  in the wind devilish soon after they got there; and I thought in my soul, at one
                  time, that they would have to be carried home. All we wanted, to make a polite
                  finish of it, was a respectable row!"
               "I am surprised to hear that Judge L—— was intoxicated. It is only a few weeks
                  since he pronounced the sentence of death on Edward H——, who murdered his wife and
                  two daughters while he was in a state of intoxication. You all remember what a
                     temperance speech he made on that occasion. I am surprised that a
                  man who holds the position he does, should set such an example."
               "O Lord! Dick, you don't know that old coon as well as we do, or it
                  wouldn't surprise you at all. I question if he has thought of Edward H—— since the
                  sheriff took him out of the court-house, after the sentence of death was
                  pronounced. Dick, do you remember, how sanctimoniously he mouthed the conclusion
                  of the form—"may the Lord have mercy on your soul?" Well, he wasn't
                     overly sober then—I'll be bound, he wasn't. After all, he is just
                  the kind of a chap that's needed here. The rum interest think he is
                     perfection itself; and they ought to think so, for if it wasn't
                  for him, they would soon be mighty scarce here. You see, we have a good many
                  religious people here, and if it was not for Judge L——, the rum interest would
                  scarcely maintain a living existence."
               "I declare, Horace," said Dick, "if these things are really so, the Judge is
                  hardly fit to decide upon anything; but rum, and the law, and the evidence must
                  suffer amazingly in his hands."
               "Well, Dick, let Judge L—— go for this time. Do you know that we have a 'belle'
                  here from New York—a real eastern beauty? She was at the picnic, and she has been
                  as spry as a cricket all the day—part of every thing, and almost the whole of some
                  things! I don't know how the mischief she's heard of you so soon. You had better
                  be scraping acquaintance quaintance
                  pretty quick. There is no time to lose, Dick. I would give my head for her. I tell
                  you, Dick, you would have enjoyed yourself."
               "I suppose I would have enjoyed myself, Horace. At least, I should have put on the
                     appearance."
               "The appearance! Well, Dick Wilson, you're the last fellow I should have shot at,
                  expecting to kill a hypocrite!"
               "I think, Horace, that expression will hardly rank me amongst that class. In every
                  thing, I move under pressure. Tell me who this young lady is, Horace."
               "She is Miss Emma S——, from New York, and is one of the liveliest beauties you
                  ever saw. Why, man, she's an angel, all but the wings! and let me tell you, she
                  intends giving you a chase, and I'm mistaken if it won't be a merry one, too. You
                  must be moving early, Dick; for if you want to catch her, let me tell you, you'll
                  have all kinds of obstacles to contend with; and you had better prepare yourself
                  for it, and don't say that I didn't give you fair warning."
               "Horace," replied Dick, "you can have her with all my heart, and if you think it
                  will make your chances any better than they are, I will give you this moment a
                  quit claim to all my right, title and interest in the beautiful bird. But I won't
                  guaranty the catching. You must look out for that."
               "That will do very well, Dick, to talk about; but she's an archer."
               "That's just what I've been thinking, Horace; and I advise you to approach with
                  all possible caution, and be sure, as you go along, to keep a path open, in case
                  of retreat, for such a thing may be necessary. And further, Horace, if what you
                  say is true, I don't believe that she is worth catching."
               "I tell you, Dick, if what you have said were to reach her ears, you would find
                  yourself in a predicament! I'd like to know what kind of stuff you are made
                  of."
               "I fancy, Horace, it's pretty good. It has stood hardships already. And so far as
                  knowing what I have said is concerned, I have no objection to your telling her, if
                  you will only be thoughtful enough to tell what you said yourself."
               "Yes, indeed! I ain't fool enough for that, Dick."
               "Do you not know, Horace, that it would be very ungentlemanly in you to accuse me
                  before that young lady, with having spoken disrespectfully or unkindly of her,
                  when you have opened every inch of the way? Suppose I should go to Judge L—— and
                  your father, and tell them what you have said about them?"
               "Yes, Dick, I know. My father and Judge L——, (if you don't know it, I will tell
                  you,) 'rule the roost' about these 'diggins.' Come, come, boys, let's be off.
                  Let's go right up to the Judge's," and these worthies started, much to Dick's
                  satisfaction.
               
               The visits of these young gentlemen, who were, for the most part,
                  what may be called well-dressed, poorly-cultivated street-loafers, who seemed to
                  think that wealth would make up for empty heads and bad hearts, with the
                  consequences necessarily flowing from them, rather increased than allayed Dick's
                  sense of sadness. They had rudely broken in upon and scattered the beautiful
                  imagery which, in spite of his depression, he had pictured to himself, and in
                  which again he saw his mother, his sister, and his little Harry, whom he tenderly
                  loved, in the enjoyment of happiness. He threw himself back in his chair, and said
                  to himself:
               "This is strange. These fellows are not in the habit of using such familiarity
                  with me, and they are not by any means amongst my intimate friends either. This
                  gives me a clue to some of Mrs. Watson's hints. I wish I knew what it means. But
                  it is my best plan to be careful. Well, at all events, they can't drive me from my
                  independence: that is something which, in spite of the rumseller, and misfortune
                  too, I have been able to keep, and keep it I will, while there is a single crag to
                  which I am able to cling. If there is treachery in this, I will defy them to move
                  me. If this is their game, it is a pretty cool calculation, and the whole of it is
                  not visible yet."
               When Dick Wilson entered the village of B——, where he designed finishing his legal
                  studies, preparatory to admission to the bar, it was with the consciousness that
                  he was very poor and wholly dependent on his own exertions. This consciousness, if
                  he had been accustomed to poverty, would have been all the safer and better for
                  him; but he was not accustomed to it. Poverty on his shoulders was an
                     awkward fit, and he had never learned those arts which early
                     necessity alone can teach.
               When the stage stopped at B——, to get a new set of horses, as usual, quite a
                  number of those who were in the habit of doing so, collected at the stage office,
                  and remained there until the last horse was hitched, and the last passenger in the
                  stage. Dick was looking on while these things were transpiring, and just as the
                  driver snapped his whip, a rosy-cheeked gentleman cried out:
               "Halloo, driver! you've lost a passenger."
               "I guess not," said the driver, and off he went, flying at the rate of three miles
                  an hour.
               When it was understood that a passenger had been dropped from the stage at B——,
                  many persons flocked to the favored rumseller's quarters to see him, for
                  peradventure it might be some distinguished man; and if all the curious who were
                  fond of rum and strange faces didn't see him, they would have thought themselves
                  behind the times sadly. Dick was considerably annoyed by this demonstration of
                  inquisitiveness, but at once set about finding some employment, the proceeds of
                  which would enable him to pay his boarding and defray contingent expenses. This he
                  was soon able to accomplish, and a day
                  or two found him very comfortably situated in this respect. He had engaged with a
                  gentleman wo was in a large business to keep his books for him, and in this
                  engagement he was exceedingly fortunate. The family to whose acquaintance and to
                  whose confidence very soon this introduced him, was just the kind under whose
                  guardianship a young man like Dick Wilson, or indeed any young man, would, if any
                  where, be safe—a much better and safer place of resort for a young
                     man than the hotel with its bar-room. Dick was not long in
                  making the acquaintance of this excellent family, and then he freely and fully
                  committed to them the history of his and his family's misfortunes; and who does
                  not know how soothing it is to have a few faithful ones to whom the joys and
                  sorrows of the heart may be committed, and where it is certain they will be safe?
                  Here Dick felt that he was safe, and this feeling introduced him at once into the
                  affections of the family, so that in his hours of gloom and despondency he always
                  turned towards their door for sympathy.
               At the end of Dick's soliloquy, where we left him, he found himself in the
                  cheerful sitting-room of Mr. Watson's family, where every thing—children and
                  all—were so well in keeping that he could not but feel that this was something
                  approaching to home. In a moment he found himself surrounded by all the children
                  in the house, for with them he was an especial favorite; and few people are better
                  judges of real goodness of heart than children. Mrs. Watson tried to get them off
                  him, but it wouldn't do: they were accustomed to regard Dick's coming as a
                  holiday, and they would have their fun, let who would scold.
               "Mrs. Watson," said Dick, "do let these children alone. I assure you it is a
                  pleasure to me to have these demonstrations of their innocent affections. The
                  childlike simplicity of life is a lovely thing, and it is a pity that it cannot be
                  preserved through life. Mrs. Watson, I have been afraid that I have intruded
                  myself too much upon your family; but I feel at home in your house, and I know
                  that if I should make an unadvised remark, as I often do, that it will not be
                  echoed from ear to ear under the stealthy garb of a leaky secrecy,
                  until the whole community is in possession of it."
               "We are always glad to see you, Richard," replied Mrs. Watson, "and we hope you
                  will come to our house with as much freedom as you would if it were your mother's.
                  You seem to feel unhappy this evening. What is wrong? Have you received unpleasant
                  news from home?"
               "Oh, no, Mrs. Watson; I had a letter from my sister yesterday, and they are all
                  well, which is all I can expect. Since the death of my father, Mrs. Watson, I have
                  hardly been free from melancholy; and it seems to grow upon me. I have tried time
                  and again to tear myself away from its embrace, but I cannot. There is a mystery
                  about it, for to me even this
                  melancholy at times has an attraction about it, which holds me like a charm."
               "Well, Richard," said Mrs. Watson, while a mother's affection brightened her
                  countenance, "that may be true, but you know that after the natural appetite is
                  satiated by the feast, the rarest delicacies are insipid. I think it is just so
                  with the mind; and a feast of melancholy, while it is unsafe and unnourishing,
                  will render substantial food unpalatable, and at last itself will turn into a
                  naseous insipidity. It was so with Lord Byron. He feasted upon melancholy, and the
                  wild strains of his Alpine song, as it mingled with the roar of the cataract, and
                  chimed with the screams of the eagle, are the evidences of the power by which it
                  had been a prisoner. He feasted upon its poison, until every fire which burned at
                  the source of that lofty genius went out in gloom. This, Richard, is the history
                  of a cherished melancholy, and it is possible that we may cherish it with the very
                  breath by which we think we are trying to expel it. But few of those who have
                  given themselves over to its companionship, have ever been able to give a good
                  reason for doing so. Be assured that it is begotten in the mind by an evil genius
                  for an evil purpose, and Eugene Aram and Lord Byron are fearful evidences of its
                  ulterior consequences. I would advise you to break away, if it is possible, from
                  that which will overcast with gloom the brightest vision your imagination can
                  conceive. A little poison may be good for the system at times, but too much will
                  kill—a little melancholy may be good for the mind at times, but too much will ruin
                  it. You have told me, in the history of your troubles, that your education from
                  the nursery was rather fashionable than religious. This is your great misfortune,
                  and it has been the misfortune and the ruin of many thousands. What shall that be
                  called which robs the child of its priceless birthright? What name
                  does that omission wear which fails to do what reason and
                     revelation imperatively command? So far as your worldly prospects
                  are concerned, I am sure you have no reason to be cast down. Your winter is nearly
                  passed by, I hope, and the joyful spring-time is near at hand. It is true that
                  your earthly prospects have been wickedly and wantonly blighted by the
                  rumseller,—the all of earthly competency upon which yourself and your loved ones
                  were dependent, is in the pockets of those who more than murdered your father, and
                  with whom God will yet reckon! You have had domestic afflictions of the severest
                  character. The home of your childhood has been broken up by a most
                     wicked robbery. Your dead have been buried out of your sight, and
                  the cold damp grave encloses their forms. You will see them no more. Beware of
                  that monster through whose influence this tempest of desolation has
                  been brought to your door. Fly from it and its smooth-tongued
                  abettors as you would from the very
                  gates of destruction! Why, Richard, you ought not to feel gloomy. Just see what
                  you have to live for—and you have a prospect very soon of having your dear ones
                  with you."
               "Mrs. Watson, my sadness is more for them than for myself," replied Dick.
               "I know that, Richard, but why should it be so? Your talents and education, with
                  your amiable disposition, will bring you a reputation and a fortune at any bar.
                  You have many warm friends here, who will do any thing for you that may be
                  necessary. But I will forewarn you—and I do this for your greater safety—that
                  there are some who appear to be your friends in your presence, and whom it would
                  be very unsafe for you to trust too far. These persons have been trying, and they
                  will still try, to accomplish your ruin. They are not particular how they do it—to
                  accomplish it is the end; and any means which promises to bring it about will be
                  unscrupulously used."
               "Ah! is this possible, Mrs. Watson?"
               "Yes, I know it to be the case, and my husband and myself have talked much about
                  it, and concluded that it would be best to put you on your guard against
                  them."
               "Do you know the cause, Mrs. Watson?"
               "Well, Richard, in the first place, all the rumsellers in the place but one are
                  your enemies, and only, I presume, because you do not frequent their
                  bar-rooms!"
               "Well, Mrs. Watson, that is no loss—that's a clear gain, and I am just that much
                  safer; and if the other one, who in some respects is a pretty clever fellow, hated
                  me to, then I should consider myself safe. Mrs. Watson, I need not explain, but it
                  is not a strange thing that the drunkard's son should himself become a
                     drunkard!"
               "Well Richard, that reason, in connection with a spirit of jealousy, is all that I
                  know."
               "This," replied Dick, "is hardly a sufficient ground of action against a young man
                  who is as poor as I am, and who has such responsibilities as mine."
               "Meanness, vice, and duplicity, Richard, always act without a reason,
                  and hence it is that so much of their action is in the dark. There is Horace
                  Stevens—you must watch that young man narrowly, as well as the few who associate
                  with him. He has, as you have no doubt learned, been raised in this place, or
                  rather he has grown up here. His father is one of our wealthy men;
                  but if you should ask him how and where he accumulated his wealth, he would be
                  ashamed to tell you. He has become very proud now, and thinks, I have no doubt,
                  that his gold-headed cane and spectacles will dazzle people's eyes so
                  much, that they will not look to see where these things came from. I will tell you
                  something about him. He accumulated his fortune in that 'old stone house' where
                  black Jim's family live now, and it was one of the worst places within many miles
                  of this place; and twenty years ago the
                  better part of this community thought himself and his family unfit to live in
                  civilized society. Most of his family perished by intemperance! Yes, that same
                     proud, ignorant man, whom you will now meet flourishing his cane
                  in the street, has been the cause of more tears, and griefs, and the loss of more
                  lives in this community, than all other causes combined; and he is strongly
                  suspected of having committed murder with his own hand. About twenty-five years
                  since, a drover mysteriously disappeared from his house, and there is but little
                  doubt but he knows all about it. His son Horace, as might be expected, is
                  worthless. His father and Judge L., together, have managed to make him a lawyer,
                  and he intends opening an office here again, as he has several times before in the
                  course of three or four years; and he regards your prospect of opening an office
                  here as prejudicial to his interests; and the fact is, Richard, the poor fellow
                  knows no more about law than my little Willie does."
               "Do you think, Mrs. Watson, that Judge L—— is in this matter?"
               "I think he is, Richard; it is amongst the kind of people with whom he always
                  acts, and it would be a strange thing if he should forsake the rumsellers and
                  their pets now."
               "Well, Mrs. Watson, do you know a young lady who is visiting at Judge L——'s, from
                  New-York."
               "Oh, yes, Richard, I know her very well—have you seen her?"
               "I have not, but Horace Stevens called on me this evening, and spoke of her."
               "I hope, Richard, you said nothing that will flatter her; for she will hear every
                  word you said, and probably more."
               "I rather think, Mrs. Watson, she won't call it flattery. I must go. I feel better
                  than I did when I came in. But I must call again, and hear the history of the
                  drover. Mrs. Watson, If I do rise, and get the better of poverty, treachery, and
                  the rumseller, I will ever remember with gratitude your family; and if I fall—for
                  I feel the possibility of this every day; for I once loved wine, and drank it
                  freely—then let my memory sleep in the grave!"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IX.
               TEMPERANCE MEETING AND ITS RESULTS.
               
                  
                     
                        "Sirs, ye know that by this craft
                        We have our wealth."
                     
                  
               
               THE rumsellers at B—— were thrown into great perplexity and consternation when
                  they heard that on the previous Sabbath Mr. Smith, the minister, had the boldness
                  to announce that on the following Wednesday there would be a meeting, to take into
                  consideration the best means of lessening the evils of intemperance in the place.
                  Such things had been attempted there before, but, unfortunately, the
                     craftsmen had generally managed to break them up in some way or
                  other, so that little, if any, benefit resulted from them. This time the matter
                  had been well considered by a few before it was made public, and for that occasion
                  they had the promise, from a very eminent lawyer at a distance, that he would be
                  present; and when this was understood, their consternation was greatly increased.
                  They did not like this impudent lawyer, as they called him, and they
                  were afraid of his influence and his speech, which they knew would be a plain one,
                  if he should come; and many of them hoped that something would occur to prevent
                  his coming.
               Mr. Stevens and Judge L——, the one superannuated, and the other no better, were
                  seen, during the whole of the afternoon on Monday, chasing the streets. Early on
                  Tuesday morning the same thing was visible. The rumsellers were all
                  at their doors. Their ostlers and boot-blacks seemed to
                  have a holiday, and their masters were watching the signs of the times. The
                  rumsellers were in a wonderful state of excitement, and in their imaginations,
                  already they saw the sixpences, whose jingle was more familiar to
                  them than any thing but profanity, sliding noiselessly into an honorable
                  channel.
               As Judge L—— and his particular friend, Mr. Stevens, were passing Mr. Smith's
                  quarters, apparently as much in a hurry as usual, Mr. Smith said to them:
               "Havn't you got one yet?"
               "We havn't got any, and I don't think we will," was the half-growled reply of Mr.
                  Stevens.
               "Have you tried Squire B——?" asked Smith.
               "Yes, we have," said Judge L——.
               "What did he say?" continued Smith.
               "Just what we might have expected," replied Stevens; "that we might go to the
                  devil, for he wasn't going to disgrace himself with such
                  business."
               "Where else have you been?" said Smith.
               "Well, the fact is," said Judge L——, looking as if he had got to the end of his
                  judgment, which was a very short
                  distance by a straight line, "we have tried every body but Dick
                  Wilson, and I doubt not that he will serve us just as his unmannerly preceptor
                  did. If he will consent to appear on the stand for us, I would rather trust him
                  than any man in the village."
               "Do you think you can get him?" said another rumseller, who had just come up,
                  almost breathless and trembling with agitation.
               "It is doubtful," said Judge L—— "but we will make the effort," and off they
                  started to test the power of flattering words in winning him to their service.
               When they entered the office, they found just the person who had a better right
                  there than any other person, and yet the very one they did not want to see—Dick's
                  preceptor, who half an hour before had recommended them to the devil for suitable
                  assistance. Squire B—— was sharp, as lawyers usually are, and it didn't take him
                  twenty-four hours to guess what they had come for; and taking his cane in his
                  hand, he marched out of the office.
               "This is a pleasant morning, Mr. Wilson," said Judge L——, and then added, "How
                  does the law go, Mr. Wilson."
               "Rather slowly," said Dick, carelessly.
               "I'll be bound, Mr. Wilson," said Judge L——, "you ought not to say that, with the
                  prospect you have before you. Such talents as yours will win a reward anywhere.
                  Speaking is an indispensable qualification for a successful lawyer, and if I had
                  been a natural speaker, I shouldn't have thanked the Governor for the
                  Judgeship. You are a fine speaker, Mr. Wilson, and you ought to improve all the
                  opportunities you have to let the people know it, and then, when you come to the
                  bar, you will at once be crowded with business. You have heard, I presume, Mr.
                  Wilson, that the officious part of this community are arraying themselves against
                  those whom they tauntingly call rumsellers, and that they are to have
                  a meeting to-morrow. We design drumming up one for the next day, and have called
                  on you to see if you will agree to take the stump for our cause on
                  that occasion."
               "No, Judge, I will not," said Dick, peremptorily.
               "You had better do so, Mr. Wilson: it will be to your advantage in more ways than
                  one," said Judge L——, in a half-pleading and half-menacing tone.
               "Why didn't you ask Squire B——, Judge, before he left the office?"
               "We don't want him," said Mr. Stevens; "he would do us more harm than good."
               "No, no," said Judge L——, "rather than try him, I will risk the stump myself."
               Just as the Judge finished his negation and his lie, Squire B——
                  entered the office, and said:
               "Dick, this is a rare chance to immortalize yourself. Go to that
                  meeting, and speak there, and every
                  respectable dog in the village will show you his teeth, and every high-minded
                  young lady, when you enter her house, will show you the door. I would like to see
                  you going to Mr. Watson's or Mr. Shepard's after that. They asked me to go, and I
                  recommended them to go where they get all their
                     assistance in carrying on this business."
               "Why, Squire B——, they have just told me they wouldn't have you," said Dick,
                  laughing.
               "That was true, sir, when they found they couldn't get me. I will defend a
                  murderer in court whenever I am called upon to do so, however aggravated the case
                  may be; but I will not let myself down to become an apologist for, or plead that
                  cause which is the origin of so much misery."
               These gentlemen were chop-fallen, and left much disappointed. The village was soon
                  filled with hand-bills, calling together the worshippers of rum, on Thursday
                  afternoon, in the court-house, and to which the announcement that Judge L—— would
                  address the meeting, was appended in capitals.
               "This is a pretty piece of business," said one of a company of rumsellers who had
                  established themselves about an advertisement which graced the town-pump, "that
                  we, for our own safety, should be compelled to resort to self-defence in this way;
                  for if it were not for us, the grass would grow up in the streets of this
                  village."
               "Yes," said another, "and it is a high-handed, daring act, for we have the
                     law and the constitution on our side. Judge L—— told
                  me so, and he is right, I am sure."
               "Aye, aye!" said a third, "but we'll fix this matter. I'm up to games of all
                  kinds, and I shan't fail this time. I'll tell you what I'll do: I'll make Jim
                  Watkins and Pete Hany just drunk enough for them to make their way to the church,
                  and then I'll pay them for going there; and as sure as guns, if they see each
                  other, they will kick up a fight right in the house, and it will trouble them to
                  part them."
               "Do you think you can do this, Smith?" said one.
               "Never mind if I can't. I'm an old bird in that work, and if I can't, nobody else
                  need try. I'll go myself, and watch the fun."
               "Then, Smith," said one, "you must be hunting up your birds. It is only about
                  three hours now until they meet."
               "I'll be ready. It won't take me long to prime them."
               Just then they saw a man coming into the village on horseback, and riding in a
                  very easy, careless manner.
               Judge L—— had sometime before this joined the company, and suddenly looking up,
                  and fixing his eyes on the advancing figure on horseback, he said, "Good Heavens!
                  boys, its the big lawyer! I must be getting out of this crowd."
               It was too late, however; for in far-sightedness he had no advantage of the lawyer; and he was, at
                  the very beginning of his retreat, greeted by the shrill voice of the mounted man,
                  calling him to stop. As he brought his horse's head along side of Judge L——, he
                  said—"Judge, I came here, by particular request, to make a temperance speech
                  to-day. This I know to be a very disorderly place, and I will hold you responsible
                  for any annoyance or blackguardism which may be witnessed at the meeting," and
                  touching his horse, which was like himself, of fine blood, he swept by the crowd
                  of abashed rumsellers, like a very superior being. After he was out
                  of sight, a few steps brought Judge L—— into the gang again, and then he said,
                  "Smith, you must not send those fellows there to-day; that lawyer has great
                  influence, and can kill this place if he wishes to do so."
               "How the devil can he do that?" inquired Smith, in a rage.
               "Why, he can kill me!" said the Judge.
               "Well, I can't think you are all the place, by a long ways."
               "Well, if you do send them, Smith, remember I won't speak at our
                  meeting to-morrow."
               At the appointed time the meeting was organized, and the business commenced in the
                  old way, on the general principles of voluntary abstinence. These people, although
                  they were heartily sick of the rumseller's work, yet they never dreamed that such
                  a thing as the modern "Maine Law" could have an existence, and this was not
                  strange. Nobody wondered that Franklin could not catch the lightning for which he
                  was fishing with his kite; but every one was astonished when it became, from his
                  experimenting, a common medium of communication.
               If there had been a possibility of procuring any such law as the "Maine Law," they
                  would have dropped at once the voluntary system; and
                  they would have seized the true instrument of success, and stamped
                     felony upon the traffic; but they had not reached, by several
                  years, the perfect day, and they intended to do the very best they
                  could, and oppose as mighty an effort as possible, to those withering curses,
                  before which youth, manhood, age and innocence were being prostrated, and whose
                  very hearts were being torn out of their bodies!
               The lawyer, without any resolutions being before the house, rose, and commenced
                  his speech by giving a glowing description of the squad of rumsellers who had
                  gathered about, and were hugging the pump stock, and how he had cut off Judge
                  L——'s retreat, and secured good order for the occasion.
               "Gentlemen," said he, "if you ever saw a rumseller who was a good man, you saw a
                  man whose daily practice was immeasurably overbalancing for evil, both his
                  profession and your opinion of his goodness."
               This seemed to startle some of the audience, for it was a strong expression, and
                  some thought it was going too far and
                  too fast. If the lawyer had spoken restrictively of the rumsellers of B——, they
                  would not have questioned his opinion; but as it was, they did't know but he
                  included the whole world, and this they were sure was a wide sweep. Said he
                  again—"If I were selling your sons and your daughters bread with one hand, and
                  double portions of poison with the other, you would have a poor
                  opinion of my goodness—the rumseller, however, sells you no
                     bread at all, but poison and only poison."
               The thing was becoming more reasonable, and even those who were somewhat
                  sceptical, in reference to the proposition at first, when they saw the
                  illustration, said to themselves, 'I guess he is about right.'
               "Never fear," said an old man, audibly, in answer to some doubtings which he had
                  overheard, "he is no fool; he know'd every word he was going to say for this week
                  past."
               When it seemed to the speaker that what he had said had been digested—and this he
                  understood by the expression of their countenances, in which he could read their
                  hearts—for he had spoken too often to juries to be out of tune or out of time with
                  any thing by which he wished to accomplish an end—he said,
               "The rumseller has no more right, natural, acquired, or
                     vested, to engage in measuring out ardent spirits to a human
                  being, than he has a right to open a shop for the sale of
                     arsenic; for although the latter acts quicker than the former,
                  still its effects are none the more certain or fatal."
               "I'll tell ye he's right, John," said an old lady who was sitting by her husband,
                  who was a friend of the rumsellers—"jist wait till he gets to the point, and puts
                  the saddle on."
               "You are all acquainted with George Handy," said the speaker, "you see him in your
                  streets every day—without character, the victim of insanity! The parents of George
                  Handy were to my knowledge amongst the most respectable of your community, and
                  George himself started in the world with as good prospects, and as fair a
                  character as any young man could wish. He is yet young in years, but an old man in
                  every thing else! Where is his wife? Where is the heritage that should have been
                  the portion of his lovely daughter? Did the assassin, under the cover of a dark
                  night, as he was on his way to his wife and child, plunge the dagger into his
                  heart? Oh no! for compared with the truth, this would have been
                  mericiful for it would have left competency and reputation to those who survived
                  him. I say merciful, when compared with the lingering tortures which was
                  perpetrated upon his entire manhood by the rumseller's hands. To his bar, and I
                  will mention the name, I mean Smith's bar, he came and came, and came again, and
                  at each coming, while his property and his character were being filched from him,
                  he in return turn received the
                  lingering poison—the warranty of disgrace! Am I right?"
               "Oh! yes," said an old man, "fifty murders could not have killed poor George as
                  dead as he is to-day."
               "Ah! John," said the old lady, I told you to wait until he got the saddle on. What
                  do you think now?"
               "I guess he is right, Jinny—Smith is a bad man, and I guess it would be better if
                  the law would licence him to sell poison,
                  and take away his whiskey from him. I don't believe he would do as much harm."
               After the usual interval for digestion had been given, with a great effort he
                  grasped the foundations and the climax, and shaking them in a manner that was
                  terrifying to some, he said,
               "Those who are aiding and abetting the rumseller in this business, are no better
                  than he is, and I will add, that in my estimation they are
                  worse!"
               And this, instead of following with a continuation of his speech, as he had done
                  before, he followed with a pause, in which he seemed to be reading the hearts of
                  some in the assembly who were not duly sincere, and whose
                     marks and scratches it would not have been difficult
                  for a rumseller to have appended to his application for license—setting him forth
                  to be a man famed far and wide for temperance and
                     sobriety!
               
               "I ain't the rumseller's friend," said one who, though the eye of the lawyer was
                  in his heart, looking up its character—"It's true I did sign Smith's petition the
                  last time, but I tell you I don't do that mean trick any more."
               The speaker was a good deal circumscribed by the time in which he was speaking,
                  and concluded thus:
               "Who sign those applications for license? They are the rumseller's abettors! Who
                  are willing to apologize for the wrongs which he is entailing upon humanity? They
                  are his friends and upholders! Who look on unconcernedly when he is trying to trap
                  a human being? They are his friends—in them he lives, moves, and has his
                  being."
               If that speech had been made in these days, it would have been moddled and
                  modulated to suit the times, and he would no doubt have said: Who is opposed to
                  the 'Maine law?' Who will plead for intemperance? Who is in favor of rum
                  legislation? These are they who give aid and comfort to the rumseller, and inflict
                  upon society the bitterest wrong.
               After he had succeeded in making every one believe that every thing he had said
                  was true, he left the stand, and was succeeded by Mr. Smith, in a style which
                  although it had not all the vigor, yet it had all the truthfulness of
                  the one which had just preceded it.
               After running over many of the points at which the first speaker had only glanced,
                  and presenting them in a very clear
                  light, he entered a little into the private rum traffic of the
                  village, by persons who would have been ashamed to be called rumsellers; and yet
                  in fact they were, and are doing a great deal of injury by it. He said it was not
                  only at the hands of the professional rumsellers of the village that
                  the community, in every sense, were suffering, but that even merchants, for the
                  sake of adding 'ill gotten gain' to their treasure, had, to some
                  extent, enlisted in the business, and if they did not sell it by
                     gills, they sold it by quarts, gallons and barrels; and that it
                  was carried home to gratify the perverted appetites of those who loved it, and to
                  form in the young a taste for that, the use of which will but destroy. These
                     semi-grog shops, he thought, had a very ruinous tendency in
                  whatever light they might be regarded, and that they ought to be included in the
                  system, and to be held responsible for the consequences.
               After the business was all over, the people departed quietly, having heard more
                  truth and having enjoyed themselves better than they had ever done at such a place
                  before.
               The street was perfectly clear. The rumsellers—there was not one to be seen. Some
                  persons did think that they were making their observations from
                     loop-holes in their houses, and that probably they were trying to
                  hunt up something which might give their meeting on the morrow a sprinkling of
                  decency. In the evening the street was filled again with themselves
                  and their friends, looking up the elements of the coming meeting.
               It was pretty well noised abroad that on account of their failure to get any other
                  person, Judge L—— had consented to make a speech, and this was quite a curiosity
                  in itself, and would be likely to collect a curious crowd of spectators, and
                  amongst them, many who would not like to be considered amongst the rumsellers
                  friends; and, above all the rest, though it was to be kept a secret, the lawyer
                  made up his mind to stay too, and hear what Judge L—— might have to say on the
                  occasion.
               Dick Wilson made up his mind that he would go too, and take with him, if he could
                  persuade her to go, Miss Handy. He called at Mr. Shepard's, and as soon as a
                  convenient opportunity offered, he asked her if she would be willing to go to that
                  meeting.
               After a moment's hesitation she said, "Mr. Wilson, how can I go there? These are
                  the people who have robbed me of father and mother, and who have thrown me upon
                  the charity of this good family; and now they are laying their plans to practice
                  the same cruelty upon others!"
               "You will not be regarded as taking part with them, Miss Handy," said Dick, "and
                  if I thought so, I am sure I would not go myself. For, so far as these people have
                  given me reason to have an opinion of them, my opinion would hardly
                  be more flattering to them than your own; and while my reasons for thinking meanly of them are not resting
                  upon a foundation so fearful as yours, yet God knows I have no reason to think
                  well of them. They left me a little, but I am not indebted to them for it; they
                  took all that they could, and the law measured it out to them—more I think than
                  was meet or merciful."
               "Mr. Wilson, they have wounded me deeper than a stranger's heart can ever know. My
                  poor mother's heart was broken into atoms by these men, and her life went out
                  amidst the wild dreams of insanity! And my father—I meet him almost daily. I try
                  to get from him a single look of recognition, but I cannot—he does not know me. I
                  am as a stranger to the one who, but for the rumseller, would have been the
                  protector of my youth. I am alone in this world now, so far as the ties of kindred
                  are concerned; and at the door of the rumseller I lay this charge of fearful
                  robbery, knowing that he must account for it to God!
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               RUMMIES IN COUNCIL.—THEIR DOINGS.
               
                  
                     
                        "Should he, when he pleases, and on whom he will,
                        Wage war, with any or with no pretence
                        Of provocation given, or wrong sustained,
                        And force the beggarly last doit by means
                        That his own humor dictates, from the clutch
                        Of Poverty, that thus he may secure
                        His thousands, weary of penurious life,
                        A splendid opportunity to die?"
                     
                  
               
               THE day which was to signalize the triumph of the rumsellers at B——, at last
                  arrived.
               This was to be a mighty affair! It was to give a death
                     thrust to the temperance reform in that village, and its friends would
                  then look on, and smile to see it die! On the preceding evening, when the sweeping
                  propositions of the 'big lawyer' were generally known to the
                  rumsellers, they were filled with fire and fury, and determined to deluge the
                  place with rum. They happened to meet under the awning of a miserable grocery,
                  compared with the keeper of which even Smith was a prince, and there
                  it went in a manner, which to relate would be offensive to the ear of decency—and
                  we will pass it.
               On the same evening, in another place, another company was gathered to consult on the best means
                  to be used to give the meeting an appearance which would not frighten their
                  friends, who might come from a distance to aid them in striking their terrible
                  blow. This company was small and noiseless, when compared with that under the
                  awning. It comprised Judge L—— and the superannuated Stevens, the file-leaders of
                  the whole matter. Said Judge L——, as he removed from his lips his glass of
                  brandy—
               "Stevens, it would be bad for us if the time should ever come when this delicious
                  stuff should be taken from us."
               "Yes," said Stevens, sorrowfully, "I don't want to live to see that time, for I
                  couldn't live long after it."
               "The rumselling business," said Judge L——, "is a fine business in this village. I
                  suppose one-half of the money in the township passes through their hands."
               "Yes," said Stevens, "fully that much; and it takes nearly the other half to pay
                     contingent expenses."
               "If you value your rum, Stevens, you musn't whisper such a thing as
                  that where any of our enemies can get hold of it," replied Judge L—— "But come, it
                  isn't our business to furnish arguments for these people. Let them take care of
                  themselves. We must prepare for to-morrow. Do you know, Stevens, if that big
                     lawyer has gone?"
               "Yes, he has," replied Stevens; "I saw him dashing over the hill this evening. He
                  wouldn't venture to show himself here to-morrow. If he did, he would be carried on
                  a rail."
               "Good heavens!" said the Judge, "I am glad to hear that. You'll hear a speech from
                  me to-morrow that will knock the noise out of every thing he said. I've got the
                     legal and constitutional side of this question, and I
                  tell you, I'll make the fur fly. Ha! ha! indeed! That impertinent scoundrel to
                  come here and say that decent men, because they are the friends of the rumsellers,
                  are aiding and abetting in murder! I'll show him which side of the bread is
                  buttered! Stevens, we mustn't make any calculation that we are going to have this
                  meeting to ourselves; for this will not be the case. I met Dick Wilson and Watson
                  and Shepard and Squire B—— this evening, and every one of them looked as if they
                  had the devil in their eyes. They are up to something, and we had better be
                  prepared for it. George Handy will be there. He never misses these kinds of
                  gatherings, and if he should appear there to-morrow as I saw him in the street
                  to-day, he would prejudice our cause very much. I tell you what I will do,
                  Stevens: I will hunt up a suit of my old clothes, if you will find a boy to carry
                  them up to the poor-house in the morning."
               "Your clothes are too big for him, Judge," said Stevens, "and every body will know
                  them."
               "That is just what I want," said the Judge, "and this very thing will give point to my
                  speech. I will send a note to the steward to compel him to put them on."
               "I'll do it," said Stevens, triumphantly.
               "Now, Mr. Stevens," said the Judge, "there is one thing yet, which is of more
                  consequence to us than George Handy. Mrs. Armstrong, you know, is very poor, and
                  is to a great extent supported by the charity of our enemies. Now can't we do
                  something for her that can be pretty well noised abroad before
                  to-morrow noon?"
               "Yes, we can so," said Stevens, with a very charitable look. "I will
                  give the half towards buying her a calico dress, if you will give the other
                  half."
               "Come, come, Stevens," said the Judge, "on this occasion you will have to go
                  farther into your generosity than that. Now I'll tell you what I will do. I have
                  got a cow that is worth twenty-five dollars in any man's money, and
                  if you will insure me two-thirds of that amount, I will send her down to Mrs.
                  Armstrong in the morning, and I will send a bag of bran into the
                  bargain."
               "She must be a good cow," said Stevens.
               "There never was a better one," continued the Judge, "and you can
                  well afford to give the half yourself. You know where that woman's property
                  went."
               "Well, Judge," said Stevens, "it's a devil of a lift; but I suppose
                  we must stand it. I'll agree to raise all I can out of Smith and Fritz and the
                  rest of them; and I'll call on some of the store-keepers, too: they
                  ought to aid; and then I'll pay the balance myself. But if it wasn't for the
                  meeting, I wouldn't give one cent!"
               About nine o'clock in the morning every body in the village knew that Judge L——
                  had given Mrs. Armstrong a cow, and, as might be expected, it was a matter of much
                  curiosity to many.
               As the hour of the meeting drew on, troops of the rumsellers' friends were seen
                  crowding into the village, and, taken all together, they were a very fair
                  representation of the trade. The quarters of the different rumsellers of the place
                  were filled to overflowing, and a majority of them were in the process of being
                  filled with rum. Crowds of boys were in the streets, admiring the appearance and
                  occasionally the swaggering dexterity of the jolly host.
               A new object of attraction suddenly arrested the attention of the boys. It was
                  George Handy, arrayed in Judge L——'s old broadcloth. The poor fellow looked
                  unusually bright this morning, and the cheerlessness of insanity seemed to have
                  partially passed away. He halted in front of Smith's door, where the cruelty of
                  the boys, encouraged by the grimaces of the bye-standers, most of
                  whom were passing through the very same process through which poor George had
                  passed, and which had made him what he was, soon set George in a rage. Smith came to the door, and as he was
                  attempting to lay violent hands on the poor fellow, George, by what some would
                  call a luckless blow, left him sprawling in the gutter beside him,
                  which was a very fit place for him.
               The bell of the old court-house, whose walls were accustomed to the recital of
                  events connected with the rum traffic, at last told the community that the
                  magnificent spectacle was about to concentrate in the court-room. The room was
                  soon filled, so that not another one could get in. Those who were merely
                  spectators, who had gone early and without any preconcerted plan, were seated on
                  one side of the house, and that side contained the well-developed proportions of
                  the big lawyer. The other side contained the bone and
                     sinew of the rumsellers' forces in that region, and amongst them,
                  very conspicuously, sat George Handy, the man whom they had so cruelly cursed. The
                  contrast between the two sides of the house was perfect, and some one, on the side
                  of the spectators, was heard to say—'Deliver me from this body of
                     death!' The bar on this occasion was crowded with
                  rum-manufacturers and rumsellers, and constituted the pageant toward which all
                  eyes were directed.
               "After a few moments, at the instance of Judge L——, who had not noticed that the
                     big lawyer was in the assembly, an old and, as Judge L—— said, a
                     very respectable manufacturer of rum, was called to the chair; and
                  in answer to the question as to where the presiding officer should sit, George
                  Handy call out—'In the prisoner's box!' After this officer had found
                  a place where his dignity might repose, a motion was again made by Judge L—— that
                  Dick Wilson should be called on to act as secretary, and in a moment, Smith,
                  looking out from the black, swollen eye which George's blow had given, said—
               "I second the motion."
               In an instant Dick was on his feet, and many of them, thinking that he was eager
                  to jump at the honor tendered him, began to cheer him. As soon as this mark of
                     respect was hushed, Dick said:
               "Gentlemen, I gave you notice night before last, that you could expect no
                  assistance from me."
               Then the difficulty was to find a man whose hand was steady enough to make out an
                  intelligible copy of their proceedings for the printer; for they intended that the
                     whole world should be filled with the fame of that jubilee.
               This meeting was almost the counterpart of one held for the same purpose in the
                  city of New York, less than a year since, and there was about the same difficulty
                  in getting a respectable organization in the one case as in the other. Of this
                  meeting at B——, however, it was never said, when their printed proceedings
                  appeared, that they had many names which belonged to no one in particular. In most
                  of their features these two meetings are so nearly allied, that one familiar with
                  the meeting at B—— would say, that the
                  rumsellers in Gotham must have had a copy of its proceedings, and that they only
                  departed from the form when they were using names to their published
                  proceedings.
               The cow story had been heard by all who were in the court-house, and
                  George Handy, in the Judge's cloth, was there to speak and answer questions for
                  himself. Judge L—— was called on, and immediately spread himself, preparatory to
                  his speech; and without looking to see whether any but the jury were
                  there, he commenced, by saying:
               "Ladies and gentlemen, I regret the necessity which has called me to appear before
                  you at this time, for nothing but imperative necessity could have induced me to do
                  so. Innovations in religion, morals and law are everywhere to be reprobated, and
                  good citizens should set their faces against them. Innovations on the
                     natural rights of individuals and constitutional
                  infractions are especially to be deprecated; and it is to consider innovation in
                  reference to these two last named points that we are met here at this time.
               "The rum traffic, at this day, seems to be something against which a certain
                  portion of the community are conspiring and arraying themselves, with malice
                     afore thought, which is the evidence of depraved mind, regardless
                  of the natural, and I may add, constitutional rights of others.
                  Rights, my friends, are everlasting things! Law is the defence of the
                  weak against the strong, and lest it should be made worse, ought to abide as it
                  is, and no one ought to be guilty of the heinous crime of interfering with
                  constitutions! God save the commonwealth from those wolves who would devour
                     it!"
               Here Smith gave a hearty cheer.
               "Gentlemen, let me direct your attention to my venerable friend, the president of
                  this assembly. Look at him! His locks are whitened now by the frosts of many
                  years; and the fruit which the grave is claiming is nearly ripe, and ready to
                  fall. He came into this community poor, when most of you were children. He did not
                  remain poor. His natural energy and noble-heartedness moved him forward. In a few
                  years after, he established a still-house in your vicinity, and while
                  he has enriched himself, he has also helped to enrich the county. Who purchased
                  your rye and corn? Where were you always sure to find a market for what you had to
                  spare? Who gave you the means by which you were enabled to clothe and educate your
                  children? Gentlemen, a grateful heart is pleasing to God. Remember that, and
                  remember, too, that ingratitude always meets its reward. Then I would have you use
                  your influence to spare the feelings of that old man, who is left to us from the
                  past, and who is soon to go the way of all flesh, and be seen no more in your
                  community.
               "I said, gentlemen, that natural rights were everlasting—I believe the technical
                  term is inalienable—and that is stranger yet. A natural
                     right means that which an
                  individual has a right to do, under all circumstances, independent of
                  any thing or person to the contrary notwithstanding!
                  Now, on this principle—for you cannot help but see how broad it is—my friend in
                  the chair has right enough and room enough to carry on his business
                  to any extent that he pleases, and what is right for him is right for all.
               "And now, gentlemen, for the retailers of rum I claim the same privileges, and I
                  insist that they are entitled to them! What! When a gentleman enters their house
                  and calls for a meal of victuals, is he to be refused? Is he to be told, you can't
                  be accommodated, sir? Then take away his privilege to sell rum, and this is the
                  very thing you must expect—the very thing you will meet; and hungry as you may be,
                  you can have nothing! Why, gentlemen, tavern keeping would not be
                  worth a pin, if the right to sell liquor were taken away, and the best
                     houses in the land would close their doors; then I guess you would see,
                  to your cost and sorrow too, what kind of entertainment these constitutional
                     vampyres could give you."
               "I am advised, gentlemen, that a traveling lecturer, wihout either character or
                  talents, who entertained a few people for half an hour, yesterday, at the church,
                  said in the course of his incoherent remarks, that we have no right to sell rum;
                  that it was even worse than assassination, and that they had as good a right to
                  sell poison, knowing it to be intended for self-destruction. And
                  further, that those who favored it—and I suppose he meant myself—were no better
                  than the rumsellers! I wish I had been there. I would have told him that
                  rumsellers could make the widow's heart glad, and that they and their friends
                  could give to those whom Providence had afflicted, as in the person
                  of George Handy, a respectable appearance. Yet we are told they are bad men! and I
                  am a bad man! But for what, unless it be for our kindness to the poor, and our
                  money?"
               Many persons were remarking very unusual excitement in the countenance of George
                  Handy. It seemed as if reason was struggling with insanity for its old habitation.
                  The evidence of this excitement become more and more perceptible, as the Judge
                  proceeded; and just when he uttered the words, Smith is not chargeable with George
                  Handy's misfortunes," George rose, and with an effort, in which he seemed
                  struggling to reclaim reason, he said,
               "Am I in hell? If not, where am I? Judge L——," he continued, "do not
                     criminate Providence! Do not say that Smith's mercy was more than
                  the mercy of God!—for it is a lie, and you know it. It is true that I
                  am dressed in your cast-off clothes; but still, with the little light which the
                  murderous spirit of Smith has left me, I will bear witness against every word you
                  have said. I know that it is false. I have proved that it is false; and while you are standing here to defend the
                  rumseller, you are worse than he is. I will soon be where you cannot
                  see me, but while I am able I will daily walk these streets, to torment yourself
                  and your clan, and warn others against your wickedness."
               Here poor George, with a convulsive shudder, sank again into his seat. Every one
                  was surprised, for no one in several years had heard from George a coherent
                  sentence.
               "This," said the Judge, "is the doings of that fellow who was here yesterday. Why
                  they are even making madness itself more mad!"
               "Judge L——," said the lawyer, who was not able to stand this any longer, "whence
                  did you derive your legal opinions?"
               "None of your business," said he, before he had time to see from whose mouth the
                  question had come. Turning his head, and seeing the commanding figure of the
                  lawyer, drawn up to its full length, he quailed for a moment, and then said, "why
                  did you ask me that question?"
               "Because I thought you might recover damages," said the lawyer.
               "What do you mean," said the Judge, a good deal confounded.
               "I mean that the man who taught you the definition and principles of law which you
                  have advanced, ought to be indicted for ignorance, and yourself ought to be in the
                  same condemnation. You have taken the liberty to be very ungentlemanly towards
                  myself, when you thought I was not present. I am here, and I will try to hear you
                  to the end—go on Judge."
               This was the winding up of the Judge's speech. For the life of him, although he
                  labored excessively, he could'nt get out another word. He knew that Dick's
                  preceptor, and others of equal intelligence were present, who could detect his
                  mingling of ignorance and duplicity, but for these he did not care. But when
                  called to account by the lawyer, disappointment and anger drove him
                  to his seat.
               Here the very venerable chairman—the man who was poor and had become rich—the man
                  whose head was white for the harvest of death—the man who had been such a signal
                     blessing to that community—the man who would soon be seen no more
                  amongst them—this very venerable man rose and said,
               "This is what I expected—nothing better could be expected. Here the judge of the
                  court has been interrupted while explaining law to his friends, and he can't go on
                  at all. These are gentlemen indeed. It would be a favor if all who are in the
                  house, and who ain't with us, would leave," and down the old man went
                  into his chair.
               "We will accommodate you," said the lawyer, "and you will be welcome to what is
                  left."
               There was a demonstration at once towards the door, and the venerable president,
                  fearing that himself self and the
                  Judge, who was yet choking on his speech, were to be left alone, called out,
                  saying, "I did not mean that all should go—the meeting is not closed. This,
                  however, did not stop those who were under way; and very soon every thing which
                  would have been desirable in almost any other place than a rum meeting, was safely
                  out of the house; and every thing that was left, except in number, was, for all
                  the world, a fac simile of its great
                     antetype in Gotham; and it could not well have been otherwise, for
                  the cry of both was, 'give me rum or I die.'
               
               It would be vain to attempt to describe the appearance of what was left in the
                  house. "Now," said Judge L——, "we are alone, and we will have leave to transact
                  our business in a peaceable and orderly manner, as good citizens should do."
               "Ah! said Stevens, the cow didn't do us much good,"—"Mr. George
                  Handy, either," said the Judge, and Smith declared that he wouldn't pay one cent
                  towards the cow, and that after that, drunkard's widows might take care of
                  themselves, for all that he would do to help them.
               The venerable distiller rose again, and began to set forth in as
                  plaintive a style as he could command, the great services which he had rendered to
                  that community, and then dwelt at some length on the ingratitude of a large
                  portion of those who, now in his old age, had turned against him, and were for
                  driving him out of his stewardship.
               The poor old man seemed to think that Judge L——'s definition of natural
                     rights was true to the very letter; and that God had given to him a
                  special right to entail misery upon his creatures until his last breath.
               As might be expected, when the restrainst of a decent audience had been removed,
                  confusion soon introduced itself; and however much they may have intended to
                  accomplish, nothing more was done, and in the midst of angry words and pugilistic
                  gesticulations, the thirsty crowd retired to the quarters of the
                  different rumsellers; and the wrecks of this splendid pageant for several days
                  after, were visible in the gutters of B——.
               The views then entertained by this old man of his 'divine right' to sell rum,
                  still exist in the minds of many at the present day; and the idea that any legal
                  restraints are to be imposed upon the business, is looked upon by them as the most
                  odious tyranny. Against this they therefore combine; and especially close and
                  earnest is this combination against the only effectual remedy that
                  has ever been suggested for the evils of rumselling—against THE MAINE LAW. It
                  is—we will not say amusing—it is humiliating, to see the candidate for official
                  place quake with fear before the dreaded influence of this combination, and seek,
                  by every means in his power, to secure it in his behalf. Nay, more: to see grave
                  legislators, when called upon to vote upon the question of enacting the Maine Law,
                  to give a faint aye or nay, and to
                  attempt to pacify the rum interest by flimsy apologies. This, however, will never
                  satisfy the friends of the law. They think they see in this what has often been
                  vainly sought for in various other ways—something that will
                     effectually put an end to the traffic in rum, and of course remove
                  the temptations which are now enticing the young at every corner. This idea is
                  possessing the public mind with the earnestness of complete conviction, and the
                  happy effects of the Maine Law, wherever it has been tried, tend forcibly to rivet
                  and extend this conviction. It is believed, therefore, that this pervading public
                  sentiment will soon be crystalized into the permanent form of efficient public
                  law.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               THE PARTY.—THE SNARE.—THE ESCAPE.
               
                  
                     
                        "I know a breast which once was light,
                        Whose patient sufferings need my care;
                        I know a heart which once was bright,
                        But drooping hopes have nestled there;
                        Then while tear-drops nightly steal
                        From wounded hearts that I should heal,
                        Though boon companions you may be,
                        O! comrades, fill no glass for me!"
                     
                  
               
               IN the breast of Dick Wilson one peculiar, lovely hope rose above every other, and
                  melted in warm and confiding tenderness amidst the still dear ruins of the wreck
                  which he was endeavoring to raise. On no occasion did the image of his home pass
                  entirely from his mind. To him it was an ever-abiding, present reality; and the
                  joys of the stranger's heart had not the mystic power to drive sadness from
                  his.
               He was conscious of his poverty, and he knew but too well that others must be
                  equally conscious of it. Dick's wardrobe was getting scanty, indeed; and this was
                  all the more annoying from the fact that he did not know how it was to be
                  replenished.
               Before this startling reality he quailed, as he was sitting alone, taking a cautious survey of his worn
                  garments, and seemingly trying to ascertain how long they would probably hold
                  together. He was looking first at the elbow of his coat—then at the knees of his
                  pantaloons—then at his hat and boots, and raveling linen, and then he ejaculated,
                  "Yes, these relics of better times are all going together—they will soon be done.
                  I am not used to this—I have given away better clothes than these, often; and I
                  have no means to replenish them. But I am glad that my mother and Eliza do not
                  know it, since for their sakes I would be willing to be even more stinted than I
                  am; and to see them smile again as they once smiled, before the rumseller came to
                  our Eden, I would endure any thing that was tolerable."
               In the midst of these unpleasant thoughts the stage coach from P—— drove up to the
                  office opposite his window. "Ah!" said he, "I shall perhaps get a letter from
                  mother to-day, and if I do I shall feel much better. If it were not for such
                  letters, I could not keep up as well as I do; but when I know how patiently they
                  are all suffering, I ought not to repine."
               He could hear from his place all the noise and confusion which usually awaited the
                  arrival of the stage at B——, and he overheard the landlord who kept the hotel,
                  saying, "This trunk is for Dick Wilson," and in the next breath he heard the surly
                  reply of a young man who was standing by—
               "Well, the Lord knows if there is any thing in it in the shape of money or
                  clothing, it will be a 'God-send' to him, for he is almost naked. Why, he hasn't a
                  thing on his back, that isn't thread-bare; and if he don't recruit very soon he
                  will lose all influence in this community, and then he'll be as good as dead.
               Dick heard the sharp voice of Mr. Jacobs the landlord, quickly replying to this
                  evidence of littleness, by saying—
               "Well, Horace, the Lord knows another thing just as well as he knows that, and
                  this whole community know it, and you seem to be the only one who does not know
                  it. If you could exchange some of your fine clothes and money for what brains Dick
                  Wilson could spare, and still be rich, I tell you it would be a
                     precious God-send to you; but your case is hopeless! You are
                  living here and sporting upon money which I am told has been acquired in every way
                  but an honest one, and now you rise up and lay claim to censorship,
                  and talk about influence! You had better go down to the 'Old Stone House,'
                     famed all over the State for its debauchery, and then talk about
                     influence as it was about twenty years ago; and Black Jim, who
                  lives there now, if he knew the whole history, wouldn't go partners
                  with you in your position or influence. Dick Wilson is moving himself forward with
                  commendable energy, in despite of poverty, to make his way to competency, and you
                  are moving towards the poor house; and
                  that is the appropriate place for you. Your influence, indeed! Good heavens! what
                  a precious thing it must be in your estimation. I would just as soon have
                     'Black Jim's' influence as yours, for it is really greater, and
                  will be more enduring."
               Of this conversation Dick had not lost a single word; and he knew the person very
                  well, by whom it was commenced, so that such expressions, although not intended
                  for his ears, were not wholly unanticipated by him.
               He stepped to the door at once and inquired of Mr. Jacobs, who was still standing
                  by the stage, if his name had not been mentioned.
               "Yes, Mr. Wilson," said Mr. Jacobs, his face slightly coloring as he spoke, "here
                  is a trunk for you, from P——, and I have just been having a word with that young
                     rowdy, who is marching off, in reference to it."
               "Yes," said Dick smiling gratefully, "I heard you, and I guess he thought you
                  severe."
               "I don't care what he thought, Mr. Wilson," replied he, "such good for nothing
                  fellows deserve severity."
               "Well," said Dick, "I thank you—am glad I have found that fellow out."
               "Yes, Mr. Wilson, if you have had any confidence in him it is a good
                  thing that you have found him out, for he is intemperate in his habits and
                  hypocritical in his conduct. Mr. Wilson, my term in this house expires in the
                  spring, and then I am going to look out for some more honorable employment than
                  selling rum. I have some respect for myself—some regard for my fellow men, and
                  more than all, for my family; and I will no longer compromise these interests by
                  remaining in this business. Here is your trunk, Mr. Wilson," and turning to a
                  black man who stood beside him, he said, "Here, Sam, take this trunk to Mr.
                  Wilson's boarding house immediately."
               Dick thanked him kindly, and then turned into the office, preparatory to following
                  his unknown treasure. He was soon ready, and just as it was placed upon the
                  wheel-barrow, he passed from the door and kept pace with it. As might be expected,
                  Dick's mind was on the trunk, and every thing disconnected with it just then was
                  an abstraction. At last Sam, puffing under the rays of a burning sun, said:
               "Massa Wilson, I guess dis trunk am somewhat full. It's a mighty good load for
                  one, I tell you. I tink Missus must sent you lots ob money dis time, and more good
                  tings, too. My gracious! massa, de sun come down hot on dis nigger's back—I tell
                  you it do, massa. Mighty rickety wheel-barrow dis is!"
               Dick understood the point of this philosophizing, and when Sam had carried the
                  trunk into his room, he handed him a quarter, at the sight of which Sam's eyes
                  expanded considerably, and he said:
               "God bless you, Massa Wilson. Sam remember you for dis kindness. I wish, massa, you'd git a
                  trunk ebery day."
               Dick had to break the trunk, and this he was not long in doing; and soon the
                  contents of the trunk were before him. His heart was glad as he beheld the
                  elements of a princely wardrobe, in his own quarters, and himself the owner, with
                  more than a sufficient sum of money to defray all the expenses necessary to fit it
                  to his person. But the joy was only momentary; for it was instantly interrupted by
                  the thought that the value of these things would have been better bestowed if they
                  had been given to his mother.
               "This," said he, "if it had been given in some other shape to my mother and
                  sister, would have been better bestowed, and although my wants are pinching
                  enough, still I should have preferred it."
               While such reflections as these were passing through his mind, his eye caught
                  sight of a slip of paper, which he thought must have dropped from the trunk and
                  might perhaps be an explanation, as there is never anything connected with the
                  charitable gift which is unnecessary. As soon as he opened it—for it proved to be
                  more than a slip—he said, in delight:
               "From Eliza! Then they know all about this. Let me read it:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "'Dear Dick: A very kind friend has sent you this
                              handsome present. I am not at liberty to mention the name, as I would
                              like to do; but I may add that we have all been remembered together.
                              We have shared largely in the same liberality. I will tell you all
                              about it when we get into one family again, as I hope we shall before
                              long. Dick, we pray for you daily. Keep up, my poor brother. We are
                              all well. We visit at Mrs. Livingston's to-morrow. Write immediately.
                              Good-bye.
                           
                              ELIZA.'"
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Joy, in its fullness, rushed into his heart again, and he felt happy; for if he
                  did not know the name of the donor, he felt that it was a gift of pure
                  benevolence—a benevolence which looked not for a reward from man, but the aim of
                  which was higher and holier than an earthly reward.
               As he was passing back to the office, he found Sam mounted like a prince on a
                  hitching post, at the door of the hotel, entertaining a half dozen of his sable
                  brethren with his philosophizing propensities, for he was what is called a 'cute
                  nigger,' and nothing escaped his observation; and to his mind there was something
                  wrong about every thing in which he had not a share. As Dick was passing by, Sam,
                  with a good deal of impertinence, said:
               "Massa Wilson, you found de trunk all right side up, did you?"
               "Oh, yes, Sam," said Dick, cheerfully.
               "Well, Massa Wilson," said Sam, "you wouldn't find it in dis way if any nigger but
                  myself had toted it down thar on that broken-backed barrow. It takes dis nigger to
                  do smart tings. When you gits a trunk agin, jist call on Sam. He's allers
                  about."
               
               "Yes," said Dick, "I will call on you, Sam." But Dick thought that such an event
                  as the one through which he had just passed was probably a good way off.
               A few days after this, Dick was sitting alone in the office, very busily engaged
                  in making out and arranging some papers for Squire B——, which were intended for
                  the Supreme Court, and just as he had finished, enveloped and marked them, and was
                  about to put them into the proper 'pigeon-hole,' a young colored boy entered the
                  office, making the inquiry—
               "Is dis whar Massa Dick Wilson be?"
               "Yes, my boy," said Dick, "I suppose I am the person for whom you are inquiring;
                  but you ought not to say Massa Wilson. You ought to say
                     Mister Wilson. We have no such titles in this latitude."
               "Yes, Massa Wilson, but den you got de ting itself, and Sanco can't see for why
                  you no hab de name too. I tell you, Massa Wilson, Massa Judge L—— be no more
                     massa at de soufe dan he be at de norfe.
                  I'll be bound he be massa wharever him can cotch a nigger."
               "You live with Judge L——, do you, Sanco?" inquired Dick.
               "I stays dar, Massa Wilson. Nobody lib at his house dese times but Miss Lucy, from
                  New-York, and Horace Stevens. All de rest only stay now!"
               "What do you want with me, Sanco?"
               "My gracious! massa, you's so kind. I most forgot dis note. Here it is. It's berry
                  sweet, I guess. Most de whole ob dem fussed about it. Look out, massa! Missus from
                  New-York writ dat note, and a mighty sight of fun dey's had ober it too! Dey say
                  some tings, Massa. Dey seem to tink Sanco got no ears, 'cause he's got a black
                  skin. But mercy! Sanco mustn't for de life ob him say, or Judge L—— skin dis
                  little nigger alive! Dat ain't all gold, massa, what shines—dat's a fact, it
                  ain't—'cause den niggers' eyes be gold in de night: in fact den most de whole
                  nigger be gold all de time. 'Member dis, massa. Sanco says look out! Dis
                     mean something, massa."
               Although this little colored boy had awakened a strong current of curiosity in the
                  mind of Dick, yet he was too honorable to attempt to wrest the little fellow's
                  secrets from him. The peculiar emphasis of the bearer, as well as his meaning
                  hints, were the evidences that he had matters of importance which he would like to
                  communicate, but that the fear of the lash prevented him from approaching nearer
                  than an indistinct hint or a meaning emphasis. Dick might have drawn from him the
                  whole matter—he might have opened his young heart and taken from it its treasured
                  secrecy—for there is no power before which this race become so entirely impotent
                  over their own hearts as by kindness—and Dick had the very kind of nature by which
                  he could have taken every thing from it. He, however, had a sense of honor, which prevented him from doing many
                  things, merely because he could do them, irrespective of the rights
                  and feelings of others. To him, if that heart was crowned with a woolly
                     head, it was just as sacred as if God had given it a covering more
                  indicative of nobility.
               He opened the note at once, and he could not help admiring the nice mechanical
                  beauty of the hand in which it was written. It was from Judge L——'s family, sure
                  enough, and contained for him an invitation to attend, in a few evenings, a party
                  at Judge L——'s, which was designed to be complimentary to Miss Lucy S——, the
                  reputed belle from New-York.
               Dick thought that the expression of consideration which the note contained for
                  himself, was overwrought, and this, in connection with the fact that Horace
                  Stevens had something to do with it, to his mind, made it altogether a suspicious
                  affair, calling upon him to treasure the simple hints of Sanco.
               From all Dick had seen, and from what he had overheard from Horace Stevens a few
                  days before, he concluded that this was a trap set for some purpose; but what that
                  purpose could be, unless it was what Mrs. Watson had told him, he could not
                  divine.
               "Well," said Dick, "whatever may be the object, I have the advantage this time;
                  for I can stay or go, just as I choose. My clothes will be finished tomorrow. If
                  this invitation had come a week earlier, why then I couldn't have done just as I
                  chose, unless I had chosen to stay away, or go with these clothes: and that I
                  shouldn't very likely have done. I can now go, and make a respectable appearance,
                  too, and perhaps by a violent effort I may be able to keep up my caste with Horace Stevens, and the precious knighthood
                  which he inherits from the old stone house and the drover's
                     saddle-bags."
               Dick felt that in the very step which he was about to take, or refuse to take,
                  there might be consequences of more importance than from his knowledge there was
                  reason to expect. Suspicions are hardly ever awakened prematurely, in the hearts
                  of those who are naturally confiding and unsuspicious; but when once they are
                  awakened, it is a difficult matter to allay them.
               He knew something of Judge L——'s character, and the influences by which he was
                  surrounded; and concluded to be governed in this matter by whatever advice he
                  might get from Mr. Watson's family in reference to it, for he was assured that
                  they were his friends.
               As soon as it was convenient to do so, two or three hours afterwards, Dick entered
                  Mr. Watson's house, and was met at the door by Mrs. Watson, who immediately asked
                  the question. "Richard, are you going to the party at Judge L——'s?" Dick saw
                  through her mischievous smile, and replied,
               "With your permission, Mrs. Watson."
               
               "That's a good boy," said Mrs. Watson, smiling, and then assuming her usual
                  demeanor, which was pleasant, she said, "you have an invitation, Richard?"
               "Verily I have," said Dick, taking it from his pocket, "here it is."
               Mrs. Watson looked at it a moment, and then remarked, "They have taken more pains
                  with yours than they did with mine."
               "Ain't they written in the same style?" inquired Dick.
               "No, I guess they ain't, Richard, nor by the same hand either—they want you more
                  than they do me. However, I shall go, and it will be purely on your account. I
                  suppose you have made up your mind to go?"
               "I don't know that I have, Mrs. Watson. I am afraid, from all that I can get hold
                  of, that there is treachery in this."
               "There is no doubt of it, Richard, and it will only become visible as they reveal
                  it. If Judge L—— has had any thing to do with it, you may depend it is a
                  complicated affair. But go, Richard, by all means. Look yourself, just as if you
                  suspected nothing, and yet be watchful of every thing, and you will in this way
                  more than half conquer those who are engaged in this business."
               "Is Mr. Watson going?"
               "Yes, certainly; and that too on your account."
               "Then, Mrs. Watson, I will go; and I want you to help me to watch every thing that
                  may be going on. Have they asked Mr. Smith?"
               Oh dear me—Mr. Smith—I guess not. He is too hard on the rumsellers for that, and
                  they would not have asked myself and husband, only in hope that it might induce
                  you to go. If they didn't want me they will be disappointed, for I will go. I have
                  some curiosity to see what a party at Judge L——'s looks like."
               The evening at length came, and was very pleasant and beautiful. The village
                  seemed to be in commotion, for parties were things which only occurred
                  occasionally, and not often enough to keep one in their ways; but a party at Judge
                  L——'s! why, it was every body's wonder. Such a thing had never before been
                  known.
               On this evening, Dick saw again, in all the vividness of a life-like dream, his
                  princely home, with its unstinted elegance, and in the midst of this vision, as he
                  had often seen it in reality, he saw moving the fine form of his father, and close
                  by his side two lovely sisters, and by a table a mother, in matronly pride, with
                  the infant Harry in her arms, wrapt in the fullness of her domestic joys.
               The circumstances, no doubt, had much to do with the frame work of this fragile
                  fabric, which soon was to be swept away into the land, shadowed by dreams. But if
                  the circumstances could awaken these things, which were so much like a reality, it
                  was only by contrast. From such
                  contemplations Dick Wilson was awakened, to enter a house which was not naturally
                  great, but around which circumstances for the time had been pleased to throw a
                  fictitious greatness. It was to such a place that he was called, exhorted and
                  persuaded, and yet, astonishing as it was, it was at the house of Judge L——. The
                  fact is, there were a great many positions which would have suited his abilities
                  much better than the one of which he then happened to have possession. He was a
                  good judge of a horse, an excellent judge of brandy, and a most unscrupulous
                  miser, and an intimate and confidential friend of the rumselles, for whose
                  interests and his own he would make the law and the evidence bend at any time, and
                  the rumsellers said, with heart and soul, "he is a great man—he is
                     our helper."
               Dick Wilson was arrayed in new habiliments, and his appearance was neat and
                  gentlemanly. He was very tall, rather slender, and as straight as an arrow, and
                  when he wished to do so, he could be as dignified as a prince.
               "Now," said he to himself, "Sanco, Massa Dick Wilson is ready to be off, and to
                  look out too, and thank fortune he has some good friends to help him."
               One half hour in the midst of that throng—which was any thing but
                  respectable—found Dick calm and self-possessed. He found a number of his real
                  friends there, who did every thing in their power to make him enjoy himself—there
                  were some there, also, who had made a profession of friendship for him, but he had
                  read their duplicity, and on that occasion was perfectly willing that they should
                  come to a knowledge of it.
               He had determined, before going, that under no circumstances, for a single moment,
                  would he be tempted to relax his vigilance; and from certain things which had
                  already transpired, his resolution was rather strengthened than otherwise.
               He was just then overhearing, from a group who were not far from him, that which
                  sent a shock of sadness through his heart.
               "Horace," said one, "do you know where Dick Wilson got those fine clothes that he
                  has on this evening? Why, he is as poor as a church mouse."
               "I guess they came from P——, in the stage the other day. I saw a trunk taken out,
                  marked for him, and if it hadn't been for that impertinent fellow at the stage
                  office, I should have known all about it there."
               "What did he say, Horace?"
               "Oh, he said a good deal; he is a great friend of Wilson. It is generally
                  understood here, that his family is subsisting on charity in P——; and I think,
                  after all, that there is a hoax about this. I think Mr. Watson has furnished these
                  things for him, and you see, with all their gravity, they are here to-night; and I
                  suppose they only came to see how their book keeper would act, and what kind of appearance he would make in the
                  presence of gentlemen and ladies; but we will tame him before he gets
                  away. The Judge is up to such things, and a single swallow of that
                     wine will set him over."
               Not a syllable of that conversation escaped Dick's ear, and in that group he saw
                  the beautiful bird of the evening, Miss. Lucy S——, enjoying with the appetite of a
                  voluptuary, the perfidious conversation of those young men; and yet not a muscle
                  of her face gave evidence of agitation.
               Directly, Mrs. Watson passed near him, and a meaning look, all she could do, was
                  rightly interpreted by Dick, and he was on his guard in a moment.
               Just behind Mrs. Watson came Horace Stevens and the young 'belle' before referred
                  to, and after an introduction, she entered into conversation with Dick, and the
                  exceeding gentility of his manners nearly threw her off her guard; for it seemed
                  at one time that she did intend to be merciful, but getting over this, she said—"I
                  believe, Mr. Wilson, you are from P——."
               "That is my native place, Miss S——," replied Dick.
               "Well, Mr. Wilson, I do think it is a charming place, and I should like very much
                  to reside there. I have been trying to get Pa to go there to reside, but I cannot.
                  He is so much attached to his old ways, that I cannot persuade him to change
                  them."
               "P—— is certainly a beautiful place, Miss S——, and it has many delightful and
                  thrilling revolutionary incidents connected with it."
               "Don't you think, Mr. Wilson, that for my pleasure Pa ought to move there?"
               "Well, I declare, Miss S——," said Dick, "I cannot tell; but as a general rule, I
                  think it is safest to give the judgment of age and experience the preference in
                  every thing which is not manifestly wrong. I have learned, although I am young,
                  that we cannot truly paint our future history, or tell by what circumstances it
                  may be influenced."
               "Pray, Mr. Wilson, have you some experience in disappointments?"
               "I have, Miss," replied Dick, with great tenderness; "this is the only thing in
                  which I am rich!"
               "Indeed! Then if Mr. Wilson has no objection, his experience would be a matter of
                  interest to me, perhaps to the company—please go on, Mr. Wilson."
               "It would be very painful to me if I did so," replied Dick.
               "Then, Mr. Wilson, you will not be offended if I guess, will you?"
               "Not at all, Miss."
               "You have been disappointed?"
               "Yes, bitterly, Miss."
               "Of a tender kind, I suppose?"
               "Very tender indeed."
               "You are not poor, are you?"
               
               "As much so as I well can be."
               "An object of charity?"
               "No, Miss," said Dick, while his face glowed with a momentary indignation, "and I
                  never will be!"
               "Come, Mr. Wilson, do not suffer yourself to be excited."
               "I am not excited," answered Dick, "and I do not think it will be possible to
                  excite me this evening."
               "Ah! you have come prepared then, Mr. Wilson?"
               "I have," added Dick, with emphasis. With this she rose hastily, with
                  a scornful air, and advanced towards the part of the room in which Judge L—— and
                  Horace Stevens, and a few of the same class had placed themselves, to watch her
                  success.
               It was very evident to Dick, who, from his position, could observe those plainly
                  towards whom she was advancing, that already she was telegraphing with her looks
                  the success, as she fancied, which had attended the onset.
               What Dick's thoughts were just now, we do not know; but we know what it would have
                  been natural enough for him to have said and thought. If he did not show his
                  feelings, still they were aroused, and they were almost forced to overleap the
                  enclosure in which he wished to keep them, until he could get into his own
                  room.
               Dick looked up, and behold she was coming again, under the escort of Judge L—— and
                  Horace Stevens, a force which, except in bulk, was little increased.
               "Mr. Wilson," said the Judge, with an exceeding effort at dignity, "Miss S——
                  thinks that you are somewhat out of temper, and she does not like the manner in
                  which you broke off a conversation, which was interesting to her, and I have
                  volunteered my services as an umpire in the matter. Mr. Stevens can argue the case
                  on the side of Miss Lucy, and I will decide."
               "I can't have any thing to do with Mr. Stevens, Judge L——," replied Dick.
               "Why not, Mr. Wilson?"
               "Because I have the best evidence that he is not a gentleman."
               "That, Mr. Wilson, is a severe charge," said Judge L——, "to make against one of
                  the most respectable young men in the place."
               "I am prepared at any suitable time to make it good," replied Dick.
               During this brief conversation, Horace Stevens showed clearly the evidences of a
                  coward, who had courage enough to do an act of meanness, when concealed from view;
                  but not the nerve to meet a manly opponent. He was silent.
               "Judge L——," said Dick, "if I have permitted myself to be discourteous in your
                  house, without a sufficient reason for
                  doing so, I am willing to make every reasonable apology."
               "That is fair," said a gruff voice, which none of the parties could
                  distinguish.
               "Ah, Mr. Wilson," rejoined the Judge, "you say reasonable, and that
                  is a very ambiguous term; for it means almost any thing which one may choose to
                  make of it."
               "I used it, Judge," replied Dick, "in the sense in which it is understood by
                  honorable persons. I am no trickster."
               "And I am no trickster, Mr. Wilson. Now just throw it out altogether.
                  Mind, it's a lady you are settling with, and just say that you are
                  sorry for your impudence."
               "Throw it out!—make myself a fool and a slave!—put myself in a
                  position where I will dispise myself! I can't do that, Judge, and it is vain for
                  you to ask any such thing of me. Judge L——, you have given this matter an
                  importance which does not belong to it, in your own house. Will you now be kind
                  enough to state this matter clearly. I do not feel willing that a single person
                  should leave this house, under the impression that my conduct has been unbecoming.
                  I know what becomes a gentleman, here and elsewhere."
               "Not so loud, Mr. Wilson, we do not wish to be overheard."
               "Judge L——, this matter is no secret in your house, it was understood before I
                  came here, and it was nearly the first thing I heard on entering."
               "You are mistaken, Mr. Wilson."
               "I am not mistaken, sir."
               "Did Sanco say any thing to you, Mr. Wilson, when he handed you the note,"
                  inquired Miss Lucy.
               "Nothing more than was necessary in discharging his errand faithfully."
               "Did you ask him any questions?" said Horace Stevens.
               "Judge L——," replied Dick, casting a look of contempt into the eye of Horace
                  Stevens, "if you will ask that question I will answer it."
               Will you answer me, Mr. Wilson," said Miss Lucy.
               "Certainly, Miss, I will with pleasure."
               "Did you quiz Sanco in reference to that note?"
               "I did not."
               "Well, Mr. Wilson," said Judge L——, "Miss Lucy has said that you treated her
                     cavalierly."
               "Of that she must retain the liberty of forming her own opinion," said Dick.
               "Come, Mr. Wilson, just say that you are sorry, and then you and Mr. Stevens may
                  right your matter as you will."
               "I am not sorry, Judge, and as for that fellow, I can settle with him whenever he
                  may desire to do so."
            
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XII.
               THE TEMPTER FOILED.
               
                  
                     
                        "Then by a mother's sacred tear,
                        By all that memory should revere,
                        Though boon companions you may be,
                        Ah! comrades, fill no glass for me!"
                     
                  
               
               "MR. WILSON," continued the Judge, "just say that you are sorry for what you have
                  said, and this will right the whole matter, and it will be dropped at once."
               "Well, Judge," replied Dick, "when I am sorry I will so express myself. At present
                  I cannot belie my own feelings."
               "Ah! yes," said the Judge, "it's all nonsense any how; but you are a tough
                  stick—just like your preceptor; but then, Mr. Wilson, you ain't too old to bend
                  yet. Will you walk with us to the other end of the parlor?"
               "Certainly, Judge," replied Dick, with true courtesy.
               Here the trio, of which Horace Stevens was one, held their way across
                  the parlor like a triumphal cavalcade, with their fancied captive behind them.
                  Mrs. Watson, who was on this occasion one of Dick's advanced guards, understood
                  the whole matter, and knew precisely what was going on; and she knew too that her
                  presence was not wanted there. It made no difference however; she knew their plan,
                  and meant to subvert it.
               At length the company halted in front of an old fashioned, stinted looking side
                  board, which was ornamented according to no style, ancient or modern; but
                  according to the peculiar taste of the man who gave George Handy a suit of
                  clothes, and then presided at the rum meeting!
               
               Arranged on the side board in a convenient position were a few quart bottles,
                  which were naturally as green as a cucumber bed, with one elegant decanter, which
                  had been presented to the Judge by a member of Congress. The company were standing
                  with their backs to the side board when the Judge, with an assumed military air,
                  stepped before them and said—
               "Ladies and gentlemen, there has been quite an unpleasant altercation between Mr.
                  Wilson and Miss Lucy S——, and I have been laboring to bring about a settlement;
                  but I am sorry to say that I find Mr. Wilson to be really stubborn,
                  for he will make no concessions."
               "What is the charge?" exclaimed several of those who knew just as well as the
                  Judge, what was going on.
               "Miss Lucy says," replied the Judge, "that Mr. Wilson has treated her
                     cavalierly," and then drawing ing himself up with a good deal of dignity, he
                  said, "What shall be the penalty?"
               "That will depend upon the nature of the offence," said a gruff voice, which came
                  from another part of the room. This was Dick's preceptor, and he had been sitting
                  in the same position all the evening, apparently much interested with the pages of
                  an old book, over which he seemed to be poring; and as the Judge repeated the
                  question again, he called out, "Explain, explain, if you please, Judge; I can't
                  vote on this case until it is fairly defined;" and he gave himself again to the
                  book.
               "Squire B——, there is nothing serious about this matter—its all a joke, I assure
                  you," said the Judge.
               "Then," said Squire B——, raising his eyes and throwing a glance at Judge L——, the
                  meaning of which he understood; "you ought not to make of it a serious
                  matter."
               "Oh! Squire, replied the Judge, it's really nothing but a joke."
               "I am not sure of that," continued Squire B——, "and if you did not design treating
                  Mr. Wilson as a gentleman, you ought not to have asked him to your house."
               "Don't you believe me, sir?" inquired the Judge, as if such a thing would be
                  strange to him.
               "I do sometimes, sir," replied Squire B——, "but I am under no obligations to
                  believe what is not sustained by evidence."
               All this time Dick stood there, mute and motionless as a statue. His forehead was
                  pale, his cheeks were slightly crimsoned, and his lips were rigidly compressed, as
                  if he was striving to smother the indignation which was burning in his heart. He
                  remembered the rum meeting, at which he had refused to disgrace
                  himself by becoming its advocate; and he was looking for the vengeance of him whom
                  he had thus mortally offended. But in the face of this he stood the picture of
                  earthly nobleness, looking scorn and defiance at Judge L——.
               After the Judge had recovered from the entanglements into which Dick's preceptor
                  had thrown him, he called out again, "What shall be the penalty?" and was
                  instantly replied to by one of the board, "A glass of wine with Miss
                  Lucy."
               At this moment, by what was doubtless a preconcerted arrangement, two young
                     gentlemen and two young ladies—they were called so by
                  a portion of the community where Judge L—— resided—presented themselves before the
                  company with a supply of cake and wine.
               "By my word," said the Judge, looking meaningly at Horace Stevens, "this is
                  precisely what we wanted, and yet this way of settling a difficulty did not occur
                  to me at all."
               "That is remarkable," said Squire B——.
               "What is remarkable, sir?" said the Judge, impatiently.
               "No consequence at all," said Squire B——.
               
               "This is it precisely, Mr. Wilson," said the Judge, taking a tumbler in his hand
                  and holding it before Dick, and then adding, "now oblige me, Mr. Wilson, by
                  drinking to the health and happiness of Miss Lucy."
               "I have no objection, Judge," said Dick, "to make friends if we are enemies, in a
                  rational manner, but as to drinking friends, I will not do it—I will not run any
                  risks. I have been sufficiently warned in and out of your house."
               "You do not think, Mr. Wilson, that I have drugged it?"
               "I don't know as to that, Judge, but I do know that to render it
                  poisonous drugging is unnecessary."
               "Well," said the Judge, "Miss Lucy, you must settle this difficulty yourself."
               "It can't be settled by you, Judge, in this or any other way."
               The tumblers were given to Miss Lucy, and turning to Dick, she said—"Mr. Wilson, I
                  am sorry that without the least provocation, you have permitted your temper to
                  become ruffled this evening; and by doing so, you have cast an unpleasant gloom
                  over all the company. Now, Mr. Wilson, take this glass, and let us drink to each
                  other's future happiness, and then it will go merrily around, and all will be
                  smooth again."
               "I hope, Miss," replied Dick, in a very gentlemanly, yet very firm manner, "that
                  if the pleasure of the company has beon for one moment interrupted, that you will
                  not insinuate that I am in the least degree accountable for it. I will drink no
                  wine this night, and I beseech you to desist from further offers of this
                  kind."
               "Are you a temperance man?" inquired Miss Lucy.
               "Yes, I am," said Dick, "both from principle and necessity."
               "Well, so far as principle is concerned, I guess we are all about in the same fix;
                  but we don't know anything about necessity."
               "You may know something about it, Miss Lucy," said Dick.
               "Oh!" continued she, "a great many things may be. I suppose Parson Smith is trying
                  to work you into a teetotaler. Have you any other objections beside your necessity
                  and Parson Smith?"
               "Yes, Miss Lucy," said Dick, "I have a poor mother;" and then, for the first time,
                  the tears came to his eyes.
               "Any other reason, Mr. Wilson?"
               "I have a dear sister, beautiful in heart and form, who would tremble
                  if she were here now; and I have a little brother; and these, in my heart, have a
                  richness which the wine-cup would dissipate; for so it was with my father."
               "What more?" said Miss Lucy.
               "They are poor, Miss Lucy; and I am their dependence—their hope—the object of
                  their daily prayers—and the only one to
                  whom they can look for protection; and I must not, will not be
                  tempted, while I am in my right mind," and then returned to his seat.
               To all appearance the party went on pleasantly; but every one who knew Judge L——,
                  saw disappointment in his countenance; and the general opinion of those who could
                  only conjecture, was that this gathering was got up with the view of entrapping
                  Dick, to reward him for his refusal to take part in the rum meeting.
               "Mr. Wilson," said a gentleman, by the side of whom Dick had seated himself, "you
                  managed to run the gauntlet pretty well."
               "It was very difficult for me to do so," said Dick, and then continued—"if it had
                  been Judge L—— alone, I could have got along finely; but to thrust a young lady
                  into the work, was very mean in Judge L——; but then I fancy their profits are
                  small this time."
               "You can't tell, Mr. Wilson, what the profits are. Judge L—— is a strange man, and
                  no one can tell where he makes or loses. He is one of those men who can forget a
                  kindness very soon, but who never forgets an insult."
               "Do you think I insulted him?" said Dick.
               "He will so interpret it. He defines every thing by his feelings, and nothing by
                  his judgment; and he can carry the appearance of friendship, until the very moment
                  when he is ready for vengeance. It would have been better for you, my young
                  friend, to have tasted that wine; for it would have made your
                  situation much safer, inasmuch as you would not have incurred his hate."
               "I think that was secured before this evening," said Dick.
               "Mr. Wilson, I am far from being in favor of intemperance—indeed, I am an
                  out-and-out temperance man from principle; but in this case, I really
                  think that a few drops—not enough to hurt a child—while it would have done you no
                  harm, would at all events have secured you the sympathy of most of the company;
                  and for the present it would have appeased Judge L——."
               "Your philosophy," said Dick, "will only hold good as a trap; for the theory of
                  drops, if you will observe, is the silent yet potent cause of much mischief. You
                  have seen accounts of those sliding glaciers, and dashing snow slides of the Alps
                  and Pyrenees, with the havoc they have made, as they leaped from crag to crag,
                  overtaking the swift-footed chamois in their descending fury. There was a time,
                  sir, when that mighty avalanche was but a snow flake; yet the aggregation of these
                  is found sufficient to overwhelm with ruin, the pleasant valley which lay beneath
                  them. Mark the path along which the avalanche has gone, and it will occur to you
                  in a moment, that there was a time when it was fair and beautiful—when it was
                  rejoicing in the peaceful possession of whatever God had given to adorn its being. It is not so now, and why? A
                  single drop fell upon that rocky bosom, and was frozen into ice. It remained.
                  Another and another came, and remained; and then the gently rippling stream—and
                  all the while the frost was fixing them to its bosom. At length the deep
                  foundations of the rock gave way, and precipitated a tempest of ruin into the
                  valley beneath—a melancholy emblem of the desolation wrought by intemperance. I am
                  very well satisfied that the avalanche, which by the succession of drops is formed
                  in nature, is a very faint type of the desolating character of the avalanche which
                  the single drop you recommended may form; and which in its falling—for that is
                  almost inevitable—will necessarily tear and drag out every root, flower and twig
                  which may be there—yes, every thing with which God has adorned and
                  dignified intelligent beings—and in its course it will desolate the last green
                  spot which misfortune still cherishes. I think, sir, your philosophy of drops only
                  leads to quarts and gallons—to the open door of infamy, disgrace and ruin.
               "Oh yes, Mr. Wilson, I understand you; but my philosophy is, that men ought to
                  govern themselves. They ought not to permit themselves to get beyond proper bounds
                  in any indulgence! I am a temperance man from principle, and not from
                     slavery. I believe in men taking things when they need them, and
                  letting them alone when they do not need them."
               "Every one cannot do this," replied Dick, "and those who are not absolutely
                  certain that they have strength of resolution to do so, had better resist it
                  entirely. The celebrated Dr. Rush, of Philadelphia, would not even administer it
                  as medicine—not because it might not be instrumental in removing some diseases;
                  but from the fear that it might implant a deeper and more deadly one; and he gave
                  as a reason for doing so, that he did not want a single one, in the day of God's
                  judgment, to rise up and charge him with having made him a drunkard! And now let
                  me ask you, sir, will they stand in that same audience who do not
                  administer it as medicine, but for gain to themselves—those who never
                  cure, but always kill! The professional rumseller! what will he do
                  there, as he rises in the midst of the ruin he has made upon the earth?"
               "Oh, yes; I see now, Mr. Wilson. It's very plain. I might have seen it sooner—that
                  you have got the same absurd notions into your head, which are absolutely crazing
                  some people. Mr. Smith, our minister, is getting the very same notions, and I am
                  sorry for you both, for it will use you up here."
               "These notions," replied Dick, "did not craze George Handy; and it
                  would be a fine thing for the community if Mr. Smith, the rumseller, could get the
                  same notions."
               "Well, Mr. Wilson, if Parson Smith don't keep quiet, he can't stay
                  here long—he is the people's servant."
               
               "But not the rumsellers," said Dick, and then continued—"What objection have you
                  to Mr. Smith?"
               "He don't preach the gospel, sir."
               "Your understanding of the gospel and his may be very different. Mr. Smith is a
                  fine scholar, and makes it his study; and it is fairly to be presumed that he
                  understands it."
               "You are mistaken, Mr. Wilson. I guess I know what is gospel just as well as
                  Parson Smith, and I have just sent for a commentary, that will give me light on
                  the Bible."
               "What work is that, sir?"
               "It's called Csar's Commentary, and I suppose it's a first rate
                  exposition of what gospel is!"
               "I apprehend," said Dick, smiling at the man's unusual intelligence, "that you
                  will not find much gospel there."
               "Have you read it, Mr. Wilson?"
               "Yes, sir."
               "Of what subjects does he treat most particularly?"
               "Of his wars, the countries through which he passed, the difficulties he
                  encountered, and his victories, as well as many things about the ancient Roman
                  commonwealth."
               "Has he no gospel in his book?"
               "Not a bit, sir, that I could see."
               "Wasn't he an old Roman Catholic Father?"
               "No, sir, he was an old Roman General, and not so very old either—I should think
                  not so old as yourself."
               "Good Lord! Mr. Wilson, if you don't astonish me. Some one told me a very
                  different thing; but then, Mr. Smith don't preach the gospel, any how, for he is
                  eternally at the rumsellers. Why, Mr. Wilson, I heard him say myself,
                  from the pulpit, that sooner than see his daughter the wife of a drunkard, he
                  would rejoice to see her in the coffin! Did you ever hear such a wicked
                  expression?"
               "I am not able to see any thing so horrid in that," replied Dick, "for I suppose
                  he only meant that he would rather see his daughter breathe her last in his
                  presence, and amidst the associations of his own home, than to have her a
                  drunkard's wife, at the mercy of the rumsellers, as poor Handy's was, and then die
                  at last at their hands, as his did, leaving a child to attract the finger of
                  scorn. I have a sister, and rather than see her situated thus, I should prefer to
                  bear her to the tomb."
               This gentleman, whose intelligence has been seen, had been put in
                  nomination by the rumsellers of B—— and their friends, for the Legislature; and
                  unfortunately for the cause of temperance and good society, he had been elected.
                  He was regarded by many as being the counterpart of the Irishman's
                     cow-bell—'a long-tongued, empty-headed thing,'—and withal, he
                  fancied himself fit for greater honors than this. In fact, he was just the kind
                     of man who could serve the
                  rumsellers with canine fidelity.
               Mr. Watson, who was overhearing all this conversation, and admiring Dick's
                  firmness, at last said to this gentleman—
               "Mr. Anderson, if the Maine law should come before the Legislature, which way
                  would you throw your influence?"
               Mr. Anderson looked very much as if he was trying to satisfy his own mind as to
                  which side would pay the best price, or give the surest promises of a re-election,
                  and then said—"That would depend entirely upon circumstances."
               "What circumstances, Mr. Anderson?" said Mr. Watson.
               "Well, sir, the shape, and the party which brought it
                  up. If it came up in a way that would stop the business entirely, I would vote
                  against it. I think I should—I don't know. And if it was brought up by the
                  opposite party in politics, why then I am sure I would."
               "If you brought it up yourself, how would you vote then?"
               "There is no danger of that, sir; I'll never bring such an unpopular thing as that
                  up."
               "Suppose, Mr. Anderson, your constituents should unequivocally express it as being
                  the wish of a large portion of them, that you should do so, what would you do
                  then?"
               "I don't know what I should do, Mr. Watson."
               Mr. Watson could get nothing out of Mr. Anderson, except, I don't know, it
                     depends on circumstances, &c., and gave him over again to Dick.
               "I am told, Mr. Wilson," said Mr. Anderson, "that you think of opening an office
                  in this place, after your admission. Now let me give you some advice which may be
                  for your good, as young men don't always know what is best for them. I would
                  advise you, when you are called on again, as you were by Judge L—— and Mr.
                  Stevens, to deliver an address—to do so. You will lose nothing by it;
                  and if you were to make a speech in favor of rumsellers, that would not compel you
                  to drink their rum. At such a time as this, Mr. Wilson, you ought not to refuse
                  the civilities of the house; but you ought to eat and drink such
                  things as are set before you, asking no questions for politeness sake. Now that is
                  gospel, Mr. Wilson. Just see, if you had tasted that wine to-night, how pleasantly
                  every thing would have gone off. When a friend meets you in the street, and asks
                  you to walk into a hotel and take something, why, do so! it won't hurt you, and it
                  will greatly increase your popularity, and, by the by, what's best of all, it will
                  increase your chances in political life. Ah! Mr. Wilson, you are not through yet.
                  There comes the Judge and Horace Stevens."
               Dick turned his head and saw them by his side.
               "Mr. Wilson," said Judge L——, "we have called to give you another opportunity to
                  make an apology to Miss Lucy before the
                  company quits the house."
               "Come, come, Judge," said Dick, "let us drop this matter. Sit down and we will
                  talk it off."
               "No, Mr. Wilson, you must apologize or—"
               "Or what, Judge?"
               "I will consider you as intentionally insulting myself and guests."
               "Judge L——, let me tell you now that I did not intend to, and did not insult
                  either yourself or your guests, or your house; and with this explanation you are
                  at liberty to draw such conclusions as you may choose. I have not been sleeping
                  since I came here, but I have been watching every thing; and my ears have not been
                  closed either; and I now tell yourself and Horace Stevens that your low
                  trickery—your stealthy whispers, and your wine cups have all been understood. I
                  was hardly seated before it was evident to me that I had been brought here to be
                  insulted, and only because I refused to occupy a position at your rum meeting,
                  which, as Squire B—— said in your hearing, would have made me falsify my own
                  convictions and play the hypocrite. I have heard Horace Stevens and this same Miss
                  Lucy speculating on my poverty in your hearing, and with your approbation; and now
                  let me tell you that I believe this whole matter has been planned by yourself. A
                  man in your position, Judge L——, ought to be ashamed to be so wedded to the rum
                  interest as you are, and you ought to have too much nobleness, merely for the sake
                  of rum, to wreak your vengeance on one who has already been so deeply afflicted by
                  it. I am poor, Judge L——, but I have never asked a favor of you yet. I came to
                  your village to do what your friends, the rumsellers, prevented me
                  from doing under more favorable circumstances. I am poor—yes, as it has been said
                  in your house tonight—'a book-keeper.' I am willing to do any thing
                  that is honorable for the sake of those whom I love. But, Judge L——, if I am poor,
                  you cannot shake me. I despise your meanness, and now I leave your house to enter
                  it no more."
               Dick walked quietly out of the room in which the apologist for rum would have
                  offered him up freely as a victim, although helplessness was clinging to him for
                  protection.
               What boots it to the rumseller and his friends who falls? What do they care whose
                  heart is broken? What value do they set upon tears which are scalding the cheeks
                  of the widow and her orphans? Ah! yes, and what do they care for the partial
                  restraints which the law now imposes upon their business? For these things they
                  care nothing; and partial legislation has proved itself to be what the pruning
                  hook is to the hedge—it gives it room to expand and to flourish! Let the axe
                     be laid at the root of the tree, and like the Trojan horse, they will
                  unbosom their instruments of death, and give up their power to afflict
                  mankind!
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIII.
               THE MAINE LAW.—LEGISLATIVE JUGGLING.
               
                  
                     
                        "Is this, O life, is this thy boasted prime?
                        And does thy spring no happier prospect yield?
                        Why gilds the vernal sun thy gaudy clime,
                        When nipping mildews waste the flowery field?"
                     
                  
               
               ON a bright afternoon in the winter of 183—, a company of gentlemen were seen
                  emerging from a carriage at the door of one of the first hotels in the capital of
                  ——. In almost any other place than in the capital of one of the largest and most
                  influential states of the Union, their appearance would have attracted a large
                  share of the popular curiosity; and even as it was, they did not entirely escape
                  notice. So far as the appearance was concerned, it pointed them out as being men
                  of wealth; and this of course procured for them the extra civilities and
                  accommodations of the house.
               In the parlor of this house, and before a cheerful fire, these gentlemen seemed to
                  be enjoying themselves. After some private conversation with each other, in which
                  each seemed to be deeply interested, one of them rose and left the room, and
                  almost immediately returned, carrying in his hand a list of the members of the
                  Legislature.
               "Ah!" said one, as he entered, "give us you yet for an emergency. Henderson, we
                  can't fail when you lead."
               "Well," said another, "if money will do any thing, we can accomplish our object
                  here very soon. We have, you know, the privilege from those who sent us here to
                  try its virtue to any extent."
               "It is true," said Mr. Henderson, "that those who sent us here have given us the
                  privilege of using their money freely. Necessity has made them remarkably generous
                  just now; but still, for our own interests, we must move cautiously. We must not
                  forget, gentlemen, that there are some who are always looking for emergencies in
                  the affairs of others, that they may turn them to their own advantage. We must
                  keep cool, and so far as possible, we must keep our anxiety to ourselves."
               In this company there was one whose appearance contrasted strangely with his
                  companions. They were men in the prime and vigor of life; but he was a man of
                  seventy years, and of venerable appearance. But if he contrasted strangely with
                  his companions, his appearance and his years contrasted mournfully with his
                  mission.
               "It will be important for us," said the old gentleman, "to meet the members
                  privately at their rooms, that no suspicion of our business may be excited. I have
                  had much experience in legislative lobbying, and have always found this to be
                  decidedly the best course. We must meet each night to compare notes of the day's success, and to prepare our future
                  plans. This meeting must be held at a late hour, for most of our work is to be
                  done after the adjournment of the House. We can then have the undivided attention
                  of those whose influence we hope to secure; and the members at this time are also
                  much more approachable, being mellowed by the influences
                  which we know full well how to employ. We must be more circumspect than were our
                  friends at their late meeting in New-York. In their excitement they committed many
                  egregious blunders—blunders, the effect of which it will cost us much labor to
                  repair."
               "I am very sorry," said Mr. Henderson, "that we were foolish enough to sanction
                  the proceedings of that ridiculous meeting, whose representatives in fact we
                  are."
               "To what item in the proceedings do you refer particularly, Mr. Henderson?" said
                  one.
               "Proscribing the leading journal in the city. That, you may rely upon it, was a
                  short-sighted piece of business, and it did us more harm at home, and it will do
                  us more harm all over the State, than any thing that we did there. This foolish,
                  ill-advised act has given the editor a double power to operate against us; and you
                  are aware that we can get no counterbalancing editorial aid. I am heartily sorry
                  that we sanctioned any such proceeding as that."
               "Yes," was the general rejoinder, "that was a great mistake; but after all, in
                  such a promiscuous gathering, it is well that nothing worse was done."
               "You may well say promiscuous," said Mr. Henderson, "for such a gathering I never
                  saw before; and it would be an important matter that would lead me into such a
                     bedlam again. Really, gentlemen, there are features in our mission
                  which are not over and above creditable; but we must hide them if we can."
               "Come, come," said the old man, "we must not spend our time in this way—let us sit
                  up to the table and examine this list, that we may know at once where and with
                  whom our business is to be transacted."
               One of them took the roll and commenced a careful examination, and occasionally
                  marking a name with his pencil. When he reached the end he looked up with an air
                  of satisfaction and said, "I think I have the matter arranged now, in a manner
                  that will point out to us at once in what quarter our business lies."
               "Let me see the roll," said Henderson; and then after a moment's examination he
                  said, with apparent dissatisfaction, "This won't do at all."
               "Why not?" said the gentleman who had pointed out, as he thought, so distinctly
                  the whole course.
               "Because," said Henderson, "you have the names of persons here whom we could
                  neither flatter nor bribe into our service."
               "Let me see the list," said the old gentleman; and after eyeing it closely for some time, he
                  continued: "This will never do. There are names here that we can't get. We might
                  as well try to enlist in our favor Neal Dow, or White, or Snow, or any of that
                  class. It will not do for us, gentlemen, to make a single mistake in this matter;
                  and as we are strangers here, if we are not exceedingly careful, we will be very
                  apt to disclose our plans to some who are our enemies, and be quite certain of
                  defeat."
               At this juncture there was some beating about and changing of plans, and it was
                  finally thought best, in order to understand fully the complexion of the
                  Legislature, to hold an evening's consultation with a member, whom they knew by
                  reputation to be favorable to their plans.
               They accordingly met him in the evening and were pleased to find him a man of
                  imposing personal appearance, surrounded with the evidence of ease and
                  extravagance, and withal an air of calmness, which made their approach
                  comparatively easy. They at once introduced themselves as the agents of the
                  rumsellers of all classes in their great city.
               "Ah! yes," replied the legislator, "I believe I have had some correspondence with
                  some gentlemen of your city on this subject; and to be candid with you, gentlemen,
                  I am afraid there is little hope for the rum traffic. My opinion is, that before
                  the adjournment of the present Legislature, this whole matter will go by the
                  board. I don't believe that any thing can save it; and those who value their
                  reputation more than their money, must keep their hands out of it, or they also
                  will go overboard."
               "What grounds have you for thinking so?" said the old gentleman.
               "I will tell you, sir," was the reply, "and then you will be able to decide for
                  yourself whether I am correct or not in my opinion. You are probably aware that
                  you have not at this moment, nor can you enlist into your service any respectable
                  public journal. They are all on the other side, and represent not only the wishes
                  but the will of the people, which is manifestly against you and the whole traffic,
                  and in favor of its being made, by stringent legislation, a penal
                     offence. There are at this moment petitions to this effect in the State
                  House, containing nearly four hundred thousand names; and they present a most
                  striking fact, which is this: these petitions represent the orderly and
                  respectable portion of the community; and these evident demonstrations of the
                  people's will in the matter, cannot be lightly considered or turned
                  aside. Now, as to their right to make known their will in this way, there can be
                  no question, nor as to the great force of their arguments. There are about
                  twenty-five thousand drunkards in this State alone, who, in connection with the
                  business in its wholesale and retail character, costs the State annually millions
                  upon millions of money—a fact we cannot gainsay; and when dollars and cents are swollen into immense
                  amounts, that is an argument which the people can understand; and if we add to
                  this the poverty and suffering, the vice and crime which the friends of temperance
                  represent as flowing from the rum traffic, you can readily see what we have to
                  contend against. I don't know what may be the popular feeling of your city `in
                  reference to this matter, but certainly, gentlemen, if you have any friends there,
                  they ought to speak out—NOW is the time for them to do so. If you remain here a
                  few days, you will soon understand the feeling of the State upon this subject, for
                  the name of Maine is about as familiar and as popular here in these
                  days, as the name of Tippecanoe was twelve years since. In fact, every thing is
                  cut and squared according to the proportions of the 'Maine law.' The practical
                  workings of that law, in the State of Maine, have so far been highly favorable to
                  temperance. In that State the expressed will of the people was carried out, and
                  the traffic in rum was placed upon the statute by the side of other
                     crimes, and the rumseller by the side of other
                     criminals. The aggregate expenses of the State of Maine have been
                  in a few months decreased in an unexampled ratio, and the decrease in expenditure
                  has not been the only advantage derived from it. It has been confidently asserted
                  on the floor of the House, that everywhere throughout that State it has diminished
                  greatly the consumption of intoxicating drinks, and the evils inseparable from
                  that consumption have of course ceased. You can see the advantage they have over
                  us in this contest. Millions of money are foolishly expended in this State—our
                  asylums are crowded—our prisons filled to overflowing, and victims for the
                  scaffold are many and frightful.
               "The Maine law has produced a different result. It is conclusively shown to have
                  diminished taxation, crime, pauperism and misery, and to have introduced hope and
                  happiness into thousands of desponding hearts and desolated homes. If it were not
                  for this standing demonstration, you might hope to succeed; but as it is, it is in
                  your way, and will be whichever way you turn."
               "Can't we double the cape of Maine," said Mr. Henderson, smiling,
                  "and get 'round by some kind of legislative strategy?"
               "I should rather attempt," replied the legislator, "to double Cape Horn in a
                  skiff. I tell you, gentlemen, it will take steady sailing and a practised helmsman
                  to go safely through such a sea as this; and I am not aware of any kind of
                  legislative manœuvering by which your interests could possibly be secured. Do you
                  know, gentlemen, with any kind of certainty, how Pennsylvania will decide upon
                  this question?"
               "It will be very close," replied Mr. Henderson, "one or two votes either way may
                  decide the matter. We are in constant communication with Philadelphia, and are
                  assured that nothing by which they can
                  hope to influence the Legislature, will be left undone. It is, however, very
                  uncertain."
               "That is just what I supposed. The people are waking up every where; and so far as
                  Pennsylvania is concerned—in view of expenditure, drunkards, crime and
                     poverty—she is not a whit behind this state; but as yet I believe she
                  has not disgraced any spot within her dominions by the appropriation of it
                     to a mass rum meeting! How does the matter stand with
                  Massachusetts?"
               "Massachusetts and Rhode Island," replied the old gentleman, "are about as good as
                  gone. The Bostonian rum manufacturers and dealers do not appear to manage well;
                  they are too saving of their money; and I am convinced that the time has now come
                  when nothing but money can save us."
               The mention of money only enabled the legislator to see new difficulties in the
                  case, and he continued—
               "Now, gentlemen, if you are not willing that the wish of the people should be
                  carried out, by the enactment of the 'Maine law' in this State, what would you be
                  willing to give them in its stead?"
               "Oh, good heavens!" said the venerable old man, "any thing but the 'Maine law,'
                  for that is the worst; and anything else will be better."
               The old gentleman betrayed, contrary to his wish and that of Henderson, the great
                  anxiety which they had upon this subject, and he exclaimed again—
               "Give them?—we will give them the old, the new, and all the excise
                  laws linked together! Any thing under the heavens but the 'Maine law,' for there
                  is no getting around that."
               "They make a strong plea on this count, gentlemen; for they say, publicly and
                  privately, in and out of the House, that you have violated every pledge you ever
                  made; and that in spite of all they could do, you have overreached and abused
                  them."
               "That is what we still desire to do," said Mr. Henderson, and added—"There never
                  has been an excise law framed yet, by any Legislature, which could not be evaded;
                  and that accounts for the liberality of my aged friend, in offering any thing else
                  than the 'Maine law.' If the spirit of existing excise laws could be carried out,
                  they would destroy rumselling; but the administrators of the law easily evade its
                  provisions, and here is where all excise laws lose their spirit and
                  force, and if the thing can rest here, we shall be satisfied. There are many
                  excise boards in this State, from whom the privilege to traffic in rum can be
                  obtained for a small price. The promise of a vote, or of influence at a coming
                  election, will sway them. For a liberal fee I would show the way to get around any
                  excise law that any Legislature might make, short of the 'Maine law,' and then, I
                  must confess, that my skill as a pilot ends?"
               "Yes, Mr. Henderson," replied the legislator, "you understand the matter; and I
                  have no doubt that more than one half
                  of the rum sold in the State, is sold fraudulently."
               "You are right, sir; but then, in order to secure your success, you would, in the
                  first place, at your town elections, secure a rum excise board; and this matter is
                  generally quite easily accomplished."
               "The excise boards in this State have proved utterly inefficient. In many
                  instances the rumselling influence has created them, and then the rumsellers, high
                  and low, have used them at their pleasure; and just where rum drinking was a
                  special curse, there they permitted it to be poured out freely, and by men, too,
                  of abandoned characters.
               "Instead, therefore, of any improvements the advocates of the 'Maine law' say that
                  matters are growing worse—that those who are engaged in the traffic are pushing it
                  on with more recklessness and success than ever before; and that they have no
                  reason to hope that it will ever be better, while the law vests its control in the
                  hands of those whose governing principle is self-interest. You know, gentlemen,
                  that for the most part all the excise laws of this State have been so tortured in
                  the hands of those to whom their execution has been entrusted, that they have
                  become a mere farce—a world-wide burlesque!
               "It is so, also, in States where licences are granted by a different process. Take
                  Pennsylvania for example: In that State licences are granted in open court, on an
                  application to which twelve repectable pectable signatures are appended, setting
                  forth the good moral character of the applicant, his reputation for temperance and
                  sobriety, together with the absolute necessity, that in a particular location it
                  is necessary for the well-being of the community, that rum be
                  sold!
               "One would think that in Pennsylvania the business was pretty well guarded,
                  inasmuch as this privilege is vested in the judgment of twelve respectable
                  citizens—neighbors of the applicant, who are supposed to know that what they
                  certify of him is true. Facts, however, prove that there is no safety
                  even with this security. They show that even good citizens may be influenced and
                  warped to such an extent by surrounding circumstances, that they have not the
                  courage to say that they cannot in any way abet in the traffic! With
                  all the precaution which hedges about even the incipient steps of procuring
                  license to sell rum in Pennsylvania, many unprincipled men—men of depraved moral
                  character, can get twelve citizens to vouch for them, and the courts seldom take
                  the trouble to inquire into the matter, and these men are permitted to establish
                  themselves according to law, to violate law every day of their lives!
               "In a large, influential and wealthy district in Pennsylvania, the people were
                  taken by surprise when the presiding Judge, who had just been elected to the
                  bench, in charging the grand jury, alluded to the deception practiced upon courts
                  by false representations sentations,
                  and announced it as his purpose, when he had the least suspicion in reference to
                  applicants, to bring their vouchers into court, and see if they would say the same
                  thing under the solemnity of an oath. This was taking the matter at once by the
                  ears, and is a noble example which those in like circumstances might imitate; and
                  they would do themselves no injury by following the precedent. Courts seem almost
                  entirely to forget the importance of this matter to the individual and general
                  interests of the commonwealth. If a deed for twenty-five acres of mountain land is
                  brought into court as evidence in any case, it is closely examined. The same thing
                  is true in reference to a will or a deposition; but an application for a tavern
                  license—the granting of which is, in many cases, the greatest affliction under
                  which a community could suffer—very often when the paper is closed, the court
                  could not mention two of the appended names, on the integrity or veracity of which
                  they have granted the license; and the same loose administration of the law which
                  governs the rum traffic here governs it there, and renders it almost a nullity. I
                  must confess, gentlemen, that the more I look into this subject, the greater the
                  difficulties become. Arrayed against us are the women and children, and they are
                  lifting up a voice which will make itself heard. You might just as well try to
                  stifle the thunders of Niagara as to hush the plaintive wail which they are
                  sending up to legislative halls. It is becoming louder and louder, and soon their
                  united voices will be against you, and then you might as well try to stand upon
                  the heavings of an earthquake, as to attempt to oppose their
                  influence. They do not spend their strength for money or for popularity. It is in
                  one mighty plea for mercy!"
               "Ah! yes," said the old man, "but it is a morbid public sentiment which permits
                  them to take their position on this ground, in reference to the 'Maine law.'"
               "They are the sufferers," replied the legislator, "and ought to be heard. It is
                  equally a duty and pleasure with them to effect those reforms which the law
                  permits, and if there be any work on earth in which they have a right to take
                  part, it is this, unquestionably."
               "What is the complexion of the Legislature on this question?" inquired Mr.
                  Henderson.
               "That I cannot tell, sir; but if they follow the wishes of their constituents,
                  they are fairly against you."
               "Well," said he, addressing his brethren, "we may as well give it up, and return
                  home in the morning, for if matters stand in this way, the case is hopeless."
               This legislator was a shrewd man, and he understood well that the philosophy of
                  getting a handsome fee was to represent the difficulties in the case as great as
                  possible, and he let them go, being assured sured in his own mind, that they would call again
                  in the morning.
               So far as he had gone on one side, his representations were true to the life, and
                  would have produced a fine effect if he had possessed the courage to have shaken
                  off the rumseller's influence and advanced them independently in his place. But
                  this, unfortunately for himself and his constituents, he had not the magnanimity
                  to do.
               They met in caucus again that night. They were disappointed.
               "Perhaps," said the old gentleman, "we missed our man after all, but if the case
                  stands as he said, it is rather dark for us; and he seems to understand himself
                  pretty well."
               "Yes, so he does," replied Mr. Henderson, "remarkably well, but no better than I
                  understand him, and I am just as sure of his influence as if I saw it operating
                  already. We must move very cautiously. All he will do will be done behind the
                  door; that man will never come to the light in this matter—mark that!"
               After repeated consultations with this gentleman and other legislative
                  dignitaries, these commissioners of the rumsellers returned home, fully assured
                  that the 'Maine law' would find all kinds of underhanded obstacles to contend
                  with.
               This proved to be true, for a system of patching upon it embarrassing amendments
                  killed it, and thewish of the people in the matter was overruled by
                  the influence of a few princely rumsellers. The same thing will be tried again and
                  again, and only the uncompromising vigilance of the people can prevent a
                  recurrence of the same result. The rumselling influence will do every thing to
                  clog the wheels of legislation on this subject—they will leave nothing undone.
                  They will compass sea and land to keep the privilege of selling rum; and the only
                  way in which this tide of perfidy can be arrested is for the people to see to it,
                  that those whom they select to frame their laws, shall be men whose sympathies are
                  on the side of right, and who in the discharge of the sacred duties of law-makers
                  shall be governed by the honest convictions of their judgment, and not by fear of
                  the apprehended frown of the maker, seller or drinker of rum.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIV.
               THE DROVER'S GRAVE.—"MURDER WILL OUT."
               
                  
                     
                        "Remember Heaven has an avenging rod;
                        To smite the poor is treason against God!"
                     
                  
               
               THE signal triumph of Dick Wilson at the house of Judge L—— over the temptations
                  by which he was beset, soon became generally known, to the great annoyance of
                  Judge L—— and those who were associated with him. Dick's course was generally
                  approved by the inhabitants of the village, even by those whose characters were
                  the reverse of his own; for consistency and firmness in the right always command
                  the respect even of the vile. To some, however, it seemed to be strange and
                  unnatural that a young man and a lawyer in prospect should be so unsocial in his
                  habits as thus to refuse the civilities of Judge L——'s house. Others did not see
                  fit to call the lure of wine by that courteous name, and admired the courage which
                  had so signally resisted the wiles and enticements of that night. As a consequence
                  of this noble resistance, every family in the village which prized virtue, or
                  valued peace, or cherished love, or feared God, took occasion to speak in his
                  praise, and never said to their sons or daughters, 'You had better not become
                  intimate with Mr. Wilson until you know more about his character.'
               One single exhibition of true nobleness, as it gushes forth freely and warmly from
                  the heart, untrammelled by artificial laws, will do more to beget the abiding
                  confidence of other hearts than all the blandishments of artifice and duplicity
                  which the most practiced may employ.
               Every one now, with the exception of the rumsellers and their adherents, was
                  gratified with this exhibition of Dick's character. Those who had heretofore been
                  indifferent, not knowing but he might turn out as the majority of young men there
                  had hitherto done, after they saw him shake the viper into the fire, instinctively
                  turned to regard him as the nucleus about which large prospects of future
                  usefulness were gathering, and which promised to do much in wiping reproach from
                  their village and securing the interests of their children from the poluting
                  social influences which had too long held sway among them. It was generally
                  understood that Dick intended locating himself in their midst, and that
                  immediately after his admission to the bar, it was his intention, through the
                  persuasion of Mr. Watson and others, to bring the wreck of his family there to
                  reside. To many this was cheering intelligence. They thought he had passed
                  successfully the most dangerous temptation which was likely to beset him, and they would freely exchange the
                  entire rum interest of the village for the mother and sister and brother of that
                  Spartan youth. To the plainest question, however, there are usually two sides, on
                  each of which will be found arrayed those of opposite opinions, interests and
                  tastes. It was so here, with the exception of Jacobs, who seemed to occupy rather
                  anomalous ground, being strictly identified neither with the rum interest nor its
                  opponents. With this exception, the question of Dick's permanent residence among
                  them was looked upon by his friends with hope, and by his enemies with fear and
                  disfavor. His refusal to speak at their rum meeting, to act as secretary for them,
                  and last of all, to drink at the house of Judge L——, had fixed the hate of the
                  latter, and they lost no opportunity to show it, and the combined influences of
                  the bar-room and the gambling-cellar were resorted to in order to prejudice his
                  interests.
               Persecution has often a sickening effect upon the heart; yet it is sometimes
                  overbalanced by its salutary consequences. Its effects are much like those of the
                  crucible: it distinguishes between the false and the true, pointing out those in
                  whom confidence may be safely reposed, as well as those who are unworthy of
                  it.
               The man who by long acquaintance has familiarized himself with the scenes
                  attendant upon the rum traffic—with the want, the misery, the suffering, the
                  horror that are daily before him whose daily bread is purchased with widows' sighs
                  and orphans' tears,—such a man, if not fully prepared for 'treason and murder,' is
                  emphatically ripe for 'strategy and spoils.' Human sympathy or respect for the
                  common rights of his fellows, have no place in his bosom. If men or measures come
                  in conflict with his vocation, he is equally unscrupulous of the merit of the one
                  or the justice of the other. His time, his talents, his means, and all the arts
                  which ingenuity and depravity can suggest, are industriously employed to maintain
                  himself and to circumvent those who would rid society of his pestilent
                  influence.
               Mr. Stevens, the superannuated rumseller and knight of the 'old stone house,' was
                  the ostensible leader of Dick's enemies, and he was often heard to swear that he
                  should never locate among them. The threats of this poor old creature, however,
                  who had been worn out in the service of rum and the crimes which grow out of it,
                  did not intimidate Dick in the least, but rather tended to arouse him to new
                  exertion. It was evident that his hopes were becoming brighter as the time of his
                  admission drew nearer.
               Perhaps you know, reader, the strange power which the anticipation of future
                  happiness has over the soul—how it can people the most bleak and desolate path in
                  life with new and beautiful creatures, which are so near akin to reality that
                     the heart loves to dwell upon them,
                  and around them its affections linger peacefully. Such were the feelings with
                  which Mrs. Wilson and Eliza were awaiting the admission of the son and brother to
                  the bar, and such were the feelings and the hopes which he was straining every
                  nerve to meet, and for the accomplishment of which he had toiled for many years.
                  Their happiness was the light and the life of his existence—the centre about which
                  all his hopes clustered. Amongst those who were lovely, to him they were the
                  lovliest, and every image which his imagination could paint was imperfect without
                  them.
               One day, while Dick was standing at the door of the office, he observed a
                  gentleman alighting from a gig in front of Mr. Jacobs' hotel; and as Sam was about
                  to drive the horse to the stable, he heard the gentleman say that he should
                  probably remain a few days, and wished to have good care taken of the horse. This
                  gentleman was apparently thirty-five years of age, with form and features finely
                  developed. For several days this stranger was seen passing through the streets,
                  and he was not known to have spoken to any one but Mr. Jacobs since he entered the
                  village. It was supposed at first that he was a collecting merchant from
                  Philadelphia, but that opinion soon passed away, and his business for the time was
                  unknown. On the third day after his arrival, Mr. Jacobs met Dick in the street,
                  and spoke of the singularity of his guest, and remarked at the same time that
                  although he appeared to have no business, yet his opinion was that he had some
                  very important business.
               "Do you know his name, Mr. Jacobs?" inquired Dick.
               "Yes; his name is Gilmore."
               "Where is he from?"
               "From one of the back counties of the State."
               "Have you any idea of the nature of his business?"
               "I have, Mr. Wilson, but I cannot name it."
               "What has brought Stevens and Judge L—— about here so much for two or three
                  days?"
               "I don't know; but it seems to me that gentleman's presence troubles them. Stevens
                  asked me his name yesterday, and when I told him it was Gilmore, he turned as
                  white as a cloth, and I have not seen him about since. If I am not mistaken,
                  Wilson, this man will reveal his business to some one before he leaves."
               There was nothing in this to excite Dick's curiosity; for, as yet, he had nothing
                  on which he could base an interesting conjecture; and he was not so much
                  accustomed to attend to the concerns of others, as many were by whom he was
                  surrounded.
               In the early part of the evening, Mr. Jacobs called on Dick, informing him that
                  the stranger wished to see him.
               "How does he come to want me?" inquired Dick.
               "He stated to me confidentially, Mr. Wilson, that he had business of importance, which required
                  the assistance of a lawyer, and wished me to recommend him to the best one in the
                  village, and I referred him to you."
               "I am certainly much obliged to you, Mr. Jacobs," replied Dick, "but did you tell
                  him that I was not yet admitted?"
               "I did, Mr. Wilson, and also told him when you would be admitted."
               Dick immediately started, wondering what this unexplained thing could mean. As he
                  entered Mr. Jacob's bar-room, he observed Stevens amongst others, and he passed on
                  to the parlor, where he was introduced to the stranger. After a few moments
                  conversation, in which it plainly appeared that the stranger was a gentleman, he
                  asked Mr. Wilson to accompany him to his room, which he did, and when seated, he
                  said—
               "Mr. Wilson, do you know the construction of this house."
               "I do know something about it," said Dick.
               "Is there any danger that we will be overheard?"
               "I think there is not, sir."
               "My business," said the gentleman, "is very important, and if it were known, all
                  my hopes and plans in finding my father's grave, would be frustrated."
               "Did you say finding your father's grave?"
               "Yes, Mr. Wilson, I have reason to suppose that the remains of my father are in
                  this vicinity. I have been for two weeks in a neighboring village, and I have
                  learned enough there to assure me that there can be no doubt about it; but the
                  difficulty will be, to find sufficient evidence to point out the grave and the
                  murderer of my father."
               "How long is it, sir," said Dick, "since your father disappeared?"
               "About twenty-five years."
               "What was his business?"
               "He was engaged in driving cattle, sir."
               "Ah! a drover, a drover?" said Dick, abstractedly.
               "Do you know a man named Stevens, in this village, Mr. Wilson?" said the
                  stranger.
               "Yes, sir, very well."
               "What is his character?"
               "Bad enough, sir. I hardly think it could be worse."
               "Do you know anything of his having kept a public house here, at one time?"
               "I have understood that he did, sir, and I have understood that a drover
                  disappeared from his house under very suspicious circumstances."
               "Yes, sir," replied the stranger, "I have no doubt but he knows very well where my
                  father is sleeping.'
               "Have you evidence in reference to your father, that will show clearly that he was
                  really here?"
               "Oh yes, sir, that can be substantiated; and also that he had five thousand
                  dollars in money."
               "Well," said Dick, "I have no doubt but Stevens has your father's money; but the difficulty will be
                  to get at it. He has a few friends here, and they will do every thing in their
                  power to aid in concealment. I believe that Stevens suspects you now. I know of no
                  other way in which to account for his strange conduct, since your appearance here.
                  I think the best way to develope the matter, would be to create a little
                  suspicion; and if you should think this best, it must be done with great care. I
                  would advise you to go to Judge L——, who is one of Steven's warmest friends, and
                  just open the matter to him, as you did to me, and if he knows any thing about
                  it—and I should not be surprised if he did—he will be putting Stevens on his guard
                  at once, and something, if they are well watched, may leak out. You must be
                  careful not to let Judge L—— know that you have said a word to me on the
                  subject."
               The stranger thought that this might be the best way, and after a good deal of
                  conversation in reference to the plan to be pursued, he stated to Dick, that he
                  would then pay him one hundred dollars, and in the event of his success, he would
                  pay him a thousand beside.
               The stranger then asked Dick if Mr. Jacobs might be let into the secret with
                  safety, and was informed that he could, and that he might be of service; and when
                  the thing was made known to him, he at once agreed to find a person, who for a few
                  days would watch every movement that Stevens and Judge L—— would make.
               The next morning, as early as it was proper to do so, the stranger called upon
                  Judge L——, and disclosed his business to him. As might have been expected, he
                  defended Stevens, and assured the stranger that there were few men who would be so
                  unlikely to do an act of that kind as he.
               "I have been acquainted with him for many years," said the Judge, "and I ought to
                  know him very well, and I think I do. Now, my dear sir, let me tell you that if
                  you breathe such a suspicion to any other individual in this community, you will
                  be in danger of your life. There is a young man here, named Wilson, who is a warm
                  friend of Mr. Stevens, and if it was known to him that you had any such suspicion,
                  he would excite a mob against you at once."
               He had been sufficiently apprised of the relation existing between Mr. Stevens and
                  Judge L——, and only replied to him that he had gone too far already to stop,
                  adding—
               "I am not much afraid of mobs or decrepid rumsellers; and I have but little
                  confidence in their friends."
               Immediately after he left the house, Judge L—— was in the street, and soon black
                  Felix was seen hovering in his rear. Judge L—— seemed to understand his business,
                  and so did Felix; for he as well as the Judge had something important to
                  accomplish. At length the Judge came up with Stevens, and Felix passed them, just
                  as they had designated ignated a place
                  where in an hour after they had appointed to meet. Smith's tavern was one of those
                  old dilapidated affairs, which had grown with the times, until twenty additions
                  had been added to it. In such a place as this secrets were not very safe, and
                  especially as every one of the partitions in the house was abundantly supplied
                  with knot holes. Felix was shrewd, and he made his appointment with himself at the
                  same time, in an adjoining room, which Smith had used as a place to store away
                  those whom he did not wish to be seen about his premises. Into this place, half an
                  hour earlier than the appointment, Felix, without any difficulty, found his way,
                  and patiently awaited the arrival of those in whom, just then, he was wonderfully
                  interested. At length they came, and the first thing he heard was—
               "Stevens, fill that glass up. You must not take this matter to heart, you are in
                  no danger. Heavens on earth! they can't find evidence to convict you now. Drink
                  and be merry, and let the drover's son go to the devil."
               "Do you think," said Stevens, "that there is no possible danger of this matter
                  getting out?"
               "It can't possibly get out," returned the Judge, "unless either you or myself
                  reveals it; for no other living soul knows the facts concerning the drover's
                  disappearance."
               "It was a devilish good thing for me," said Stevens, "that he went to you for
                  advice; but I suspect pect Wilson knows something about the matter."
               "I don't think he does," said the Judge; "I was apprehensive that he might call on
                  him, and I warned him against doing so, assuring him that Wilson was one of your
                  best friends."
               As they became warmer over Smith's whiskey, they talked with less reason, until
                  they had made a full revelation of the important facts in the case. As they were
                  about ready to leave, Stevens said—
               "I believe Dick Wilson has been consulted in this matter before you were. I saw
                  Jacobs taking him into his parlor last night. I wish to the Lord, Judge, we were
                  rid of that fellow."
               "Is there any danger, Stevens, that the grave can be discovered?"
               "Oh no, Judge; I am not afraid of that—that lot will never, in all probability, be
                  occupied, and there is a pile of stones resting on it now, which look as if they
                  had been always there. They will keep him down—I am sure of that."
               "It will be best, as soon as possible," said Judge L——, "to find out whether or
                  not Wilson knows any thing of the matter."
               "How am I to do this?"
               "Go and call on him at the office."
               "Will you go with me?"
               "No; If I did he would suspect us at once; but go yourself, and I will go bail
                  that he will be civil as long as you are."
               After drinking again, these worthies started into the street, apparently unconscious that they had
                  been unraveling a chain of facts, pointing to a grave which for twenty-five years
                  had been concealed, and pointing out, too, the guilty individual. Felix at once
                  carried the result of his eaves-dropping to Dick, who communicated it
                  to the stranger. The matter was now plain enough, and after arrangements of a
                  private nature, for future proceedings in the matter, the stranger visited the
                  stone pile, under which, in all probability, his father was sleeping, and left the
                  village. This was a strange matter to Dick, and he did not know how to interpret
                  it; but evidently it had placed his enemies in his power, and this at least was an
                  advantage to one in his situation. His fee, like his heart, was at once divided
                  between himself and his mother; and this signal success always made him look
                  forward with greater earnestness than ever to his admission to the bar. His
                  intention was that the case should be thoroughly sifted, and that the horrid crime
                  should be brought to light.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               THE GUILTY TREMBLE.—DICK'S PROSPECTS.
               
                  
                     
                        "Whose daring revels shock the sight,
                        When vice and infamy combine,
                        When drunkenness and crime unite,
                        And every sense is steeped in wine."
                     
                  
               
               THE case of Mr. Gilmore, the drover, and the singular revelations which had so
                  recently been made in reference to it, seemed to excite Dick Wilson intensely. It
                  was not, however, the hope of bringing speedy vengeance upon the aged criminal;
                  nor yet was he moved to it by the hope of personal gain. The stranger had deeply
                  enlisted his sympathy, and this, in connection with the yet fresh recollections of
                  his own father, who had perished at the hands of those who were as guilty as
                  Stevens, moved him to press forward in an investigation of the matter. For several
                  days and nights he had been unusually busy in running over the pages of musty
                  looking volumes. After considerable research, without finding much that was
                  applicable to the case in hand, an old book, containing many of the reports of
                  English trials, seemed at last to have gained complete mastery over him.
               
               The reader, even under ordinary circumstances, can find subjects of deep interest
                  in these reviews of legal lore, for with much native courage and true heroism of
                  soul, they present also the dark spots in human character. In the persons of Emmet
                  and McNevins and the Sheerers, the great state prisoners of the rebellion,
                  arraigned at the bar of English authority, they present a galaxy of noble names,
                  whose melancholy history, whose premature fall by civil tyranny, will be cherished
                  and reserved for all time. Then, after the lapse of years, in the person of Warren
                  Hastings, is brought vividly before the mind the princely prisoner and the power
                  of those splendid intellects by whom he was impeached. There, too, we may look
                  into the English prison, contemplate the griefs of Lord William Russel, and see
                  him on the eve of his execution, without stain upon his character, parting with
                  his family, and commending them to God. There, too, is the exhibition of crime, in
                  all its grades and with all its aspects of wickedness, clearly and forcibly
                  presented to the mind, revealing the fact that the eye of God had looked upon the
                  scene, and had kept here and there an open view in the history of the
                  murderer.
               It was this latter class of recorded facts which had the power to rivet Dick's
                  attention to the page, and after going through with the record of the one which
                  had arrested his attention, he said, "This is remarkable: here is almost a similar
                  case," and added ded, as he commenced pacing the floor—"Both these cases had their
                  origin in rum, and it seems as if God had in both cases forced rum to become the
                  revelator of its own dangerous character and hidden wickedness. God only knows how
                  long the heartbroken widow may have watched for the coming back of her husband;
                  and when month after month and year after year had passed slowly and sorrowfully
                  away, with a hope wrapped up in its own life-feeding sources, she still looked for
                  his return—the return of one who for twenty-five years has been sleeping within
                  two hundred yards from where I am now sitting, and who will never again re-enter
                  that home. The widow is dead, and now the son, guided by the uncertain and
                  disconnected reports which reached the far-off home, has come in search of the
                  father's grave; and almost miraculously, by the singular coincidence of rum
                  betraying itself, the facts have been revealed, and his feet have pressed the soil
                  which for a quarter of a century has rested upon the cold bosom of his
                  father."
               While Dick was musing upon this strange affair, a person who was not wholly
                  unexpected entered the office. It was Mr. Stevens, whose coming, by the report of
                  Felix, the eaves-dropper, was almost certain. He entered the office
                  with his usual lordly air, and with his accustomed duplicity inquired for Squire
                  B——. Dick, in quite as cool a manner, informed him that Squire B—— was absent, and
                  had been for several days. It was evident enough that from some cause or other he was very uneasy.
                  He was generally pretty well 'primed,' and there were times when brandy couldn't
                  stagger him.
               "I am very sorry, Mr. Wilson," said he, quite courteously, "that Squire B—— is not
                  at home—very sorry indeed. My business is of a pressing nature and requires
                  immediate attention."
               "Perhaps," replied Dick, "I may be able to attend to it for you. Squire B—— left
                  his business in my care until he should return, and if it is business that I can
                  do, I will attend to it for you."
               "Ah, yes, I dare say you would; but you couldn't attend to it, Mr. Wilson. It is
                  very important, as well as strictly confidential. You couldn't do it."
               "Very well," replied Dick, "then it will be best for you to defer it until he
                  returns, as he gave me no directions about any confidential business."
               "When will he be home, Mr. Wilson?"
               "To-morrow," replied Dick; "and as soon as he comes, I will inform him of your
                  anxiety."
               "Yes," continued Mr. Stevens, "I think it would be best to wait until he returns.
                  Important matters, you know, Mr. Wilson, ought always to be entrusted to old
                  heads, for they are better at keeping secrets, when it is necessary to do so."
               "Certainly, Mr. Stevens," replied Dick, "it is right that men of experience should
                  have the preference; but then I don't know that experience is much assistance in
                  keeping secrets. You are aware of the fact, no doubt, that in some way or other,
                  secrets crets always get out, and the more important they are, the surer are they
                  to find a leak somewhere, and sometimes those whose interests are most intimately
                  involved cannot keep them."
               "That ain't the way with me, Mr. Wilson. I can keep a secret—I tell you I
                  can."
               "That may be, Mr. Stevens: you may be an exception; but the general law of secrets
                  is, that they have the power of self-transmission." I have been engaged this
                  morning in looking over the reports of English law trials, and particularly those
                  which were of a criminal character, and I am convinced that I might have taken a
                  very strong position, and have said that there were secrets, the disclosure of
                  which would subject the possessor to the most severe penalties of the law, and
                  that notwithstanding they would betray themselves."
               "Now, Mr. Wilson, no man need tell me that I couldn't keep a secret. When I want
                  to keep a secret, I can tell you that I can do it."
               "Here is the case," said Dick, "and if you will spend the time to read it, I think
                  you will agree with me."
               The old man took the book into his hand, and then took off his spectacles, and
                  wiping them with a flourish of dignity, replaced them. He straightened himself in
                  his chair, threw one leg over another, and resting his elbow upon his favorite
                  gold-headed cane, commenced the perusal of the singular case.
               In the meanwhile Dick had placed himself in a position where he could see the movement of every
                  muscle in his face. Presently he saw the nervous agitation—the relaxing and
                  contracting of the muscles—the involuntary shudder. His cane fell to the floor,
                  his look of dignity disappeared, and his whole countenance was the aspect of
                  guilt, without a single thing expressive of remorse. At length he finished, and
                  laying down the book, he addressed Dick:
               "This must have been a hardened villain, Mr. Wilson; but then you know they have
                  very bad men in England. I have never been there, but I have always heard this,
                  and from this account I should think it was true. Have you ever heard of a case of
                  this kind, Mr. Wilson?"
               "I have heard of a great many instances, Mr. Stevens, where murderers to all
                  appearance had succeeded in covering up their track; but I must confess that I
                  have never heard of but one case, for which this in all its leading features, as
                  well as in most of its particulars, seems to be a parallel."
               "Was that in England?"
               "Oh no, sir; it was in this country—purely an American tragedy."
               "Indeed! do you say so? I didn't think there were such bad men in America. In what
                  State was it, Mr. Wilson?"
               "In the State in which we are residing, sir."
               "Was the man who committed the murder a tavern-keeper?"
               "Yes, sir, he was at the time he committed the crime, and I believe he continued
                  for several years after to sell rum."
               "Was the man whom he murdered a drover?"
               "Yes, sir, he was, and I believe he came from one of the back counties of this
                  State."
               "Well, of course, Mr. Wilson, he has been executed, hasn't he?"
               "Not yet, sir; the matter has never been made public, and there are circumstances
                  in the way of the prosecution of the case just now."
               "Ah! Mr. Wilson, I suppose the evidence is wanting."
               "No sir; there is no lack of evidence."
               "How many witnesses are there?"
               "Only one that could be relied on."
               "How did the thing get out?"
               "The walls communicated it."
               "Well, Mr. Wilson, but the walls couldn't tell it."
               "Mr. Stevens," said Dick, while he looked into the eyes of the guilty man, "I will
                  tell you how it was made known: the principal and the witness were closeted
                  together to confer upon the plan by which detection might be avoided, and also to
                  consult on the ruin of another, and while they were there making
                  merry over the whiskey which was furnished for the occasion, they betrayed
                  themselves."
               "You say, Mr. Wilson, they were planning the ruin of another."
               
               "Yes, sir, they were trying to drive a young man to the rumseller as the surest
                  way to effect his ruin."
               "When did this happen, Mr. Wilson?"
               "I am not at liberty to tell you, Mr. Stevens; but the time may come when all
                  restriction shall be taken away, and then I will consider it my duty to tell
                  you."
               "Well, thank God," said Mr. Stevens, "I never murdered any person. I used to keep
                  a tavern here at one time, and there were some good-for-nothing fellows who were
                  always in the habit of lying about my house, drinking, and who died there at
                  last—two or three I think in my bar-room; but nobody would think of calling that
                  murder—they wouldn't in these days, any how."
               "They ought to have called it by its right name," said Dick, promptly, "for
                  certainly, Mr. Stevens, those who kill with rum, for a price, are
                  just as guilty as those who use a less painful mode, and they should be made just
                  as amenable to law. I have no doubt the time will come, in the progress of
                  civilization, when the man who kills outright, and he who slowly kills by rum,
                  will expiate their guilt together."
               "Good Heavens!" exclaimed Mr. Stevens, affecting great surprise; "Young man, you
                  make a wide sweep."
               "No wider," replied Dick, "than the principles of justice make; and this is, or
                  ought to be, the foundation of all law."
               "But don't you see, Mr. Wilson," said Mr. Stevens, with a good deal of vehemence,
                  "that you involve a very large class of persons, many of whom are wealthy and
                  respectable."
               "Mr. Stevens, I have nothing to do with involving them—they involve themselves.
                  They do it intelligently and deliberately, in the face of the multiplied evidence
                  of its criminality, and they carry on their work when they know certainly that
                  they are accomplishing the ruin of those with whom they are bartering. Wealth
                  ought not to be permitted to rise superior to law, and no business ought to be
                  tolerated in a civilized community, the effect of which is unmixed evil."
               "Didn't you say, Mr. Wilson, that nothing was yet known, except by very few, of
                  the case you mentioned?"
               "Perhaps I did, sir; but I ought to have said that suspicion had always rested on
                  the individual; but that until very recently no sufficient evidence could be
                  reached."
               "There is such a witness now—are you sure of this, Mr. Wilson?"
               "Oh, yes sir; I have it from his own mouth."
               "Do you think an individual ought to be punished for a crime committed twenty-five
                  years since?"
               "Certainly I do, Mr. Stevens. It is said that it is never too late to repent, and
                  of course it is never too late to afford to such individuals an opportunity to do
                  what, under other circumstances, they would probably never do. It appears to me that one
                  example of this kind would have a better effect upon the public mind, than a great
                  many examples of a different character."
               "Have you seen Judge L—— lately, Mr. Wilson?"
               "I have not. I have no confidence in him, and I shun rather than seek his
                  presence. He is the only man of whom I ever felt any real dread."
               "I think he is your friend, Mr. Wilson, and you could very easily make him a warm
                  friend."
               "Mr. Stevens, you know better than that. You know that I could not have a more
                  bitter enemy. You know that it would be a matter of delight to Judge L—— if he
                  could ruin me. I hope you will not attempt to deceive me in this manner."
               "I understand you intend stopping here to commence the law."
               "That is my intention, sir; and I am now making arrangements with that view."
               "I dare say you will find it very pleasant, Mr. Wilson, when your family come here
                  to reside."
               "I hope to find it so, sir, and I am looking forward to that event with a great
                  deal of pleasure."
               After muttering some apology for intrusion upon time, &c., the old man left
                  the office; but Dick was assured from his uneasy manner, that he would be back
                  again before long.
               He had come, according to arrangement with Judge L——, in Smith's back room, to
                  sound Dick, in order that he might ascertain whether or not Mr. Gilmore's business
                  had been made known to him. This he had not been able to determine; but the
                  singularity of the coincidence, and the particulars of the case to which Dick had
                  cited him, were so much like the one in which he was the chief actor, that guilt
                  was plainly visible, both in his countenance and actions.
               He intimated his own friendship, and proclaimed that of Judge L—— for this young
                  man, when it was known to all, that they were seeking his destruction, and the
                  only reason for it was, that at their command, he had refused to destroy himself.
                  Dick, after some reflection, resolved that it he came back again, he would at once
                  free his mind from any doubt on the subject, by confronting the criminal with the
                  evidence of his guilt. He said to himself, "there can be no harm in doing so.
                  Felix is trusty, and Stevens is just what his countenance betokens—a human
                     fiend. He has lived and wallowed in the filth of drunkard
                     making, until humanity has departed from his constitution. He has
                  committed every sort of crime, including the blackest; and this solitary instance
                  of murder, while it is the only one of which the law takes
                  cognizance, is far from being alone. The one was against the law,
                  because the weapon was not licensed. The rest were according to law,
                  because the instrument was consecrated for a stipulated price.
                  Amazing inconsistency! thought Dick, that legislation has been so blind upon this subject, as to privilege
                     one class where another has been proscribed; and
                  especially when the latter is infinitely the worst, for there is hardly a crime
                  that can be mentioned, which does not come forth as spontaneously from legalized
                  rumselling, as vegetation springs from the earth.
               In the village of B—— this fact was often demonstrated. The wrecks of many
                  families who had been happy, were still there, and their children either beggars
                  or thieves.
               Dick had been busily engaged in reviewing his studies, preparatory to examination
                  and admission. The visit of Mr. Gilmore had to some extent interrupted him; yet
                  after his departure, he seemed to apply himself with greater interest than ever.
                  Mr. Watson, with several other friends, who were acquainted with his
                  circumstances, and who had urged him to locate there, offered him every facility
                  in their power in making arrangements for the comfortable removal of his family.
                  In all the arrangements which were made, Mr. Watson took a leading part. Without
                  Dick's knowledge, he had for some time been engaged in fitting up one of his own
                  houses for the family. It was a beautiful location—one which Dick had often seen,
                  and where he imagined that himself and his dear ones might be happy. He had never
                  said a word to Mr. Watson about it, yet he had often half made up his mind that he
                  would do so.
               One afternoon Mr. Watson's little boy came into the office, with a request that
                  Dick should come and take tea with them that evening, and as the little fellow was
                  leaving, he said:
               "Mr. Wilson, what shall I tell mother?"
               "Tell her I will be there, Charley," was the reply.
               In a very short time Mr. Stevens returned, and in a more abstracted manner than in
                  the morning, repeated the same question, inquiring for Squire B——. Dick informed
                  him, as in the morning, that he was not at home.
               "Ah!" said he, "I believe you did tell me so. That was a most remarkable case you
                  spoke of this morning, and I would like very much to know the particulars of it. I
                  don't know what makes me feel so much interest in this matter."
               "It is not strange," said Dick, "that you should feel interested. It is rather
                  natural. Two cases of this kind so nearly alike are enough, under
                     ordinary circumstances, to stir up one's curiosity."
               "That's a fact, Mr. Wilson. My curiosity has always been very great, and I never
                  knew what to call it before. Curiosity!—that's it exactly, and I feel better
                  satisfied now. This curiosity is a powerful thing, when it is once awakened by
                  such awful things. I will be obliged to you, if you will tell me some of the
                  particulars of this case."
               "If you will walk out with me," said Dick, "I will tell you enough to satisfy you that I am in
                  earnest."
               Mr. Stevens readily consented to do so, and off they went. Dick took it upon
                  himself to lead in the walk, and directed their steps by a circuitous rout to the
                     stone pile. Just as they came alongside of it, Mr. Stevens said,
                  with signs of impatience:
               "Mr. Wilson, don't forget your promise, for I shall be offended if you do not
                  satisfy me."
               "Let us set down here," said Dick.
               "I would rather not," was the reply.
               "Why not?" quickly inquired Dick.
               "It is unpleasant."
               "What makes it unpleasant?"
               "I don't know."
               "Have you ever been here before?"
               "Many a time," was the trembling reply.
               "Have you been here on any particular occasion for a particular
                     purpose?"
               "Not that I can recollect."
               "Your memory must be treacherous indeed. Does not the father of Mr. Gilmore lie
                  beneath this pile of stones? You surely cannot have forgotten the night on which
                  you bore that lifeless body to this spot, and here interred it."
               Mr. Stevens attempted to speak, but he could not articulate a single word, and
                  Dick continued:
               "You have, without cause, sought my destruction, and here now, poor old man, you
                  stand trembling bling before me, in the presence of the rude sepulchre which
                  contains the evidence of your guilt. I know the whole of this matter. Are you
                  satisfied? Say, are you satisfied?"
               Dick at once directed his steps to Mr. Watson's house, having left the guilty man
                  standing in horror upon the grave. As he entered, his excitement was at once
                  apparent to Mr. and Mrs. Watson, and they interrogated him as to the cause. He
                  revealed the whole matter to them, as well as his arrangements which were made
                  with Mr. Gilmore's son in reference to the prosecution of the case. Mr. Watson
                  expressed his regret that anything in reference to the matter had been made public
                  until after his admission, adding that if Felix could be bought in one case, he
                  could also in another, and that if Judge L—— and Stevens together could ascertain
                  who the witness was, that it would be impossible to get at the facts.
               After tea Mr. and Mrs. Watson asked Dick to walk out with them. They lead the way
                  and soon arrived at the very house which, before any other in the village, Dick
                  would have selected as his residence. As they entered, he saw that every thing was
                  in readiness for the reception of a family. It was plainly yet pleasantly
                  furnished throughout, and Dick thought even without an inhabitant, it had still an
                  air of cheerfulness about it. After they had examined the house through, and Dick
                  had expressed ed himself freely in
                  reference to its pleasant appearance, Mr. Watson said:
               "It is a pleasure to me to inform you, Mr. Wilson, that this house has been fitted
                  up for yourself, and it will afford myself and family much pleasure to see you and
                  your mother, your sister and brother, after the severity of the trials through
                  which you have passed, once more in the enjoyment of peace and happiness."
               "Richard," said Mrs. Watson, "I think you will yet see pleasant days, and I would
                  now advise you to lay off that melancholy expression of countenance. Your mother
                  ought not to see it, for it will represent to her a canker at the root, and may
                  bring unnecessary sadness to her heart."
               "Ah!" said Dick, with a painful smile, "the extreme of ambition and the extreme of
                  poverty, with an absolute dependence on the kindness of others, is hard to endure.
                  But I will try to wear it off, and I will struggle to show you that I appreciate
                  your kindness."
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               THE PLOT.—THE VICTIM.
               
                  
                     
                        "What dire necessities on every hand,
                        Our art, our strength, our fortitude require!
                        Of foes incessant, what a numerous band
                        Against this little throb of life conspire!"
                     
                  
               
               As Mr. Watson had suggested, Dick had acted very much against his own interest and
                  the ends of justice, in making any revelation whatever to Mr. Stevens. The matter,
                  with the manner of its discovery, soon became public, and, worst of all, Felix was
                  gone, and no one could give any account of him. There was no doubt in the minds of
                  the better portion of the community in reference to the correctness of the report,
                  and if there had been, the sudden disappearance of Felix would at once have
                  removed it. This was a singular advantage gained over Dick by Mr. Stevens and his
                  friends, and although Mr. Jacobs, who was himself a rumseller, declared that Felix
                  had communicated these things as facts, the cry of slander was notwithstanding
                  raised against him.
               After the disappearance of Felix, Dick at once wrote to Mr. Gilmore, informing him
                  of the fact, and requesting him to come
                  on immediately, that the grave might be opened. While this, if the body were found
                  there, would relieve Dick in the mind of every one from the suspicion of slander,
                  it would not necessarily convict Mr. Stevens of the crime of which he was no doubt
                  guilty. In the meantime the influence of Mr. Stevens and Judge L—— and their
                  friends was made to bear upon him with as much severity as possible, and every
                  opportunity was improved to injure his feelings and prejudice his interests. Even
                  the venerable distiller, who had presided at the rum meeting, and who had been
                  such a signal blessing to that community, by affording them a market in which the
                     necessaries and the happiness of life might be
                  exchanged for rum—he too was awake, and ready in any but a legal way, to wipe this
                  suspicion from the craft.
               It was now observed that Mr. Stevens strutted the streets more pompously than ever
                  before, and as often as possible took occasion to pass the office of Squire B——,
                  not neglecting to cast a most contemptible look at Dick when he met him.
               In a short time Mr. Gilmore arrived, and arrangements were at once made to open
                  the grave. Many persons were collected to witness the result, and every one
                  present trembled with intense anxiety. Stevens was present and stood as near the
                  spot as he could possibly get.
               "These stones," said the old grave-digger, as he commenced his work, "have not
                  laid here as they now are for the twentieth part of twenty-five years."
               This at once created the suspicion, that if it was in fact a grave, some person
                  had recently disturbed it, and if so, its occupant had undoubtedly been removed.
                  The stones were soon cleared away, and the work, to all appearance, ready to be
                  commenced in earnest. It was now a matter of surprise to many that the old man
                  hesitated to commence his work, and some one in the crowd called out—
               "Jacob, why don't you commence digging?"
               "It's no use," he replied, "for this here spot has been worked on very lately,"
                  and picking up from the earth something that attracted his notice, two or three
                  rusty buttons were shown, and it was manifest enough that this relic had not been
                  long exposed to the action of the atmosphere. Jacob at once handed the buttons to
                  Mr. Gilmore, and said:
               "I will go down to the bottom, if you say so; but whatever may have been here, it
                  is now gone, and we will not find what might have been found a few weeks
                  since."
               Some thought it was best to give up the search, and others, encouraged by what was
                  already found, advised to the prosecution of it. Jacob persevered until he had got
                  to the depth of two feet, which proved to be the bottom of a hastily made
                  grave.
               "Now," said he, "I am down at the bottom."
               "What do you think?" said Mr. Gilmore. "Has this been the grave of a human
                  being?"
               "Oh, there is no doubt of it," said Jacob.
               
               "Have you ever opened a grave before?"
               "Yes, sir, many a time."
               "What has been their appearance usually?"
               "Just what you see here, sir."
               "How long do you think it has been since this grave was opened?"
               "Not over a month, sir, and I should hardly think as long as that. You see it has
                  been nicely done; and before I commenced lifting a stone," said Jacob, "I knew
                  what had been done here; and when the stones were removed, I found that the
                  surface had been thickly covered with fresh grass seed, which has not yet began to
                  sprout. There has been foul play here, Mr. Stevens. I don't know who did it; but
                  there has been a dead body put here, and it's very likely that the same hands that
                  put it here have taken it away."
               At this moment Mr. Gilmore advanced to where Mr. Stevens and Judge L—— were
                  standing, and said in the hearing of all present:
               "Mr. Stevens, I have come from a distance to find the remains of my father, who, I
                  have no doubt, fell by your hand. You have managed to buy and send away the only
                  witness by whom this fact could have been established, and then, to elude
                  detection, you have rifled the grave, and stolen the evidence of your crime to
                  some other hiding place. Before I left here, I was fully aware of your guilt. I
                  called upon Judge L——, your friend, who is standing by your side, and who knows
                  that you are guilty, and he warned me against Mr. Wilson, as being your bosom
                  friend, and persevered in proclaiming your innocence; and yet on the same day he
                  was closetted with you, and giving you counsel how to conceal your guilt. I am as
                  well satisfied of your guilt as if I had found the remains of my father in this
                  grave."
               Mr. Gilmore consulted nearly all the negroes in the place in reference to Felix;
                  but even the philosophic Sam could give no intelligent account of him, farther
                  than that he had seen him ride out of town on one of Mr. Stevens' fast horses.
                  After several unavailing attempts to get a clue to the whereabouts of Felix, Mr.
                  Gilmore resolved to give up the search and go home. He saw the embarrassing
                  position in which Dick was placed, and heard, during his sojourn in the village,
                  threats of prosecution for slander. In view of these things, and to raise the
                  spirits of this young man, he assured and re-assured him of his entire confidence
                  in him, and intimated the possibility of something yet being known which might set
                  the matter right. He assured him that so far as a prosecution was concerned, there
                  was not the least probability of any thing of the kind, and if it should take
                  place, said he, "I will stand between you and your enemies."
               The time when Dick expected to be admitted was near at hand, and this matter had
                  so confounded him that he was far from being in tune for it. Gradually, however,
                  as it approached, he seemed to recover
                  from the mortification which the placing himself so completely in the power of
                  these reckless men, had produced.
               The day at length came, on which he expected to be admitted to the bar, and
                  commence an active existence. On the Saturday previous he had received a letter
                  from his mother, and also one from Mrs. Livingston. These letters were full of
                  kindness, and both congratulated him upon the noble manner in which he had
                  contended with poverty. The one from his mother was peculiarly dear to him, for in
                  it he saw how entirely and how confidingly the little household were leaning upon
                  him. It expressed the joy which they felt when his last letter informed them of
                  the kindness of Mr. Watson in providing for their comfort, and assured him of the
                  comfort and happiness which a re-union of those domestic ties, which had been so
                  rudely severed, would bring to their hearts. The expression of love, the spirit by
                  which home ought ever to be consecrated, was breathed in every line and embodied
                  in every word; and then he saw the insignificance of his persecutors, some of whom
                  seemed to be like hungry wolves, waiting for their prey.
               In the village of B——, the admission of an individual to the bar was by no means
                  an every-day occurrence, and hence an event of that kind was hailed with a good
                  deal of curiosity, and in this instance it was more than usually intense.
               At length the old court-house bell was rung, and the house was soon filled up, and
                  just as the crier had finished the sentence, 'God save the common-wealth!' Dick
                  and his preceptor entered together. After seating himself by the counsel board,
                  and exchanging meaning glances with several of his friends who made out to catch
                  his eye, he turned to survey the gathering, which was unusually large. The first
                  person who attracted his attention was Horace Stevens. He felt himself to be
                  prepared for all the legal and honorable requirements of that day. He regarded
                  himself as about taking a position in society which would afford him an
                  opportunity to show himself worthy of the confidence which had been reposed in
                  him.
               After the tedious charge to the grand jury—in which rumselling was not hinted
                  at—they retired to analyze the criminality of the county, and find something for
                  lawyers to do. Squire B—— rose and addressed himself to the court in the most
                  respectful terms, requesting that a committee might be appointed to examine Mr.
                  Wilson, and suggested that if the court had no objection, he would prefer, for his
                  own part, a public examination. He stated farther, that there was a very unusual
                  number of persons present, and he presumed they had come with the expectation of
                  hearing the examination. Judge L—— had not the reputation of being very
                  accommodating, either in or out of court, and on this occasion, any thing that
                  would tend to increase the popularity of Dick, of course would not be granted. In reply to the motion and suggestion
                  of Squire B——, he remarked that the time of the court was very precious, and could
                  not be spent in flattering vanity.
               "I will appoint a committee," said he, "to examine this young man, and they can
                  retire to some private place during the adjournment of the court at noon; but I
                  cannot, and I will not, take up the time of the court with this matter."
               A committee was accordingly appointed; but Squire B—— was not one of the number.
                  He had little more reason to expect favors from the Judge than Dick had, for he
                  had watched and divulged his low trickery as often as he had had an opportunity of
                  doing so. When the committee were appointed, he remarked to a lawyer by his
                  side—
               "This matter is going to make trouble, you may rely upon that."
               When the hour for a recess arrived, Squire B—— invited the committee to his
                  office, to perform the duty assigned them. After a close and protracted
                  examination had been gone through with, every member of the committee concurred in
                  expressing the opinion that it was one of the most satisfactory examinations at
                  which they had ever been present.
               As soon as the bell was rung for the afternoon session of the court, the house was
                  again crowded, and the court being formally opened, the chairman of the
                  committee—who was from an adjoining county—rose and asked the court to hear a
                  report of the examination of Mr. Wilson. This report was introduced with much
                  feeling, and so far as a large part of the audience were concerned, with great
                  effect. The whole thing was of the most flattering character.
               Squire B—— rose slowly, and made a motion to the effect that Richard Wilson be
                  admitted as an attorney, to practice in the several courts of the county. This was
                  a moment of excitement with Dick. The excitement, however, was that of hope
                  unmingled with fear. The dark future over which he hung was unknown to him. Could
                  he then have withdrawn the veil, and seen what was soon to be but too clearly
                  revealed, he might, with Byron, when standing upon the highest crags of the Alpine
                  mountains—poised midway between the heavens and the earth—have breathed out from
                  his hopeless heart, into the ear of the furious storm-god, as he was passing in
                  the angry chariot of the thunder clouds—'Tell me, ye storms, are YE like those
                  within the HUMAN BREAST?'
               For a moment after the motion was made by Squire B——, Judge L—— seemed to be very
                  much perplexed; but it was evident enough that he had been drawing quite liberally
                  on the assistance of rum, to aid him in carrying out his purpose.
               "Gentlemen," said he, "I have heard your application for the admission of Mr.
                  Wilson, and from your reputation as jurists, I have no doubt that your report is
                  correct. I regret exceedingly that
                  there are insuperable difficulties in the way of granting this application at this
                  time. It may not be known to you, gentlemen, that Mr. Wilson lacks yet several
                  months of the time which the law prescribes as being necessary for one of his age,
                  to be spent in the study of law prior to admission. The court feel the importance,
                  gentlemen, of adhering strictly to the law, and you will see the necessity of
                  doing so, when you consider the dangers to which the standing and respectability
                  of the bar is liable; and these, at the sacrifice of every personal feeling, the
                  court is determined to preserve in their purity. The court find it necessary,
                  therefore, to hold this application under consideration until the next regular
                  term, at which time, if Mr. Wilson pursues his studies diligently, he may possibly
                  be admitted."
               A single glance at Dick would have told you that hope in his heart was crushed—it
                  would have pointed to the dying fires which had warmed him up and kept him alive
                  in the days of his toil, in preparing for that hour. For a moment he looked wildly
                  around that densely peopled court room, and in the eyes of several he saw that the
                  smile of vicious triumph was already kindled. He cast no look towards his friends,
                  for while he thanked them for their former kindness, he felt that he needed their
                  kindness no longer.
               For a moment he rested his head upon the counsel board, and when he raised it
                  again his features were calm—all evidence of feeling was gone, and all that could
                  be seen of his broken heart, with its crushed and bleeding affections, was a
                  solitary tear. Like himself, it was alone—and soon that evidence of agony, so
                  emblematic of himself, disappeared. In the midst of the silence and astonishment
                  of the moment, Squire B—— rose, and fixing his eye on Judge L——, until it seemed
                  as if it would pierce his very soul, he commenced—
               "May it please the court, this is one of the coolest and most flagrant pieces of
                  villainy that has ever been concocted and carried out in a civilized community.
                  How cool! No doubt, days and nights of concert with others, have been
                  spent in perfecting this plot. It affects to be the promptings of kindness—the
                  respectability of the bar! What does your honor care about character?—about
                  respectability? What appreciation have you of kindness?"
               Here Judge L. informed Squire B—— that he would have him committed, if he pursued
                  these remarks. Said Squire B——,
               "You cannot find an officer who is mean and base enough to execute your command.
                  What attachment have you to honor?—None. Here is Mr. Wilson, a young gentleman of
                  fine abilities, and enviable acquirements, thoroughly prepared to practice in any
                  court. He has not been trained at that bar, sir, whose foul practices you
                  understand best, and in the minutia of which you are deeply read and wonderfully
                  skilled—but at the bar, sir, where honorable men like himself contend with each
                     other, for justice. Here upon the
                  threshold you intercept his progress. The withering pestilence of the rumseller,
                  let loose in its fury, wasted and scattered the opulence of his city home, and
                  sent him forth pennyless and alone, to search for a place in which, by his own
                  industry, he might finish his profession and find a home, to which he might remove
                  those who are dependent upon him. Tell me, then, if up to this moment he has not
                  nobly acquitted himself? Chance brought him here. Will you tell me who has been
                  injured by his coming? Those who affect to have been injured by him, had reached
                  the acme of wickedness before he came. He has injured none, and those
                  with whom he has associated must regard themselves as being richer in the true
                  ornaments of life, than before they enjoyed his society. Now, sir, when he has
                  passed through the trying ordeal of poverty—where he has proved himself not only
                  equal, but superior to the disastrous circumstances by which he has been
                  surrounded, and with the tenderest relations of earth clinging to him for
                  protection and shelter—you have chosen to meet out to him a furious
                  vengeance."
               The stillness of this moment was suddenly broken, and every eye was turned towards
                  the door. Dick's cup was more than full—it was running over; and unobserved by
                  Squire B——, he had risen from his seat, and was advancing towards the door.
               "There, may it please the court," continued Squire B——, "there goes your victim!
                  he is carrying rying out of this court room, which you have rendered infamous, his
                  broken heart."
               Dick had paused, and was leaning his elbow on the prisoner's box, apparently
                  indifferent to all that was passing, when he seemed to be suddenly aroused as from
                  a dream.
               "Judge L——," said he, "have I ever done you a wrong which was not an hundred
                     times provoked by yourself? No! You know that I have not. You know that
                  you have followed me with cruelty, almost since the day you first saw my face. You
                  have been confederate with the rumseller to destroy me. I know that you have
                  disgraced your position, by compromising the principles of justice with a
                  miserable client, in a crime of twenty-five years' standing. I know very well,
                  sir, the history which for a quarter of a century has loomed in ghost-like terror
                  about the old 'stone house.' Judge L——, enter it upon the record,
                  that your villainy has finally triumphed over the young and unoffending!"
               Amidst the intense confusion which prevailed, Dick had left the house, and every
                  one who was not compelled to remain soon followed his example. Every one who had
                  been taught to prize virtue, left with a sad heart; and Mr. and Mrs. Watson, as
                  they turned towards their home, were deeply impressed with the treacherous
                  character of the Judge, and feared the consequences, which they apprehended might
                  follow.
               
               "Poor fellow," said Mr. Watson to his wife, as they passed along, "I am afraid
                  that even his generous nature, backed by all his love of home and the fair
                  prospects before him, will be insufficient to withstand this crushing blow. Though
                  he has withstood manfully all the other temptations which have been almost
                  constantly before him, I am really fearful that this bitter disappointment will
                  unman him. Before the death of his father, you know, he drank freely; and he has
                  often told me that he has had to struggle hard here, to resist the importunities
                  of his own appetite for strong drink. I had supposed the danger past, and that,
                  young as he was, once established in business, with his family around him, the
                  influence of a pernicious early habit would be entirely overcome. But this, coming
                  to him so suddenly, so severely, I fear will be too much for him. I tremble for
                  the consequences."
               And well he might, for nothing is more clearly established than that the love of
                  strong drink, when once formed, lives while the heart beats. To resist it requires
                  a life-long struggle. Years of abstinence may have been practiced, yet a single
                  draught of the maddening poison fires the appetite to resistless intensity, and
                  the victim falls powerless in the hands of the destroyer. This view of the case
                  shows clearly the danger constantly attending the use of alcoholic drinks. To
                     use them is to form a relish for them. To
                     love strong drink, though we may now avoid intoxication, is among
                  the most perilous ilous positions in which we can be placed. We may
                  escape with only a shortening of life, and the rendering of it comparatively
                  miserable. We may not become drunkards, yet the chances are against
                  us. If our lives are prosperous and fair—if nothing occurs to tax peculiarly our
                  fortitude, or our energy, we may float on, being considered as only moderate
                  drinkers. But if storms assail us, then it is that our rotten sails and rickety
                  hulks are tried; and if we have been moderate drinkers before, we
                  become drunkards now, and at the very time when the duties and responsibilities of
                  life press upon us, and when we should assert our manliness, by meeting and
                  discharging them, we falter and fall.
               Dick's footsteps were soon heard at the door, and Mr. Watson rose to meet him. He
                  saw at once the strange calmness which the chilling events of the day had printed
                  upon his brow; and there was a wildness in his expression which told but too
                  plainly the conflicts of emotion with which he was oppressed.
               "Mr. Watson," said he, "I have come to ask a favor of you. You have been to me
                  more than a father since I came to your door, a stranger, seeking the means to
                  obtain my daily bread. I can never repay you, or your dear lady, for your
                  kindness, your many favors to me. I wish you, if you will, to mail this letter in
                  the morning to my dear mother. It will acquaint her of my misfortune, and of my
                  determination to leave this place."
               
               "But you will not leave us?" said Mr. Watson.
               "Yes, Mr. Watson, I must. My business here is over. There is nothing to keep me
                  longer. My hopes are all wasted by cruel malice and hate. Oh! my dear friends, do
                  not think me indifferent to you. Whatever betides me, you will be ever gratefully
                  remembered."
               "Where do you intend to go, Richard?"
               "God only knows, Mrs. Watson. I am determined to leave this place, and where I
                  shall finally stop, this whirling brain has not yet decided."
               "But, Richard," said Mrs. Watson, "think of your mother—your sister—your helpless
                  brother!"
               "Ah!" said Dick, "those are precious names to to me. They have hitherto held me up
                  against discouragements. The letter will explain the matter. It will tell them
                  that I have kept the field resolutely as long as hope remained, and when that
                  died, I fled from the field of my disappointment, and whither, time only can
                  tell."
               Then turning to Mr. and Mrs. Watson, and extending his hands he said—
               "Good-bye, my dear friends. You may, or you may not, see me again. I shall
                  struggle to show myself worthy the confidence you have reposed in me, but on some
                  other field than this," and turning, he walked rapidly away.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               DUTY AND PLEASURE.
               
                  
                     
                        "Onward, onward may we press,
                        Through the paths of duty:
                        Virtue is true happiness,
                        Excellence is beauty.
                        Minds are of celestial birth,
                        Make we then a heaven of earth."
                     
                  
               
               IT was well known in the village of B—— that Dick Wilson had left, and many a
                  heart had sorrowed over his misfortune as they contemplated the probable
                  consequences, for which they knew the rumseller was responsible.
               Months had passed, and no reliable tidings of Dick Wilson had come back to the
                  village from which he had so suddenly departed. Mr. and Mrs. Watson thought and
                  spoke much of him, and their children often asked the question, "Mother, where is
                  poor Richard?" and invariably, in answer to these interrogations, which were
                  prompted by their childish love, she would take the occasion to warn them against
                  those unfeeling men, who were capable of blotting out the light, the loves, and
                  the hopes of life; and for these things they could not fail to honor that mother's
                  memory. Mr. Smith, the minister, was
                  still there, and likely to remain, notwithstanding the bitterest opposition.
               A traveler is on the cars, and his attention is directed to a group who are
                  sitting near by him. The first object in that group is a woman habited in the
                  weeds of mourning, and her appearance indicated that she had not reached the
                  middle of life. She sat quiet and thoughtful in the midst of a mourning band, who
                  seemed to regard her as their only protection. The lines of care were deeply
                  traced upon her brow, and upon her cheeks, too, are the deep furrows, which look
                  as if the tearful flood of years had held there its uninterrupted way. With her
                  sadness seemed to be doing a rapid work, and reason to be tottering on its throne.
                  She turned her eye from the strangers by whom she was surrounded, with a sweet
                  familiarity towards heaven. It was plain that she knew the way thither, and that
                  often in thought she had been there before. Her lips moved reverently, and an
                  unearthly serenity gilded for a moment her countenance, and then, with a full,
                  rich smile, which looked all the brighter as it contrasted with the gloom of her
                  mourning apparel, she cast a glance of love upon her charge, and tried to be
                  calm.
               "Who can this be?" inquired the traveler; and then, as if lost for an answer, he
                  said, "Well, whoever she may be, she is deeply marked by sorrow. There surely was
                  a time when her heart was not sad, when no cloud of grief shaded her brow, and
                  when those tears flowed not. These could not have been tears of joy; for they
                  leave no traces: they wear no furrows. It is theirs to tinge the cheek of beauty
                  with a deeper hue of gladness, and add lustre to the eye which they have
                  moistened. She is a widow no doubt, and he upon whom she bestowed the virgin
                  affections of her heart—upon whom she was leaning for support and trusting for
                  defence in the wilderness of life, is gone. But where? To the grave, perhaps, and
                  she is alone, save with her little band, for whom only her heart seems anxious to
                  beat on. He, the husband, in the spring-time of existence, may have forgotten his
                  solemn vows. He saw his first-born infant, and in an extacy of pleasure, he may
                  have sworn over it that he would be faithful to those solemn engagements, and yet
                  it may be that he turned from the path of safety and domestic happiness, not
                  willingly, but under the influence of strong temptation."
               The traveler resolved to satisfy himself, and learn from her own lips the history
                  of her griefs, and to his sympathizing inquiries she replied:
               "I am a drunkard's widow, and these poor children are a drunkard's orphans."
               At this moment the traveler heard the mention of a name, in which he was deeply
                  interested. He turned himself hastily toward that group in which some one, he was
                  sure, had spoken that name. There was a company of young persons of both sexes, and the very opposite of the
                  quiet one from whom he had just turned. Their spirits seemed to be elastic and
                  cheerful as the air they were breathing, and as their merry laugh rang out from
                  the yet unchecked fountain of joy in their hearts, no cloud of permanent sadness
                  rested on a single countenance in that gay throng. Sorrow had left no traces
                  there: no withered beams of hope were strewing their paths. These happy ones were
                  returning to their homes amidst the associations of city life. After enjoying
                  themselves for a short time amidst the rusticity of rural scenes, and, as was
                  natural enough, they were amusing themselves in the recapitulating of new sights
                  and sayings. But among them was one who, if she had not gazed so minutely or so
                  reverentially upon the majestic scenery by which their rural rambles were skirted,
                  had, notwithstanding, looked upon that which had been and was still more majestic
                  and sublime in its being. She had seen a desolated heart, and she had sympathized
                  with forlorn and neglected merit.
               "Well, Kate," said one of the company, addressing a girl of queen-like beauty and
                  dignity, "your taste must run in an odd channel. Oh! you don't know what you have
                  missed by your strange preference for that poor family—the widow and her sunburned
                  daughter. I dare say, Kate, you lavished your pocket-money very freely upon them.
                  Ah, ha! my girl, what will your mother say to this?"
               "Lucy," said Kate, "I am never afraid to account count to my mother, and this time
                  I shall do it with less fear and with more pleasure than I ever did."
               "Oh, yes, I suppose your mother will praise you. I remember now—her maxim is that
                     religion and charity go together. I declare, Kate, if
                  a person can't be religious without bearing its burdens, it's bad enough."
               "Religion don't ask you to bear its burdens, Lucy: it comes to bear yours. My
                  mother will praise me, that's true; and I love her all the better because she has
                  taught me to be kind to the suffering. I have given away no money, but if it had
                  been needed, I should have done so with a singular satisfaction. I have
                  sympathized with that family, and although you may laugh, I am proud to own it;
                  and for doing so I have been repaid in knowledge which, I hope, will benefit me
                  through all my life. I regret very much that each of you did not accompany me with
                  your sympathies to the house of that heart-broken woman. You have lost much—more
                  than you are aware of. You have seen beautiful pictures, wrought out in grandeur,
                  upon the rugged mountain side; but I have seen and sought to heal a wounded
                  heart."
               "Why, dear me, Kate! we couldn't go there at all. I am surprised that you should
                  think of such a thing. Our education is all against that. We would have given you
                  our charity to have carried with you to that family."
               
               "Ah!" said Kate, "they are cheerless enough now, without being frozen by those
                  charities which are unaccompanied by the heart."
               "Oh! we didn't mean to freeze them, but to tell you what we would have been
                  willing to do if you had made the request. We are not misers; but as for going to
                  such low places as that, we can't do it, and what's more, our parents would not
                  permit us to do so. We thought it stronge enough that you went, but then we
                  referred it all to the strange sentimentalism which has been coming over you ever
                  since you took that little ragged class of vagrants, whom your father tamed, and
                  brought into the Sunday school. I suppose it's all right, but we can't do it. We
                  ain't liberal enough to teach little vagrants!"
               "Lucy, I beseech you do not use that word vagrant, for there is
                  something about it so unnatural and chilling, and so very cruel, when applied to
                  children, who, in many instances, if they are almost any thing that is bad, are so
                  from the force of circumstances. Those children, whom in your mirth you are
                  pleased to call vagrants, are indeed very poor. Some of them have poor mothers,
                  but unfortunately all of them have fathers who are intemperate. I have been at
                  their homes, and I know what their miseries are. I am willing to admit that there
                  are cases when that term of reproach may have an application, but it never will
                  apply to the child It ought to be stricken from the catalogue of reproach proach,
                  and some other word, one that has a winning spirit, instituted in its place.
                  Better call them victims."
               "Whose victims, Kate?"
               "The rumsellers, Lucy. Suppose those children nad overheard you, pointing them out
                  by that cold word—would its tendency have been to make them better or worse? I
                  love those children—not because they are the children of intemperate fathers—but
                  because they are human beings, whose destiny must be shaped for good or for evil.
                  The diamond, although it may be unsightly when taken from its bed, yet when it has
                  passed through a refining process, it may vie with the sun. So with these
                  children. If they are poor, and comparatively uncared for now, by sympathetic
                  care, they may be prepared for usefulness here and happiness hereafter. Do not,
                  therefore, use the word vagrant, when you speak of children, and be careful how
                  you apply it when you speak of the young or of the old, however far they may be
                  advanced in crime. Oh, remember that poverty is not without its feeling
                  instinct—nor is misery without its sensitive spirit."
               "Well, Kate," said Lucy, "I will give you my word it won't be used again. You seem
                  to have a special respect for poverty and low-life, and it amounts almost to
                  making heroes out of your little worthies. I never yet have crossed the threshold
                  of poverty, and that may be the reason why I do not look at the matter as you
                  do."
               
               "Poverty," replied Kate, "is by no means rare, and you may yet be forced to cross
                  its threshold in entering your own home. We can't tell what's before us. Poverty,
                  when virtue clusters about it as a defence, is able to stand in the evil day; but
                  poverty, when it has combined with vice and shame, has no defence; but yet, even
                  this kind is not hopeless—it may be restored. Kindness may revolutionize the soul,
                  and win it back to the ways of peace. 'Vagrant' has a tendency to harden and
                  deprave those to whom it is applied."
               "Ha, ha! indeed, you are getting sentimental. Your visits amongst the hills have
                  wonderfully affected you. But, Kate, you may do as you please, but you cannot make
                  me mingle with this kind of low life. It's a pity these low people can't make out
                  to get along with their own society. It's good enough for them, and they ought to
                  be contented. It's out of the question for them ever to be respectable. I presume
                  they were always just so."
               "I am surprised," replied Kate, "to hear you talk in this way. Why, the rumseller
                  can make almost any thing that is bad. He can change an industrious into an idle
                  man—an honorable into a dishonorable one—an affectionate father and husband into a
                  fiend. Yes, he can turn a domestic paradise into something as rayless and as
                  cheerless as Egyptian night."
               "Well, now, Kate, this is strange. Just look at it. You know, as well as I do,
                  that these drunkards ards are low people, and that they can never rise—it is their
                  nature to be just what they are. If rumsellers were doing the harm that you talk
                  about, do you think that intelligent people would sustain them?—I guess not."
               "I admit, Lucy, that it is strange; but far the worst is, that it is true. If
                  intelligent Christian people had that jealous fear for the peace and safety of
                  their own homes, which one would think they would have—if the peace and happiness
                  of their sons and their daughters, which is precious above every price, and which
                  is daily menaced by this monster cruelty—they would shake it, with the mighty
                  energy of a giant's grasp, to the earth. Oh, Lucy, but it does seem as if a
                  mercy-loving God would soon awake to full vigor, the slumbering instinct of
                  humanity. It does seem as if it must awake before long, to avenge the widow and
                  the orphan. I am well persuaded that it is only because people do not more
                  familiarize themselves with the homes—the wants and the miseries of the drunkard's
                  family—that they are so slow to move on this subject."
               "Kate, this would be a nice work for genteel people—to be caught in the alleys,
                  and garrets, and cellars of those miserable places. I am utterly astonished that
                  you should think of such a thing. Kate, you are an exception to every thing. You
                  are good—better than you ought to be."
               "Thank you, Lucy; but I think God made genteel teel people to be more than the slaves of
                  fashion—for more than to bend their necks to receive and wear its yoke. If this is
                  all that genteel people feel to be their duty in life, then they will come down to
                  the grave with not a single duty of life discharged. You may laugh now; but you
                  would weep if your brother were a drunkard."
               "Oh, Kate, there is no danger of that: that's impossible."
               "I admit, Lucy, that it is improbable, but I can not admit that it is impossible.
                  I have heard of many, and especially of one, who, so far as natural nobleness
                  could make him such, was as good as any brother, and, until cursed by the
                  rumseller, was as noble a son as any one over whose destiny a mother's heart ever
                  yearned."
               "Pray, Kate, who was this paragon of excellence?"
               "He was a widow's son."
               "Ah! I see: poverty made him noble."
               "You are mistaken. Wealth made him unsuspicious."
               "Where does he live?"
               "God only knows, if now he lives at all."
               "Well, what is his name? You can tell that."
               "Not now."
               "Why not?"
               "With the name there are other things you must know."
               "Why must I know them?"
               "Because you are connected with them, and you are a part of the scene."
               "Where did you learn all this?"
               "From the lips of that poor widow."
               "Oh, fie! Kate, you are a good girl; but if that poor widow and a strayed or
                  stolen son are the heroes, I guess it ain't very interesting."
               "Oh, yes," replied Kate, pleasantly, yet earnestly, "you would like to hear
                  it."
               "Well, what is that widow's name?"
               "I did not intend to tell you," replied Kate, "but I will. Her name is
                  Wilson."
               "Wilson? Wilson? Has she lived there long?"
               "I believe not."
               "That name seems to be familiar."
               "Yes, I presume it is. Do you remember spending several months in the village of
                  B——? You know the portrait which is hanging in our parlor? You have often admired
                  it, and several times you said that it reminded you very much of one you had seen.
                  You were right: it was his. It was poor—but never mind now."
               She who had been the reputed 'belle' in the village of B——, started in
                  astonishment, and the deep anxiety in her countenance made it a matter of general
                  interest, and Kate was besieged with requests that she would relate the widow's
                  history, which she agreed to do, if at an appointed time they would meet her at
                  home.
               
               They reached the depot, and the passengers were hurrying to their respective
                  homes. The grief of one can reach the heart of another and tinge with sadness even
                  the glowing cheek of beauty; but when it does, it makes that cheek look all the
                  lovelier. This the traveler saw in the beautiful demonstration before him; for in
                  every feature of that beautiful girl, gentleness, love and dignity were
                  surpassingly developed. There she had stood in the midst of that smiling, fickle
                  band, the only one of their number who could defend, with heroic magnanimity, the
                  poor and unfortunate—laying the blame where of right it belonged, at the door of
                  the rumseller.
               Oh! that the youth of America—those whose banners, ornamented by the hands of
                  their gentle sisters, and followed by their prayers, have often danced proudly on
                  the battle-field, and waved defiance in the face of the maddening charge—were all
                  like this young heroine of virtue!

               KATE HAMILTON AND MRS. WILSON.
               
                  
                     
                        "O ye, to pleasure who resign the day,
                        As loose in Luxury's clasping arms you lie,
                        O yet let Pity in your breast bear sway,
                        And learn to melt at Misery's moving cry."
                     
                  
               
               "WELL, girls," said Kate Hamilton, when her auditors had assembled at her father's
                  house, "you seem to think that wealth and respectability are proof against those
                  changes of condition which often result from the rum traffic."
               "Ah!" said Mr. Hamilton, "that's a great mistake, as in my limited experience I
                  have already known more than a dozen wealthy and worthy families who have been
                  reduced to beggary and rendered miserable by intemperance."
               Here it was evident enough that Kate's auditors were fearful, lest Mr. Hamilton
                  should rise above the common-place morals to which they were accustomed, and give
                  the matter a seriousness which they thought would lessen its interest. Kate had
                  already informed her parents of all that she had seen or heard from the widow, and
                  in their own domestic circle, in a
                  feeling and Christian manner, they had canvassed the subject.
               "Now," said Kate, "if you still entertain the opinion you did, I think I can
                  convince you that you are wrong, and that reverses have a foundation in fact
                  deeper than they usually have in the wildest fiction."
               "Kate," said the young lady who had been foremost in the conversation on the cars,
                  "do you know who that portrait represents?"
               "I do know the individual by report," said Kate.
               "Have you ever seen him?"
               "I have not."
               "How did that portrait come into your possession?"
               "Frank brought it home with him from college."
               "Did he never tell you whom it represented?"
               "Yes; but until very recently we had forgotten the name. Dick Wilson is the
                  original."
               "Dick Wilson! Kate, you are jesting."
               "Yes," said the matronly-looking Mrs. Hamilton, as an expression of sorrow passed
                  over her face, "that was very cruel in you; but I suppose you did not look at the
                  consequences. Kate will tell you."
               "Are you sure, Kate, that the person represented there was called Dick
                  Wilson?"
               "Yes, I am sure of it. He was a most intimate friend of my brother's, and in
                  looking over Frank's old letters a day or two since, I found several from him. Did
                  you ever know a person of that name?"
               "Fate," said Lucy, "has brought me here this evening, to rehearse to me a lesson I
                  was trying to forget. Go on, Kate. Fate has managed this matter, and although so
                  short a time has elapsed, I vainly hoped that pleasure had erased it from my
                  memory forever."
               "These things," said Mrs. Hamilton again, "are hard to banish. The thorns which we
                  pluck with our own hands, and place in our own beds, will surely pierce us, and
                  often with many sorrows."
               "Fate is a hard master," said Lucy, as she looked intently into the unruffled
                  countenance, which brought back the thronging recollections of the past, and from
                  which she seemed to hear, in a gentle whisper which spoke to her heart, 'I have a
                  mother,' and then, as on that fearful day in the courthouse of B——, it seemed to
                  be rushing from her presence in the wild frenzy of despair. For a few moments she
                  seemed to be deeply absorbed in reflection, in which, no doubt, the past history
                  of the individual pictured before her was rising in its sad realities, and she
                  faintly ejaculated, "Where is he? Where is he?"
               "On the sunny plains of Mexico," said Kate, "he sleeps a quiet sleep in a
                  soldier's grave, where the din of battle and the wail of the dying chanted his
                  requiem. Ah! but say not 'fate,' for it is a cerles s word, and here it is wholly
                     inapplicable. Fate, mingling in our
                  misfortunes, would encircle them with additional terrors, and so continue, until
                  even despair would be welcome to the heart. Say Providence: there is
                  something sweet and inspiring in the vastness, the intelligence and goodness
                  expressed by that word."
               "You say he sleeps, Kate?"
               "Aye, the long sleep, dear girl, which is broken only by the resurrection. But I
                  will tell you all in its connection."
               "Go on, Kate. Oh! if once again I could see that face as on that fatal night when
                  I first saw it. Then beauty and dignity covered it, and then I, a foolish girl,
                  was willing to contract for its ruin, and for the breaking of those hearts to whom
                  misfortune had endeared it. There is a witchery in the wine cup which, until now,
                  I never saw."
               We feel, but cannot explain, the laws of association by which we are
                  surrounded—the nicety with which they are woven into the very constitution of our
                  being; and yet we know that by this connection the simplest agency may awake in
                  our recollections—in our very souls—those events which in joy or sorrow rise up
                  before us again; and they have a whispering voice which has power to chain and
                  hold in captivity even the stern energies of a mind which ordinarily is not easily
                  moved.
               Oh yes, grief-smitten mother! in your premature widowhood you have felt, seen,
                  known, that there is a fearful meaning in the feeblest memento. Even the wail of
                  your infant child can call up those overwhelming recollections which remind you of
                  the bright days of your home—days which were darkened by the coming of the
                  rumseller, to riot without mercy on the affections of that home.
               "Now, girls," said Kate Hamilton, "why or how it was that I strayed from your
                  society during our recent visit I cannot tell; and neither can I tell why it was
                  that my attention was directed to that family. But one thing is certain—we don't
                  always direct our own steps. The old grave yard lying just opposite the house,
                  with its antique appearance, attracted my curiosity, and I entered it. After
                  passing through it, I seated myself on a beautiful grassy knoll, whose sweet
                  appearance during a century had kept at bay the grave-digger's spade. The door of
                  that humble dwelling was wide open, and I was sure that it was the abode of
                  poverty. Occasionally I caught a glimpse of the inmates; but after all, the grave
                  yard was my theme, and I was unwilling to be interrupted. I was rising to depart,
                  better, I hope, than when I entered, when my attention was arrested by what to me,
                  at that moment, seemed to be the finest music to which I had ever listened. The
                  singers were trilling, with a mournful cadence, in which feeling and musical
                  precision were blended into the sweetest harmony, a precious old song, to which I
                  am passionately attached, and I listened as if listening to the music of
                  seraphims, while they sung, with a rich, clear melody, the words,
                  
                     
                        'Oh, come, come with me to the old kirk yard,
                        For I well know the spot, through the old green sward;
                        Friends slumber there we were wont to regard,
                        And we'll trace out their names in the old kirk yard.'
                     
                   An indescribable sensation came over me, and as they concluded, I said
                  involuntarily to myself—'Here I am, amidst the rural scenery of nature, where I
                  expected to hear no music but that which is breathed from nature's own lungs, and
                  yet here I have heard almost the perfection of that rare accomplishment.' I knew
                  very well that nature educated in some degree her own children—that her high
                  mountains and dashing cataracts could give to her rural offspring the fervid
                  inspiration as well as the rich, mellow voices to which I was then listening—but I
                  knew that nature could never give that elegant precision. I rose from the
                  beautiful spot where I had seated myself, in the resting-place of the dead, and
                  crossed over the street to the door. Oh, if you had seen that group! The door was
                  still open, and I could see them plainly; and what a contrast there was between
                  those pale cheeks and those rich voices! There sat three persons—a mother, a
                  daughter, and a little boy—grouped together in the informal order of true
                  affection; and it seemed as if they were trying to console each other to the last.
                  They were sad indeed, but intelligence and dignity were in their sadness. They
                  were pale, but there was beauty in their paleness. They were poor, but there was
                  an evident nobility in their poverty. And last of all—any one might have read in
                  the calm expression of their countenances, that in enduring riches
                  they were princely. As I stood before the door they invited me to enter, without
                  any appearance of confusion; and as I did so, the young girl immediately handed me
                  a chair. After seating myself, I asked to be excused for the informal manner in
                  which I had made my appearance, and then told them how passionately I was attached
                  to the song which they had been singing.
               "'We are glad to see you,' said she, who proved to be the mother of the two by her
                  side. 'That old song is very precious to us; and yet we seldom sing it—only when
                  we would hold fellowship with those whom it vividly pictures to our mind, as when
                  in the bloom of youth and in the strength of manhood.'
               "I asked them to sing 'The Old Kirk Yard' again, and they cheerfully complied with
                  my request. When they had finished it, and wiped the tears from their cheeks, the
                  little boy, with a pleasant, playful smile, approached me. To me there was
                  something remarkable in that boy's countenance. It seemed as if I had been
                  acquainted with it for years, and yet I was sure that I had never seen it before.
                  Placing his hand in mine, he said,
               "'Will you please, Miss, to tell us your name? You don't live about here, do
                  you?'
               "I told him that my name was Kate Hamilton, and said, 'Now you will tell me your
                  name, wont you?'
               
               "'Yes, Miss,' said he; 'my nams is Harry Wilson.'
               "I then asked the lady if she had resided long in the place, to which she replied
                  that they had been there but a short time, and that the city of —— was their
                  native place.
               "I replied, 'I thought this was not your native place.'
               "'Oh no!' she continued, "we are almost as much strangers here as you are
                  yourself. Myself and my poor children came here recently, and are comparatively
                  strangers. We were forced to turn our backs upon our native place. Yes, yes!' she
                  continued, in a paroxysm of grief, 'the city of —— is our native place—my own, and
                  the birth-place of my children. It will remain our native place forever; but,
                  alas! we may not hope that it will ever again be our home. All is lost—all that
                  endeared it to us is gone! Our home, with its cherished objects, has been swept
                  away forever. Other feet are moving, and other hearts are happy, at this moment,
                  where our feet once moved, and where our hearts were once happy; but that was
                  before the spoiler came. Other voices are ringing in merriment through halls which
                  once were familiar with ours, and other children are prattling in the same nursery
                  where these poor children once prattled; and, oh! may they never feel in those
                  same halls the bitterness which we inherit! But, O God! by what fearful
                  temptations is poor human nature continually ally surrounded, and especially in
                  fashionable life. The rich may often do what the poor dare not: but this is a
                  fearful evidence that their path is doubly perilous, and that it is as much
                  subjected to the inroads of the rumseller as is the path of the poor. Miss
                  Hamilton, he has ruined us! When I look at my poor
                  children, what must I think of him? When my heart turns to the grave yard, can I
                  bless him? When I go forth in thought to search for the grave of my lost one, can
                  I have words of kindness for him? No, no! I cannot; but I will not curse him. I
                  will leave him in the hands of that God from whose judgment he cannot escape.
                  These children, four years since, had before them the prospect of ample wealth,
                  and claimed a place in the best society. I say the best, for so it is called; but
                  it's often greatly misnamed. Their morning was as bright as it could have been;
                  but it has been quickly succeeded by a dark day of gloom and affliction. What are
                  they now? They are young—they are innocent—they are uncomplaining. A murmur is
                  scarcely heard from them. They are poor, and to a great extent they are uncared
                  for by any save myself. I have this picture continually before me. I can close my
                  eyes, but I cannot shut my heart. I see them shut out from society; and then I see
                  the fearful consequences which necessarily follow—the scoffs and the insults of
                  the rude and the low-bred, mingled with the chilling indifference of the proud. I
                  see them pouring out their griefs and their tears in secret places, where none but the eye of God can
                  see them: and when I see this, how painfully appears before me the contrast and
                  the cause. Oh, yes! my young friend, when I see all this, as it comes unbidden to
                  my mind, with the appalling visage of some dark spectre, bearing misery to the
                  hearts of those dear ones of mine, whom a gracious God has yet spared to me, it
                  almost drives me to madness. When I see and feel this, I cannot help concluding
                  that the rumseller's business is humanity's bitterest curse; that he who pleads
                  for it is doing a flagrant wrong to his kind. I know not how soon this fragile
                  form of mine may bend to the earth before the rude storm, whose fury has loosened
                  my hold on life. My children may yet become the inmates of the poor-house, but
                  while I live I shall labor to prevent it.'
               "'Our circumstances,' she continued, 'have been very different from what they now
                  are. My husband was a wealthy merchant in the city of ——. He had a generous
                  disposition, and we had all of earthly comfort that our hearts could desire. We
                  had joy, happiness, friends. We supposed that these things would outlive
                  ourselves, and be a portion for our children. He was richly endowed with all the
                  social qualities of life, and his manners were winning in the highest degree. He
                  loved his family as he did his life. Our style of living was fashionable. In this
                  respect, I can truly say, that it amounted to folly; but then we could not avoid
                  it: for our circumstances, together with our position in fashionable life,
                  fastened it upon us, and for myself, I endured rather than enjoyed it. We suffered
                  this cruel species of slavery, because we could not break the chain. But it is
                  broken now—broken by its own rottenness, and just when it had succeeded in
                  paralyzing those energies which should have been free to meet and struggle with
                  adversity. Our side, board—ah! yes; here was our fatal mistake—was always richly
                  furnished with sparkling decanters, to which the friend was always made welcome,
                  because we thought there was no harm in it, and no
                     danger to be apprehended from it! It seemed to bring cheer to their
                  hearts, and wit and sprightliness to the conversation of our guests; and many who
                  have forgotten the name of Mary Wilson, will have difficulty in forgetting the
                  kindness with which their coming was always greeted at our house. In all this we
                  saw no danger. Our children were growing up around us, and our domestic happiness
                  was completed by their childish love. It was fashion's voice, and we
                  obeyed the call; for it promised to screen us from the evil hour, if,
                  peradventure, it should ever come. We never thought that this stream would
                  overflow its banks—we never dreamed that that side boad, in our own house, was
                  opening a path to the bar of the rumseller. There was one, however,
                  who saw the danger, but who, from fear of offending, did not mention it until it
                  became apparent to myself. One day a person entered our parlor and inquired for my husband. He
                  was an old minister, whose locks had been whitened by age, and who was an intimate
                  friend of our family. My husband and myself had every confidence in him, and were
                  always glad to see him entering our house, for we knew that our good was the
                  object he sought to promote. My husband was at home, but at first refused to come
                  into the parlor. I expostulated with him, and entreated him by the proverbial
                  civilities of his house to come in at once. I could not at first understand why he
                  was so reluctant to see this good old man; but directly the truth flashed upon my
                  mind, and I said:
               "'Come, Richard, he will do you no harm. His visits are always cheering,' and
                  taking him by the hand, we entered the parlor together, and my husband welcomed
                  him with genuine cordiality. In the society of that old man, no one could have
                  kept back the acknowledgment that his presence rendered the very atmosphere more
                  sacred. On this occasion he was familiar and affable as usual, and yet, although
                  he had not named the purpose of his coming, it was evident that a sense of duty
                  had directed his steps to our door. For some moments he seemed to be engaged in a
                  struggle with his own feelings. It seemed as if he were looking deeply into his
                  own heart, in which a sense of paramount duty was struggling with the very natural
                  fear of offending. He began:
               "'Mr. Wilson,' said he, 'it is now a little more than nine and thirty years since
                  a pious mother, now in heaven, I have no doubt, brought you in her arms to the
                  altar of God, where at my hands you received the sacred rite of baptism. You have
                  grown up to manhood, and you are surrounded by a young family. You have been
                  blessed with all the comforts that the world can give; and yet I am fearful that
                  you will find it to be after all a broken staff. I have often prayed that the
                  prayers of your mother might be answered; but my hopes are every day declining.
                  Wealth and fashion, Mr. Wilson, are fearful obstacles in the way of a faithful
                  discharge of duty. It has been so with me on many occasions. I have come to your
                  house before on the same errand which has brought me here today, and I have gone
                  away again, cast down and discouraged—almost resolved to let you go. But why
                  should I fear to appoach this subject, or conclude that it will be thanklessly
                  received? If I had overheard a band of incendiaries covenanting amongst
                  themselves, that at the solemn and lonely hour of midnight they would fire your
                  dwelling, I surely would hasten to you with the tidings, and you would thank me
                  for it, too. Or if I had heard the low, stealthy whispers of an assassin band,
                  fixing the hour of your destruction, would I not hasten to you to warn you of your
                  danger? and would you not thank me for it? Or if I knew that in your absence your
                  wife and your children were to be hurried out of this house and launched into the
                  jaws of an unrelenting poverty, would I
                  not, for the love I bear to yourself, your wife and your young children, hasten to
                  your door, break in upon your quiet slumbers, and bid you to be watchful?—and you
                  would thank me for it, too. Mr. Wilson, I see all this, and more than all this,
                  looming in terror about your door. I see ruin, misery and death flocking to your
                  threshold, to blight its joys. I see your wife and children, unless there is a
                  rapid change, taking a last, a wild glance at all that is left there to love, then
                  turning from these halls, to enter them no more. I see them on their way to your
                  yet fresh grave, to consecrate it with tears.
               "'What reason have you,' said my husband, 'for those alarming conjectures? I
                  apprehend no such danger as that of which you speak. I know no cause for
                  alarm.'
               "'I know, Mr. Wilson,' said he, 'that the wine cup is obtaining the mastery over
                  you; there is, therefore, most imminent danger.'
               "'I do not think it is,' replied my husband.
               "'Ah! Mr. Wilson, that increases the danger. You do not see it yourself; if you
                  did, you might avoid it.'
               "'Well, it is strange, sir,' said my husband, 'if such is the fact, that I should
                  not know it. I think I am safe enough, however.'
               "'Well, Mr. Wilson, I am sorry that you think so. I wish it were true; but a long
                  experience has taught me that with perseverance in this way, ruin— the ruin of
                  every thing—is inevitable. I am sure the wine cup is becoming your master. I do
                  not see the evidence of this in your domestic circle; nor do I see it so much upon
                  your cheek, as I do in the grass-grown path of your former life—a path in which
                  you were won't to travel in the discharge of high and sacred obligations. This
                  path is closing, and I see a fresh path, which is every day widening and
                  deepening, from your door-stone to the place of sin and death; and there I see you
                  sitting with apparent cheer, in the rumseller's den. Ah! my friend, he is skilled
                  in his business. He knows every turn in the road along which yourself and your
                  possessions are coming into his power. I have not seen you engaging in the revels
                  which are usual in many of those places; but you have argued in favor of the
                  liberty to sell rum. Your temperament, Mr. Wilson, is of the kind which will move
                  you fast in whatever direction you take. You are unsuspecting, and hence direful
                  consequences will come to you unexpectedly, and before you are aware of it.
                  Forsake your course quickly, as you love your own soul—your own peace—as you love
                  your family, as you value every thing that is dear upon the earth, or sacred in
                  heaven. Forsake it, and return again to duty, to peace and hope. As you have been
                  in the bar-room from time to time, have you not frequently met with those who were
                  habitually there, wasting themselves and squandering the little for which penury
                  was pleading at home? Beware of these
                  associations, Mr. Wilson, for they will ruin you. Beware of your own conduct, too,
                  for you may ruin hundreds. Your position gives you influence to do harm as well as
                  good. You may ruin your own family, and you may wound a thousand hearts, and cause
                  them to bleed through the whole journey of life.'
               "After engaging in a fervent prayer, the echoes of which are yet alive in my
                  heart, he rose to leave; but on reaching the door, to which my husband had
                  occompanied him, he suddenly halted, and taking him by the hand, said:
               "'Now, Mr. Wilson, I beseech you, by the memories of those who are sleeping on the
                  shores of the Delaware; I beseech you by the loves and the hopes of the living; I
                  beseech you as a husband, father, friend; I beseech you by every thing, present
                  and future, and by all that pertains to the endearing relations of life; for the
                  sake of crushed and bleeding humanity; for the sake of your own present and
                  eternal interests, and in view of your dying hour—turn yourself and your influence
                  against the rumseller.'
               "My husband sat down for a moment, as if appalled by what had passed. There was no
                  evidence of passion in his countenance, and rising in an agitated manner, he
                  commenced pacing the room. Suddenly he came up to me, and taking me by the hand,
                  said:
               "'Mary, can you tell me what Mr. J—— means? I was not prepared for such a shock as
                  this. It is both sudden and strange. Surely he does not think that I am a
                     drunkard! Then what under the heavens does it mean? Do you think
                  any of the children overheard the conversation? If they did, you must right it in
                  some way.'
               "'You can do this, Richard,' I replied, 'better than I can, and without speaking a
                  single word to them.'
               "'How, Mary?' he immediately inquired.
               "'Ah! my husband,' I continued, 'can't you tell how? Go a little into the past
                  history of our home, and see if you cannot get my meaning. I have never chided nor
                  reproved you harshly, and I never will; but still I am not blind.'
               "'Mary! what do you mean?—for heaven's sake tell me, and I will do any thing that
                  is not absolutely impossible.'
               "'Richard,' I replied, 'do you remember the pride and pleasure you once took in
                  spending your evenings in the society of your family? Do you remember how often
                  you have quoted to me those beautiful lines— 
                     
                        "Home! who can tell
                        The touching power of that most sacred word,
                        Save he who feels and weeps that he has none?"
                     
                  
               
               "'Yes, Mary, I do remember, and they are dear to me now.'
               "'Are they as dear as they once were; or are beauty and loveliness passing from the cheeks of those
                  dear children?'
               "'Mary,' said he, while the tears rolled down his cheeks, 'they are dear to
                  me—they are a part of my being. You do not think that these children could lose
                  their place in my affections?'
               "'But, my husband,' I replied, 'others have the power to rob us of your
                  society.'
               "'Oh! Mary, it is my business that is pressing me—necessity compels me to be
                  absent from you.'
               "'Richard, is it not the necessity of which our friend has spoken.'
               "'Do you think, Mary, he could have seen me there?'
               "'Where, my husband?' I inquired.
               "'No matter,' said he, 'I was wandering.'
               "'Do tell me, Richard, where you meant?'
               "'Yes, Mary, I may as well tell you—I mean the rumsellers—and you
                  have as good a right to know as any one else.'
               "'Ah! that is what I feared,' I replied. 'That has troubled me. The rumseller's
                  work! Let heaven name it properly; for as yet it has not a name which denotes its
                  dark character. I have seen its fruits in the face of age and childhood, as they
                  have come to our door for charity, and I thank God that I have always tried to
                  sympathize with them; for the day may come when we may need the sympathy of
                  others! Oh! Richard, won't you promise me that you will forsake those unworthy
                  associates, and that you will turn your influence against them at once? Won't you
                  join with the humane in prayer to God against this business, which is rife with
                  every misfortune?'
               "'Yes, Mary,' said he, 'I will promise you that I will at once forsake these men,
                  and these places. I know what they are better than you do. You have only seen the
                  product of their labor—I have seen the machinery in its terrible operation. I
                  promise, you, Mary, and I call God to witness, that I will forsake them. I never
                  knew what misery was, until I became familiar with it at these haunts.'
               "'At the sound of these words, my heart leaped for joy, and I thanked God
                  fervently for having sent his servant on that day to our house. Again the holy
                  lamp of life was lighted, and burned brightly in my soul, because I thought it was
                  burning with like brilliancy in the bosom of my husband. Alas! how little after
                  all did we know of the rumseller's power! I did not think that it could throw
                  itself into the domestic circle, and lead out its reluctant victim to the
                  slaughter! It has done it. The law, the boast of civilization,
                  sanctions it. I am its witness—these children are seals set to its truth."'
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIX.
               WHAT RUM DOES.
               
                  
                     
                        "Fly trom the wine cup,
                        Though pleasure may swim
                        In the bright rosy bubbles
                        That float round the brim.
                        Far down 'neath the depths
                        Of the red wine that flows,
                        Lurks the Syren that lures
                        To the vortex of woes."
                     
                  
               
               "'IF I had known,' continued Mrs. Wilson, 'what a fearful power the rumseller
                  swayed over his victim, I could hardly have cherished a single hope for my
                  husband's safety. Such knowledge, however, at that time, was impossible; for then
                  I could not suspect a human being of such absolute cruelty. If I had then
                  understood that its charm was serpent-like in its character, and that
                  it never removed its eye from its prey until its victim entered its jaws—then I
                  should have resigned my husband to his inevitable destiny, and given myself to
                  preparation for the worst. For a time I was happy again—happy in the presence of
                  my husband, as when mutually we smiled upon our first born. Our children seemed
                  happier—every thing appeared more lovely, and to me it seemed as if the fast
                  wilting leaves of hope had suddenly ceased to wither, and had arrayed themselves
                  once more in freshness and in beauty. Oh! what a broad, deep, and sacred
                  foundation does that hope, which concentrates in the well-being of a loved one,
                  lay in the soul, and how does the full tides of interest and affection love to
                  sport at its base, and rejoice in its success. One morning, as my husband was
                  leaving the breakfast table, in better spirits and with a more cheerful manner
                  than he had manifested in many days, he called me aside and said—
               "'Mary, you look happier than you have done in months. Every thing seems to be
                  clad in new life. It is strange that I should not have seen this before. I never
                  supposed that any thing could hold such a spell over my being, as to darken my
                  mind, and mutilate my hopes and my happiness at the same time. I feel, and have
                  felt for days, as one who had been brought back from the grave, or as one who had
                  been released from the grasp of uncompromising tyranny. Oh! the headaches and the
                  heart-aches of that path!—the gloom, the anticipations of a lingering death on
                  earth; and then—oh yes! and then, the lingering death—which, in the far beyond,
                  still linked to life, utterly refuses to die! Don't you think, Mary, it was a
                  happy thing for us that God sent that old man to our house to alarm me—to warn me
                  of danger?'
               "'My heart was wild with glad emotion, and I answered, yes, dear Richard, I think it was; and I
                  am sure we can never be sufficiently thankful; for you were well nigh hopelessly
                  tangled in the meshes of the rumseller's net.'
               "'There is no doubt about that, Mary,' said he, 'but you can know but little of
                  its peril. Indeed, it is impossible for any one to know it, except those who have
                  unconsciously fallen under its lash, and smarted from its stripes! But, Mary, you
                  must pray for me; for as much as I love you, much as I idolize our dear children,
                  and much as I value our domestic peace and happiness, I must tell you that it is
                  difficult for me to keep my resolution, and realize the cherished wish of my
                  heart. You may think this strange; but wherever I turn, I meet the temptation to
                  forswear myself, and jeopardise every interest of my life. To get without the
                  reach of it is impossible. In every street, and at every corner, start out those
                  forces, before which a trembling resolution falters—generally falls!
                  These temptations, Mary—ah! here is the secret—before them every thing gives way!
                  Remove them and the poor drunkard will make and keep his resolution
                  to live soberly; but until this is done, nine out of every ten will fall—fall
                  hopelessly and forever!'
               "'We had many conversations of this kind, and I hoped and believed,
                  notwithstanding the danger by which my husband was surrounded, that he was safe! I
                  thought our happiness secured. It was, after all, a dream; and why did I permit
                  myself to hope? The rumseller! the rumseller! It is his to abrogate every oath
                  which his marked victim may have taken before the altar of affection, in the heart
                  of his beseeching wife and children! It is his to stand by till the last drop of
                  blood has fallen to the ground; and then to exclaim, with inhuman indifference—'It
                  is a pity that he ruined himself! He was indeed a clever fellow; but he would have
                  rum!' Himself! Himself, indeed! Look at your victim! His blood has all flowed
                  out—his eye is closed—his heart is quiet! Did you not measure out to him the
                  poison? Then, like Cain, you have slain your brother. This is the verdict
                  rendered, not only by widows and orphans, but by humanity at large. Gradually I
                  saw that the resolution of my husband was giving way before the temptations by
                  which he was beset, and soon his time was given again to the society of the bar
                  room—the deadly upas from which I feared he could not escape. My hopes were almost
                  dead, and I had well nigh concluded that it would be useless to attempt his
                  reformation. Ah! but thought I, that victim is my husband. Our mutual oaths went
                  up together to heaven, and were recorded there, side by side; and now shall I give
                  him up, and let him die as the brute dieth? The instincts of a wife, of a mother,
                  forbid it. On one pleasant morning, when every thing without was bright and
                  beautiful, and when every thing within my heart was sad and cheerless, I took him
                  into the parlor, that we might be alone, and then said to him—'Richard, this is a lovely morning,' and in an abstracted
                  manner he said—
               "'Yes, Mary, it is; but I must really go. I have some important business this
                  morning, which is waiting for me, at the store.'
               "'I understood it, and said—'Tell me, Richard, may I hope any longer?'
               "'Mary,' he replied, 'it is useless for me to try. My resolution is broken, and it
                  would avail me nothing if I should resolve again. You had better make up your mind
                  to the worst; for, Mary, it will come. I cannot prevent it, and I fear it is not
                  far off. They have too much power over me. I am too weak to stand against the
                  temptation. There was a time when I could have done it; but that time is past, and
                  I beseech you, let me go!'
               "'How can I do this?' I inquired. For some moments he made no reply. He had placed
                  his handkerchief to his face, and was weeping bitterly. His whole frame denoted
                  intense agitation. Oh! Miss Hamilton, that was a fearful sight to look upon: to
                  see the father and the husband bathed in tears and trembling in agony, dragged out
                  from the loves of his own house by the witchery of rum. At length he said to
                  me—
               "'I feel that I cannot recover myself. If any one, two years since, had pointed to
                  this fearful moment, I would have asked the question. 'Am I a dog, that I should
                  do this thing?' But it is done, and now I cannot help it!'
               "'You love me, Richard?' I replied.
               "'Yes, Mary, as I ever did.'
               "'And you love your children?'
               "'Yes, Mary; these poor children—I love them, but they will have but little cause
                  either to love or respect my memory. What is to become of them? My character is
                  ruined not only, but my estate also! Ah! Mary, you will soon know all. The
                  prediction of our old friend is rapidly fulfilling. The storm has gathered and is
                  ready to break.'
               "'Richard,' I continued, 'won't you resolve, and try again? Oh! if it be possible
                  for you to escape, do not give yourself up to destruction. Your wife—your
                  children—yourself! Oh, God! must all be lost! Won't you try again?'
               "'Oh, Mary! dear Mary!' he replied, 'you know not how the strong man trembles, and
                  how he writhes in utter hopelessness, when he has once become the slave that I am.
                  I would do any thing to be free again, but it is too late. Mary, make up your mind
                  to let me go, and as soon as possible let the cold grave hide me, since for me
                  there is no more peace, and I live only to disgrace you and our dear family.'
               "'I hope, Miss Hamilton, that your heart will never be rent by the influence of
                  such a terriffic moment. During that day, for the sake of my children, I assumed
                  an air of composure, impressed, however, with a feeling that the worst would soon
                  come. At this moment one of the servants came in, and announced the entrance of Mrs. Philips, one
                  whom, of all others of my acquaintance, I least desired to see. She was a married
                  lady, of middle age, to whom fortune had come suddenly, and she was one of the
                  most envious spirits I ever knew. As soon as she recovered from her affected
                  sympathy, and had satisfied herself with a survey of our parlor, she said—
               "'Mrs. Wilson, it is hard—very hard—absolutely cruel. You can't endure it—its
                  dreadful hard to suffer all this—it will kill you. It's a shame for people to take
                  such advantages. I did not think, Mrs. Wilson, that there were such mean,
                     dishonest people in this city. This fine house and furniture, and
                  yourself and your sweet children! Has there been any one here yet, to look at your
                  furniture? All these nice things must go, and I dare say they will go cheap.
                  That's an elegant piano—pure rose wood; and these carpets—in fact every thing is
                  of the best quality. I would like to have some of these things. Ever since I heard
                  of the advertisement, I have hardly slept a wink. I presume you would be just as
                  willing that I should have some of them, as any one else. You would rather see
                  them taken by your friends than by strangers.'
               "'I was almost stupefied, and inquired what she meant.'
               "'Why, dear me, Mrs. Wilson, don't you know? Why you are to be sold out of every
                  thing which the law don't allow you, in three weeks. Your husband
                  band is broke clear down; and every body says that it will be impossible for him
                  to recover. His store is closed, and has been for two days. I am told, and I
                  suppose it is true enough, that in one gambling establishment in this city, he has
                  been robbed, in the way of loaning to gamblers, of about one hundred thousand
                  dollars, in the last year! This is all true, I assure you!'
               "'I had been looking for trouble; I had made up my mind on that morning, that it
                  was inevitable. But then, after all, I was not prepared for any thing like this.
                  If what I had just heard was indeed true, I knew how it had been brought about. My
                  husband was not a gambler; of that I was certain. I knew that he was generous, and
                  that perhaps when blinded by strong drink, he had been robbed of the means on
                  which we were dependent for subsistence.
               "'Mr. Wilson did not not return that evening, as he usually did, to tea, and after
                  waiting for several hours, I sent a servrnt out to look for him. I directed him
                  first to go to the house of a rumseller, at which I knew my husband had been in
                  the habit of spending much of his time. The servant soon returned, and I saw in a
                  moment that something was wrong, and in answer to my question, he immediately
                  informed me that he had seen Mr. Wilson in the bar-room of the house to which I
                  had sent him, bleeding profusely. I lost no time, but with my servant, immediately
                  hastened thither. The saloon, or
                  bar-room, was filled with rowdies. Finding it impossible to press my way through
                  the crowd, I entered a room on the opposite side of the hall. This was filled with
                  persons of genteel and quiet appearance; they were strangers, and were engaged in
                  conversation, and I overheard one saying, 'I think he has nearly killed him.' As
                  soon as I could find words, I said to them,
               "'Gentlemen, can you tell me if there has been a person badly injured here
                  to-night?'
               "'Yes, madam, there has,' replied a gentleman of strong, muscular appearance. This
                  was the only moment of my life that I ever felt as if summary vengeance would be
                  sweet. I asked the gentleman if he would have the kindness to ask the proprietor
                  to walk into that room. I had seated myself facing the door, and when it was
                  opened, I saw that the crowd had dispersed. In a moment the proprietor entered,
                  and I at once asked him if my husband was in his house. He turned from me
                  suddenly, as if intending to depart at once, without answering my question; and in
                  my agony I cried out, 'Stop, villain! You cannot escape in this way.' He stopped,
                  and collecting himself, said to me, with an air of superiority:
               "'What business have you in this house, madam?'
               "'I am in search of my husband,' I replied.
               "'Who is your husband?'
               "'Richard Wilson!'
               "'He is not here, and has not been here to-night.'
               "'Do you say, sir, that my husband has not been here?'
               "'I do, madam.'
               "'My husband has been here, sir, and is now in your house, either dead or
                  alive—God only knows which. I will find him, sir. It is folly for you to attempt
                  to deceive me. My servant saw him in your house this evening, with the marks of
                  violence upon his person. If you have murdered him at 1 st, I beseech you in the
                  name of mercy, let me see his body, that I may give it a decent burial.'
               "'Madam,' said he, 'if Richard Wilson is your husband, you cannot see him this
                  evening. He has retired in a state of intoxication, and does not wish to see
                  you.'
               "'How do you know, sir, that he does not wish to see me?'
               "'You can't see him, madam; and you my as well leave this house,' he replied, as
                  he turned to leave the room.
               "'Landlord,' cried a voice behind me, which I at once recognized as that of the
                  person who had called him into the room, 'if you take another step, you do it at
                  the peril of your life. Another step, and the record of your abominable crimes
                  will meet you in the judgment. Stir not, sir; attempt not to leave this room, and
                  know from one who has the power to command your craven spirit, that this lady
                     shall see her husband, and
                  instantly, too. God only knows in what situation she may find him. It may be
                  dying, or already dead.'
               "'With the true instinct of a spiritless coward, he brought volleys of oaths to
                  his assistance, declaring that Mr. Wilson should not be seen.'
               "'Then,' continued the gentleman in whose presence he was trembling, 'I understand
                  that it is your determination, sir, that this lady cannot be permitted to see her
                  husband.'
               "'You understand me right, sir,' was the surly reply.
               "'Well, sir,' said the gentleman, 'it is my determination that she shall see him,
                  at once; no matter through what, or to what, it may lead;' and then turning to the
                  company, not one of whom, during the conversation, had said a word, he said:
               "'Gentlemen, for the most part, we are strangers to each other. I am not naturally
                  quarrelsome, and yet I am not a coward. You have all seen in what a dastardly
                  manner conjugal devotion has been set at defiance, and insulted by this wretch.
                  You have seen the wife come here to find her husband. She has been refused to see
                  him, though he may be dying under this roof. Gentlemen, here is a duty for us to
                  perform; and whatever consequences may attend it, the man shall be found. Let us
                  make this case our own, and suppose that our wives or our
                     sisters were trying to gain admission to our sick or dying rooms,
                  and were thus inhumanly and brutishly tishly repulsed, would we not invoke the
                  stranger's arm, to interfere for us?'
               "'He took a lamp from the table, and advancing towards the trembling miscreant, he
                  said, 'Take this light, sir.'
               "'In an instant every one in the room was on his feet, and it was evident enough,
                  that they were prepared to act with firmness and decision.
               "'There can be but little doubt,' said the leader, 'but this den has its
                  keepers—those who will defend it, in order to hide from justice the evidence of
                  their crimes. Let us, therefore, remember that duty is calling us to this
                  encounter, and if we must fight—nay, if it be necessary to tear this infernal den
                  to pieces, we will do it!'
               "'Addressing the rumseller, he said:
               "'Now, sir, lead us instantly to the place where you have concealed this lady's
                  husband! Let nothing tempt you to lead us into an ambuscade, for in that case, you
                  will be the first to fall.'
               "'He took the lamp, and with a trembling step, he proceeded. After passing up to
                  the fifth and last story of the house, in a small room, which, from the fragments
                  which were scattered through it, plainly indicated that it was occupied by the
                  lowest class of servants. I found my husband—no light—no water—no friend near him,
                  and literally clotted in his own blood! Here the rumseller placed the lamp on an
                  old box which stood in the room, and appeared to be about leaving us.
               
               "'Stop,' said the leader, 'we are not done with you yet. Make no attempt to
                  leave.'
               "He appeared to be entirely unconscious either that myself or others were by his
                  side. I spoke to him, and asked him if he knew me. An expression of wildness
                  passed over his features, and he spoke faintly, and yet so that all in the room
                  could hear:
               "'My God! Mary, is that you? Has it come to this? They have succeeded at last. Oh!
                  for God's sake, take me from this place quickly. Do not let me die here! Take me
                  home, that I may see once more those dear children, who are ruined.'
               "'After speaking thus, he said:
               "'Where are those men?'
               "'I informed him they were gentlemen who had assisted me in finding him. He then
                  said:
               "'Well, I am lost! lost! lost!—but God bless them and their wives and children,
                  and keep their feet from learning the bitter way which I have trod.'
               "'As reason returned, he fixed his eye upon the guilty rumseller, and said:
               "'Your victim is in a dying state. There, sir, is my wife: you have robbed her of
                  every thing. My young children!—you have stolen the bread from their mouths, and
                  hope and happiness from their hearts. God reward you!'
               "'I must cover up the scenes by which this event was immediately succeeded. I
                  cannot wring my heart and bleed it afresh by a narration of the fearful history of
                  the few days which elapsed before the death of my husband, which was immediately
                  followed by the death of a lovely daughter. A few hours after we had returned from
                  the funeral, and while we were grouped together with a few friends in the parlor,
                  who were endeavoring to console our desolate hearts, we were startled by the
                  entrance of a civil officer, who informed us that all our personal property was
                  under execution and was to be sold in a short time. This was new to my children,
                  but at that moment they seemed to have been so entirely broken in spirits that the
                  intelligence of this new calamity, by which they were to be beggared, did not seem
                  to affect them. They looked at each other and at me, but not a word was spoken.
                  The officer, with whom I had no acquaintance, was still standing in the room,
                  apparently waiting an answer from me, and I said to him:
               "'I understand you, sir.'
               "'Well, madam,' said he, 'it has been enjoined upon me by those for whose benefit
                  your property has been levied upon, to take security for its safe delivery on the
                  day of sale, or to remove it at once to the quarters of an auctioneer. This,
                  madam, I cannot and will not do. I know how these afflictions have been brought
                  upon you, and I know into whose pockets the proceeds of your property will go. I
                  think it would be an act of justice and mercy to raze many of those places in this
                  city to their foundations. Heaven forbid that I should add to your sufferings. I will neither remove your goods nor
                  take security. I have no fear about them.'
               "'I assured him that nothing should be removed, and he left. The day of sale
                  arrived, and we saw article after article passing from our possession. This was
                  severe. Those cherished things wasting and scattering in our presence, was almost
                  beyond endurance; but the law allowed the rumseller to be paid for his work, and
                  we knew they must go. It was late in the evening when the sale closed, and it was
                  quite dark before the last articles were removed by the purchasers, so that it was
                  necessary for us to remain in the house during the night. This was not our
                  intention; for through the kindness of a trusty but poor old Scotchman, we had
                  procured a very small house in a retired part of the city, to which it was our
                  intention to have removed that day. This, however, we could not do, it being
                  necessary for us to wait until all was over, to know what we might carry with us.
                  To us, that was a bitter, gloomy night. Every thing but the meager allowance of
                  the law was gone, and I have often thought that those who are excusing themselves
                  by saying that they can do nothing to stay this current of ruin, would, had they
                  been present, have been awakened and enlightened and moved to action. Through that
                  long and cheerless night, while my children, overcome with grief, were sleeping
                  soundly, often did I rise to look at them and weep over them. The next morning all
                  that was left us of earthly goods was carried to our humble home, where, until
                  within a few months, we have resided. Miss Hamilton, I have told you all that I
                  can bear to tell you, and I hope you may find it of some service to you through
                  life.'
               "'Did you not say, Mrs. Wilson,' I inquired, 'that you had a son?'
               "'Yes,' replied Mrs. Wilson, 'I did.'
               "'Where is he?'
               "'That I do not know.'
               "'What was his name?'
               "'Richard.'
               "'Have you ever heard him speak of Frank Hamilton?'
               "'Oh, yes,' she replied, looking at me intently, 'very often. We were well
                  acquainted with him. He spent a vacation once with poor Dick, and I was so much
                  pleased with him and his friendship for my son, that I presented him with an
                  elegant portrait of him. Do you know Frank Hamilton?'
               "'Very well, Mrs. Wilson.'
               "'Are you a relation of his?' she quickly inquired.
               "'I am his sister, Mrs. Wilson, and your son's portrait is suspended in our
                  parlor.'
               "'Is it possible? Where is your brother?'
               "'He is in Mexico, and we are looking for him soon. Indeed, he may be now in New
                  York. The war is over, and those broken regiments are on their way back to their
                  homes!'
               
               "'Ah, yes, Miss Hamilton,' she replied, 'but there are those who will not come
                  back—those who will not return with returning regiments. No, no! the dead at
                  Monterey will never come back. My poor son must remain there. It may be, Miss
                  Hamilton, that your brother has fallen in with him, and will know something of his
                  end, and oh! what a pleasure it would bring to this desolate heart to see one who
                  saw him there, and know from that one how it was.'
               "'Is it possible, Mrs. Wilson,' I inquired, 'that your son has fallen in
                  Mexico?'
               "'I think there can be no doubt of it, although we only know it by report.'
               "'Why did he leave you?'
               "'Necessity, Miss Hamilton, compelled him to leave home to finish his studies. The
                  wreck of our fortune left him entirely dependent on his own exertions. My son went
                  to a village about one hundred miles distant from the city, to complete his
                  studies, preparatory to admission to the bar. In this new situation he sustained
                  himself for a year with great credit, entirely by his own exertion. But ah! the
                  rumseller and his friends were there, and how could he be safe? We knew the
                  danger, and we prayer for him daily, that he might be kept from temptation. His
                  letters were always cheering to us, and they became more so as he neared the time
                  of his expected admission to the bar. It was our expectation to remove in a few
                  days to the village lage of B——, where, through the persuasion of his friends, he
                  had concluded to locate himself. All our arrangements were made, and the darkness
                  which had rested upon our path was disappearing, when we received the following
                  letter from poor Dick:
               "'My Dear Mother, Brother and Sister:
               "'Farewell! Your hopes and mine are broken. My prospects yesterday were bright:
                  they are now in ruins! I would like to see you once more—you all for whom I have
                  lived, and for whom I was willing to toil. I have been beset by a cruel and
                  chilling conspiracy. I refused at the house of Judge L—— to drink wine with a
                     foolish girl. For your sakes more than my own, I was unwilling to
                  risk the peril. This morning I expected to have been admitted. My examination was
                  passed. I was refused and rejected! I love you as I ever
                  did. Good-bye! Tell little Harry that he must fly from those who have ruined his
                  father and his brother. Good-bye!'
               "'Since then we know nothing of him, only as we have heard by accident that a
                  person of his name had fallen at the battle of Monterey. We have nearly ceased to
                  hope. My husband has been taken away, and I suppose my son also. We have been
                  robbed of every thing, and we are only one of the hundreds of thousands who are
                  writhing under the bitter inffliction.'
               "There," said Kate Hamilton, pointing to Dick Wilson's portrait, and with her eye fixed on Lucy,
                  "that was cruel. You ought not to have tempted that noble young man. Ah! you can
                  not measure the consequence of that glass of wine with which you tempted him."
               "Kate," said Lucy, "I will go at once to that widow, and make atonement."
               "How will you atone? Can you give her back the son, full of vigor and hope, as
                  when you saw him first? Can you open the grave and bring him up, manly and
                  beautiful as he was on the last day you saw him in that peopled court-house? No,
                  no; yours, I fear, were but a part of those influences which drove him from home
                  and friends, and that led him to a distant clime, in which his life has been
                  sacrificed. For this you can not atone."
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               THE REFORMED RUMSELLER.
               
                  
                     
                        "Ah! who can tell how hard it is to climb
                        The steep where wine's red temple shines
                           afar;
                        Ah! who can tell how many a soul sublime
                        Has felt the influence of that malignant star,
                        And waged with virtue an eternal war."
                     
                  
               
               "I HAVE been in the business," said a reformed rumseller, "in the best, but never
                  in the worst places, and I know what it is, and to what it tends, notwithstanding
                  the eloquent pleadings of its apologists. I know what it is in the capitals of the
                  largest States in the Union, and in the capital of the nation."
               "Well, what do you think of it?" said a less than half persuaded philanthropist,
                  who found it impossible to satisfy himself that rum was not among the necessaries
                  of life.
               "I think, sir," said he, "that it is degrading to him who is engaged in it, and
                  that of all other employments, it is the most injurious to the community in which
                  it is carried on."
               "Do you think," inquired the hesitating philanthropist, "that there is any
                  possibility of doing away with it?"
               
               "Oh yes, sir; of this I have now no doubt."
               "In what way do you propose to do it?"
               "By wise legislation, sir; and this is the only way in which it can be done."
               "Well, well, sir—but hasn't our legislation been wise heretofore?"
               "I think not, sir. The true, effective course would be to give it no quarter—to
                  strike it from existence at once and forever."
               "But can this be legally done?"
               "I think so, clearly. We certainly have a right to suppress any traffic, any
                  business, the only tendency of which is to injure the community; and
                  as the selling of rum, to be drank, has this effect and no other, the right of the
                  people to protect themselves from its effects is, I think, beyond reasonable
                  question. The stale cry of illegality, unconstitutionality, &c.,
                  has lost its force, and is no longer in the way of proper legal restrictions."
               "Do you seriously think that legislators will risk the venture?—that they will be
                  willing to go for so stringent a law as you propose, and run the hazard of losing
                  the votes of all those who are opposed to the measure? If you do, you have greater
                  confidence in their uprightness and courage than I have. The law you propose
                  strikes at a business in which immense capital is now employed, both in the
                  manufacture and sale of alcoholic drinks. Hundreds of thousands depend upon it for
                  support. The great interest of agriculture furnishes the raw materials, and
                  annually draws from it a large amount of its receipts. All this you propose, at
                  once, to annihilate—a work, sir, which I think you will find easier to talk about
                  than practically to execute."
               "The time was when these objections influenced legislation, and were so
                  controlling that the laws enacted were a nullity. That time has now passed
                  Three-fourths of the electors, in a large section of the Union, are decidedly in
                  favor of the measure. They are also determined that those to whom they give their
                  suffrages shall, on this question at least, no longer misrepresent them. They know
                  their rights, and they also know their powers. They have deliberately, and yet
                  decidedly, concluded to assert the one, and to exercise the other; and mere
                  demagogues and time-servers will be driven into merited retirement, while their
                  places will be supplied by men with whom principle will be paramount to policy. A
                  few years since, in a certain State, when the school question was before the
                  Legislature, there was quite an excitement. There were men, whose constituents had
                  spelled their tickets, 'kno skool'! and every body knew how they
                  would go. It was said that they would echo the kno skool of their
                  constituency; and so they did. But one of the most intelligent and prosperous
                  districts in the State had sent to the Legislature a man who was utterly unlike
                  themselves. At length the school law was taken up, and the fidelity of their
                  representative was of course to be tested. At this time, one of his
                     constituents stituents, a very
                  intelligent friend of the school law, happened to be on a visit to the capital,
                  and his curiosity led him into the Legislature. He was just in time to hear one of
                  the most eloquent speeches of the session, and was of course delighted with it.
                  But when the vote was taken, he was much disappointed to find the representative
                  from his own district vote 'kno skool.' In answer to the question,
                  how so intelligent a district as his happened to be represented by so stupid a
                  blockhead as had just voted, he said that he was a rum representative, sent up
                  there to protect that interest; and that he should vote against popular
                  instructions, was, after all, not so surprising. He said he was comparatively
                  little known to the electors—had, by agreement with his rum supporters, pledged
                  himself to the friends of temperance, and received their votes, and was by this
                  ruse elected by a large majority. This method of deceiving the electors can not
                  now be successfully practised. The trick is understood, and is guarded
                  against."
               "But how can you guard against this. Pledges, you say, are not regarded."
               "There are men whose past lives and conduct furnish a certain guaranty that they
                  will act as they talk. It's these that we shall
                  elect."
               "Then you do not believe in political catechisms?"
               "I do not. The best assurance of fidelity, I repeat, is the recorded conduct of
                  the men, of whom we have now an ample supply in all localities; and he that, at
                  this day, is not publicly known as an uncompromising friend of temperance, should
                  not be entrusted with the responsible duties of legislation. Elect such men—and
                  that we shall, is now no longer doubtful—and the 'Maine law' follows as a matter
                  of course."
               "Why did you quit the rumselling business?"
               "For three reasons, sir. The first was on account of my family. A bar-room is a
                  bad place in which to educate a child, exposed, as it is, not only to the
                  temptations of rum, and the filthy and loathsome conversations which rum produces,
                  but the worst of all possible examples. In the second place, on my own account. I
                  felt its demoralizing effect upon me, even while engaged in it, and so does every
                  one similarly situated. I knew almost certainly that if my life were spared, I
                  should be doomed to reap the consequences of rumselling—little respected by the
                  good, and uncared for by any. In the third place, on account of the evil
                  consequences which I saw resulting to others. I could never believe, hard as I
                  tried, that money was to be gained, no matter by what means; yet it does seem to
                  me that this is the only maxim on which the rumseller can, at this day, justify
                  himself. I once saw, in my own house, such a fearful exhibition of the evils of
                  rumselling, that I quit it at once and forever. From my own bar was the rum given
                  which sent a generous-souled young man onward in the path of degradation and
                  misery."
               
               "Did you do this yourself, sir?"
               "No, sir; but I saw it immediately after it was done, and I never think of it
                  without shuddering. About nine o'clock one evening, while keeping a public house
                  in the village of B——, a young man, with whom I was well acquainted, entered my
                  bar-room and seated himself quietly. Usually he was cheerful; but now he spoke to
                  no one. In a short time a negro man came in with his trunk, and as it was placed
                  on the floor, he said:
               "'Ah, companion of my misfortune, we must go again, and we can not hope to keep
                  together long. The severities of life will separate us.'
               "I knew that his hopes were in ruins, and I vainly endeavored to assist him in
                  regathering them.
               "'That, Mr. Jacobs, is impossible,' said he: 'it would be as easy to gather the
                  chaff which has been driven off by the madness of the whirlwind. My hopes are
                  gone.'
               "I tried to ascertain what destination he had in view; but this was impossible: he
                  did not seem to know. He took from his trunk a package of letters, then closing
                  it, seated himself on the top of it. His feelings were intense, as he glanced over
                  the letters in a hurried manner; and then, putting them together again, he
                  ejaculated:
               "'My mother! my mother! your cup of misery is full!'
               "I left the room for a moment, and on returning, to my surprise, I saw him
                  standing at the bar, with a decanter in his hand. I would have prevented it, but
                  at that moment Judge L—— and half a dozen of young men entered the bar-room. These
                  were the persons who had prepared him for the rumseller—the persons who had driven
                  him there, and for a moment they quailed before him. The Judge immediately
                  approached the bar, and said, with a hypocritical smile:
               "'Come, come, Mr. Wilson, don't take this matter too much to heart: it will all be
                  right in a short time. I am glad to see you at the bar. I have more hope for you
                  now than I ever had. We will drink together and be social. It's the life of the
                  law to be social. Let us drink and make merry!'
               "This young man took off his hat and held it in his hand, and his whole appearance
                  indicated his utter despair. Judge L—— handed him a glass, saying:
               "'Now, Mr. Wilson, give us a sentiment, and matters will all be right.'
               "For an instant he looked into the faces of those who were determined to crown his
                  ruin, and then looking into the glass, as if to measure its wasting curses, with a
                  look of phrensy, he drank! Oh, bitter draught! I had known his early fondness for
                  drink and the great struggle which he had had to resist the importunities of a
                  pernicious appetite. Yet I had supposed him secure in his own firm purpose to
                  resist. But when I saw him yield, I knew that all was lost! Henceforward, I
                  feared, he would be a passive victim in the tempter's snare, for such is the usual, the almost invariable
                  result. I felt that if there had been no rumseller to have taken or given the
                  advantage to others, at that moment, that young man would have been comparatively
                  safe. He would have recovered from his disappointment; the storm would have swept
                  by, and his sun would have shone brightly again. But as it was, that sun rose no
                  more. Rum perpetually eclipsed it!"
               "Did you ever learn what became of this young man?"
               "Yes, sir; after wandering about from place to place for some time, he enlisted in
                  the service for Mexico, and it has been reported that he was killed at the battle
                  of Monterey. This, I think, was not true, as I have been creditably informed that
                  he has since been seen in the United States."
               "Did you hear any thing about his situation?"
               "Yes, sir, and it was bad enough. He was a complete wreck."
               "And this example, Mr. Jacobs, led you to quit the business?"
               "It did, sir, and every honorable man who has any respect for himself, for his
                  family, and the peace of the community, will, I hope, do the same thing soon; and
                  those who have no honor to move them, who care nothing for themselves, their
                  families, or for the peace of the community, ought to be forced to
                  give it up at once. Now, sir, this is what must be done by legislation. Heretofore
                  the people have been unconsciously strengthening the hands of the rumseller. From
                  them has he obtained his power to mock the pleas of the drunkard's wife and child.
                  I think, sir, if you will examine this matter carefully, that you will agree with
                  me, that strong legislation only can correct it."
               "Indeed, Mr. Jacobs, I think you are about right, and if legislation is the only
                  thing that can correct it, we had better have it at once."
               "Well, this is what we intend to have; but we shall meet opposition
                  the most strenuous and untiring. While the friends of the measure are prompted to
                  effort by a regard to the public welfare, its enemies are stimulated by the
                  considerations of self-interest. The former can employ only the arguments of
                  truth, and can appeal only to the intelligence and virtue of those whom they hope
                  to move. The latter will, no doubt, as they have heretofore done, employ the most
                  unscrupulous of means. Gold, their only idol, will be freely employed in the
                  preliminary canvass, at the ballot-box and in the halls of legislation. But it
                  will not now prevail. Men, 'above all price,' will occupy the seats too long held
                  by the mere sycophant; and when the question comes up, 'Shall the Maine law pass?'
                  men with strong nerves and stout hearts will be ready, with a firm and cheering
                  'aye,' which shall dissipate all doubts, and gladden alike the heart of the
                  philanthropist and the Christian."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXI.
               FLYING FROM TEMPTATION.
               
                  
                     
                        "Fly from the tempter—
                        From the brow of the brave
                        She has torn the gay wreath,
                        And made him a slave;
                        E'en the pride of the statesman,
                        The fame of the just,
                        The wine cup has humbled,
                        And trod in the dust."
                     
                  
               
               THE conclusion of peace, after the surrender of the city of Mexico, was the signal
                  to the American volunteer, that his work was done, and that again he might turn
                  his battle-soiled face towards home. Many anxious hearts were waiting impatiently
                  for the return of those regiments, whose ranks had been thined by disease and the
                  Mexican spear. Some were waiting for the return of the living, and others to hear
                  the fate of those who would probably return no more. It was soon understood that
                  the shattered remains of the 11th regiment of infantry were expected that day to
                  land in the city. This was believed to be reliable intelligence, and, in
                  consequence, joyful was the countenances of those who expected to meet their
                  friends, while others were agitated by the mingled emotions of hope and fear. At
                  last, and while crowds were thronging the landing, the noble vessel, bearing in
                  her bosom the broken ranks of those who had periled their lives in a foreign
                  clime, drew near; and then were heard the questions—Where is my husband?—my
                  brother?—my father?—my son?—and many were answered, in the grave! Mr.
                  Hamilton and Kate were there; but not in the crowd. From their position they were
                  able to see the soldiers as they left the vessel.
               "Father," said Kate, "there are but a few more to come off—I am sure Frank is not
                  there," and as the last of those veterans left the vessel, she added, with painful
                  emotion—"No, Frank is not there," to which Mr. Hamilton replied, "No, my child, he
                  is not."
               Leaving the carriage in charge of the servant, he at once advanced to where the
                  regiment was forming, and meeting a young man, whom he at once knew, he eagerly
                  inquired after his son. He was informed that he had been transferred to another
                  regiment, and that he had already, or would in a few days, land at Pittsburgh,
                  with the remains of the first and second Pennsylvania regiments. He immediately
                  returned and said to Kate—
               "Thank God, the boy is safe, and will be home in a few days."
               "Yes," said Kate, fervently, "thank God—but, father, poor Mrs. Wilson's son
                     comes not back! He has fallen a victim to the snare of the
                     rumseller—to that fell temptation,
                  which, by legal sanction, fills the land, and by which so many are ruined."
               "But, my dear child, this temptation will not, I am confident, much longer exist.
                  The signs of the times encourage me to hope that the hour of deliverance is near
                  at hand; and I have no doubt that twenty years hence the business of rumselling
                  will be regarded with as much abhorrence as we now regard the foreign slave trade.
                  Yes, my daughter, the day is coming—and I thank God for it—when all, in every path
                  of life, will forsake this business, and frown upon it with indignation; and when
                  it is left to the protection of the manufacturer, the
                     vender and the drinker, it cannot sustain itself for
                  an hour."
               In a few days Frank Hamilton returned, and at his home all was joy and gladness.
                  The father, and mother, and brother, and sister, with sweet cordiality, gave
                  themselves up to the pleasurable emotions which filled their hearts. They were
                  anxious, of course, to hear from the youthful soldier, the history of the scenes
                  through which he had passed—from the beach at Corpus Christi to the halls of the
                  Montezumas; and he appeared as anxious to gratify them.
               Frank was sitting opposite the fine portrait of Dick Wilson, which Kate had
                  removed from the parlor into the family sitting room. As his eye fell upon it, an
                  involuntary sigh escaped from him, and the quick ear of Kate heard it; and it
                  assured her that he knew something of the history of him whom it represented.
                  Frank proceeded to tell them the most startling of those incidents which are
                  inseparable from war, and of which he was a witness. When he had finished, the
                  evening was far spent, and Kate inquired if he had heard any thing of Dick
                  Wilson.
               "Why," replied Frank, "what has put that into your head?"
               She then told him what she knew and had seen of the family, and he replied—
               "Kate, I am glad you know where they are—I know all about poor Dick."
               "Well, Frank, do tell us something about his death."
               "His death?" replied Frank. "He is not dead!"
               "Oh, yes, he is, Frank; his mother said that he was."
               "Then, Kate, he has died within a month, for I saw him embarking for the
                  States."
               "His mother, Frank, heard that he was dead!"
               "It is a mistake. I suppose he landed here a few days since with the 11th regiment
                  of infantry, and it is probable that he is yet in the city, as I requested him
                  particularly, to wait until I should arrive. I gave him the street, and number of
                  our residence, and requested him to call—though I did not expect that he would do
                  it."
               "Is this possible, Frank?"
               "It is certain, Kate, and I have no doubt but in a few days you will have the
                  pleasure of seeing him in this house.
                  Col. C——, from Virginia, became very much attached to him; and I understand the
                  Colonel is lying sick at the Irving House, and the probability is, that Dick is
                  still with him, as I do not think that, under any circumstances, he would leave
                  him in that situation."
               "Then," replied Kate, "you have heard of his misfortunes?"
               "Oh, yes, my sister, I know all about them—we have been much together, and I know
                  them from his own lips. I hope, Kate, he may yet be saved; for with the single
                  exception of excessive drinking, he is as noble as he ever was. When in Mexico,
                  surrounded by the influence of a partial civilization, he was but slightly
                  tempted; but how he may withstand the strong allurements of a Christian land—his
                  native country—I cannot say! Kate, it is a humiliating acknowledgment, that one
                  who has formed a relish for intoxicating drinks, is less tempted to indulge it
                  among the rude and half barbarous Mexicans, than among the enlightened citizens of
                  this Christian land."
               "When did you fall in with him?" inquired Kate.
               "As soon as I landed at Corpus Christi, I entered the commissary office, to look
                  about me, and see if I could ascertain the nature and character of war. I felt
                  somewhat home-sick; the novelty was worn off. I had seen enough to convince me
                  that this was no pleasure trip, if government did pay the expenses penses. It was
                  the first time that a foreign sun had ever thrown its light on my path. As I
                  entered this office, I found a good many persons, whose countenances indicated as
                  much anxiety as mine. They were seated in every kind of order—on drums, boxes of
                  muskets, cavalry swords, provisions, &c. As soon as I seated myself, my whole
                  attention was arrested by a single countenance, and I became more interested, from
                  the fact that he would always turn from my gaze. I was seated on a pile of cavalry
                  swords, directly opposite to him, and for the purpose of better satisfying myself,
                  and giving it at the same time the appearance of indifference, I took up one of
                  those swords, and twisted and turned it, until an observer would have thought that
                  I could tell all about the instrument, when I was hardly conscious that I had it
                  in my hand. The grey roundabout and pants make a great difference in one's
                  appearance; and yet, I was certain that in that care worn face there was left an
                  expression still, of one whom before that I had seen and known.
               "A lieutenant soon entered, and this young man rose to answer his call. I watched
                  him closely, as his pen glided over the paper in preparing the order, and then
                  heard the lieutenant say, 'Dick, you would make a fine lawyer,' to which he merely
                  replied, 'Do you think so?' After this he turned his face to the window, and so
                  remained for a few moments, and when he again turned to the desk, I saw the
                  evidence of tears, which he vainly attempted to conceal. A very little thing, Kate, will waken up
                  in the heart the most tender recollections, and I knew that something had touched
                  a deep chord in that young man's heart, by which, perhaps, the cheerless memories
                  of disappointments were revived afresh; but until that moment, it did not occur to
                  me that it might be Dick Wilson. I immediately left the office—for I found that it
                  would be impossible for me to satisfy myself without addressing him. As I was
                  leaving, and had got some distance from the office, I turned and looked back, and
                  as I did so I saw him standing at the door, with his arms folded across his
                  breast, and I concluded at once that he had come there to look after me. There was
                  something very imposing in his appearance, and what I could not determine, while
                  sitting face to face with him, was now clear enough to my mind, and I was sure
                  that that was Dick Wilson. In the early part of the evening, I was dispatched to
                  the commissary office, with an order for blankets. This was the very opportunity
                  for which I was seeking, and I went to the office at once, and produced my order.
                  He immediately wrote another order, and handed it to me, saying—
               "'This, Mr. Hamilton, will procure them for you.'
               "I was startled by that voice, and the familiarity with which my name was called,
                  and I said at once, 'Is this Dick Wilson.'
               "'Yes, Frank,' he replied, 'this is all that misfortune fortune and the rumseller
                  has left. I have had a hard time, Frank, since we parted.'
               "'But, Dick, what brought you here?'
               "'The same, Frank, that will drive many another poor fellow here, and which will
                  make him anxious to give away his life, has brought me here—I mean the
                  RUMSELLER—the licensed pest of civilization!'
               "He asked me if I could spend the evening with him; to which I readily assented.
                  After making the necessary arrangements for the comfort of those in my charge, I
                  returned to the office, and at his request, we directed our steps towards a
                  retired place on the bank of the river. Yes, Kate, there I was, on the banks of
                  the Rio Grande, arm in arm with as noble a heart as ever beat, and as we had often
                  been in earlier days. How differently situated! Then his hopes were promising and
                  his heart light. Now he was oppressed with sadness.
               "'Here, Frank,' said he, 'is a spot to which I have been in the habit of resorting
                  almost nightly; and there is something in its very loneliness which endears it to
                  me.'
               "We seated ourselves, and after a pause in which I saw that he was making an
                  effort to control his feelings, he said—
               "'Frank, you did not expect to meet me here, as I am.'
               "'Dick,' said I, 'what has led you to this step?'
               "'Ah! Frank, I cannot lead you through the terrific process by which I have been
                  moulded into what you see before you.
                  You see how much I am changed, and while I cannot now help it, I am far from being
                  insensible to the fearful fact.'
               "He related to me the severe misfortunes of his family, as well as his
                  difficulties with Judge L——, and his departure from the village of B——, and then
                  continued—
               "'But, oh! Frank, I did not intend to fall. I was disappointed—broken down—cast to
                  the very earth. I knew the strength of those hopes which were clinging to me; but
                  in that hour, when, to me, my path seemed to be hopelessly dark, and the sun of my
                  life seemed to have gone down to rise no more, I availed myself of the rumseller's
                     consolation! Ah! yes, it was then, in an hour of mental
                  unconsciousness, that I fell—I am afraid, hopelessly and
                     forever! And, O God! in that delirious moment, what did I entail
                  upon myself and weeping, heart-broken innocence, in the persons of those who were
                  spared in the wreck of my home? Ah! yes, I am sure that if this temptation had not
                  been in my path, that I could have survived the shock of that disappointment; but
                  it was in my path, and I fell, as thousands have fallen. From the moment I tasted
                  the poisoned chalice, I felt the beginning of certain ruin. Sometimes I had hope,
                  but it was dim and indistinct. I knew not where to turn or whither to fly, and I
                  bade farewell to those whom, every moment since, I have loved better than I do my
                  life. Since that, I have been a wanderer, without out any object; and I could but
                  poorly represent to you the scenes and the sufferings through which I have passed.
                  Often as I have seen the slave dragging out his weary life, have I wished that I
                  had been born a slave! I have wished that the power of thought could be silenced
                  within me, and that I might forget myself in the grave. After wandering about from
                  place to place, and finding my health rapidly declining, it occurred to me that if
                  I should leave the United States, I might, after all, recover. It was not without
                  an effort that I expatriated myself. It was not because I did not love my native
                  land, but because I felt that the rumseller had the power to mould my
                  destiny as he pleased, and lead me through the broad streets of my native land to
                  the base of his sacrificial altar! Oh! Frank, to talk about slavery! The
                  subjugation of the body is absolute tyranny; but it cannot compare with the
                  absolute and cruel subjugation to which the rumseller reduces his victims. It
                  stings sharper, deeper, than the driver's whip; for it strikes both the body and
                  the mind, and with maddened fury drives them together into the cheerless vortex of
                  desolation! I sometimes hope, Frank, to withstand, in this half civilized region,
                  the few temptations which beset me; but at home they were so constant and so
                  strong, I could not resist them. This is all that brought me here; but if I must
                  die by his hand, I would rather it would be at home. I came here only to avoid a
                  power sanctioned by American law,
                   and which is the most despotic of any
                  on earth. Five weeks ago I was standing on the wharf at New Orleans, looking with
                  anxiety at a vessel which was preparing to leave for this place. I was without
                  money and without friends, surrounded by strangers, and sixteen hundred miles from
                  the place of my nativity. I knew not what to do; for in the streets of that city I
                  had seen hundreds whose appearance showed them to be forlorn and friendless as
                  myself, and most of whom, by their countenances, indicated that they were familiar
                  with crime. At that moment I was trying to solve a fearful problem. I was deciding
                  between two evils, which, to me, appeared of equal magnitude: whether to live and
                  permit the rumseller to exercise his authority over me, or to commit suicide.'
               "'Why, Dick,' said I, 'surely you did not think of that!'
               "'Yes, I did, Frank. You may think it strange, but I tell you, the
                     rumseller can make one think and do almost any thing. I found
                  myself, before I was aware of it, at the door of the custom house, and still
                  undetermined as to which would be the best for me. I was standing here, when a
                  gentleman came to my side, who, for some moments, eyed me intensely. To me, his
                  gaze was exceedingly painful. I did not know but he might be a civil officer, who
                  was in search of suspected persons, and perhaps was about to fix upon me, as one
                  having the appearance of a criminal. I knew that I had the rumseller's
                     mark upon me; and among strangers, I was aware that this mark was
                  fatal. They generally think—but they misjudge when they do so—that the victim is
                  as accomplished in wickedness as the destroyer. Even in my forlorn situation, I
                  could not endure such a suspicion. I had slept in the open air, on the banks of
                  the Ohio and the Mississippi. I had gone for days without food, and this I had
                  endured but to be suspected of crime. I could not endure it; and I immediately
                  inquired,
               "'Do you see anything about me, sir, to call for such close observation?'
               "'If I am not mistaken,' he replied, 'your name is Wilson.'
               "'That is my name, sir,' I answered, 'but where have you seen me?'
               "'I saw you,' he replied, 'on the evening of the day on which your hopes were
                  crushed. I never saw you before, nor since, until this moment; but I should have
                  known you in any place, or under any circumstances. I see, Mr. Wilson, what your
                  misfortunes are, and any thing that I can do to alleviate them, will be done
                  cheerfully. What do you want to do?'
               "'I want,' I replied, 'first of all, to escape the temptations of the rumseller;
                  for, until I can do this, it is in vain for me to attempt to do any thing.'
               "'I am sorry,' he replied, 'to see you under such influences.'
               
               "'I told him that I believed that it was utterly impossible to escape them, and
                  that I thought it would be my best plan to go to Mexico—that possibly I might be
                  safer there.'
               "'Then,' said he, 'as your constitution is evidently too feeble to go into the
                  army, I think I can procure you a situation in the commissary office, at Corpus
                  Christi.' After some conversation with a gentleman named Nicholson, the business
                  was immediately arranged, and a passage secured for me, on board of the vessel to
                  which I had referred. Since that time, I have been here; and while under other
                  circumstances it would afford me pleasure to see acquaintances, as it is, I have
                  tried to avoid it.
               "'I knew you, Frank, as soon as you entered the office, and I saw, in a moment,
                  that there was still something about me that you recognized; but I did not think
                  you would be able to identify me, until that young lieutenant called me Dick. Ah!
                  Frank, you cannot tell what burning recollections your appearance wakened up
                  within me, and yet, if you had not recognized me, I think that you would never
                  have been conscious that, in a land of strangers, you had been in the same room
                  with your fallen friend!'
               
               "After we had conversed for some time about many things, I asked him if he had
                  given up all hope of recovering himself, to which he replied—
               "'Oh, no! Frank, I hope not; I think if I can endure this climate for three years,
                  that I may then return to the United States with safety, and if it were not for
                  the rumseller, I should return to-morrow.'
               "I found Dick kind, gentlemanly, and warmhearted as ever. It was necessary for me,
                  in a few days after this interview, to proceed to Fort Brown, and we parted again,
                  after I had obtained a promise from him to write to me often.
               "About a month after this time, I received a letter from him, dated 'Charity
                     Hospital, New Orleans,' in which he informed me of his situation. He
                  said that finding himself unable to endure the climate, and feeling assured that
                  he must die, he was anxious, if possible, to reach his mother, and die in her
                  arms; but that on landing, it was necessary for him to be taken to the hospital,
                  where he expected to die. He concluded by saying, 'Frank, if you live to return
                  home, I have a dying request—search out my poor mother, and tell her all you know
                  of of me.'
               "I think it was about six weeks after the date of his letter, that I was sent to
                  Corpus Christi, on business; and just as I was about to leave, a gentleman said to
                  me, 'You can tell 'Rough and Ready' that there is a regiment of
                  volunteers from Louisiana, under command of Gen. Gaines, expected to land here
                  to-day.'
               "My return was not urgent, and I determined to wait and see them; and sure enough,
                  in a few hours the vessels came in sight, and soon were near enough to distinguish the gray uniforms with which
                  the decks seemed to be crowded. Here, to my surprise, I met Dick Wilson again. He
                  was feeble, and hardly able to bear the weight of his musket. His spirits were
                  low, and conversational powers, which were of the first order, seemed to have left
                  him almost entirely. I did every thing in my power, during that day and the next,
                  to rouse him, but I found it impossible to do so. We parted again, hoping soon to
                  be brought together by the concentration of all the troops in Mexico, into one
                  army. This, however, did not occur; and I soon learned that some illegality in the
                  formation of the regiment, under Gen. Gaines, had caused it to be disbanded, and
                  that many of the men who composed it, had returned to New Orleans.
               "Here, again, I lost all traces of Dick, and although I inquired often of those
                  who were continually coming into the service, I could find no one who knew any
                  thing of him. I could not forget him; and while I sympathized with him, and wept
                  over his condition, I felt that his fall was inevitable. I knew the rumseller's
                  power over his victim, when once he had succeeded in making a beginning; but,
                  Kate, until I met poor Dick Wilson, I never fully realized his complete despotism!
                  Here I had an opportunity to see it. I knew Dick before the rumseller had touched
                  his constitution, his character, or his hopes. We had read Horace
                  together—together we had admired the beauties of Longinus, and wept over the death
                  scene of Socrates. In all the pleasures and duties of a student's life, we had
                  been together, and but a few years—short and changeful—had passed away, since on
                  the same platform we had received the parting benediction of the venerable
                  president. Then he was every thing that was noble; now he appeared to be hanging
                  indifferently from the frowning precipice which overlooks the chasm of
                  despair!
               "When I met him first, at Corpus Christi, I had hope; but when I met him in the
                  Louisiana regiment, I saw the unmistakable impressions of the rumseller's work,
                  fostering a disease which was preying deeper than the disease upon his
                  constitution. I had given him up, and expected to see his face no more."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXII.
               THE LOST FOUND.
               
                  
                     
                        "Fly from the tempter,
                        Who has led thee astray
                        From the high aspirations
                        Of life's early day:
                        Ere the hopes of thy mother
                        Have faded in gloom,
                        And her gray hairs, dishonored,
                        Are laid in the tomb."
                     
                  
               
               FRANK had related the circumstances under which, for the third time, he had met
                  with Dick Wilson in Mexico, as well as the hopes which he still entertained for
                  his safety.
               "Do you really think," said the good Mrs. Hamilton, who was impatient with
                  interest, "that he has landed here?"
               "Oh, I am sure of it," said Frank. "I saw him embark for New York. I'll show you
                  in the morning—mind if I don't, mother."
               "God be praised!" said the tender-hearted old lady. "We may be able to restore him
                  to his heart-broken mother yet, and this will be like giving life to the dead. My
                  son, if you find him in the morning, you must bring him home with you. Have his
                  trunk brought directly here."
               "His trunk!" replied Frank. "You mean his knapsack. Our backs were our baggage
                  wagons, in Mexico."
               "Well, Frank, bring all he has, be it much or little, and we will induce him to
                  remain with us as long as possible, and we will try every way to strengthen his
                  good resolution."
               The hour was late, and Frank found it impossible to answer satisfactorily half the
                  inquiries of Kate, and in a pleasant way he said to her:
               "I would advise you to exercise your usual caution, and not to fall in love with
                  Dick before you see him. You may be wonderfully disappointed. And pointing to the
                  portrait, he said: "You must not base your judgment on that, for he is greatly
                  changed."
               In the morning, Mrs. Hamilton, Kate and Frank were all in a hurry; and even Mr.
                  Hamilton, who was remarkable for regularity, betrayed some slight wandering from
                  his usual course. When the time for family prayer arrived, Mr. Hamilton offered up
                  a fervent petition in Dick's behalf, and prayed that the same God who had restored
                  the long lost Joseph to his father, would also restore this young man to his
                  widowed mother.
               "Now," said Mrs. Hamilton to Frank, as they were seated at the breakfast table,
                  "do you think you can find him this morning?"
               
               "I think I can, mother, if he is in the city. He may have gone to Virginia with
                  Col. C——; but I do not think that he has yet been able to leave. I am glad,
                  mother, that you are so much interested in him, for it too often falls to the lot
                  of those who are unfortunate, that they meet only indifference and
                  inattention."
               "I am interested, my son, to save, if it be possible, that young man. The mother,
                  the brother, and the sister, who are now weeping for him, did not willingly
                  surrender him to the rumseller. If we can now restore him safe to his dear ones,
                  it will be doing a work for God and humanity. That is what we live for, and no
                  nobler end can we hope to attain."
               After breakfast, Frank was soon in the street, making his way towards the Irving
                  House, where, he had heard, Col. C—— had taken rooms, and where he expected to
                  find Dick, if he was still in the city.
               "Who knows," said Frank to himself, "what may be the result of all this? I thank
                  my parents that they loved me and watched for me more than for the vanities of
                  life. What I am I owe chiefly to their judicious care. In three years I have met
                  Dick Wilson in almost all imaginable situations of suffering, and far from home.
                  We have sat down together to talk about the past, and then he spoke with a
                  mournful eloquence of its melancholy recollections. I have heard him say, while
                  sitting under the shade of the same ancient elms where Cortez tez is said to have
                  offered his human sacrifices, that the rumseller had so transformed him, that he
                  felt more at home on the soil which had drunk the blood of thousands of
                  semi-barbarians, at the hand of the Spanish robber, than he did in his native
                  land."
               With such thoughts as these revolving in his mind, Frank Hamilton entered the
                  Irving House, and going at once to the register, found the names of Col. C—— and
                  Dick Wilson registered together. This was a matter of rejoicing to him, and he
                  hastened at once to their room. As he entered, Dick rose at once to greet him, and
                  Col. C—— could not help admiring the pure friendship which these young men
                  manifested for each other. Frank had formed a slight acquaintance with Col. C—— in
                  Mexico, and consequently did not need an introduction. When Frank entered the
                  room, the colonel and Dick were engaged in conversation, which had been laid aside
                  merely for the time, and the greeting over, Col. C—— continued:
               "Mr. Hamilton, I have just been making a proposition to Mr. Wilson, to accompany
                  me to Virginia, and there enter upon the practice of law. I have offered to him,
                  if he will consent to do so, every facility, both in money and influence, which
                  may be necessary for his success; and here I must say to you, Mr. Hamilton, that
                  if the beauty of our lovely country is marred by the existence of slavery, it is
                  not, like yours, blackened by the foul curse of rumselling, which does more to
                  blight and blacken, to waste and
                  wither, to degrade and stultify, than slavery in its most revolting form."
               "Frank," said Dick, "I have almost made up my mind to go and try my fortune in the
                  'Old Dominion.' What do you think of it?"
               "Do you think, Dick," said Frank, "that you will be better off there?"
               "No, Frank; but I think I should not be tempted there as I am here, and wherever I
                  can be the freeest from that, there I would like to go." After a moment's pause,
                  he continued, with much feeling: "I may as well go there as anywhere. There are
                  for me some precious spots upon the earth. There are graves I should like to
                  visit; and there are living ones, the sight of whom, if it were only once more,
                  would gladden my heart; but where they are I do not know."
               "Dick," replied Frank, with much feeling, "death has not disturbed the little
                  flock. They are all living and well."
               "Have you seen them? Do you know where they are? Who has seen them? Tell me,
                  Frank, for heaven's sake," said he, while intense agitation was visible in his
                  countenance.
               "My sister, Dick, has seen them within a few weeks, and they were well."
               "Is it possible? Well, thank God, I may then see them again. This is more than I
                  expected. Frank, you have always been to me the harbinger of good."
               For a moment he was silent, but the tears which had bounded from their source at
                  this unexpected intelligence, refused to disobey the dictates of his heart, and
                  they held on their way. At length he continued:
               "Col. C——, I had almost concluded to go with you to Virginia, but I must give it
                  up. I must go at once to those dear ones, who are looking for me. They know, in
                  all probability, that I went to Mexico, and as the living are all returning, they
                  will be looking for me too. Oh, yes! I can almost see the wild anticipations of
                  their hearts, and feel the clasp of their arms about my neck. I am happy in the
                  thought, that yet the warm breath of my mother may dissipate the fevered phantoms
                  of my brain. Ah! but when they see me they will weep, and those are fearful tears
                  which a mother pours out when compelled to look upon the victim of a rumseller in
                  the person of her son."
               "Dick," said Frank, "your mother is not looking for you."
               "Ah! and has she cast me off? If she knew the sufferings through which I have
                  passed, she would not cast me off."
               "She has not cast you off," said Frank, "but she has heard, and she believes, that
                  you were killed at the battle of Monterey."
               "Then, Frank, I must uudeceive her at once. Col. C——, you have been my friend. You
                  have watched over me as a brother since the day I entered your command, in the
                  city of Wheeling, until this day, and if it were not for the intelligence which Mr. Hamilton has brought me, I should
                  go with you; but as it is, I can not."
               "Mr. Wilson," said Col. C——, "I am glad to see you manifest such feeling. It
                  increases my friendship for you and my interest in you. It is best for you,
                  however, to look at this matter free from all excitement; for you are now placed
                  in a position in which you ought to act with remarkable caution. When you go home
                  and have seen those who are still dear to you, what will you do? They are poor,
                  and you are poor, and when the burst of joy and sorrow, which will attend your
                  meeting, is over, will it not be succeeded by the cheerless vision of poverty
                  rising before you, to chill you into despair again, and drive you to the
                  rumseller's den? If you will go with me, I will provide you a home for your
                  family, and the means to bring them to Virginia; and there, surrounded by new
                  associations, and men who would not strive with each other to excel in making the
                  child a drunkard, you will be comparatively safe."
               "You are too kind, my friend," replied Dick, with evident emotion.
               "Never mind that, Wilson," replied Col. C——, "for kindness, if it is genuine,
                  always brings its reward. I will do it cheerfully, as for a brother."
               "Then, Col. C——," replied Dick, "I will go. I would go to the ends of the earth to
                  escape the ruin which I constantly fear."
               Frank could not help admiring that noble Virginian, who, although a soldier, had
                  still a heart filled with rich and generous sympathy, prompting him to offers of
                  kindness, which would have been as readily fulfilled as they were cheerfully made.
                  Frank felt that he had a claim, and that it would be necessary for him to
                  institute it at once, and accordingly, in the presence of Col. C——, he informed
                  Dick that he expected him to spend a few days with him before leaving the city,
                  giving him to understand that it was the particular request of the family that he
                  should do so. It was known to Frank that Col. C—— was about to repair to
                  Washington city in a few days, and it was soon agreed that Dick could spend a few
                  weeks in New York previous to leaving for Virginia. These arrangements being made,
                  Dick stepped into another room to make preparations for accompanying Frank to his
                  home, and while he was absent the colonel said to Frank:
               "Mr. Hamilton, I feel very much interested in that young man, and I would be
                  willing to do any thing within the range of possibility to save him. If he can be
                  saved, there is no honorable situation in life which he would not grace, and no
                  position which he would not adorn."
               At this moment Dick entered the room, elegantly dressed, and Frank involuntarily
                  exclaimed:
               "Why, I declare, Dick, you look natural now, and you bring 'old times' vividly to
                  my mind."
               As soon as they were fairly in the street, Dick said:
               
               "Is it possible, Frank, that your sister has seen my family? And what must she
                  think of me?"
               "Yes, Dick," said he, "my sister has seen your family. She has mingled her tears
                  with those who love you; but she understands where the blame lies: indeed every
                  person of common sense must understand it. You need have no fears, Dick, in
                  entering my father's house, for they will not only receive you kindly, but they
                  will do every thing in their power to make you happy."
               The conversation continued about one thing and another, and before Frank himself
                  was aware of it, his home stood before him. They entered, and Dick was immediately
                  seated in the parlor. Frank left, and made his way, without any apparent
                  excitement, to the room where his mother and Kate were seated. As soon as Mrs.
                  Hamilton saw her son, and perceived that there was no unusual expression of joy in
                  his countenance, she said:
               "Ah! my son, it is as I expected: either death or the rumseller has been before
                  you. You didn't find him. Well, I was fearful that it would turn out in this
                  way."
               "Well, mother," said Frank, "you are not often mistaken, I confess; but you are
                  this time. I have got ahead of both death and the rumseller. I know it's a hard
                  thing to do; but then, I did it, and Dick Wilson is in the parlor."
               "Is it possible?" said Mrs. Hamilton and her daughter, in the same breath.
               "Come and see," said Frank.
               They entered the parlor, and Dick rose to meet them. His appearance was much
                  better than they had anticipated, for they expected to have seen more distinctly
                  the ravages of dissipation.
               "We are glad to see you, Mr. Wilson," said Mrs. Hamilton, "and we are happy to
                  make you welcome at our house. There," said she, pointing to Dick's portrait,
                  which Kate on that morning had replaced in the parlor, "for several years you have
                  ornamented our parlor, and we hope now that you will feel yourself surrounded by
                  the freedom of home."
               "Thank you, Mrs. Hamilton," said Dick, and then added, as he looked at his
                  portrait, and remembered the scenes through which he had passed, "That is a
                  reminiscence of my better days."
               Soon Mr. Hamilton came in, and walking directly up to Dick, without an
                  introduction, gave him a shake of the hand, which told the cordiality with which
                  he met him more eloquently than his lips could have done, and then said:
               "It seems to me, Mr. Wilson, that I have seen your face before."
               "Yes, sir, you have," said Dick; "when the troops of the 11th regiment were
                  landing a few days since, you inquired of me concerning your son."
               "Upon my word," replied Mr. Hamilton, "it is so. You ought to have made yourself
                  known, and come directly to my house."
               "I had not permission to leave until the regiment was disbanded, and, besides, the indisposition of
                  Col. C——, who has been a very warm friend of mine, made it necessary that I should
                  remain with him."
               "Yes, yes, Mr. Wilson, always be grateful, and never forsake a friend in the time
                  of his need. I would have been very glad to have had the colonel here. Do you
                  suppose he would be able to come and spend the evening with us?"
               "I think he would be able and happy to do so," replied Dick.
               "Then," said the old gentleman, with his unpretending suavity of manner, "we must
                  have him here."
               Orders were immediately issued to have the carriage in readiness. It required no
                  lengthy argument to persuade the colonel to accompany them, and he was soon in the
                  carriage with them. He was manifestly in feeble health; but yet, according to the
                  true Virginian style, he did his part to make every thing pleasant, and when he
                  entered Mr. Hamilton's house, he seemed at once to be at home. The evening was
                  spent in hearing and rehearsing the life like pictures of the scenes in which
                  these young men had mingled, and the conflicts through which they had passed, with
                  a continuous application from Mr. Hamilton, of the goodness of God, in saving
                  their lives, and bringing them back to their native land.
               After tea, Kate favored them with some excellent music, and to those young men it
                  seemed to be doubly sweet, since for several years they had heard no music but the
                  shrill music of the march, or the startling clangor of the battle field, as it
                  rose toward heaven, the harbinger of blood. At the request of Dick, she played,
                  with remarkable effect, 'The Dead at Monterey,' and immediately followed it with
                  the cheering strains—'Home, home again from a foreign shore.' When the last echoes
                  of those strains were dying away, the speaking tear was seen in every eye—they
                  could not be hidden, for they were the truthtelling oracles of their hearts, and
                  they must speak and tell how the heart felt at the kindling recollections of
                  home.
               When the evening had been both spent and enjoyed to a late hour, the colonel rose
                  to depart, and thanking them for their kindness, said to Kate, pleasantly—
               "Miss Hamilton, I am goiug to leave Mr. Wilson in your care for a few days, and I
                  will hold you responsible for his safe delivery in Virginia."
               "Very well," said Kate, blushing, "I will try to have him delivered to you
                  safely."
               Dick had spent a number of days with the family, and he could not doubt the
                  genuineness of the spirit which he observed to be the governing principle of every
                  thing about him.
               One day Dick ventured to inquire of Kate, in reference to his family, and the
                  circumstances in which she had found them. Kate replied to his inquiries quiries in a frank and feeling manner,
                  and added—
               "Mr. Wilson, they will be rejoiced to see you. I would like to share in the joys
                  of that meeting, and I have been thinking of making a proposition to Frank, that
                  we would accompany you home."
               Dick was nearly overcome—"Home! home!" he ejaculated, "what a spell—what a
                  subduing power there is in that word! But as yet, I must not see that spot—my
                  exile is not completed. Oh! for light to alluminate the darkness, and strength to
                  overcome the perils which yet lie between myself and my mother's fond embrace. My
                  way has been dark, gloomy, almost as the valley and shadow of death. I am going to
                  Virginia. Col. C—— has made me an offer which I could not possibly refuse."
               This, to Kate, was evidently unexpected, and, although unintentionally, she
                  betrayed her surprise, and ventured to remonstrate with him on the subject, and
                  referred forcibly to the deleterious effects of slavery, and the influence which
                  it must necessarily exert on one's life and character.
               "Miss Hamilton," said he, "slavery I shall abhor wherever I am; but I am
                  satisfied, nevertheless, that it is best for me to go."
               "Perhaps you are right," said Kate.
               "I think I am," he replied, "inasmuch as it will afford me an immediate
                  opportunity, not only to find a situation for myself; but also for my little
                  family, and this I hope is, as it ought to be with me, the great
                  consideration."
               After spending two weeks very pleasantly in the society of the Hamilton family,
                  and feeling renewed in health and spirits, he intimated his intention on the next
                  day to leave for Virginia. The family had become attached to him, and to them this
                  announcement seemed to come prematurely. They were loth to part with him, and if
                  it had not been for the pressing nature of his engagement, he would not have gone;
                  but he was sure that the offer made to him was prompted by kindness, and he did
                  not feel at liberty to neglect it. During his stay, the whole family had done
                  every thing in thier power to strengthen him against the insidious snares of the
                  rumseller. Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton had spoken to him as they would have done to a
                  son, whom they tenderly loved, and were anxious to save from the most dreadful
                  calamity; and Frank and Kate had done every thing which they could have done for a
                  brother, and they felt themselves to be richly repaid in the lively manifestations
                  of gratitude, which were too plain to be mistaken, in every look and action of
                  Dick.
               The time of his departure came, and with tears they bade each other good-bye, and
                  in doing so, Mr. Hamilton put a purse into his hand, saying—"God bless you, young
                  man, and keep your feet from the rumseller's snares," and Dick was again a
                  wanderer, in search of a retreat from the luring tempter.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               THE EFFECT.—THE CAUSE.—THE REMEDY.
               
                  
                     
                        "Ah! Misery, how I feel thy power!
                        Long have I labored to elude thy sway,
                        But 'tis enough, for I resist no more."
                     
                  
               
               THE destiny of the individual is often irrevocably fixed, who has formed a relish
                  for the intoxicating cup. With him it is usually true, 
                     "That one false step forever blasts his fame."
                   Mr. Hamilton greatly feared that this would prove true of Dick Wilson, and
                  that, goaded on, as he constantly was, by the promptings of an insatiable
                  appetite, he would be very likely to fall into the snares so thickly set in his
                  way by wily rumsellers.
               "I regret," said he to his family, as Dick Wilson left, "that there are so many
                  dram shops scattered all over the land. But for these, this young man, with his
                  firm resolutions to reform, would have little difficulty in effecting it. But as
                  it is, he is constantly tempted to drink, go where he may; and however firm his
                  purpose, it will be marvelous indeed if he long adheres to it."
               "Father," said Kate, "I do not think so now. I had many pleasant conversations
                  with him during his stay with us, and I am sure he will be able to withstand the
                  temptations of those men who had nearly accomplished his ruin."
               "I wish, my child," replied Mr. Hamilton, "that I was sure of it; but I am
                  not."
               "Don't you think, father," said Kate, "that he wishes to escape?"
               "Of that, my daughter, there can be no doubt. All, no matter how degraded, who
                  have become addicted to intemperance, regret it, and in their sober moments often
                  weep bitterly over the desperation of their condition. They would abstain, but
                  they cannot. Their resolutions are strong enough, but they have not the power to
                  carry them out. This I consider to be the case with Dick Wilson. He wishes, he
                  hopes, he may even be determined to reform; but he is not master of himself. His
                  perverted taste, his burning thirst for the destroying beverage when excited by
                  its presence, will overcome the calm teachings of reason and judgment, and he is,
                  I fear, destined to be their slave. Yes, I consider his situation one of imminent
                  peril, and the chances are a thousand to one against him. If he escape, his life
                  must be a constant struggle. His watchfires must never go out, nor, for one
                  moment, must the sentinel leave his post."
               For many days after this young man left Mr. Hamilton's house, he was the subject
                  of their daily conversation, and his
                  ability to withstand temptation was thoroughly canvassed. Kate invariably
                  maintained that she believed him to be beyond the rumseller's power, and often did
                  she speculate upon the nature of the happiness which would visit Mrs. Wilson's
                  lonely and cheerless dwelling when tidings, as from the grave, should be borne to
                  her, that the lost was found—the erring reclaimed—the son saved! Gradually, but
                  reluctantly, the cherished hopes of that family grew fainter and fainter. A month
                  had passed away, and not a line from Dick Wilson had yet been received, and all
                  but Kate seemed forced to the conclusion that again he had fallen.
               One morning Frank entered the room where Kate and her mother were sitting, and
                  laid on the table an open letter, saying as he did so, with as much calmness as
                  possible—
               "That is from Dick Wilson."
               "I knew he would stand firm," said Kate, while a flash of joy passed over her
                  features.
               "Read it, Kate," said Frank.
               "Yes, my daughter, read it," said Mrs. Hamilton. "I want to know how he reached
                  Virginia."
               Kate took up the letter, and in an instant the truth flashed upon her mind, and
                  laying it upon the table, she exclaimed—"Is it possible?" and left the room in
                  tears. At the request of Mrs. Hamilton, Frank read to her the letter, which was as
                  follows:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Dear Frank: The rumseller has triumphed again, and I
                              have fallen hopelessly beneath his stroke—fallen, I am afraid, to rise
                              no more. They have made this poor life of mine an eventful one. You
                              and your dear family have been very kind to me. You have tried to save
                              me, but, I fear, in vain. Ah! Frank, a few years have made a great
                              change in my character and destiny, such as I never anticipated. You
                              knew me when my prospects in life were enviable, and you have met me
                              in the land of strangers, and there you have seen my misery, and you
                              have known how I struggled against the ruin which beset me. I am
                              passing away rapidly. I feel it bitterly. I had a constitution which
                              for a time defied excesses, but at last it has given way, and now lies
                              in ruin. I had hoped to look once more into my mother's face, and see
                              her smile. I thought that once again I might be permitted to pronounce
                              the names of brother and sister in the presence of those who gather
                              with their griefs to my mother's side. That hope is dissipated
                              forever. Oh! how I have thought of them, and longed for them. I have
                              sat down by the camp-fire, on the plains of Mexico, to think of them
                              when every eye, save that of the sentinel, was closed, and enjoyed
                              sweet pleasure in the anticipation of a return.
                           "Ah! that hope will never be realized; for its last green leaf has
                              withered and died, in the bleak wastes of my heart. Oh! it is sad to
                              be a wanderer from home and
                              its joys; but it is sadder yet to feel the burning thirst which
                              consumes me, and to be powerless to resist its importunities. Oh!
                              Frank, how often do I wish that I could commence anew the journey of
                              life—that I could only be free from the snare which is leading me so
                              rapidly to ruin. I now see the emphatic force of those truths which I
                              derided at the time—that for the youth, or the young man, there is no
                              safety, unless he inscribes upon his banner the motto, 'Taste not,
                              touch not, handle not.' If I had done this, before the cursed taste
                              was formed, I should have been spared the bitter pangs which I have
                              been doomed to suffer. But, unfortunately for me, I thought that the
                              exhilerating effect of wine, so far from being injurious, was
                              positively beneficial. This was the sentiment in my father's family,
                              and of the circle in which I moved in earlier life; and to this I owe
                              the bitter scourge which now lashes me with such relentless fury. I
                              never drank to intoxication until that fatal night, after my rejection
                              at the village of B——. Yet I must say, that after taking the
                              resolution, upon the death of my father, to stop drinking, I had
                              constantly felt an almost irrepressible desire to continue a practice,
                              the influence of which I knew not, until I sought to discontinue it. I
                              had supposed that I could stop at any time, and without any
                              difficulty; but no one can tell what a struggle I have had, save those
                              who have been similarly situated. I have resolved, and re-resolved
                              that I would never again touch the fatal glass; but when my eye rested
                              upon it, and it was everywhere in my way, I was fired with such a
                              perfect phrensy of desire, that I could not resist. Frank, you will, I
                              doubt not, think of me often; but I hope you will not be too severe
                              upon my memory. Remember the causes of my ruin. Though I
                              greatly erred in closing my ears to the kindly warnings which were
                              given me, and in suffering myself to be borne thoughtlessly along by
                              the social influences around me; yet I must plead, in extenuation of
                              my guilt, the great force of those influences, and my ignorance at the
                              time, of the effect which they were producing. My fondness for
                              society, and the place where I sought its enjoyment, laid
                              the foundation of my ruin. That was done, though I did not know it,
                              before I was eighteen years of age. The DRINKING SALOON, oh, that such
                              a place had never existed—'that was the rock on which I
                                 split;' and the thought of its effect upon me is so
                              paralyzing, that I can only add, that this is probably the last that
                              you will ever hear of your early and
                           
                              Dear friend,
                              DICK WILSON."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               When Mr. Hamilton came in, the letter was handed to him, and he perused it
                  carefully. It was evident that he was not disappointed in the result; indeed, he
                  would have thought it miraculous if this young man, under the circumstances, had
                  triumphed; but with such a conviction pressing upon his mind, he did not say, 'It
                  is no use to try—it won't do any good.'
                  But his was the language of the freeman, the Christian and the philanthropist.
               "I am not disappointed," he said; "this is what I feared, and just what will be
                  found true in ninety-nine out of every hundred similar cases. While we should do
                  what we can to restore those who are already fallen, we should, at the same time,
                  remember that in the case of the intemperate, 'an ounce of prevention
                  is worth many pounds of cure,' and if we expect success to crown our
                  efforts, we must seek the causes, and find and correct
                     them, and the effects will of course cease. I have
                  long been thoroughly impressed with the conviction, that if we should strike out
                  of existence all the retail dram shops and tippling houses of the land, that we
                  should then have reached the fountain, and its streams, numerous and polluting as
                  they now are, would be dried up thoroughly and perpetually. To effect this,
                  stringent enactments are necessary, and I look forward with confidence to the time
                  when the horrors of intemperance will be matters of history rather than the daily
                  observation of all our citizens."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               CONCLUSION.
               
                  
                     
                        "On the world's wide field of battle,
                        In the bivouac of life,
                        Be not like dumb driven cattle:
                        Be a hero in the strife."
                     
                  
               
               FRIENDS of humanity! you whose eyes have wept and whose hearts have bled at the
                  ruin which intemperance has wrought, what is to be done? The story of Dick Wilson
                  is only that of thousands of young men who, by the pernicious influence of the rum
                  traffic, under legal sanction, have been made to suffer and to bleed, and this is
                  but one of the ten thousand families, which, by the power of this monstrous
                  wickedness, have been stricken down to the very earth, and whose agonizing wails
                  are piercing the heavens, and stirring the vengeance of the Almighty.
               Who are suffering? Rather, who are not suffering? Every relation in life has been
                  chilled and torn by it, and its sacred sanctity has been wantonly violated by its
                  accursed touch. You have seen the father, under its influence, tottering to his
                  home, and through life—tottering even to the grave; and you have seen the mother and the children, who were
                  as dear to her as if the munificence of a princess had been hers, subsisting upon
                  tears and sorrow and poverty, for, locked in the coffers of the rum-seller was the
                  living, of which she was the rightful, and ought to have been the
                     legal owner. You have seen the strong young man going forth into
                  the world, intent upon the prize for which he was struggling vigorously and with a
                  high-souled magnanimity, each day removing obstacles and dissipating fears, until
                  the end was full in view, and the reward seemed just within his grasp. Friends
                  were attracted to him by the rich promise he gave, and upon him their earnest and
                  admiring glance was fixed, as he passed another and another of those who were
                  competitors in the same race, and they doubted not that he would reach the goal of
                  his ambition. But in his, as in thousands upon thousands of similar cases, they
                  did not know that a concealed venom was rankling in his veins, and that already
                  the fatal fire was kindled within him, which, although smothered for the time, was
                  only waiting an adverse gale of fortune, to fan it into furious and uncontrollable
                  flame. It came: the victim struggled fiercely in the contest for life, but was
                  overcome in the encounter, and sank into the dark and cheerless embrace of the
                  drunkard's grave. "And did he fall alone?" Had that been so, the scene would have
                  been relieved of more than half its horror. A mother, sister and brother are again
                  smitten by the crushing ing blow, their staff broken, and their earthly hopes and
                  prospects blighted.
               This is but a single case. Every city, town and village in our broad land presents
                  a daily record of numerous cases, of which this is but a faint example. Few are
                  the families even that have not been more or less directly scourged by this pest
                  of the race. The long and full chronicle of crime, the baseness which gloats in
                  its triumphs over propriety and decency, the broils which disturb public and
                  private peace, the haggard ghosts of poverty and want, with all their suffering
                  children, the madness which dethrones reason and demolishes "the dome of
                  thought"—indeed, by far the greater share of all the ills that flesh is heir to,
                  have their origin in the same prolific source of evil and of ruin.
               In view of the devastation which it has wrought, and is still working, how
                  humiliating the thought, that in this country, at this time, with all the lights
                  emitted from the temples of science, and the altars of religion, it should still
                  go on, immolating annually its thousands of victims, and this, too, under the
                  sanction of American law!
               
               Again, the question occurs—What shall be done? Is the evil beyond our reach? Shall
                  we abandon the field to the destroyer, and let his horrid work go on? Shall we
                  continue, as we have horetofore done, to aid in the destruction of
                  our countrymen and kindred, by giving to the rum traffic the positive sanction of
                  law? "Forbid it, my country— forbid it,
                  heaven!" Every motive which should control the actions of the philanthropist, the
                  Christian, the political economist, the man of business, the friend of his family,
                  or of himself even, impels to action. Humanity, in all her forms of wretchedness,
                  is making her most earnest and solemn appeals. Her arguments are want and misery,
                  sorrow and suffering, tears and trials, crime and blood. They are, however,
                  utterly unavailing with those whose sensibilities have been benummed, whose
                  sympathies have been dried up, by the degrading associations and influences of the
                  rum traffic. Gain is their only object, and the consequences which result to
                  individuals or to society, are nothing to them, if they only make it profitable.
                  Disease and death may be before and around them—the fondest hopes and the dearest
                  relations of life may be blighted and severed by their touch, without exciting one
                  throb of pity in their callous hearts, or one purpose of amendment in their
                  obdurate minds.
               A business, therefore, the natural and unavoidable effects of which is to harden
                  and degrade those engaged in it, and from which society so bitterly suffers,
                  should obviously be prohibited by the strong arm of public law, from further riot
                  upon social peace.
            
            THE END.
