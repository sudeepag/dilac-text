            INTRODUCTION.
            MANY are the changes of the last fifty years,â€”some for the better, others for the worse. Of the latter, not the least are found in the humble tenements of the poor.
            To them, in former days, much more than at present, the pastor turned for many of his most efficient helpers, the Church for many of her brightest ornaments.
            The neat, white-washed cottage, partly hidden during the summer by creepers, and adorned with flowers in the windows and about the door, spoke of moral worth within, where the want of those things, in the like class, now betokens the lack of it, if there are not clear indications of degradation, vice, and crime.
            The writer can call to mind many eminent cases of cottage piety; but that of Robert Dawson and Mary Lawrence, his wife, is the most vividly and fully before him.
            Under these assumed names he takes two of God's humble poor, who are now with Him in heaven, to exemplify that type of cottage piety which formerly blessed this and other lands more than at present.
            Those who do not recognize in the picture the ones who sat for it will see internal proof that the sketch is not one of fiction. It is rather one of the sternest reality, to the correctness of the most of which there are yet living witnesses; while those parts of it which lie back of the memory of any now on the stage of life, are well authenticated.
            If more is said of Mary than of Robert, it is not because his piety adorned their cottage less while it shone there, but because he came later into the kingdom of Christ on earth, and passed thence much earlier to his reward in heaven.
            Mary survived him for nearly forty years, and left behind her writings, from which we glean much that follows. Indeed, the most that is said relates to her during her widowed state. Should the reading of this unvarnished narrative induce any, in palace or cottage, to a more entire consecration to God, to his name be the glory.

               CHAPTER I.
               MARY'S PARENTAGE AND EARLY LIFE.
               MARY LAWRENCE was the daughter of an Evangelical clergyman, who was pastor of a church in New England for nearly sixty years. He was a descendant of one who came over in the Mayflower. Her mother was the daughter also of a New England divine, who married, as tradition has it, a descendant of John Fox the martyrologist. The best of blood flowed in her veins. She was the youngest of six children, and was born January 8, 1778.
               Her mother had the chief care of the family, as her father was much engaged in parochial duties. She governed it in the happiest manner, and the mutual attachment of her children was such that "an unkind word or an unpleasant look never passed between them."
               Her father's family was a model, upon which others looked with admiration.
               
               Their home was as near an earthly paradise as often falls to the lot of mortals.
               Under this influence Mary grew up till her thirteenth year, careless respecting the state of her soul; but at that age she began to think about the judgment, which, at times, seemed to be near, and to be alarmed about herself.
               Her convictions were often so overpowering that she was obliged to retire from the family circle to weep; and yet she strove to conceal her state of mind as much as possible, even from those who would gladly have pointed her to Christ.
               She read her Bible, though its startling truths filled her with terror, and was much in secret prayer, for which, as summer came on, she went into a field of grain, till she thought that none but God could see or hear her.
               After this she had seasons of great joy, when she thought if the judgment should come that it would be delightful to her.
               She looked upon godly ministers as a most happy class of people, and, from her chamber-windows, often watched them, as they left her father's house, till she could see them no more. "Still, I do not remember," she says, "that one of them ever said a word to me about the state of my soul. It was too much their custom, when together, to indulge in light conversation, by which they failed to do the good they might otherwise have done. Had they been faithful, I might look back with more satisfaction to my youthful days."
               Her parents guarded, with an ever-watchful eye, the company which their children kept, and the places of amusement to which they resorted. They also set before them the best of examples, and strove to impress upon their minds the importance of being ever ready to die.
               Their mother would say to them, "Let it ever be your habit to pray for God's guidance, so that you may follow that which is pleasing to him, and, at the great day, meet your parents at his right hand."
               After some time the mind of Mary became less serious, though occasionally the terrors of the grave and of the eternal world would arouse her to a sense of danger.
               When near eighteen years of age, she went with her father to his native place. "Our journey," she writes, "was delightful; along the course of which I was treasuring up facts and little incidents which I thought would be interesting to my mother on my return.
               "We left home on Monday, and on the following Friday, a little after midnight, I was awakened from sleep to hear that my mother was dead.
               "She had died of the apoplexy very suddenly; and thus, unexpectedly, in a moment my earthly happiness seemed to be annihilated.
               
               "We hastened to our desolate home, where, instead of a fond mother to clasp me in her arms, the first object that met my weeping eyes, as we drew near, was her coffin."
               Aside from her conviction for sin, the death of her mother was Mary's first trouble, which was not a little increased by the state of her father's health.
               In the spring of 1797 she began to teach school, and continued in that employment most of the time for four years. While thus employed, her exposure to the small-pox alarmed her very much, for she felt that she was not prepared for a dying hour; but she escaped the disease, and her fears gradually subsided.
               We have no means of tracing more minutely the several steps by which God brought her to himself, but find that she united with the church, of which her father was pastor, in the summer of 1799.
               In after-years this step occasioned her "floods of sorrow and deep repentance," through fear that she had taken it in a thoughtless manner. "Often," she observes, "has the adversary taken advantage of me in my seasons of deep spiritual depression, and suggested that. I joined the church when I was not fit to be a member, and that I could not be forgiven."
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               FROM THE MARRIAGE OF ROBERT DAWSON AND MARY LAWRENCE TO THEIR REMOVAL INTO THE COUNTRY.
               OF the early life of Robert Dawson we know comparatively little. He was born on what is known in certain sections of our country, by way of pre-eminence, as the Cape, in 1765, and spent much of his early life upon the ocean. For years before he retired from it, he was commander of a merchant ship.
               He is said to have been a man of "commanding person, gentlemanly bearing," and, for one of his years, had, at the time of their marriage, acquired, by his own industry and enterprise, what was regarded in those days as a handsome fortune.
               Though without piety, which was thought less important then in the partner of a Christian than it is at this day, he was esteemed worthy of the one to whose destinies he was about to unite his own. They were married, October 4, 1800, with unusually bright prospects. But the future is wisely concealed from us.
               Their serene sky was soon overcast by clouds, through which what the world would call a propitious ray seldom penetrated for years, if one ever did, while the two journeyed on in life together.
               They encountered losses of property, and met with other severe trials, for which Mary's early training had poorly prepared her.
               But we shall see, as we go on, that these losses and trials were nobly borne, and that, while they were the means of bringing Robert to Christ, and fitting him, in no ordinary degree, for his eternal home, they developed also, in Mary, eminent traits, the existence of which had not otherwise been known.
               Now, as they, united again on the shores of a blissful eternity, after they had been separated for many years, review the scenes through which they passed together, we doubt not that they see cause to bless their heavenly Father for the bitterest cup that was ever placed to their lips. When they were married, Mary was young, and, for a professor of religion, somewhat gay. She had known but little trouble, neither did her prospects lead her to expect it.
               How surprising, then, when one short year had hardly passed after that event, to hear her say that "she felt like a poor solitary being, overwhelmed by earthly sorrows and abandoned by her God"!
               And as we go on we shall find that it was not without reason that "her spirits, naturally high, were exceedingly depressed;" for her present trials were exhausting, and her fears with reference to the future were great.
               But what had blighted those high hopes and clouded those fair prospects with which she and Robert had set out in life together only a few months before? What had given her such fearful forebodings with reference to the future? We would simply state here, to prevent erroneous impressions, that the cause of this change in her prospects was not the fault of either, but rather, as we are wont to say, the misfortune of both, and leave the facts to be developed as we go on.
               With reference to that first year, Mary wrote, when quite advanced in life, that she "could not depict the half she felt;" and yet those for whom she wrote will not attempt to place before the world the half she told them. Enough will be said to show the nature and magnitude of her trials, while the rest will await the revelations of the great day.
               It was Robert's intention, when he was married, to retire at once from the ocean and to settle down with his partner upon a farm. He had already purchased land for this purpose, when circumstances, as he thought, made it necessary for him to take one more voyage to the West Indies. It was the one voyage too many that sailors are wont to take, and was apparently the cause of all their trouble.
               When speaking of their parting, Mary says, "We were cheered by the thought that this would be a last voyage, and that we should soon be settled down in a happy home of our own."
               But long was it before that hope was realized, if it ever was, by the two together.
               On his way to the West Indies Robert was assailed by a privateer, who ordered him, with terrible threats, to strike his colors and come on board. It was evening, and, instead of complying, he extinguished his lights, crowded on all sail, and by the help of a dark night made his escape. Arriving at the islands, he disposed of enough of his cargo to freight his ship for a return voyage, put his mate on board, as master, and sent her home, intending, when the balance of the cargo was disposed of, to purchase and freight another and return with it himself. But, owing to the unprincipled conduct of one of his men, he met with heavy losses, and became involved in lawsuits, before he could get ready to sail. These harassing events preyed upon his mind to such a degree, that soon after he left port his reason was so impaired that, in his better moments, conscious of his unfitness to command the vessel, he directed his mate to sail for Charleston, where Mary's youngest brother was engaged in mercantile business.
               Owing to the effect upon his mind of the conduct of his men, it was thought best, after he had reached that city, to place another in command of his vessel, while he returned home some other way. The one to whom the vessel was intrusted, believing that Robert would not live to return, proved false to his trust, sold the cargo, appropriated the avails of it to himself, and then sent the brig into Boston with a debt upon her of hundreds of dollars.
               Robert sailed from Charleston to New York, and thence to his home, where Mary welcomed him. From the consequences of the troubles in which this voyage involved him, he never entirely recovered. We are not able to state what became of the first ship and cargo sent home; but the result of the whole was most disastrous.
               Blow after blow had fallen upon him in rapid succession, till instead of returning richer by thousands than when he went, his hard-earned property was gone, and with it his vigorous health and spirits.
               Having referred to a calamity with which Robert was visited an his way from the islands, it seems proper to state that he first suffered, in a like manner, when he lay sick in a foreign hospital, to which he was brought by a fall while repairing his ship. Not being cared for in a proper manner, fever set in, and the foundation of a mental disease was laid from which he occasionally suffered in after-years.
               When he reached his home from the West Indies, it was as a ship enters the quiet haven after she has encountered many a storm, had her spars carried away, and her sails rent asunder.
               He was the wreck of what he had been but a few months before. It was then that the true character of Mary Lawrence began to appear.
               A few days after he reached home, he was in a terrible state of mind. Strong men stood back from him with fear, and so hopeless was his case that his young wife was strongly advised to abandon him to his fate.
               Instead of sympathizing with her in her very great afflictions, and giving her every possible aid, they censured her for her watchful and tender care. But, though her own health was poor, she never wavered in her duty for a moment, but considered her marriage vows too solemn to be broken, and equally binding upon her in sickness as in health, in adversity as in prosperity, in the loss of reason, even, as in its full possession.
               Her attachments to her husband were increased rather than diminished by his trials, and especially, though doubting the genuineness of her own hope, did she desire to see him at peace with God.
               She scarcely left him night or day, but endeavored deavored, with the utmost tenderness, to soothe his agitated mind till the tempest had spent its fury and he seemed in a fair way to be restored to perfect health.
               Just at this critical moment, in some way, he learned the fate of the brig that had been sent from Charleston, and this information, very imprudently given him at that time, threw him into a worse state of derangement than he had ever been in before.
               It became necessary to confine him; and, in the entire want of those hospitals for the insane, which now adorn every Christian land, a room was selected for that purpose in the house of his father-in-law. After giving facts much more minutely than we shall do here, Mrs. Dawson goes on to say that it is utterly impossible for her to describe the trials of those times. Heaven and earth seemed against them.
               Many who had appeared to be warm friends and showed them marked attention in their prosperous days, now stood aloof from them; while others, who had envied their happiness and prosperity, seemed to exult in their calamities.
               Amid these circumstances their eldest son was born. In ordinary times his birth had been a matter of great rejoicing, but now it was regarded by many as a calamity, and, in his mother's own words, "the little one was deemed a curse!"
               
               Robert was chained in his chamber, while Mary, though requiring every attention to keep her alive, was again, as soon as possible, by his side, and scarcely left him day or night. She sat by him and slept near him, while he, in turn, looked upon her as the best friend he had on earth, and ever treated her as such. One of his great fears was that he might be left to do her harm when he was not himself.
               Mary was truly thankful that their marriage had been solemnized before these calamities came upon them, and said to herself, "Now Mr. Dawson has one friend to feel for him and to try to comfort him."
               The loss of property did not occupy her thoughts; but the painful situation of her husband absorbed every other consideration. She had a general impression that mercy was in store for them, though, to her great grief, during these sore trials she found little access to a throne of grace.
               Robert's father had, some time before this, removed to a distant part of the State, and when the son was sufficiently restored to health to leave his chamber, he could not be induced to return again to the house in which it was. In consequence of this they were without a home.
               One evening, when Mr. Dawson was walking in the field, his wife, with her infant in her arms, took him food. He sat down beneath a tree and partook of it, while they condoled each other upon their unhappy lot. The stars were already beginning to appear, and the night dews were falling around them, when a widow (so kind was woman's heart when men were afraid to invite them in), passing by, asked them to spend the night with her. Mary then felt that if she could have a little home of her own to shelter her, she would not care much where it was. She said that no pen could describe her anguish. The day after their stay at the widow's, Robert resolved to go to his own father's in the country, and to send thence for his family at the earliest practicable moment. Such was his health that his companion took it upon herself to find a vessel that was about to sail to the nearest port, and, after getting his things in readiness, took him to it, bade him farewell for a time, and returned to her father's house.
               The family were on a journey. She and her infant were alone in the very house where her early joys had been very great, but her recent calamities all-but overwhelming.
               There in solitude she reflected upon the more recent past. It was hard to realize that it was not all a dream, from which she would ere long awake. But the awaking was more and more to the fearful reality.
               When Mr. Dawson left his partner, he sailed for Boston, and went thence as he couldâ€”for there were few if any stages in those days, and much less were there comfortable carsâ€”to his father's house in Huntstown, more than one hundred miles into the interior, and nearly two hundred from the home of his childhood and youth. He was so joyfully received by them that it made him almost well again.
               As soon as arrangements could be made, one of their own number started on horseback for Mary and her babe, that now was nine weeks old. He took them both on his own horse, behind him, and returned. The mother was just recovering from sickness, and the child was sick on the way; but a kind Providence brought them to the end of their journey in due time.
               Though Mary was now among strangers, she says, "We meet with the greatest kindness from every one." They had little of their own but what they wore, yet Robert soon fitted up a room in his brother's house, and by the kindness of their friend they became a little family by themselves.
               The sorrows and trials through which they had already passed, had been enough to embitter a life of ordinary length, if scattered over the whole; but when we remember that it was not yet thirteen months since they were married, it must be admitted that such a chapter of reverses is very seldom crowded into so brief a space.
               Their property was gone, their health impaired, if not permanently ruined, and unjust claims were pressed upon them, which it was impossible for them to meet. The friends of their prosperityâ€”not of themâ€”had disappeared. They were beginning to learn upon whom they could rely. The placid sea had suddenly become one of tempestuous raging, before the mariner could trim his sails, and their bright morning had early been followed by raging storms that even now were only a little lulled.
               God was leading them down into a valley that was deep and dark, but he made it to them ere long light in the Lord.
               At the moment when the strong oak was tottering to its fall, the vine that had entwined around it, and depended upon it, came to its support.
               It seems strange, as we look back, that Mrs. Dawson did not sink beneath her load of sorrows; but in their darkest day, when even God seemed to hide his face, she felt that mercy was in store for them, and that some day they would rise above their troubles. But, though sustained by such a hope, the time for realizing it, if ever, was not yet.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER III.
               THEIR RESIDENCE IN HUNTSTOWN.
               THOUGH in the obscure and very humble circumstances in which we left them at the close of the last chapter, Robert and Mary were not allowed to remain unmolested.
               An old and inveterate foe, who had been the chief cause of all their troubles, found them out and brought false claims against them. As they were not able to cancel those claims, if they were so disposed, he had Robert seized and thrust into the debtor's jail.
               "I alone," says Mary, "was witness to his anguish during the night before he was torn away, and had reason to fear a fatal result." After his departure, most painful were her circumstances. Her nights were spent in weeping, rather than in sleep, and with pitiful emotions did she gaze upon her little son, as yet unconscious of the troubles amidst which he was born. True to the instincts of her heart, she soon visited her husband in prison, and did what she could for his comfort there.
               A few days after her return she was summoned again to him. He had been taken suddenly sick.
               While she was preparing to go, said one to her, "Do you not think God is unjust in dealing so hardly with you?" To which she promptly replied, "I have never had any disposition to complain of God." Heavily as he might be pleased to lay his hand upon her, she would still justify him in all his dealings toward them.
               Mrs. Dawson reached the jail, after riding nearly twenty miles, probably on horseback, through a violent storm, with her infant in her arms. Here severe and complicated afflictions awaited her. Mr. Dawson was in a feeble state, and her child, after such exposure, was almost immediately taken sick. She was a prey to grief, and often sought a place to weep.
               At the expiration of Robert's term of imprisonment, they returned to Huntstown together, and resumed housekeeping in their very small way. They then hoped to enjoy a measure of comfort; but, worn out by anxiety, in the course of a few days Robert was laid upon a bed of sickness, where he languished for three months. The whole period was one of excessive gloom, save as it was relieved by the unabated kindness of friends.
               They were without money, without health, and one of them was without faith in Christ.
               Mary was obliged to be up much of the night, or, if she sought repose, lost herself in sleep only as she became exhausted by weeping. Every day seemed to bring new trials, till her resolution and strength were nearly gone.
               For the future, she could see nothing but anxiety and grief, and it seemed to her as if God had delivered her over to the assaults of Satan, who accused her of unfaithfulness and hypocrisy. Still, she never cherished hard thoughts of her Maker, but felt that he did right by her at all times.
               The most dreadful day Mrs. Dawson ever passed was a Sabbath early in the year 1802. For the time the adversary seemed to have full possession of her husband, every power and faculty of whose soul was wrought up into the most deadly opposition to God.
               No language was too strong for him to use in respect to his Maker, and he expressed his earnest desire to be where he might use the profanest of oaths without restraint.
               Overwhelmed with anguish at such a fearful storm, and worn out with watching, Mary left him for a time in the care of his brother, and withdrew from a scene too painful to be longer endured.
               When she returned, she saw that the tempest had spent its fury. The countenance of the poor sufferer showed that the lion was transformed into a lamb. The scene which she had but recently witnessed was the last desperate struggle of Satan to keep a perishing soul from Christ, and the turning point in the never-ending existence of one for whom Mrs. Dawson had long agonized at the throne of grace, even when Jehovah seemed to turn away from her.
               God had begun a good work, though it was weeks before this long tempest-tossed soul could calmly and fully rest in Christ.
               In the mean time, Christians around, who had become deeply interested in this greatly afflicted couple, gave themselves to prayer as if they would give God no rest till the work he had commenced was in a measure complete.
               Prayer-meetings were appointed on his account, and continued for ten days. Some counseled or prayed with him whole nights, till divine light broke more clearly in upon his soul. It was feeble at first, but continued to increase, until the subject of so much solicitude and prayer made a profession of his faith in Christ, and settled down in the unshaken belief of those doctrines called Calvinism, from which he never swerved to the day of his death.
               God had employed a long and terrible course of discipline, but it had its effect, and henceforth Robert and Mary Dawson were one in Christ. It is very rare that a couple can be found so perfectly harmonious, as they were, in all matters of faith and practice.
               Such, at length, was Mrs. Dawson's reward for being true and faithful to one in his extreme adversity versity, whom she had married in his prosperous days. If she had followed the heartless advice of some, and left her husband when he most needed a friend, Robert had probably gone, through neglect, to an early grave, and been lost forever, while his partner had been filled with remorse to the end of life in the view of her course.
               Now, she could look back upon it with satisfaction, feeling that she had done what she could. Mr. Dawson, after he found peace, at once commenced to discharge in full, as the head of a household, the duties of a Christian. The family altar was erected, and on it incense was daily offered. Thus was the divine light kindled up in that cottage home, which was to shine, almost without exception, brighter and brighter so long as they journeyed here below.
               Mary had before cultivated to some extent the piety of the heart, but here begins, in its proper sense, cottage piety, for which the Lord had been preparing the way. Mr. and Mrs. Dawson spent about two years in Huntstown, where they met with kindness that made such deep impressions upon their minds, that they loved to speak of it in after-days, and visit from time to time those scenes of their sufferings and their joys.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               FROM THEIR REMOVAL TO WESTFORD TO MR. DAWSON'S DEATH.
               WESTFORD is on the eastern slope of the Green Mountains, in the western part of the old Bay State. It is not a town of itself, but a neighborhood of Olney, to which we have given that name.
               Much of this town, of which Westford is a part, is exceedingly rough and mountainous. Among the valleys of the northwestern part of it is one that is hemmed in, on every side but the north, with such lofty mountains that it is not blessed with the morning sun till hours after the hill-tops have been gilded by his rays. And to tell when it had actually set, to those occupying the table-lands above them, the inhabitants of the vale looked not to the west, but watched the shadow as it crept up the hill-side in the opposite direction.
               Three streams of considerable size, in days when primitive forests covered most of the soil, finding their respective ways from the west, south, and southeast, met in this valley, and rolled on their united waters to one of the larger tributaries of the sea.
               About the confluence of these streams, and on both sides of the main one, Robert Dawson obtained some wild land, cleared a small spot, and built a very unpretending house, into which he moved his family in November, 1803.
               From his early days he had been familiar with the mountain waves, and now sought a calm retreat from a troublesome world, amid scenes which we have often compared to the ocean suddenly frozen into a solid mass when lashed to its utmost fury. The murmuring brooks, which could be heard from every part of this retired tract of land, were soothing, and sung, as it were, of heaven, to one who had been led through deep waters to the feet of Jesus.
               To his wife, the contrast which her new home presented to the one she had left, three years before, was about as great as it could be.
               She had been accustomed to refined society, but here, out of her own family, she was to have very little for many years.
               Her early home, fast by the house of God, afforded her every advantage that can usually be found in the parsonage of a village church.
               Now, the nearest house of God was five miles off; and such miles, up hill and down, that one must actually travel such miles to understand what they are. The family carriage to which she had been accustomed, was to be enjoyed no more.
               With the comforts of such a home as hers had been before the reader's mind, let her describe to him the one to which she had moved: "It was surrounded," she says, "with dense forests and lofty mountains, over which wild beasts roamed at pleasure. We sometimes saw them by day, but more frequently heard them by night."
               Their house was made of logs, was unfinished, unfurnished, and unpaid for. It had not, at first, even a door to exclude the wild beasts by night, had they been disposed to enter.
               But God had so prepared her for the change, by the terrible ordeals through which she had passed, one after another, in quick succession, that she says, "I can truly say, that if I ever felt happy, and thankful to God, it was the day when I first found myself at home in our log-house."
               In their new sphere they had everything to learn, under the most unfavorable circumstances. Robert knew nothing of farming; Mary was entirely ignorant of the peculiar duties of a farmer's wife. They had but little to do with; yet, dispensing with silks and broadcloths, to which they had been accustomed, they determined to do the best they could, while they, unitedly and alone, looked to their Father above for his blessing and direction.
               
               "Before honor is humility," and not only without a murmur, but joyfully, had they gone down into the lowest vale in which that heavenly grace abides. Whether either of them received honor in later days, and in what sense, the sequel will show.
               In their new home it was necessary for Robert to be engaged, by day, in out-door labor. In winter he must cut down the lofty trees which everywhere encumbered his land, and be ready to clear them away, and put in grain as the season for it came round.
               In summer he must plant and sow and gather in such ripened harvest as God might be pleased to give him.
               For a few years he was much alone, and would toil and pray or praise, together, while the thoughts of that better country toward which he was steadily moving, made his burdens light.
               Then he had his little, inquisitive boy by his side, many of whose questions could not be answered without much thought.
               At the same time, Mary would be much alone, with her little ones, whom she delighted to instruct in the best way she could, while engaged in her various household cares.
               Their evenings were mainly spent at home, together, when they related to each other, the incidents of the day, read the word of God, prayed, and talked of their heavenly home.
               And when they retired to rest, so as to be prepared for the toils of the coming day, Robert was accustomed to repeat aloud portions of Scripture, or pious hymns, till he fell asleep.
               The busy world did not intrude upon them, and they knew little of its outward scenes.
               To a very great extent, they were alone with each other and with God. Their neighbors were few and remote. Though kind, and ready to lend a helping hand, as they could, each had his own peculiar toils.
               At times, such of them as could, guided by torch-lights, through forests or fields, would spend an evening with Robert and Mary, in prayer, or they, in turn, would spend one elsewhere, in a like manner, if they could.
               Mary could seldom get to the house of God, and, when she went, it was necessary for her to leave home the day before, and pass the night with some friend far on the way, so as to be able to reach home on the evening of the following day, after service.
               Robert went as he was able, and reported as much as he could to his family when he returned.
               Their pastor could not often visit them; but he was ever most cordially welcome when he did. Such a visit was to them a feast of fat things. Time was not spent in frivolous talk, but, looking upon him as a servant of their Master, they loved to sit at his feet and hear his words.
               He ever found them ready to converse upon spiritual things, not as cavilers, but as those who had spiritual appetites, and wished to be fed with strong meat as well as with the sincere milk of the word.
               The good man answered their inquiries, solved their doubts, and removed their fears as best he could. And if, knowing, as he did, the circumstances in which they had been in early life, he left their cottage with commiseration for them in his heart, it was also with a deep conviction that he had few, if any, more reliable, valuable friends, few, whose prospects of heaven were brighter than theirs. They could not do much for his earthly comfort, but they remembered him in prayer.
               Now and then, as God gave to them a little one, whom they wished to give back to him in the holy ordinance of baptism, it was delightful to see them, with the child in the father's arms, leaving home on Saturday, and quietly starting for the church, at which they hoped to meet with the people of God on the following day.
               Now they would slake their thirst at a mountain spring, then take a cup of tea with a pious friend, and spend the night with some loved disciple, not remote from the house of God. Thus, child after child, as God blessed them with children, was borne in their arms, as they walked to the far-distant sanctuary, and lent to the Lord.
               The sphere in which this pious couple moved was very contracted; but their influence for good was felt to its utmost bounds. The wicked who knew them, and knew their history, were constrained to admit, that there was power in the religion of the crossâ€”that this humble couple walked with God.
               Thus years passed on, and as the forest faded away before Robert's sturdy hand, the stumps, which the fallen trees had left in the ground, became altars, by which he kneeled for prayer. In winter, the snow-banks were consecrated by the devotions that were offered behind them, almost as pure as their unstained sheets that covered the earth. For, though Robert found great delight in prayer with his family, there were times when he wished to pray alone.
               But even here, though they usually had great peace within, they had their trials without. Their old enemy followed them to their obscure wilderness-home, and harassed them for a number of years.
               At one time they had to drive what little stock they had, to a distant part of the forest, to hide it from his malignant grasp. Sometimes their crops, scanty, at best, would be cut off by early frosts, and they would be reduced to great straits. Such was the case during the second and ninth winters of their residence in Westford.
               The latter was ever after spoken of by them as the "poor year." They had been building, and their expenses had been much increased. The early frosts greatly injured the maturing harvest, and they met with such other serious losses, that they actually suffered for the necessaries of life.
               At the same time they had much affliction in their family. But these trials without, did not shake their confidence in God. They were never, happier in each other, but were mutual comforts, as they looked to God together for help. In their greatest extremity, Mary's father sent them relief, as he had done before, when his moderate income would permit.
               They had much sickness; but their most trying season, in this respect, was in 1815. Mary was then brought to the verge of the grave, their youngest child was sick, from home, and their oldest son, then of great service to his parents, broke his arm. Thus were their sorrows multiplied.
               Robert watched over his suffering companion with the greatest tenderness, and would frequently say, "Now I have an opportunity to repay you for some of your care and anxiety about me."
               Their experience in spiritual matters was not always the same. Mary was at times depressed. Her old fears would return, lest she had joined the church when she should not, and then she trembled lest she had committed the unpardonable sin; but the Lord, in his own good time, delivered her.
               Robert, too, after they had been for some years in Westford, was brought into great distress about his future state; but, at length, the glory of the Lord burst in upon his mind with almost overwhelming power. It was a new baptism from on high. Thenceforth he manifested new zeal in prayer, and they set apart frequent days for fasting or thanksgiving in their own family, which they observed with great strictness, though their neighbors were engaged in labor as usual.
               Soon after their trying sickness in 1815, the town enjoyed one of those precious revivals, with which it was often blessed, in answer to the prayers of such as Robert and Mary. They were led to hope that three of their children were subjects of renewing grace; and from that time, their oldest son, who was very fond of books, wished to prepare to preach the gospel to the heathen. They would gladly have encouraged him at once; but such were their circumstances, that arrangements could not be made for him to enter upon a course of study till the autumn of 1819.
               For more than a year before that, a very marked change had been observed in Robert. In everything he seemed to say, "Not my will, but thine, O God, be done." He evidently looked upon himself more than ever, as a pilgrim here, and regarded his race as nearly run. His constant prayer was for preparation to enter into the joy of his Lord. He spent more time even than he had formerly done, in religious conversation with his children, and gathered them not only morning and night, but at noon also, around their family altar for prayer. He besought them to seek first the kingdom of God, assuring them that the scoffs of the world could not harm them if they would live godly in Christ Jesus. He was very anxious to bring them up under his own eye, that he might guide their tender minds aright.
               In June of this year they were called to follow to the grave a brother of Robert's, who had been growing more and more dear to them continually. It was a severe blow to them, and Mr. Dawson especially felt that it was a loud call to him to be ready for his own departure.
               On the second of January following (1820), he arose in usual health, attended to the ordinary duties of the morning, conversed with his children about death, judgment, and eternity, then walked those five miles to the house of God, where his people were that day to commemorate Christ's dying love. At the close of the second service he returned home, which he reached amidst falling snow, just as darkness was beginning to come on. While conversing with his family about the deeply interesting services of the day, he was suddenly attacked by a disease which baffled all medical skill, and, after three days of terrible suffering, he fell asleep in Jesus, in his fifty-third year.
               Thus closed an eventful life, and thus passed away from earth an affectionate husband, a tender father, a good neighbor, and a pillar, if eminent devotion to God can make one such, in the Church of Christ.
               During his whole sickness he was remarkably calm and peaceful, though his sufferings were very great. Not a murmur escaped him, not an unpleasant look shaded his face. He said that death was no terror to him,â€”that for a number of years, and especially for the last seventeen months, he had endeavored to live near the cross. While his strength held out, he conversed with, those of his family who were at home, and charged those around him to tell the absent one to "live godly in Christ Jesus." Few who had seen him sitting so meekly in the house of God, only the Sabbath before, knew of his sickness till he was with the Lord.
               
               As the scene so sad to those who remained, came to a close, and the released spirit took its upward flight, Mrs. Dawson buried her face in her hands and wept. Her cup, so often full before, now overflowed. The hand of the Lord was pressing her, and she could not for the moment realize that underneath her were the everlasting arms.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               FROM THE DEATH OF ROBERT TO MARY'S REMOVAL FROM WESTFORD.
               AFTER nineteen years of checkered, wedded life, Mrs. Dawson was left a widow. God's own appointed priest of the cottage was removed, but the altar, at which he had ministered, was not taken down, nor was the flame that had burned brightly upon it extinguished. Other hands, thenceforth, supplied the incense, and, as we go on, cottage piety is not to be exemplified in the lives of Robert and Mary, but in the life of the latter alone, though there will frequently be occasion to refer to the former, especially for a few years to come.
               It was then a good Puritan custom, in West-ford, and we hope that it has not yet passed away, for the surviving members of a family, when death had broken in upon their circle, as soon as, practicable after the funeral, to go up together to the house of the Lord and ask the prayers of his people in a public manner, that their afflictions might be sanctified to them.
               The mourning group would rise and stand as the request was read from the sacred desk.
               
               Thus Mrs. Dawson appeared with her little children around her, in the parish church, on the first Sabbath, if we mistake not, after her husband's death, and just one week from the time that his tall, erect form had been seen there in apparent health, among the devout worshipers of God.
               In a healthy community, so sparsely settled as Olney, death and the subsequent scene at church, of which we have spoken, were comparatively rare. When they did occur, the impression was deep and solemn.
               In the present case everything seemed to conspire to touch the tenderest sympathies and to call forth the most fervent prayers of the worshiping assembly.
               It was in the midst of a cold New England winter when Mary followed the companion of her toils, her sorrows, and her joys, to the grave, and assumed, in respect to her family, the entire duties which they had hitherto shared between them.
               They had lived together in such a happy manner, in the midst, even, of their sharpest trials, that the now departed one was accustomed to say to their children, "Live in peace and love, as your parents do, that you may please God and go to heaven at death."
               Together they had often prayed and praised, and talked of the things of that better country to which they looked forward; but now one had passed the flood, and was, through grace, forever at rest.
               Spread out before the other was a lonely way, save as Jesus whispered to her, "Fear not, for I am with thee."
               The children of this pious couple had been taught, from their tender years, to be industrious. Of those who survived their father, the older ones were becoming efficient in years at the time of his death.
               The oldest son, who was so ungraciously received by many at his birth, had publicly given himself to God, and entered upon a course of studies preparatory to the gospel ministry.
               He was summoned from school to the dying bed of his father.
               On the whole, prospects were brightening around this couple whom God had thus far led by a painfully mysterious way, and they were beginning to realize more and more the tranquil home which they had anticipated as they set out in life together, when the death of the one gave an aspect entirely new to the future of the survivor.
               After two or three weeks, it was thought best for the oldest son to return to his studies, while his little brothers, eight and fen years of age, took care of the stock and aided their mother, as they were able, to provide for the family.
               
               That plan would give her time to look into state of her worldly matters, and to lay such plans for the future as the emergency seemed to demand, without interfering with the studies of her son.
               In the mean time we can learn, from various sources, in what manner Mrs. Dawson received the heavy blow that her heavenly Father had been pleased to lay upon her.
               Her struggles with sickness and poverty rendered it impossible for her to give much attention to correspondence, but, in addition to such letters as she did write, we have a narrative of her own life, commenced by her in her sixty-third year.
               Though more than twenty-five years had elapsed, at the time she commenced it, since she had passed through some of her sharpest trials, they were so impressed upon her mind that no lapse of time could erase them.
               Her children were necessarily more or less scattered soon after she became a widow; and as they returned home from time to time, they were accustomed to gather around her, as twilight came on, and listen, till a late hour, to her thrilling narratives, as those of an earlier day listened to the tales of the Revolution or of the Indian wars.
               The facts were thus kept fresh in her recollection. From this narrative, and from such letters ters as have come to hand, we can not only see what further trials came upon her and hers, but how she bore the past, and others, as they came.
               Writing to her father, then far advanced in life, only three days after her bereavement, she says:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "January, 8, 1820.
                           
                           "How many times I have taken my pen to fill my letters with the sad tale of my afflictions and sorrows! but now I know not where to begin.
                           "My cup is more than full. Your Mary is a widow. This day week the dear partner of my youth was here, but now I am solitary indeed.
                           "How sudden! How changed, how dark and gloomy is the world! My loss is very heavy. Far away from my friends and from the house of God, how lonely pass my hours!
                           "It is a satisfaction to think that amidst our many trials we were more and more united."
                        
                     
                  
               
               Then, after speaking of her husband's calm and heavenly frame of mind for about a year and a half before his death, she brings out the fact before alluded to, that it was his custom to have family worship three times a day. We have never known any other head of a family adopt such a course; but the type of piety cultivated in that humble cottage led the family to spend a part of that mid-day hour in the worship of God which most of the laboring class spend in rest.
               
               She then turns from the gloom that surrounds her on every side, and says, "But why should I despair? He has promised to be the widow's God and a father to the fatherless. Not one jot of his word will fail."
               Though it was but three days since she became a widow, she could already look through the clouds to the faithful Promiser, and rest on his word.
               The next letter from her which has come to hand, is dated more than three months later than the foregoing.
               She had received letters of sympathy and condolence, but so many were the cares pressing upon her that they, as yet, remained unanswered.
               To prepare the way for the one that follows, it is necessary to say a few words about that son to whom it is addressed.
               It was evident to those that knew him that his thirst for knowledge was very great. He had already struggled with difficulties which few have had to encounter, and fewer still have overcome.
               From her early consecration of him to the work of the ministry, his mother had reason to think that this very thirst was given him in answer to her prayers, and she might well fear either to check his ardent aspirations or to withhold, in the least, any possible aid or encouragement that she could give him.
               A few weeks before his father's death he had made arrangements by which he was to be released from further labor for him, and to enter systematically upon a course of study.
               Being summoned home on account of the sickness of his father, in anticipation of a fatal result, he said, "Every prospect of pursuing my studies was apparently cut off forever. Should my father be taken away, I must provide for my mother, brothers, and sisters."
               Ere he reached his home, the spirit of the father had taken its upward flight.
               Then he felt that those buoyant hopes which only the day before were cheering his heart had probably gone forever. His studies must be relinquished for the present. Duty clearly called him to remain with his mother, at least for a time.
               And when he returned to school, three weeks later, according to the temporary arrangements of which we have spoken, he was looked upon by many as very cruel, and sharply reproved by one of his kindred for leaving home when his presence and aid were so much needed there. And it may well be questioned whether one in a thousand would be justified in leaving home under similar circumstances for a like purpose. One word from his mother had been enough to induce him to abandon his plans till he had seen her provided for, if not forever.
               
               But she called to mind her loan of him to the Lord, at the time of his birth, for the very work to which he now most ardently aspired, and dared not say that word, dared not take back the offering which she had then laid upon Jehovah's altar.
               On the contrary, she not only gave her consent for him to return to the academy, but for him to go, a little later, to the residence of his uncle, who was then at the head of a college in one of the Middle States, that he might pursue his studies to better advantage, though she would hardly expect to see him again till his course was finished.
               But how could that mother, in this, the time of her sore bereavement and pressing wants, give up the only child that could afford her much relief? He was well calculated, in every respect, to be her solace and support, and, we repeat, all depended upon her word.
               On one side, the ties of nature were strong, her wants were many, and she had very great inducements to say to him, "You must not leave me; your duty is here."
               On the other, were her vows ratified above, and the living proof before her that God had accepted her offering.
               Nature struggled, but grace triumphed; and Mrs. Dawson cast herself upon God, who had hitherto sustained her, and said to this son of her vows, "Go in peace, and. the Lord go with thee."
               The sacrifice was made, and purer, than before was the flame that thenceforth ascended heavenward from that cottage altar.
               Leaving home under such circumstances, amidst the severest censures of some whose opinions ought to have weight with him, it was natural for him to wish for proof, in the handwriting of his mother, that she sanctioned his course.
               In answer to his question, "Do you cheerfully give me up?" she addressed to him the following letter, to which reference has been made:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "April 24, 1820.
                           
                           "MY DEAR SON,â€”Duty and nature have for some time been at variance, but duty has at length gained the victory. It is a trying time with me. You must needs think that it is a great thing for me, in my lonely widowed state, to have you separated from, me.
                           "The ties of nature are strong, and it is impossible for children to feel for parents what parents do for children. But I am sensible that you feel enough for me.
                           "You have searched your heart, you have studied your duty. The first thing you have to do, is to perform it toward God, and, in doing so, you will do your duty to every living creature.
                           "You are cast out into the world at a time when you need to be much on your guard; youth is easily drawn aside; therefore gird on the whole armor of faith, and for a helmet the hope of salvation, whereby you may be able to withstand all the fiery darts of the adversary. Remember the words that your dying father left behind for you, 'Live godly in Christ Jesus.' May it never be said of you that you have left your first love. Let nothing hinder you from daily and fervent prayer; and when you address the throne of grace, remember your mother, brothers, and sisters. The eyes of many are upon you as an instrument in the hand of God to bring souls to Jesus. And let it never be said that you are an apostate. This world is a gloomy place to me; and should I hear that my children follow the ways of sin and iniquity, it would quickly break my heart. All the satisfaction I expect in this life, is to strive to do what shall be most for the glory of God, and to see my children walk in the truth.
                           "I have often viewed the hand of God in taking away your father. Our hearts were firmly united, but I have now one tie less to bind me to earth. I have often, when passing by his grave, said, 'There lies the one who made life dear to me.' I am now about to have you separated from me, and it is with cheerfulness that I give you up. If you can be the means of bringing but one poor heathen to the knowledge of Christ, it will more than recompense me for all the trials I have passed through.
                           "Your father and mother have trodden a most thorny road for nearly twenty years, but the kind hand of our heavenly Father has led us through these briers and thorns. He has seen fit to take my partner first, because he was most fit to go. I must travel this now lonely road a little longer, and then, if I am one of the chosen of God, I shall meet all the happy saints in glory. Sometimes I think I have faith to believe that the promise to the widow and fatherless will be amply fulfilled to me and mine. Give yourself no uneasiness thinking you have gone away against my will, for I cheerfully perform the vow I made in my youth. I give you not up to man, but to God; and as the Lord guards his children, so will he guard you, if you go on to fear him, until you arrive at your journey's end."
                        
                     
                  
               
               The son left home on the 29th of the same month; and as soon after his departure as Mrs. Dawson could command her feelings, she wrote to a distant relative as follows:
               "My oldest son has taken his leave of me, perhaps forever. About two hours since we gave the parting hand and shed the parting tear. He was the one that I have had reason to depend upon for a support, but he has gone for a nobler purpose. I have given him up to God, who is able to open some other door for me. Last evening we had a prayer-meeting on his account. I never witnessed a more solemn scene. Every heart seemed to melt.
               "Now, on one side, I see some relic of my husband, on the other, a book, within which I find a paper written by my son. It was too painful for him to utter what he wished by word of mouth. He has left it for me in writing.
               "My children, one after another, must leave me, though they cling to me and beg to remain. I am obliged to set reason to work instead of giving way to feelings; but had I been told one year ago what I must pass through during that period, I should have said, It is impossible for me to endure it. But strength is promised us equal to our day."
               Thus did this mother, amidst the fresh sorrows of her widowhood, and when she saw it necessary for her family to be scattered, in consequence of the departure of her son, rise above nature, and lay him upon the altar, to be used in the Lord's service to the day of his death. By faith she looked through the impending clouds and believed that God was able to provide. As we look back, after the lapse of many years, we see that both mother and son were called to do as they did; but their line of conduct was so contrary to the ordinary course, that we cannot blame those who censured the one for going from home, and the other for consenting to let him go. They were acting on principle too elevated for the most of their well-meaning neighbors to comprehend.
               In the course of the following autumn, by the earnest request of her kindred, and probably by their aid, Mrs. Dawson once more visited the place of her birth.
               She had been absent fourteen years, and now saw many changes. The visit necessarily called up much that was pleasant, with reference to the past, much that was painful.
               Thence she wrote to her son, exhorting him to persevere in holiness, and saying to him, "Should you and your brothers and sisters prove true disciples of Christ, my comfort would be inexpressibly great, whatever my outward circumstances. '"I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in the truth.'"
               And we may here anticipate enough to say that Mrs. Dawson had a good measure of that comfort of which she speaks, for a number of years before her death. We know not that one of her children ever caused her serious trouble; on the contrary, all but one were members of the church, long before she left them; and for that one, who made a profession of her faith soon after, she had, not without reason, a hope for many years.
               But to return: Mrs. Dawson's father had let her husband have money from time to time, to a considerable amount, and it was her hope, as well as that of her kindred, that his account might be brought against the estate, and collected of it, for her benefit, in addition to what she might otherwise have. But they were doomed to disappointment.
               In speaking of this to her son, she says, "Never was one, who ought to have enough, more completely cut off. But the hand of our heavenly Father is in all these things. Though he slay me, I hope I shall be able to trust in him."
               Soon after the above was written, it became doubtful whether Mr. Dawson had left property enough to meet the claims against his estate; for it was found, when too late to remedy it, that the title to his first purchase, upon which he had made the most improvements, was not good.
               Mary was thus deprived of her "thirds" of what little they supposed they had, excepting the third of a second purchase across the "river," and her interest in that sold for only twenty-five dollars.
               Two cows and a few sheep were all the stock that fell to her share. Such were her circumstances, when she found herself in the sole charge of her family.
               Aside from her very meagre furniture and wearing apparel, the whole could not have been sold in those times for one hundred dollars.
               But, instead of sitting down in despair, in the view of her prospects, she turns, as her custom was, to higher themes, and says, "When I look with an eye of faith to a happy eternity, with the hope and prospects of a joyful resurrection, the trials of this life appear small."
               She not only sought all her comfort, at the feet of Jesus, but sent word to a nephew, who had been serious, that he would never find happiness till he found it there.
               Writing to her son, September 6, 1820, she says, "I think I never saw the importance of religion more than I do now. I long for the advancement of the Redeemer's kingdom, long to join in singing the hallelujahs of heaven. But who am I, that I should think of joining that blessed company?
               "It is time for those who profess to be the followers of the Lamb to be doing as well as professing. If we were as careful to let our light shine as we ought to be, there would be less stupidity among us."
               She then craves his prayers for herself, her other children, for the church of Christ, and for the world.
               Her son having frequently expressed a willingness to return home rather than to have his mother suffer, she wrote to him:
               
               "December 19, 1820.
               "Believe me, I have never been sorry you left me, though your presence and help would have added greatly to my comfort. I hope my views are extended to the glory of God and to the good of immortal souls. I would willingly give up all my children to the service of God, were they old enough, and desirous to engage in so good a work.
               "Persevere in your studies and leave nothing undone that you can do for immortal souls."
               About this time one of Mrs. Dawson's kindred, a widow in good circumstances, wished her to take her youngest daughter and become a member of her family. There the mother and daughter might have had a peaceful and happy home; but this offer, though very desirable in itself, and for those to whom it was extended, she felt constrained to decline, for the sake of her other children. "For their sake," cost her whatever sacrifice it might, she was "resolutely determined" to have a home of her own, to which they could freely come, and occasionally, at least, make one of her family circle.
               After speaking of some pleasant things in the letter to her son of the last date, she says, "You think I do not tell you half my troubles. I have now been telling you my comforts; and the greatest of these is the prospect of a joyful resurrection rection, after which I hope, through the merits of Christ, to join in praising redeeming love forever.
               "I cling too fast to the dust of your father, and have said, if I could have him back by my side, I would quickly do it; but it was a sinful utterance, and I hope to be forgiven!"
               In this letter she speaks also of the sickness of one of her daughters, who, from that time to the present, has been more and more a sufferer, till it seems, to those who know her complication of diseases, almost a miracle that her life has been spared so long.
               It was thus ordered that one child, and of the whole family, the one best qualified for the place, might remain at home.
               As years passed on, mother and daughter each needed the help of the other, till they became so wedded that the death of the one was almost the death of the other. She writes:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "March 8, 1821.
                           
                           "Disappointment is my daily lot, yet I think the promise to the widow and fatherless has, as yet, been made good to me. The fault is all my own, if there is any failure.
                           "Could I believe all that God has promised, I should be happy; but sometimes I feel so unworthy that I dare not apply one of the promises to myself.
                           "At other times I can look beyond these scenes with transport, to the time when I shall get beyond the temptations of Satan and the clogs of sin. Sometimes the perplexities of life almost overwhelm me. I have labored, during the past winter, under great depression of spirits; but my chief hope is beyond this life. I trust that I shall eventually conquer through the blood of the Lamb.
                           "I sometimes think that it is enough to quiet the minds of the poor in this world, to remember that, if they are the children of God, however distressed they are now, by-and-by they shall be clothed in Christ's righteousness and sing the praises of redeeming love forever. And could those, rich in this world's goods only, know the superior prospects of those who are rich in faith, they would not pride themselves in uncertain riches."
                        
                     
                  
               
               Then, after exhorting her son to persevere and to prove faithful, she says, "It is a time of great stupidity here, but I hope that a faithful few mourn over the deadness of the times. The things of eternity ought ever to be first in our minds; we know not when a word may be blessed. Let us endeavor to fill up life in a more useful manner. Let not a moment be misimproved. I think I can trust my heavenly Father, who never did wrong. All things are in his hands. I have been greatly perplexed in times past, but hope to yield a due submission to his will, to whom, if there is any sincerity in my heart, I have committed all. Though often cast down, I sometimes look to those blissful seats in glory, and think that no trial is too great for me to pass through, if I may reach them at last. Though separated from the most of our dearest earthly friends, it is cheering to think that we shall meet one day never to part. "Were it not for this thought, I could not bear these separations. Labor for us and for all at the throne of grace!"
               The time had now come when the place where Mr. and Mrs. Dawson had toiled together for many years, must be sold. Such a course was necessary in order to settle the estate of the deceased. Many circumstances tended to make it dear to the one who survived. They had found it a waste, howling wilderness, but her partner had turned much of it into fruitful fields with his own hands.
               There nine of their children had been born, and thence three of them and their father had been carried to the grave. There she had seen much of joy, much of sorrow; and the latter, even more than the former, binds one to the spot where it is experienced. The very toils and trials through which she had gone in connection with it, made the place doubly dear to her. In view of the sacrifice at which it was sold, she writes, "It often grieves me to see how our place has gone; but all things I hope will work right." She then speaks of a place she had bought in a part or Olney, known as Ashton, about one mile from the meeting-house, and says, "I expect to be obliged to use the most rigid economy, but I do not mind that, as I shall be near meeting and between two excellent neighborhoods." Her life for a year prior to this had been one of great perplexity, and she had often been constrained to say, "Oh, the trials that a widow has to endure!"
               She had made it her frequent prayer that God would select some little spot for her near his chosen flock, and now she hoped that he was answering her prayers, though she felt that it would be hard to leave her old home and the neighborhood which had been rendered peculiarly dear to her by the kindness of the people, especially since she had been a widow.
               When we remember how much she had suffered, and enjoyed too, during the checkered years that Westford had been her home, we cannot wonder that she found it hard to tear herself away.
               We know not that we have ever read or heard of the spot, this side of Bethany, where humble cottage piety was more beautifully exemplified than it had been there, during the time that Robert and Mary sojourned there together. And not even at that rural home, at the foot of Olivet, was the Saviour more welcome than He was among those rocks and hills, where they toiled and prayed and praised the great Creator.
               These things enchained her to the spot.
               On the other hand, when we remember the circumstances under which she had been brought up, close by the house of God and in the full enjoyment of all the means of grace, of which she had now been deprived, in a great measure, for nearly twenty years, while her desire for them continued to increase, it is not to be wondered at, that she was willing to make great sacrifices if she could be "near God's chosen flock."
               Had not the work of grace been very deep and thorough within her, she might, long ere this, have ceased to care for the Lord's house; but instead of that she could say in truth, with her favorite Watts, 
                     
                        "One day amidst the place
                        Where my dear God hath been,
                        Is sweeter than ten thousand days
                        Of pleasurable sin."
                     
                   We know not that she ever lost her desire for the sincere milk of the word or for the strong meat, however long she was deprived of them. She writes to her son, June 19th, 1821: "Let not this world perplex you. Do your duty to your God. He is doing all things well. If we are his children, we shall be provided for."
               
               About this time Mrs. Dawson commenced a journal, extracts from which will occupy more or less of these pages for about eight years, after which it does not appear that she kept one.
               JOURNAL,July 17, 1821. "Here I am, alone day after day, having no earthly friend with whom. I can communicate. What a privilege I enjoy in being permitted to go to Jesus! Yes, my dear Lord, I come as a poor sinner. Wilt thou suffer such an unworthy one to approach thy throne of grace? Blessed be thy name that I have been carried through so many trials. I lament my ingratitude to thee."
               "July 18. This day has been a distressing one to my soul. I fear that God is about to forsake me, so great are my sins. The greatest part of the forenoon I spent in supplication at the throne of grace, that I might be protected from the temptations of the adversary."
               "July 19. Am in some measure relieved from my distress, and cannot help indulging the hope that I am not yet cast off. How lovely it is to be separated from the world when I feel thy presence, dearest Saviour! My life, my all, I dedicate to thee."
               "July 20. How gloomily pass my hours away! My bosom companion can no more hear my tale of sorrow. How tenderly, while with me, did he soothe my anguish! How I cling to his dust! May I be prepared to meet him above."
               "Aug. 7. Blessed Jesus, I cannot express the longing desire I have to glorify thy name. I long to join with some of the dear children of God in speaking of thy glory. How precious are the manifestations of divine love to me, after I have been distressed for days together! In this house my dearest earthly friend breathed his last. The world has been cheerless to me since he departed. Precious is the grave of the saint. May I turn my eyes to Calvary and behold my bleeding Lord. May I melt with love and gratitude to him."
               To illustrate the wife's place at the domestic altar, some one has beautifully said, "When the sun shines the moon disappears, when he sets she appears and shines; so when the husband is at home he leads domestic worship, when he is absent the wife must ever take his place."
               In keeping with this sentiment, when Mrs. Dawson's husband had gone from her, to return no more, she took upon herself the duty of family prayer, and during the long period of her widowhood, maintained morning and evening devotions at her domestic altar. We know not that they were ever omitted when only her own family were around her, though, when gentlemen were her guests, if no one of them could lead in prayer, a sense of propriety might cause her to omit the duty for the time.
               When her sons came to see her, after they had obtained an interest in Christ, they led the devotions of the family; but at other times her children were accustomed to hear her well-known voice in prayer, both morning and evening. She was accustomed also to ask the blessing at table. The last time she sat there, not more than ten hours before her death, the head of the family being from home, she was unwilling to take tea till the divine blessing had been invoked. Being unable to perform this duty herself, she requested her daughter to perform it.
               Fit companion for one who rose from his sickbed, as her husband did three days before his death, that he might once more kneel in prayer with his family. Even in those circumstances, it did not satisfy him to lead their devotions in a reclining posture. So true is it that the ruling passion is strong in death.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               FROM MRS. DAWSON'S REMOVAL TO ASHTON, TO THE END OF HER JOURNAL.
               ONE who afterwards attained to no mean eminence as a Christian scholar says, "I was filled with sublime emotions when I first saw Scofield River."
               He was then probably a child.
               That stream flows through the deep and extended vale which lies to the north of Olney, and is the outlet for the water from vast slopes of land on either side. When we last saw it, it was so low and meager that a little child might wade it without danger.
               It was formerly a much larger stream than it is now, though even at this day, in times of melting snows and heavy rains, it is a swollen torrent.
               From this river to the site of the old meeting house in Olney is about four miles, almost every foot of which is ascending, and a part of the way the angle is very considerable. Far up this hillside there was a little cottage, white in its better days, perched like a nest among the rocks.
               It was a mile from the house of God, to reach which, from the cottage, one must climb the worst part of that hill.
               To this neighborhood, which we call Ashton, Mrs. Dawson thought it was the will of God that she should move, when she left Westford. One field belonging to the cottage near by, afforded pasturage for her cow in summer, and another a supply of hay for it in winter. Upon the latter was a good supply of berries and fruit for a family even larger than her own. Near by was an ever-flowing spring, while through the fields flowed a sparkling mountain-stream on its way to the more distant vale. In its waters the beautiful trout found a home or were drawn forth by the angler's skill to tempt the appetite of an invalid or to give a little variety to the ordinary cottage fare. One part of this stream had been skillfully turned so as to flow near the door of the cottage, and, after supplying, in a measure, domestic wants, and furnishing, in its fall, soothing music by night and by day, flowed on and watered, in time of need, a garden that had been redeemed from the rough fields around. It had thus become fruitful, and in it Mrs. Dawson subsequently spent many beautiful summer mornings. While she toiled there with her hands, she listened to the music of the feathered songsters, or let her thoughts soar upward into the sphere in which angels sing. Many a choice vegetable was afterwards gathered here for family use, the sweeter to those who partook of it because they had toiled for it. Her children gave her such help in it as they could.
               The reader should bear in mind that Mrs. Dawson's life, not only in summer, but at all times, for many years, was one of arduous toil for things essential to life, or he will be likely to look upon her as a person who had much leisure for spiritual things. Even the writer, but for his personal knowledge to the contrary, would now and then be under that impression.
               But to return. It was still a very arduous task to reach the church from this cottage; but, in comparison with her former situation, she felt that it was quite near.
               She moved early in the autumn of 1821, and lived there for seventeen years.
               A light in the northern window of this cottage could be seen, during a dark night, far down the vale, but the influence of the piety cultivated within it extended to a much greater distance. It was not limited by vales or hill-tops. There Jesus was ever welcomed. His absence ever veiled that home in sadness.
               JOURNAL, October 2, 1821. "Am now in my new home, but exceedingly gloomy. Feel unfit for earth or heaven: I love the scenes of my former toil, and miss those neighbors who have shown me great kindness in my tribulation.
               "Farewell, ye companions of my sorrows, ye associates of my first-born. Hours do I spend in meditating upon past scenes."
               Then, writing to her son, October 6, she says, "I think I shall like my little cottage well; but it was trying for me to leave those old scenes. My neighbors had all been very kind, and expressed regret that I should leave them. You speak of being troubled with gloomy feelings. If you have more of them than your mother, I pity you. I have been troubled with them the year past more than ever before, in consequence of living more than usually alone. Only my youngest children are with me." After speaking of the seriousness of two daughters, she says, "How amply is the promise of God fulfilled to me! How many blessings I have! I think I have the greatest cause for gratitude that ever a person had. While I see many around me distressed for a home, I have a comfortable one, and my prospects for the winter are good. Nothing is wanting but a heart to trust in God.
               "Often, when things look dark, some kind hand unseen has supplied my wants; but my happiest moments are in anticipation of the time when I shall drop these clogs of sin, and join in praising redeeming love beyond the grave.
               "I trust I have, again and again, committed you to a covenant-keeping God. Persevere, take every opportunity to warn your young companions ions of the danger of going into eternity unprepared. I often fear that I am not a Christian; but I see nothing in this world to animate me without the love of God in my heart."
               In her best moments Mrs. Dawson was not accustomed to speak with much confidence of her own piety, but usually, when referring to her future prospects, would use some qualifying clause. She is to be judged rather by her life than by her opinions respecting herself.
               JOURNAL, Oct. 17. "I long, my Saviour, for a heart to praise thee continually; but oh these clogs of sin! I desire to be free from them. Lord, I consecrate myself, my children, my all, to thee."
               "Oct. 19. Why do I not trust the promises of Him who has said he will be the widow's God and a Father to the fatherless? O God, save me from distrusting them."
               "Oct. 28. Twenty-five years ago my mother died. Lord, prepare me for the solemn hour when I must go! Have this day been to the house of God. Saw a former companion of my son. What tender emotions did the sight of him awaken! When shall I meet my son again? Perhaps not till I meet him at the bar of God."
               "Oct. 30. A few months since I was distressed lest I should be deprived of a house; but God has provided for me. Still my heart is hard, and I cannot rest till Christ is formed in me anew."
               
               "Nov. 5. Have been once more to the Lord's table, and am much impressed with thoughts of eternity. What horror must lost souls feel when finding themselves in unending woe!"
               "Nov. 10. Can a sincere Christian so easily turn aside from the paths of duty as I do? Yonder is the moon, obedient to its Maker's will, riding in all its beauty. It never deviates, as I do, from the course prescribed for it."
               "Nov. 11, Sabbath evening. Have attended public worship during the day, and this evening have been to a conference meeting. How I long to see Christians engaged and to be engaged myself! May my hope be thoroughly tried; may it not rest on anything short of the rock, Christ Jesus."
               "Sabbath eve, Nov. 18. During the last week I think it has been my earnest desire that God would give me true comfort in believing, or deprive me of all comfort. A female friend and myself have set apart a season, daily, to pray in secret for the outpouring of the Spirit. What a privilege to think that Christ will hear our prayers! Hear, gracious Lord, the petitions that I have been offering to thee this evening, and grant, through the coming week, should my life be spared, that I may be engaged in thy cause. Grant that my children may all devote themselves to thee. May my oldest son enjoy the smiles of his Saviour. Let us meet again on earth, if it be thy will, but especially prepare us to meet in heaven. How many tears I shed at the dead of night when I meditate upon past scenes, especially upon my unfaithfulness to God!"
               In one sentence under the last date, we have the origin of many precious revivals. Two or three of God's humble followers, almost unknown to the world, and most frequently females, are praying for them, and persevering in prayer till God hears and answers. Would that we had more such praying ones, and then our revivals would be more numerous, more extended.
               "Nov. 22. I feel to-day as if I could present a blank to my Saviour, and let him fill it for me. I am willing to die or willing to live, but think that to die would be unspeakable gain."
               "Saturday night, Nov. 24. While all around me were asleep, I commended my children, from the oldest to the youngest, to my gracious Redeemer, and then fell asleep, thinking that if I should not awake in this world I should in glory."
               
                  Dec. Under this date, Mrs. Dawson expresses fear that she should not be able to clothe her family, but is much comforted with the promises of God to the widow and fatherless. Just at this time she received aid, and says, "Thus are my wants again supplied. May I cling more and more to the precious promises. Once I had an earthy companion to whom I could unbosom my mind, but God saw that my affection were too much on him, and took him from me, that He alone might have my heart."
               "Dec. 8. Thanksgiving occurred last week, and I attended public worship, the first time on a similar occasion for twenty years. What a multitude of trials I have passed through during those years! A thorny road has mine been. Am not satisfied with myself, but Christ is precious to me. What a comfort to feel that I am one of his disciples, and that ere long I shall be clothed with a robe of righteousness, and sing redeeming love in heaven."
               "Dec. 9. Attended a conference meeting, which was full, but stupidity reigned throughout."
               "Dec. 13. A female prayer-meeting was appointed for to-day, but, as has been the case three times before, a storm prevented our assembling.
               "I hear that a revival of religion is prevailing in one of the adjoining towns. Oh, that it might spread, and that the world might become interested in Christ! I beg for more evidence that I am born of God."
               To her oldest son:
               "Dec. 16. I am never at a loss what to say to you, though I often think that I dwell too much on the dark side, I like my new home. My neighbors are very kind. I have the privilege of attending meeting every Sabbath, when the weather is suitable, and at this season of the year I can usually ride with some one; yet when I look toward that part of the town where we used to live, I cannot prevent the flowing tears. I think I can meditate with delight upon the precious promises, and often when alone dwell upon that which God made to Abraham, till it seems as if I could hear the same voice saying to me, 'Mary, I will be your God and the God of your children. Leave all your cares with me; be faithful, and you shall receive the promises.'
               "When I review the past, it seems as if there never was one who did so little good as I have done; so little for my family, so little for souls, so little for God!" Why am I permitted to live? Should I ever be admitted to heaven, what a wonder of wonders it would be! I feel my affections more and more weaned from this world, and am not without enjoyment at times, but so often go astray that I have many gloomy hours.
               "Some weeks past, when my mind was lifted in a measure above the world, I adopted a plan which I recommend to you. It is this: present a blank to your heavenly Father, and let him fill it up for you. I felt that I could do it at the time referred to, and ever since; when trials perplex me, I refer to the blank, and all is quiet.
               
               If I am one of God's children, I am satisfied that he will fill it so as to promote my greatest good. We are too apt to think that we put our trust in God when we do not. We should trust Him for all things, the small, as well as the great. We must also take Christ for a whole and complete Saviour, and not think that we are to do a part and leave the rest to God. We must also take the Holy Ghost as our whole comforter.
               "Finally, my son, be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. Press forwards; turn not to the right hand nor to the left. Be not afraid to tell sinners their danger; you know not when a word may touch the heart." Then, speaking of some revivals in progress, she says, "I long to see all engaged," and closes her letter by saying, "We shall meet again, on earth, if our heavenly Father thinks it best; if not, I hope in the realms of light." Thus does the mother strive to comfort her absent son, though her own spirits were often low.
               In the foregoing letter, Mrs. Dawson has spoken of the privilege of attending meeting every Sabbath, and that means, both morning and afternoon, in the part of the country where she lived. It was very rare that one who was present in the morning was absent the other part of the day. In those rural districts few went home during the interval between the services. The good would spend much of it in the Sabbath-school or in prayer meeting. After the close of the second service they would go home, take a late dinner, and then often attend a third meeting in their own or some adjacent neighborhood. Thus was the whole day given to the service and worship of God.
               JOURNAL, Dec. 17, 1821. "Yesterday I attended meeting. The text was, 'What hast thou done?' I must answer for myself, I have done very wickedly. It seems to me as if I never did any good to my family, never any to poor immortal souls. What a black catalogue of sins is set down against me!"
               "Dec. 20. Met a female friend to pray that God would pour out his Spirit. To me it was a pleasant season. We read a portion of Scripture, and three times engaged in prayer."
               "Dec. 21. Am alone. Grant me, Saviour, thy presence. Thou wast nailed to the cross for me. Rude iron tore thy precious feet and hands. The dreadful wrath of God was upon thee when thou didst atone for human guilt. Let me share in the merits of thy death. I desire to lie at thy feet, and to love thee with an eternal love."
               "Dec. 22. My bleeding Saviour has been visibly before my mind. What shall I do for words to express my emotions?"
               
               "Dec. 23. While at the house of God I heard that the revival in a town adjoining us was increased. Joyful news! I long to see all engaged for God.
               "This evening have been to the conference meeting, where the question was asked, whether we could say, as Peter did, 'Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee.' I almost dared to say as Peter did, but am afraid of my evil heart. This I can say, 'Lord, thou knowest that I long to love thee, long to wash thy feet with my tears, long to lean on thy breast with thy beloved disciple, long to be singing hallelujahs above.'"
               "Dec. 25. Is it possible that one so sinful loves the Lord Jesus? Yes, my Redeemer, I do love thee better than any earthly object. How can human beings rest till they feel thy love? For sinners, O Saviour, didst thou die, and thou requirest from them nothing in return but faith and love.
               "To-day my joy in Christ has been almost overpowering. Are these delightful thoughts from Satan? They cannot be."
               "Dec. 26. While about the duties of the morning, my heart was praising God, to whom I dedicated myself anew, beseeching Him, with prayers and tears, to enable me to do faithfully what I can, and leave results with Him."
               "Dec. 27. Again two of us met for prayer. I grieve that no more are interested. We read the Scriptures and offered four prayers. It was a delightful season."
               "Dec. 28. How precious have been my meditations in the night-watches! Last night, when all about me were asleep, my Saviour appeared very precious, and in the morning my affections were more and more toward Him.
               "A friend has presented me a cloak, which my little girls can wear to meeting in turn. Kindness draws tears of gratitude from my eyes. Lord, repay with thine everlasting kindness those that befriend me."
               "Jan. 14, 1822. I have once more been permitted to see my eldest brother, and to hear him preach. Once more have we parted, to meet perhaps no more on earth. Farewell, my dear brother, farewell."
               "Jan. 15. My mind is much occupied about the heathen. I long to have all my children engaged in Christ's cause, and, if it be his will, to have them all missionaries. Lord, help me to commit them to thee and to plead with thee that thine image may be placed upon their hearts. Oh that the children of all my brothers might be engaged in the cause of Christâ€”that all the world might be interested in Him.
               "Jan. 26. During the past week I have spent some time in a neighboring town where God is pouring out his Spirit; but, neglecting duty, I have incurred his displeasure. Have mercy upon me, O Lord, thou son of David."
               "Jan. 30. I am beginning to fear that by-and-by I shall have nothing for my little children to eat or wear; but, O God, let me never distrust thy faithfulness. I beseech thee, in behalf of all widows and fatherless children, that they may trust in thee."
               "Jan. 31. I desire to take my place in the dust, and there plead for mercy upon me and mine, till Jesus bids me rise, and says to me, 'Daughter, thou art mine.' Have enjoyed another precious season with my female friend."
               "Feb. 1. My heart is most tenderly affected on account of my fatherless offspring. It appears to me that they will soon be motherless too."
               "Feb. 2. Still distressed about my children. It seems impossible to keep them with me. Satan gets the advantage of me."
               "Sabbath, Feb. 3. Heard the Rev. Mr. â€”â€” preach, but cannot love his principles. His preaching did not seem profitable to me." (The minister here referred to was developing Unitarian sentiments at this time.)
               "How I long to clasp my son in my arms! but perhaps we shall meet no more on earth. If we can meet in glory, our earthly trials will appear light. One view of heaven, connected with the thought that it is forever ours, will a thousand times pay us for them all."
               "Feb. 6. Was kept awake, by night, with anxiety for the temporal comfort of my children, whom I committed to God, at the midnight hour, with prayers and tears, after which my mind became composed and I slept."
               Similar statements are frequent while her children were small. In Mrs. Dawson's circumstances, it required no ordinary faith to lift her above her anxieties and her fears.
               "Sabbath, Feb. 24. Sweet is the return of holy time. For eighteen years I was in a great measure deprived of the privilege of going to the house of God. Now I can go every Sabbath, if the weather permit."
               After complaining of her coldness, she says:
               "Feb. 26. My Saviour smiles again. Did thoughtless sinners know how precious these smiles are, they would quickly forsake their vain delights. 'I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.' I long to be singing hallelujahs above."
               When a person came to take her youngest son to live with him, she says:
               "Feb. 27. And must that child leave me to live at a distance from me? May God's guardian dian care be over him and the love of Christ be in his heart. May he be taught to pray to that God whom his parents chose as theirs.
               "I hear of a number of ministers becoming Unitarians, who were once engaged in the cause of Christ. May I cling fast to my suffering Saviour and be a firm believer in the one God in three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit."
               "March 2. Lay awake much of the night, and felt an unusual anxiety for some dear friends who do not appear to believe in Christ. My soul went forth in prayer for them, and for my children who must soon leave me.
               "May those who have the care of them be kind to them, and be the disciples of Him who took little children in his arms and blessed them."
               "Sacramental Sabbath, March 3. Had a most excellent discourse on the doctrine of the Trinity."
               "March 6. Am yet greatly tried about my little ones. For them to be separated from me, in their tender years, wounds my heart. Should they be treated unkindly, it would bring me, in sorrow, to the grave.
               "Heavenly Father, accept these little ones for thine own. Command thine angels to protect them. May Christ be their Saviour and the Holy Spirit their sanctifier.
               "As long as I live may I pray for them, and when these eyes can no longer weep for them, when this breath can no longer be spent in prayer for them, may I be praising God in glory. Why is it that I am so loath to leave my little ones with my heavenly Father?
               "Sometimes I am ready to ask, Why was I left a widow? Why could not my partner have been spared, that we together might bring up our children?
               "But hushed be every murmuring thought. At Jesus' feet I lay me down, and to him give up my children, my life, my all."
               To her son she writes, March 17, 1822: "I often feel as if I was separated from my dear friends because unworthy to be with them; but, if we are the children of God, the separation will be short."
               Then, after speaking of the defection of some to the Unitarian error, she says, "I love to hear preached the humbling doctrines of the cross, the full and complete atonement made by Christ, and the one God in three persons.
               "I love to find myself at the feet of Jesus, but stray so often, that coldness and dullness creep into my heart and thrust my Saviour out; but sometimes my faith is so great, that I think I shall never more have an anxious thought. I need the power of God to keep me. Am so prone to sin, my faith is so weak, and my love so cold, that I often fear my name is not in the Book of Life. I am a poor creature everywhere but at the feet of Jesus,â€”and there too, without his smile. Where is that sweet consolation which I have felt in times past, when I have meditated on the promises till I have felt that I could leave every concern, for time and for eternity, with my heavenly Father?"
               After being detained from the house of God two Sabbaths by ill health, she writes, when permitted to visit it again:
               "March 22. How sweetly did my soul go forth after my Saviour! It seemed to me, as the minister described the feelings of God's chosen ones, that those feelings were mine. I was sorry to have the meeting close. 'O God, my soul longeth, yea, even thirsteth for thee.' Blessed Jesus, set thy seal upon me, and grant me not my portion here. I long to praise thee in glory. Make me perfect as my Father in heaven is perfect, that I may forever adore thee. Was not thy precious blood shed for me?"
               "March 25. Dear Lord, with the light of this beautiful morning may my soul ascend to thee. Be with me this week, that, whether I live or die, I may be with thee. Have visited a sick neighbor. Asked him if he was reconciled to the will of God. Gracious Father, help me to improve the time of health in preparing for eternity."
               "March 26, Morning. I long to see the cause of Christ prospering. None but Christ, none but Christ for me.
               "Evening. All with me are asleep. The Keeper of Israel never slumbers nor sleeps. I pray for a proper idea of prayer, and fear that many who profess to pray do not know what prayer is."
               "April 7. Unable to sleep, I arose a little past midnight. Spent a little time in reading and prayer, committing all my earthly concerns to Him who careth for me, then strove to go on with my daily duties. Fear I shall not be able to provide for my family."
               "April 14. Am detained from the house of God by the weather. How disappointed I feel! Sometimes it seems as if I could live and die there; but God is everywhere with his children."
               "April 19. My health is poor, and my mind gloomy. O God, give thy poor broken-hearted child one little drop of consolation."
               Speaking of the religious state of the town, Mrs. Dawson says, "The times are dark. My Christian brethren, where are you? Do you mourn in secret? No public prayer is offered in this neighborhood. There is no conference-meeting here. If I have no love for my Saviour, why does this state of things grieve me"
               "April 24. Have conversed with a person or two, away from home, upon the subject of religion. How sweet are the moments thus spent! Five deaths have been announced to me. It is time for me to see if I am fit for heaven."
               To her son:
               "April 29, 1822. It is two years since we parted. If we both live to the end of your college course [when he left home he did not expect to return before], I shall expect a visit from you; but all things are uncertain.
               "Only the heavenly inheritance is worthy of our anxious care.
               "I see little here to animate me, but can sometimes look beyond this life with a lively hope."
               In this letter, as her custom was, Mrs. Dawson speaks of the state of religion in the place of her residence and in the towns around, rejoicing when it flourished, and mourning when it declined.
               JOURNAL, May 6. "A dear brother, whom I never expect to see again in this world, has been to make me a visit. My neighbors are very kind. They often supply my wants when company comes unexpectedly."
               "May 7. Four of us observed the monthly concert for prayer."
               Mrs. Dawson thought that piety must be at a very low ebb in a church when that concert was omitted, and on one occasion, when it had been suspended for a time, interceded with her pastor to reappoint it, endeavored to get others to intercede with him, and then requested him to appoint one at her own cottage.
               "May 10. Our female prayer-meeting has increased to five, each one of whom offered prayer. Lord, increase my faith, increase my love."
               "May 16. When the hour for our female prayer-meeting came, no one appeared; but just at night my particular female friend came, and we united in prayer.
               "I long to see another reformation. I often look back, and say, as Job did, 'O that I were as in months past!' when my children were about me, when my partner was with me, and we conversed together about the things of eternity, prayed together, and rejoiced or mourned as circumstances required. Together we instructed our children in the things of the kingdom. Now they are without a father's care; but God is their father and protector.
               "May 28. Have again been called to the house of mourning. The oldest daughter of a late brother-in-law is no more. She died in the confident expectation of meeting her Lord and Saviour in the realms of glory."
               About this time Mrs. Dawson's son removed his relation to a college much nearer her than the one at which he had been, and, in reply to a letter from him, she wrote to him on the 1st of June.
               As her oldest child, and the only one that could enter fully into her trials and joys, the most of her letters were directed to him for some years. Her other children were younger, without Christian experience, and so near her that several of them usually met her on the Sabbath, at the house of God.
               As years rolled on, and they matured, and went from her more and more, her letters were divided among them; though she ever found peculiar delight in unbosoming her mind to her first-born, who had been in a peculiar sense the companion of her sorrows.
               In this letter, she speaks of a powerful revival in an adjoining town, in which many of their kindred lived, several of whom were personally interested in it, and of one, still more powerful, in another direction, during which the people almost abandoned labor for a time.
               Westford was also blessed with a similar work of grace; and the writer tells her son that many of his old companions were either under conviction or had been brought to Christ.
               JOURNAL, June 5. "Found myself nearly out of some things necessary for the support of my family; but toward night the very articles were sent me. What reason I have to recognize the hand of God and still present my blank for him to fill!"
               "June 12. Am appointed teacher of one of the first classes in the Sabbath-school; but how unfit for the office! Lord, make me faithful. Teach me that I may rightly instruct my class. My soul goeth forth in longings after God. I would love my Saviour unto perfection.
               "June 13. My sins appear so great, this morning, that I shall certainly sink unless Jesus stretch forth his arm and save me."
               In the afternoon Mrs. Dawson and her particular female friend met for prayer. She says, "We read over the covenant adopted by the Church, and repeatedly addressed the throne of grace; but my sins have crucified my Saviour. They appear like mountains; but the blood of Christ is sufficient to remove them, and he bids me come to him.
               "Satan says to me, 'You are too vile to go;' but Christ says, 'I have received as vile as you. Come unto me.' My heart is hard; but Christ says, 'I will give you a new heart.'
               "Satan says to me, 'You are a hypocrite.' Christ says,'I will take away your hypocrisy, and make you sincere.' Satan says, 'You are proud, and will not go.' Christ says, 'Come, and I will give you a heart that will not harbor pride.'
               
               "Satan says, 'You are an unbeliever, though you profess to be a believer.' Satan, I must tell thee to get behind me; Christ is my Alpha and Omega."
               "Sabbath, June 16. Have been permitted to attend public worship. At noon met my Sabbath-school class, and questioned them about the birth and death of Christ. Ascertained also the state of their minds. Oh that God would enable me to be faithful!"
               "June 20. A church fast, and as a church we have renewed our covenant engagements to be the Lord's. A solemn day."
               "June 22. The early part of last night slept but little; was greatly distressed for my soul. By prayers and tears I sought the Lord, and could not find him.
               "To-day I strive and pray to find my Saviour; but my sins have driven him from me."
               "July 2. For a number of days I have had my fears respecting my future state, but now I have a glimpse of glory, and feel, as Watts expresses it, that 
                     
                        "'My name is printed on his breast,
                        His book of life contains my name;
                        I'd rather have it there impressed
                        Than in the bright records of fame.'"
                     
                  
               
               As Mrs. Dawson has spoken, in one of the above extracts, of her appointment as a Sabbath-school teacher, this seems to be the place to introduce troduce the substance of a letter from a former pupil, addressed to the compiler:
               "I take the liberty of addressing you on a subject of deep interest to myself. The now sainted Mrs. Dawson was my Sabbath-school teacher in my youthful years. She ever had a large place in my affections because of her faithfulness in that capacity. She was not satisfied simply to hear her pupils recite their lessons, but endeavored by special effort, by individual, private conversation and urgent pleading, to persuade each one to seek Christ without delay. Doubtless she carried her charge to the mercy-seat in humble, persevering prayer. Often would conscience urge the truth of her instructions upon the wayward, and when some left [home] to enjoy the heavenly teachings of Miss Lyon, and were subjects of a work of grace in her school, the heart of our Sabbath-school teacher 'rejoiced with exceeding joy.' She was ever ready to assist such onward in their Christian course. May her example lead other teachers to greater faithfulness in personal effort for the salvation of souls committed to their care."
               To her son:
               "July 5, 1822. I have been hesitating about writing to you, because I know not how to pay the postage, and I know that every cent is valuable able to you." In such straitened circumstances were both mother and son.
               The former continues, "Your vacation is near, and I know not how to have it pass without seeing my long-absent son. Yet I am willing to use reason. Stay if you can get into any employment that will profit you. If not, come and give joy once more to your mother and gladden the hearts of your old companions. The reformation increases. God is sealing his own, and the happy day is fast advancing when all shall know the Lord."
               JOURNAL, July 8. "Again have I been to the table of my dying Lord. Ten persons made a profession of their faith in Christ.
               "Since the last Sabbath, one of my Sabbath-school scholars has obtained a hope in Christ, another is under deep conviction, and a general seriousness seems to be among them."
               "July 31. I think widows are the most solitary persons in the world. They have the strongest reason to rely upon the promises. How often is my heart, as it is this day, ready to burst with grief! No friend is nigh to whom I can tell my sorrows. But God counts every tear. Perhaps the angels also are near me. I long to be free from sin, and to sing the praises of redeeming love.
               "At times my sins are set before me in their blackest hue, and I should sink but for my Saviour. How precious his love appears!"
               "Aug 1. How can those who profess to be the friends of God, harbor ill will toward each other? How delightful this world would be if all did their duty!
               "I think I hunger and thirst after righteousness. Looking upon the garments that cover my body, often do I say, Christ has a robe for me that will never be old. The more it is worn, the more it will shine.
               "With reference to him, I think I can say, 
                     
                        'I shall behold thy blissful face,
                        And stand complete in righteousness.'"
                     
                  
               
               
                  Sept. 2. After alluding to her difficulties in providing for her family, for which she had to toil daily and constantly, she says, "Oh, ye mothers whose husbands are alive to comfort you, and to provide for your children, little do ye know the sorrows which I endure."
               "Sept. 5. Again two of us have enjoyed a season of prayer. Did my sisters in Christ know the sweetness of these seasons, they would not be so backward."
               Mrs. Dawson's son at college had encouraged her to expect a visit from him during the summer vacation, and she was much elated with the thought of seeing him once more; but, when the time came, he felt obliged to disappoint her. Several years had passed since she had seen him; and it was a very heavy blow to her.
               
               She gave utterance to her anguish almost as if he were dead. "No more, my beloved son, will animation cheer my drooping spirits. No more shall I look out to see you approach my humble dwelling. No more shall I, in fond anticipation, clasp you in my arms."
               Then she adds, "But perhaps we shall meet again on earth: if not, may we, at the right hand of God."
               To the same:
               "Sept. 28. It is impossible for me to tell you how disappointed I was in not seeing you, though I was glad you had an opportunity to take a school.
               "Since the death of your father I have never had anything to animate me till I thought of your coming home; but all things are ordered by the Most High, and I trust will work for the best.
               "I am often in darkness, and this hard heart causes me sorrow; but one hour at the feet of Jesus affords more satisfaction than all the treasures of this world.
               "When I am in want, I have no earthly friend to ask 'what shall I do for this or that.' May this lead me to Jesus with all my complaints.
               "Oh that I had faith! In all your addresses to the throne of grace, remember your mother, who never forgets you.
               "We shall eventually meet, I hope, in the happy land, where we shall be permitted to recount the scenes of earth and meet those worthies who have lived and died in Christ before us. This thought almost makes me wish to leave the body; but, when I look within, and see what a sinner I am, my spirits sink, and I fear that land is not for me."
               JOURNAL, Sabbath, Nov. 9. "Returning from meeting, my mind ran upon the glories of heaven. I longed to join those already there. My prayer was, 'Father, may I be with thee where thou art. Not that I desire to be taken out of the world now; but I pray thee to keep me from the evils that are in it. Let me enjoy the influences of thy Holy Spirit and the society of thy children.'
               "I have recently visited the place where my husband and myself passed the greater part of our married life, where he toiled and died. I went to his grave."
               "Dec. 5. Thanksgiving Day. Have been to the house of God. Heard an excellent discourse, in which we were urged to aid missions, the Bible society, and other kindred institutions. I said to myself, I am poor; O God, thou knowest that I long to have something to give, but I have nothing except my children.
               "One I have given to thee; and I pray thee to hear the vow which I now make. It is this: if my other children shall be called to enter the public service of Christ, I will, in the strength of the Lord, give them up. They are thine by preservation; make them thine by thy renewing and sanctifying grace. Set thy seal upon them."
               "Sabbath, Dec. 8. Have been again to the house of God. How sweet a place is that to me! A few females spent a part of the time between morning and afternoon service, at a private house, in prayer."
               In the course of this month Mrs. Dawson was permitted to see her son once more, after an absence of two years and a half. It was a most joyful meeting.
               JOURNAL, Dec. 26. "Last evening my children were all around me, but their father's seat was vacant. We had not all been together before for nearly three years. How pleasantly yet solemnly did the evening pass!"
               "Dec. 30. My dear son has left me again. I commit him to God, to whom I long since dedicated him.
               "The kindness of the people here toward him calls for my warmest gratitude. May God reward them by the renewed tokens of his love."
               "Jan. 5, 1823. It is three years since the death of my husband, and I find myself as sincere a mourner for him as I was the day that death parted us. Think I shall never lay aside the garments of my widowhood. Though the Sabbath bath and sacramental day, I am kept at home by the state of the weather. Parent of mercies, be with me. Blessed Spirit, take up thine abode in my heart."
               "Jan. 7. Since the death of my husband the things of the world have never animated me. Lord, give me some spiritual animation. Cheer me with the well-grounded hope of a joyful resurrection. Have mercy on me. O Lord, thou son of David, have mercy on my children, have mercy on this town."
               Mrs. Dawson's only sister was married late in life; and to her and her husband she wrote:
               "Feb. 1, 1823. How gloomy and solitary is a widow's life! It is a heavy burden, too, to have a large family around me, and no one to look to for aid."
               After speaking upon the subject of religion, and urging them to be faithful to their friends as they met, she says, "When you sit pleasantly together, remember your disconsolate sister, and do not forget that you must part. I am much given to depression of spirits, to which I was for the most part a stranger till I was left alone.
               "I feel like a poor beggar seeking protection for myself and children who are cast out upon the world without a father."
               JOURNAL, May 18. "My youngest daughter has gone to live away from me for the present. I feel her departure deeply. May God be her God and send some guardian angel with her."
               "May 27. My youngest son, too, has gone from me. It makes my heart sink to part with my two children. The hope of dwelling with them in heaven, alone cheers me under such trials. I commit them to Him who took little children in his arms and blessed them."
               "May 30. Have been to the house of God. The text was, 'If then I be a father, where is mine honor?' O God, I have not given thee the honor due to thy name. I plead guilty before thee. Grant me a heart that will trust wholly in thee, a heart that will enable me to commit the dear children, now away from me, entirely to thee.
               "Thou canst give them favor in the eyes of those with whom they live. Thou wilt perform thy precious promises; therefore I leave my fatherless children with thee, hoping and praying that I may ever leave them there. I still present my blank."
               In the part of the country where Mrs. Dawson lived, it was the custom of pious students, when at home during their vacations, to visit much from house to house, talk with the people upon the subject of personal piety, pray with them, and attend such neighborhood meetings as they could.
               But, though her son acted in accordance with that custom during the visit of which we have spoken, some casual remark of his, awakened the ever-watchful and anxious mother's apprehensions that he was tending to infidelity.
               Not being aware of having awakened such a fear, he did not take any pains to remove it, and, being very much engaged in study, he did not write so soon as he should after he returned to college. This silence increased her fears that all was not right, and led her to address him as follows:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "April 5, 1823.
                           
                           "I must tell you that my mind never was so distressed for you as it was for two weeks after you left home. It was for fear that you would be an infidel. I could do little but go to the feet of Jesus and plead for you. I cannot tell you how many times a day I cast my eyes toward heaven, and said, O God, protect my son from infidelity! Your letter to your sister did not satisfy me.
                           "My son, come out from among unbelievers; separate yourself from infidels; go to the feet of Jesus. I treasured up every word you dropped while here, and the only reason I have not written you before, was the hope of a letter from you clearing away all doubt. But a double weight falls upon me.
                           "Woe to me that I am a mother, if that son whom I expected to advance the cause of Christ, should be an infidel! Let no studies keep you from going often to God in prayer. All the comfort I have is, that your heart is in his hands."
                        
                     
                  
               
               Whether her fears were excited with cause, or without, these extracts show that she was tenderly alive to the best interests of her son, and that her soul was in anguish lest he should make shipwreck of the faith, and inflict a deep wound upon that sacred cause to which she had devoted him.
               JOURNAL, April 6. "My health, for the past few days has been very poor. O God, be my comforter, bear me up, keep me from the power of temptations. Let me not murmur, though bowed down with sorrows."
               "April 11. Through the goodness of our heavenly Father, I am restored to my usual health.
               "I think I can say, my soul goeth forth in longings after God. I desire to see every one engaged in the cause of Christ. Am distressed for the Church here. Oh that the Holy Spirit might come even unto us!"
               "April 20. As I was coming from church, alone, I endeavored to take my children, one by one, in the arms of faith, and carry them to the Saviour, beseeching him to bless them, and to keep them from infidelity."
               "April 28. A letter from my oldest son informs me that he still leans on Jesus."
               "May 2. Have been to our preparatory lecture. O God, wilt thou ever again visit us with thy Spirit? 
                     'Return, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove.'"
                  
               
               "May 3. My mind is weak, my spirits dejected. Am constantly distressed for one child or another, and find no relief but in going to Jesus for them; and even then unbelief creeps in, till I am ready to doubt his precious promises."
               "May 11. How great are God's mercies toward me! Surely he is a prayer-hearing God."
               She writes to her son, June 1, 1823:
               "That I have been greatly distressed for you, is true; and one reason is, the weakness of my faith. My mind is weakened by tribulation, and every trifle, when my children are in danger, distresses me. God removed your father that I might lean on him, and I hope I have learned, that, although I have given you up to God, I must go to him, daily, on your account. The children of God must watch, as well as pray, do, as well as profess.
               "Satan takes every method to deceive, if it were possible, the very elect; but those who are created anew in Christ Jesus will never be given up to him. It is a great thing, my son, to be a Christian. At times, it seems as if I could see the Saviour pleading with sinners to come to him.
               "I long to have pride taken from me, and to feel more and more my dependence on Him who holds me fast. I long to see all seeking an interest in Christ. I think the time will come in this world, when it will be seen who the true worshipers of God are; and perhaps the development of Unitarianism is to separate the true Christian from the hypocrite. My heavenly Father is ever kind."
               JOURNAL, June 15. "My pastor has given me a Bible. Precious book, be thou my guide to the New Jerusalem!
               "Other friends are constantly supplying my wants.
               "O God, thou hast heard my prayers for my family, now hear them for the Church in this place!"
               
                  June 27. All mourners seem like brothers and sisters to me. The son of our pastor has been drowned."
               
                  Sabbath, June 29. Our pastor, in his afflictions, dwelt upon the importance of being ready for death."
               
                  Sabbath, July 6. Enjoyed some enlivening views of heaven at the Lord's table. What a sweet place is the house of God, at times, to me!"
               To her oldest son, July 29:
               "Am not distressed at present about your being an infidel; but we must daily look to God to hold us fast. Am ever glad to hear from you, and should have written you long ago, but for the want of paper." So great were her straits.
               
                  August 6. Have just returned from the annual meeting of our female benevolent society. It hurts my feelings to see one after another pay their fee, while I have nothing to pay with; but some friends paid mine and made me a member."
               About this time, her friends presented her "a great many necessary articles," and their kindness made so deep an impression upon her that she says, "The mercies of God to me are so great, that I am lost in astonishment."
               Although, during this period, she had to walk one mile, most of the way up a very steep hill, in order to reach the house of God, she was almost always there,â€”if any one was,â€”whatever the weather. Her example in this respect was a living epistle, known and read of all; and yet for some time she had but a single dress, in which she managed to appear neat on the Sabbath, after she had worn it during the week.
               Her desire to be in the house of God as often as the Sabbath returned was so great, that she would, as far as possible, surmount every obstacle that lay in her way; and thus she administered a silent rebuke to the multitudes who, with a full wardrobe, a home fast by the church, or a carriage at hand to take them to it, are often absent.
               Yet, in the midst of these accumulating embarrassments, when she had only a single dress for the week and the Sabbath, when she could not write to her son for the want of paper, and knew not how to pay her postage, or a small admission-fee to a benevolent society, she viewed the mercies of God to her with amazement.
               She was ever disposed to be thankful for such favors as she received, rather than to murmur that she received no more, though her wants were many and pressing. So true is it, that one whose heart is rightly affected, will find cause for thanksgiving, though much remains to be supplied.
               To her son:
               
                  August 8. We must remember the signal mercies of God to us from time to time, and still wait on him.
               "He will be gracious; not one of his chosen will fail of heaven. Let us strive to be of that happy number. Stupid as I am, I cannot but look forward to the time when these vile bodies shall be clothed with the righteousness of Christ.
                     
                        ''Midst flaming worlds, with that arrayed,
                        With joy shall we lift up our heads.'
                     
                  
               
               "The true Christian, leaning upon the Saviour and clinging to his promises, need not fear the judgment-day. But let us examine ourselves, lest we be found wanting.
               "I have not felt so distressed for you, of late, as I did last winter, when Satan almost gained the victory over me.
               "With reference to my children, I find no way but to take you, one by one, in the arms of faith to Jesus; but, that being done, I feel an humble assurance that he will keep what I commit to him.
               "How thankful we ought to be that you live in such a glorious day! I hope your feet will stand on Calvary, and that you will tread the streets which the Saviour trod in the days of his humiliation."
               The last sentence has reference to her son's cherished purpose to be a missionary in foreign lands. Instead of holding him back and trying to convince him that he ought not to go, she not only urged him forward, but remarked, when she had no money for the cause of missions, that she would "put her four sons into the box."
               She referred to the manner in which their missionary collections were taken up.
               With what degree of faith she thus, figuratively tively, gave them to the Lord, subsequent years will show.
               JOURNAL, August 6. "It is twenty-two years since my oldest son was born. How great my trials, bow rich my mercies, since! May he be the means of turning many from darkness to light!
               "I have nothing to offer to the Lord but my children, whom I desire to dedicate anew to him. May their days be spent in his service!"
               
                  October 5. Of late, have been comforted in carrying my children to God in prayer. Think I have faith to believe that they will all be brought to Christ."
               Mrs. Dawson was ever unwilling to be in debt, and, to avoid it as much as possible, would go without an article, though necessary, as long as she could, when she had not the money to pay for it. Hence, when she "wanted two sheets of paper" to write to her absent son, she would confine herself to a part of one, if she had it, rather than go in debt for more.
               She was yet owing a little for her home, and wished to have that entire debt canceled.
               She alludes to this:
               
                  October 12, 1823. The time is approaching when I must pay for my place. I am tired of having my note on interest.... A widow's life is made up of trials."
               But, amidst all her trials and wants, no one ever lost by her. Sooner or later she paid every debt. Her religion would not allow her to buy that for which she had not a reasonable prospect of paying.
               JOURNAL, October 19. "Have been to see my youngest daughter, from whom I have been separated seven months. My prayers for this child have been answered."
               
                  Thanksgiving Day, November 20. Morning. The sun has risen in brightness, and, so far as I know, my family are in health. I am permitted to live, while in sight is a house where the mother of a large family of children is attired for the grave.
               "But how soon may the clearest sky be overcast!
               "At ten o'clock, a man called and said, 'Your son is in town: he arrived last night, and is not well.' Struck dumb, as it were, I inquired no further."
               Soon the friend who accompanied her son from college called, and, in answer to her inquiries, she found that he had been very sick, that he was then in a critical state, that they had reached town the night before, but had stopped at the house of a friend, lest the shock should be too great for her.
               As soon as possible, the mother was by his side, and the following day he was removed to her house. "This affliction," she says, "has come upon me as a chastisement for my neglect of most solemn vows."
               It was not till the 29th of the following month that her son was able to return to college, when the mother records the goodness of God in his restoration, and says, "How grateful I ought to be to my heavenly Father for his mercies! May I live more and more to his glory."
               She also gave her son a few rules to guide him with reference to his health, studies, and soul.
               In the paper which contained them, she says, "Your sickness has sorely afflicted me. Gladly would I have borne it for you. Had it not been for the supporting hand of my heavenly Father, I should long since have sunk under my trials. This life has no charms for me; and feeling, in a measure, friendless, so far as relates to this world, I am led the more to search my heart to see if Jesus is my friend.
               "At times I am enabled to believe that I shall meet all my children in heaven. Go, my son, to Jesus with every trouble, and by divine aid I will daily commit you to him. When we have done that, let us rest assured that all will be well, whether we meet again or not."
               JOURNAL, January 19, 1824. "My happiest moments are when I am most humble and can pour out my soul in secret prayer. All the rest I enjoy in regard to my children is in committing them to Jesus. To him I must daily carry them."
               To her son:
               
                  February 14, 1824. I love the society of Christians and of my children; but there are times when the blissful presence of my Saviour is better than either. At times I love to be alone. One is more free then, if in trouble, to go to Jesus for consolation.
               "When I think what privileges a true Christian has over one who is not, I sigh for brighter evidences that I am a child of God. How many stumble over a hope into hell!
               "And must I, who cannot endure the least jar, murmuring, disputing, repining, or complaining, must I be cast into hell with all those who forget God? Must I, who long to feel the love of my Saviour, more than I ever longed for the treasures of this world, blaspheme him forever? It cannot be. If I truly love him, I shall surely dwell with him in the realms of glory.
               "I was greatly refreshed, a few days since, by a line from you, though I have not felt that distress for you, since you left home last, that I did one year ago. Cleave more and more to the Saviour."
               
               Referring to his sickness, and to other trials through which he had passed, in which he ever had his mother's tenderest sympathies, she says, "While the Lord afflicted with one hand, he sustained with the other. It was a number of days before I could carry my complaints to Jesus; but at length I thought I could say, 'Lord, hear my prayer that goeth not out of feigned lips.'
               "The greatest comfort I have is in going daily to God for each of my children separately.
               
               "View yourself as in a narrow way, with enemies on either side, pointing their arrows at you, while the meek and lowly Jesus beckons you on between them, saying, 'Lean on me, and the enemy shall not harm you.' Look to the Saviour, and you need not fear.
               "I have told you how trifles affect me, if they relate to my children. Sometimes they drive sleep from me by night, and cause me to walk the floor in anguish by day. But this is the weakness of a mother who has too often anchored her hopes to the things of earth. When she has thought all was safe, some boisterous wave has parted the cable and left her to be tossed upon the tempestuous deep. Then faith takes hold of another cable, made fast to an anchor within the veil, and all is peace."
               JOURNAL, February 28. "Have been very little inclined to mingle with the world for a number of months. There is so little said about the concerns of the soul, even among Christians, that I fear the time spent in visiting among them is lost.
               "When alone, I feel the presence of God. Then I look to heaven, and say, Father, if it be thy will, once more visit our church; once more pour out thy Holy Spirit upon us. Bring our dear youth into the fold. I long for the society of thy saints, and mourn the stupidity of the times."
               
                  March 1. A little company of females met for prayer. Had a precious season. It is long since we have been permitted to pour out our souls together."
               
                  April 16. Our minister is afflicted. Have been to see him; and, as the Lord has seen fit to smite the shepherd, I pray that the sheep may not be scattered.
               "O God, keep me from sinning against thee, in thought, word, or deed! When I think of my Saviour's sufferings for me, my tears flow."
               
                  Sabbath, April 18. Have no words adequate to express the preciousness of Christ to me. I pray thee, O Father, in the name of Christ, show us wherein we have grieved thy Spirit!"
               
                  April 20. After complaining of her own coldness, she expresses an earnest desire for the prosperity of the Church, and says, "O my fellow travelers to eternity, think of death, of the pains of hell, of the agonies that Christ endured to purchase heaven for you! See the blood flowing from his hands, his feet, his side, and hear him cry, while bleeding on the cross, 'Father, forgive them!'
               "And, fellow-professors, where are you? Are you mourning in secret, and wrestling with God for a reformation? Why not entreat sinners to attend to their eternal peace?"
               To her son:
               
                  April 28. It is with grief that I find you have been sick again. Perhaps you did not render unto God the glory due to his name for raising you up from your former sickness. Your restoration called for profound gratitude; but our heavenly Father, seeing that you were not humble enough, laid his hand upon you a second time; and yet you intimate a want of love to him, and complain that prayer is a burden. The disease of your soul pains me far more than that of your body.
               "You say you long for the smiles of your Saviour. That is hopeful. Strive to be more and more like him, and I trust that the little spark within you will be fanned to a flame. God can clear the darkest sky."
               Three days later she writes, "It is a most beautiful morning. I have just returned from my garden. It is a sweet place for meditation. It was in a garden that Adam was placed when he came pure and holy from the hands of his Maker. It was in a garden that our Saviour poured out his soul in prayer, and in a garden was the sepulcher in which he was laid. Why should it not be a sweet place for meditation? I long to live near God; but where am I? It grieves me that the son whom I have dedicated to God should complain of so much coldness. If you have any enjoyment in religion, let me know it, that I may have something to cheer my spirits.
               "I often feel perplexed about one child or another; but the sorrows of a widowed mother's heart are known only to God."
               To the same:
               
                  October 2. You are the only person on earth to whom I can open my mind with freedom; and if you knew the feelings of my heart you would write one line and tell me if you are well. Assured of that, I might rest easy a little while.
               "Perhaps you think I have not much feeling, and the world may regard me as incapable of tears; but my heart is often rent with anguish, and my eyes frequently overflow with tears for my children; but let my anxiety be ever so great, it is generally known to none on earth.
               "I have often been obliged to leave the family circle, lest my children should see my weakness. Judging from my own case, how little is known from outward appearances!
               "At times I love to be separated from the world, that I may commune with my own heart, and if it ever rises to God, it is then; but 
                     
                        'The heart unchanged can never rise
                        To happiness and God.'
                     
                  
               
               "A revival, my dear son, must begin in the closet; and it is vain to look for a proper one, if that is neglected. Declension begins there, and there a revival must begin.
               "I have been thinking much, for weeks past, of the enmity toward one another that apparently exists in the hearts of God's professing people. It seems as if the different denominations could not bear one another; though all profess to belong to Christ and hope to be saved through him.
               "It cannotâ€”must not be so. True Christians will fellowship one another. The time is coming (oh that it were now here!) when every man in every face will behold a friend and a brother!
               "How pleasant that time will be, and how gladly each will help the other on in the blissful road!
               "I find it sweet to be at home, and seldom go abroad, for where one hopes to find a rose is often a thorn; where he looks for honey is a sting; but alone with Jesus, the only sting is sin.
               "I long to live above the world, but have many cares to drag me down. Oh for the Spirit to direct me!
               "Saints and sinners now mingle together, but there will be a separation. Glorious day to saints; sad, awful, to sinners!"
               Though Mrs. Dawson speaks, in the foregoing letter, of her tears and anguish, such was her self-control that even her own children seldom, if ever, saw her weep, if she might even be called sad in their presence, though her trials were many, sharp, and long.
               When fresh ones came upon her, she would wear an anxious look till she could roll them upon Jesus, when it would yield to one of calm serenity or holy confidence.
               But for her own confession, the world might have looked upon her as incapable of tears, which were reserved to be poured out before God.
               At this stage of his work, the writer inquired of Mrs. Dawson's oldest daughter, whether she ever saw her mother weep.
               In reply, she speaks of the time, which we have already named, just after her father's death, when her mother came from his room, buried her face in her hands, and wept; and, though many years had elapsed since then, she thinks it was the only time she ever saw her in tears.
               
               And the daughter who lived with her on the most intimate terms to the day of her death, says, "I do not remember ever to have seen her shed a tear; but I have heard her weep as if her heart would break."
               She then mentions a single instance when she was aroused from sleep by her mother's bursts of grief, as she said, "for the sins of her children.
               "The daughter then adds, "I tried to comfort her; but nothing less than the renewing grace of God in their hearts could do it.
               "Later in life," she continues, "I have often heard her, during the silent watches of the night, when she thought no ear but that of her heavenly Father heard, pleading and weeping for herself and her children."
               At other times, when she had been left alone and was suddenly interrupted, she has been found with her eyes raised heavenward and her lips moving in prayer; and when recalled to herself, she has often been seen to wipe away the falling tear.
               "Her tears were not thrown away upon trifles."
               This perfect self-control, this calm reserve, led her last and much-loved pastor to say, "My first impressions were that widow Dawson and I would never be very good friends;" though after an acquaintance of ten years he adds, "To the last, she proved one of the truest friends I ever knew, or ever expect to know in this imperfect world."
               While then to the world, and in a measure to her own children, who but imperfectly understood the inward workings of her soul, she might have appeared cold and reserved, beneath the surface "beat a warm and sympathizing heart."
               From some things which have been said within the last two or three pages, a stranger might infer that Mrs. Dawson had wayward children, and that even her professedly pious son, fitting for the ministry, gave her occasion for tears and anguish of heart; but such, as we have before stated, was not the case.
               Her anguish and tears were rather in contemplation of consequences that would follow, if they should not do well, for time, but more especially for eternity.
               They stimulated her to those earnest, untiring efforts and fervent prayers which God blessed for the preservation of her whole family in the ways of virtue. And if more mothers felt similar anguish for their children while they were small and before they had been led captive by Satan at his will, they would have less occasion for it on their account in after-life.
               And though we cannot tell now why Mrs. Dawson was so distressed, at one stage of her son's course in college, lest he should be an infidel, we are inclined to believe that, as it will be seen hereafter, he was then exposed to peculiar danger, secret or open, from which he must be saved, if at all, in answer to prayer, and that nothing less than such fears would stimulate an anxious mother to offer such as were suitable. It was probably God's way to save her son, though it may seem circuitous to us.
               And it may here be stated that those who think some families grow up aright without any special effort on the part of their parents, little know what agonizing prayers, what tears, are poured out before God for them when the world lies buried in sleep. Parents who thus early and faithfully agonize with God for their children usually get their reward in this life. They do not weep and pray in vain, though others who neglect their offspring till they have become profligate and headstrong, have their sorrows and anguish to no purpose.
               Writing to her son, and speaking of sickness and death not far from her, she says:
               
                  November 27. What an awful thing it is to put off repentance till a dying hour! It is a time of great spiritual stupidity here, and I have reason to cry out, My leanness, my leanness! and yet I think the cause of Christ lies near my heart. But a professed follower of Christ should be a Christian at all times, in the closet, in the family, at home, and abroad.
               "I long to have sweet communion with God. But shall I ever be free from sin?
               "Had I assurance for myself, I should still be distressed for the many who are perishing. Oh, eternity, eternity! We cannot endure despair here; and what will poor souls do in a miserable eternity, where there is not so much as a gleam of hope?
               "Your college life will soon be closed. Render thanks, my son, to Him who has hitherto made your way prosperous.
               "I have endeavored to consecrate you to God for his service. Live near him; be faithful. So long as we can keep Christ between us and Satan, we are safe."
               She closes this letter with the following lines: 
                     
                        "Christian soldier, watchful stand,
                        Now the tempter is at hand;
                        Guard your heart: he pleads for sin,
                        Whispering evil thoughts within.
                        Guilty pleasures, decked with charms,
                        Seek indulgence in your arms;
                        But your covenant God on high
                        Marks your steps with piercing eye.
                        Quick, arouse! resist and fight,
                        Trust in Heaven's assisting might:
                        They who faithfully endure
                        Find the promise ever sure;
                        Persevere, the victory gain,
                        And the crown of life attain."
                     
                  
               
               JOURNAL, December 1. "It is Thanksgiving Day, but so destitute am I that I could not ask my children home to spend the day with me. Yet may I have a thankful heart for God's mercies to my family!
               "Had rather possess my Saviour's love than all the wealth the world can give."
               
                  December 9. I hear that another fellow-being has breathed her last. Prepared or not, she has gone to meet her God.
               "Oh for clearer and brighter evidence of my fitness for heaven! Heavenly Father, may I be enabled to spend the remainder of my days in prayer for the prosperity of Zion. The cause of Christ lies near my heart, and the prospect of a holy eternity appears delightful. To be with Christ forever, never more to grieve his Spirit, never more to be vexed by the lying tempter!"
               
                  December 11. For a number of months, in the view of the uncertainty of life, I have thought of penning some thoughts for my children, which they can read when I am in the grave."
               She then writes for them as follows:
               "Let me entreat you to make Christ your friend. Never close your eyes at night without first seeking the pardoning mercy of God in Christ, and, when you awake in the morning, let your first thoughts be a prayer to God for his protection during the day. Remember that your mother's prayers alone cannot save you. You must pray for yourselves. In my widowed state, I have tried to smooth the rugged path of life for you. When you no longer have a mother's home to enter, remember that your heavenly Father will never forsake those who trust in him. Ere this meets your eye, I may plead with God for you no more. Follow me no farther than I have followed Christ. Carry every grief to him. If your hearts are hard, tell him: he can subdue them. If tempted to sin, fly to him for protection. You cannot do too much for Him who died to save you. Remember that his eye is upon you, that his ear hears all you say. He observes, too, your pious breathings, and will bring you to an account for all you think, say, and do. When you read the precious promises, do not grieve the Holy Spirit by saying, they are not for you; but remember that sin indulged in will cut you off from all the blessings promised.
               "Live in love among yourselves. Go to Jesus, live near him, and death will not find you unprepared."
               In such a manner did this mother write for her children when the most of them were small, in anticipation of her own removal from them.
               We have now reached the period in the history of this cottage circle, when Mrs. Dawson's letters, which have hitherto been directed mainly to her oldest son, began to be shared by her other children who went from her, more and more as time passed on and they matured in years.
               Now and then she wrote also to her more distant kindred. She was left with four sons and four daughters, all but one of whom survived her.
               To her second daughter, she wrote:
               
                  December 26. I know your situation in life is mortifying to your proud heart; but this pride must be overcome before you can be fit for heaven.
               "We must be content to move in such a sphere as our heavenly Father has marked out for us. How cheering to think that he chooses the poor of this world to be the heirs of heaven!
               "If we belong to Christ, the kind angels are watching over us while we are about our daily employment."
               Then she charges her to "lead a virtuous life, daily read her Bible, watch, and pray."
               JOURNAL, March 24, 1825. "This day my third son is fourteen years of age. He has been from me nearly ever since his father's death; but the time for which he was engaged is expired, and I have to seek a new home for him. My children have no earthly father to guide them. Pray, ye Christians, for them. Your prayers may avail much."
               "April 13. Am much distressed for those of my children on whom I see not the image of the Saviour. As I sat with them and gazed upon them this morning at table, I said, My fear is that the love of Christ is not in your hearts. Heavenly Father, look in mercy upon them!"
               "April 16. As I read in the 'Missionary Herald' of some in heathen lands who earnestly desire to serve God, the tears flowed from my eyes, and I longed to have Christ reign in millennial glory."
               To her oldest son:
               "April 7-16. Oh that I had some good news for you! but a great stupidity prevails. Many are off their watch, and Satan takes advantage of them.
               "Unless God appear for us, we shall sink. I have lost a good neighbor; was with her when she died; closed her eyes, and dressed her for the grave.
               "Rest, precious dust, till the resurrection!
               "It grieves me that I have so little feeling when by the dying bed of others. My dear child, plead for your mother, for this church, and for the poor, thoughtless youth of this place.
               "Last fall my prospects for the winter were dark; but my heavenly Father has fulfilled his promises. He has been the widow's God, the Father of my fatherless children.
               
               "I cannot tell you what anxiety I feel for your little brothers, whose characters for life are forming, without a father to direct them. Though their moral characters are good, I fear that the Saviour's image is not on their hearts. Oh that God would once more visit us, and that we might realize the importance of eternal things! But perhaps he has gathered all he intends to from this place.
               "It is time for us to awake out of sleep; but God alone can awaken those so dead as we are.
               "I long to hear of a revival in your college, and hope to hear of one by your next letter. I long in turn to have something to tell you of a Saviour's dying love; but, ah, how cold and feeble is mine for him!"
               Mrs. Dawson was ever solicitous, not only for the spiritual welfare of her children, but for the church of which she was a member, for the college where her son was studying, and for the prosperity of Christ's kingdom throughout the world.
               Few, if any, were more ready to converse about the things of the kingdom of God, or to do all they could to advance it in the earth.
               To one of her sons, about whom, as expressed in the foregoing letter, she felt much solicitude, she was accustomed to say, when they were parting, "Now remember that you are just at the age to be ruined." And the deep impression made upon his mind by it, as it was often repeated, was never effaced till he became thoroughly convinced that he never would be too old to be ruined, should God withdraw his gracious aid.
               Mrs. Dawson was ever blessed with kind neighbors, and, though it was not much she could do for them, she cherished a lively sense of their kindness, and was happy to make such returns as she could.
               Her desire to do this, led her to write a note of introduction to her brother, living upon the seaboard, on behalf of a son of one of them. He was out of health, and wished to try a change of air and employment.
               In that note she charges her brother to be kind to him, as he wished to be to one whose parents had been very kind to her in her widowed state.
               JOURNAL, June 4. "Spent three afternoons last week in conversing with some of the followers of Christ about the things of the kingdom. How sweet such moments to me!"
               
                  June 30. Am greatly distressed lest my children should fall into sin. O God, protect them! I leave them with thee."
               To her oldest son:
               
                  August 8. You deprive me of one of the greatest enjoyments of my life by not writing to me. I take great satisfaction in reading and answering your letters."
               At this date she speaks of feeling the decays of nature; though her constitution held out for more than thirty years after it.
               JOURNAL, August 20. "A revival of much power seems to have commenced in some parts of this town. My own feelings have been much exercised of late."
               
                  October 25. The Lord has come once more into this town by his Spirit. Many are awakened to the concerns of their souls. Two of my Sabbath-school scholars are indulging a hope, and another is anxious for her soul."
               God had now graciously carried Mrs. Dawson's oldest son through his collegiate course; he had paid her a visit, and then passed on to the seminary, to which he was followed by his mother's earnest prayers.
               JOURNAL, October 30, Sabbath. "Many of us in this neighborhood assembled at break of day in the school-house for prayer. Solemn scene! I returned from this meeting in time to go to the house of God, and then in the evening walked a mile to a conference-meeting."
               "Sabbath, November 13. One hour or more before day, I arose and went to the school-house to meet Christians for prayer. Solemn hour! At the proper time, went to the house of God."
               That the reader may understand what effort Mrs. Dawson had to put forth to attend these meetings, it is necessary to remark that she lived one mile from the school-house, and the same distance from the church, which was in the opposite direction from the school-house, and up the steep hill of which we have before spoken. She thus had four miles to walk in going and coming, when she attended the morning prayer-meeting and church. Yet she went a mile on the evening of October 30, to attend a conference-meeting, making four servicesâ€”two at churchâ€”and six miles' walk for that day; and they were such miles as none but those who dwell among the mountains have. The writer thinks she frequently did the like. It probably was too much; but such was her love for the prayer-meeting and the churchâ€”and that is what we wished to showâ€”that she seemed unwearied in her efforts to attend, though, like her divine Master, she had to rise "a great while before day" in order to do it.
               JOURNAL, November 15. "On my way to meeting, called to see one sick of the measles, and received a most cruel reprimand. My son had, and without knowing at the time that this disease was upon him, spread it. This family had taken it, and one of them said I had been the means of endangering the lives of hundreds. God only knew the wound that such words gave me. Could my tears remove the sickness of this family, they should profusely flow. What is a feeble woman when thus assailed!"
               
                  November 18. Going in another direction, I received another similar rebuke, and my heart was deeply wounded. The tears flowed as I walked homeward.
               "On the way I was overtaken by a young convert, and we immediately entered upon religious conversation.
               "He too had received a wound as deep as my own, though of a different nature. His father had rudely reproved him for attending religious meetings. I advised the young man to be fervent in prayer for his father."
               
                  November 24. Thanksgiving Day. Of late I have longed much for my heavenly home.
               "So great is my anxiety for my younger sons who have no protector, that I am compelled to retire frequently from company to pour out my tears. I leave them with God, whose promises are sure."
               
                  December 2. My family is larger than I expected; my provisions are not adequate. I have been tossed to and fro, night and day, about the temporal wants of my children, though their souls, I hope, have not been forgotten.
               "I have none to whom I can tell my sorrows, but my heavenly Father. He always hears me."
               While in these straitened circumstances, one of her sons found forty or fifty pounds of honey in a tree not far from her house, which seemed very providential.
               Thus did God, in one way or another, provide for the widow and orphans, as he would have satisfied his ancient people with honey out of the rock, had they obeyed him.â€”Ps. lxxxi. 16.
               JOURNAL, January 7, 1826. "Still much distressed for my poor fatherless children. God alone can remove the dark clouds that now envelop me. When I am laid in the dust and cease to plead with thee, O God, for them, be thou their protector."
               
                  January 15. Thus far the winter has been a gloomy one to me. Cares for my family press upon me. Have but little spiritual enjoyment, but am praying that the time may be hastened when Satan shall be bound."
               
                  January 17. After describing some things, seen from home, which affected her much, Mrs. Dawson says, "I wept like a child. Returned home and retired early. Awoke in the night, but the Saviour's face was hidden.
               "I besought the Lord for mercy for myself and family, and for protection from the assaults of Satan. While my children were sleeping, I was sighing, weeping, and praying on their account. At length these words came to my mind: 'I will both lay me down in peace and sleep, for thou, Lord, only makest me to dwell in safety.'"â€”Ps: iv. 8.
               Mrs. Dawson was blessed with four brothers: two of whom were preachers of the gospel. To the second one she wrote:
               
                  January 20. Happy should I be were we so near that we might converse with each other and cheer each other as we pass on to eternity. May we have Christian resignation to our lot."
               Then, after speaking of her many anxious hours for her family, whom she endeavored to commit to the faithful Promiser, of her success in paying for her place after a long and severe struggle, and of her desire, long cherished, to have a home of her own, so as to be independent as long as she could, she goes on to inquire into the spiritual state of her brother and of his family.
               Though older than herself, her deep interest in him and his led her to say, "It is time for us to look up our evidence of a meetness for heaven. For myself, I long to lie low at the feet of Jesus. Let us strive with all our might to do the will of God, and aim at his glory in all we do. My hope is in Jesus. I have done looking for much in this world, and my prayer is, that I may not have my portion here. My mercies are great, though my trials have been many."
               She then closes her letter, by speaking of the state of religion for more than twenty miles around her. Ever feeling a deep interest in the welfare of Christ's kingdom on earth, and supposing that other professors felt in a similar manner, she communicated, in her letters, as much as possible that was cheering in relation to it.
               JOURNAL, January 24. "How precious my Saviour appears! I have great delight in committing myself to him. He has once more broken through the clouds and shone in upon my soul. When shall I be complete in righteousness? When safe in glory? My tears do indeed flow, but they are not now tears of sorrow. The Saviour's love calls them forth. O Immanuel! drops of blood which thou didst sweat for me, coursed down thy face, and can I refuse my tears? Flow on, rather, ye pearly drops. I love to weep at Jesus' feet, and to plead there for the Church, and for thoughtless sinners who never pray. It would be sweet to die at his feet even now, if such were his will."
               
                  January 25. Of Late, I have longed for the society of some Christian friend, that we might pour out our souls together in prayer. God has to-day sent me just such a friend as I desired sired. The time spent by us together was most precious."
               
                  February 5. Have been to God's house. It was pleasant to be there, because he was there. It is delightful for me to be near him."
               
                  February 26. Have had a letter from my youngest brother. My son has visited them, and they think I must be proud of such a son. But my religion does not admit of pride. It calls for the deepest humility. I have occasion for the greatest gratitude, not for pride."
               
                  Marchâ€”Have felt great distress, for a number of days, on account of my youngest son. O Lord, my petitions are constantly rising to thee for this child."
               Near the middle of this month, her second son was brought very low by sickness. At one time it was thought that he could not survive the day.
               "On the eighth day of his sickness," says his mother, "as I sat in the room with him, he appeared to be near death. My soul arose to God, and I said, Blessed Jesus, I have long since given this son to thee: shall I take him back now? No, no! Shouldst thou give him back to me, and tell me to keep him as long as I wished, I would give him immediately back to thee, and pray thee to do thine own will, not mine.
               "I have but one request:â€”purify him, purify him, O God; and then, shouldst thou take him before any more of the storms of life beat upon him, glory be to thy name; or, shouldst thou spare him, I still would say, Glory be to thy name."
               During this domestic affliction, there was one incident that developed Mrs. Dawson's unshaken confidence in God and her genuine submission to his will, if it be possible, even more than her language which we have just penned.
               When it was thought that her son could not long survive, the mother stood with folded arms, and said, with great deliberation, I would not take that child out of the hands of God, if I could do it by turning a straw.
               
               How different this from the course of another mother, who also professed to be the follower of Christ! She, too, had a child that was apparently sick unto death.
               But while her pastor was beseeching God that the life of the child might be spared, if it were his will, she interrupted his devotions, by saying, "There must be no ifs about it: the child must be spared. I cannot give him up!"
               And spared he unexpectedly was, to perish ignominiously on the gallows while his mother lived. Mrs. Dawson's son was spared to be a blessing to her, to the Church, and to the world, till God took him home after nearly twenty years of faithful labor in the gospel ministry.
               
               We believe, as a general principle, that, in such cases, children who are spared to submissive parents are spared to be blessings; while those who are spared to the rebellious, prove to be curses to those who bore them.
               To her son at the theological seminary, Mrs. Dawson writes, March 26, respecting the sickness of his brother, the interests of religion around her, the way in which God fed her, with honey from the tree; and then, referring to a sketch of her life, which this son had asked her to prepare, she says, "I am sorry I ever gave you any encouragement that I would prepare one; for a truthful narrative of my life would cause my children to weep when I am laid in the grave. My younger children know little of my trials, save what they can remember: perhaps it is best that they should not know."
               JOURNAL, April 16. "My youngest son "has made me a visit, after an absence of seven months. He feels the ties of nature.
               "What distress I have felt for him for several days! I cry unto the Lord on his account. We parted at the meeting-house when he started on his return. The tears rolled down his little cheeks. The parting pierced my heart. Walking homeward, I poured out my soul for the child."
               Some time before this, the man with whom another of her sons lived, removed to a large inland town and engaged in a business that was attended with many temptations and exposures to evil influences. He wished to take the lad, then fourteen years of age, with him.
               Many thought it very unwise in the mother to let him go. One said, in her hearing, "Were he my son, I would not let him go for a thousand dollars a year." Another, "It will undoubtedly be his ruin, for time and for eternity."
               But the mother took the case to God, and, contrary to the advice of others, consented for him to go.
               She says, "I cried unto God all the day long, and he gave me an answer of peace."
               She followed him with her prayers, and felt an humble confidence that God would keep him from the evil. In answer to prayer, he came out of the furnace unharmed, when, but for that, the worst fears might have been realized.
               The child himself, in his maturer years, felt that he owed his preservation from harm to his mother's prayers; though he knew not of that day of wrestling for him till after she was laid in the grave.
               To her oldest son:
               
                  May 11-21. Last week we committed to the grave Thaddeus Roodâ€”a Christian in life and in death. His last words were, 'Come, Lord Jesus, and take thy servant home.'
               "To-day a poor profligate is buried. He has been sick, in town, about three months. His last rational words were, 'The wrath of God is coming upon me. I must die, Mercy, mercy, mercy!'
               "He charged an impenitent friend to take warning and not live as he had done.
               "Such is the contrast between the death of a saint and that of a sinner. In regard to spiritual things, the times are dark. When you and your companions meet for prayer, remember the low state of this church, and of all churches in a similar condition."
               Having waited long to hear from this son, she writes:
               "You know not how my mind is racked about one child or another, or you would not delay writing so long. My own low state in religion, and the state of this town, cause me great depression of spirits. I envy not the rich and the great, but wish to be an humble Christian, ever dwelling at my Saviour's feet. When I view him near and feel his love, I am not at a loss what to write.
               "A few Sabbaths since, I thought that to be near the house of God would be to be near God, and, though a poor sinner, I felt that it was sweet to be where the Saviour meets his faithful followers.
               "But why go back? The Christian must press forward. It is time for us to separate ourselves from the world, and to be ready to suffer for Christ. Prepare yourself for usefulness. Keep up secret prayer, without which our hold on heaven is gone."
               JOURNAL, June 25. "Have once more visited Westford, where sleep the remains of my partner; viewed the fields where we used to walk, converse together, and pour out our souls to God in prayer. Farewell, ye delightful shades! Visited also my little son. God only knows what I felt when I thought that I had virtually given him to one who has since become intemperate. Shall I break my word and take him away?
               "No: he has been committed to God. I leave the child in his hands."
               So sacred was her regard for her word that she would not remove that little son from the man to whom she had virtually given him in good faith, though he had forfeited his standing in society and given her just cause to take him away.
               Leaving the matter in the hands of God, he himself, in his own good time, wrought out the deliverance of the child from such an influence.
               
               To her oldest son:
               
                  June 30. Am at a loss what to write. When Zion flourishes, it is not so; but how can I make my letters interesting on any subject but religion?
               "Our people are preparing to celebrate Independence. I do not object to the proper observance of the day; but, at the present time, deep repentance and humiliation, rather, become us, on account of our forgetfulness of Him who has preserved us a free and independent people these fifty years.
               "People seem to be far more anxious about temporal showers, than about those that are spiritual."
               JOURNAL, July 4. "I would gladly have gone and heard the address, but was detained. Intend, however, to go out and unite with a few females in prayer. Parent of mercies, go with me."
               Later in the day, she writes, "What a disappointment! Went to the place appointed for prayer, but no other one came. Full of sorrow, I returned home."
               
                  Sabbath, July 23. Endeavored to pour out my soul in prayer at an early hour, while most of the town were probably asleep. Spread my case before the Saviour, committing my children to him, and praying him to sanctify the day to me, to my family, and to the Church."
               Aiming to turn everything to good account, she wrote to her oldest son:
               
                  Augustâ€”You speak of a grievous poison with which you have been afflicted. Let it put you in mind of the poison of sin.
               "In the one case, as you had to bathe in the sugar of lead to effect a cure; so, in the other, nothing but the blood of Christ can wash away the stain of sin from our souls."
               Then, speaking of her second son, she says, "If he could become a Christian, and be active as such, gladly would I forego many enjoyments. Of late, have felt an unusual anxiety for him and his younger brothers."
               Speaking of a call from a young man who bore her own maiden name, she says, "The name is enough to endear him to me, especially if he loves the Saviour."
               Speaking of the Saviour, "When I think how little I do for him, my spirits sink; and when I think how much time I spend at the table, how much in sleep and anxiety for the poor body, which will soon want only a shroud and coffin, then, how little I spend in prayer, I am constrained to ask, Shall I ever enter heaven?
               "My son, be faithful as a Christian. Serve the Lord with your whole heart, and, if it be God's will, I hope to live to hear you preach."
               
               Then she speaks of the delightful world this would be if all were united in love; but, strange as it is, many who profess to be Christians seem contented with the bare name, pray, in form, night and morning, and quarrel through the day.
               Prior to this date, she had expressed the hope that she might live to hear her oldest son preach; but it does not seem to have occurred to her that she might hear the four preach, from time to time, for a number of years before she died; but such was her privilege.
               Respecting her neighbors, it is worthy of remark that, though she had, at an earlier period of her life, those who tried to injure her, we do not find, even in her most free correspondence, so much as one word written against them.
               Her habit was to make the best of a case, however bad, and to throw a veil over what she could not sanction. When one's conduct was really bad, she would find some apology for it, if possible.
               In confirmation of this, her oldest daughter writes, "I think mother was very careful about talking against others. I do not know that I ever heard what could be called such talk from her."
               And the daughter who knew her best, because she was the most with her, says, "She was not guilty of the sin of slander; but, if she heard anything against any one, was more likely to tell the person concerned than to speak of it to others.
               "She would reprove those who did slander, and throw a veil of charity, if possible, over the errors of those who had gone astray.
               "She felt that other professors, even if they did not do right, were more fit to be at the Lord's table than herself; and that she could commune with them if they could with her, instead of turning from her Lord's table because she thought one of his professed followers had done wrong."
               To her oldest daughter:
               
                  September 8. Bear up through the storms of a vain and transitory world, remembering that you are but a sojourner here, where you were placed to prepare for a better state. Strive to be contented where your heavenly Father has placed you. Adore him for having placed you in a gospel land. Take his word for your guide, read it every day in a careful, thoughtful manner, and look to him for his blessing."
               JOURNAL, September 15. "Have enjoyed some precious views of the promises of God to me, a poor widow, this Sabbath morning.
               "Having taken away the one who naturally provided for me, he is himself my God and husband. I take great delight in meditating upon his promises and in leaving my family with him."
               
               
                  November 18. A church conference at our pastor's. He set before us the importance of awaking from spiritual slumber. Returning home, I retired to rest at my usual hour, and, after a little sleep, arose, went out, and poured out my soul to God, beseeching him for the Church and for my children, who were asleep. After unbosoming all my cares, returned to the house, lay down again, and slept."
               To her oldest son:
               
                  December 30. Am yet permitted to live, while many around me have died since the year began, of whom some perhaps are mourning in endless despair. When I consider the past mercies of God to me, and remember how little I have done to advance his cause, there is reason to doubt whether I am one of his children. If I am, why not more devoted to him? Did not the Saviour now and then give me a glimpse of his love, I should sink."
               About this time, Mrs. Dawson's second son commenced a course of study, preparatory for college, to the amazement of many. For some time he studied at home and recited to his pastor.
               Speaking of him, in this letter to his brother, she says, "He is very studious, studies till midnight almost every night; and, though I see not how I can do without him, or how he can get along, I never shall discourage him."
               Such was her position with reference to all her sons. It is not known that she ever urged one of them to seek a liberal education; but when she found that one of them after another was intent upon that course, instead of discouraging him, as many and great as the obstacles were in his way, she aided him all that her limited means would permit.
               Speaking, in the same letter, of her third son, she says, "He is very fond of books, reads at every opportunity, says he is determined to have an education; and people think he will."
               Then, speaking of her family being large, she remarks, "The God that has fed me all my life long will feed my children. My dependence is upon them, and theirs is upon me. Could I see them truly pious, I should mind no hardship, but would say, Here, Lord, they are; send them where thou wilt.
               "This life is one of trial: we have a warfare to wage, and crosses to bear, if we would follow Christ.
               "I have been a widow long enough to know that the tears of such must flow in secret. It is of no use to complain to any but to God.
               "Did we believe in him, and were we careful to go to him, how sweet would be our consolations! His angels hover around and protect us.
               
               "My son, be faithful in every duty. Persevere unto the end. Carry every complaint to Jesus."
               Thus did the piety of this humble cottage mature and develop, as we go on, till the occupant of it seemed ready to part with all of her children to go to heathen lands. She only needed to be convinced that the Lord called them to serve him in that part of the field, and she would have bid even the last, "Go in peace."
               To the same:
               
                  February 11, 1827. I am sorry you are straitened for money. My will is good to help you, but.... Pray that your learning may be blessed to you and prove a means of bringing some to Christ. Such has been the state of the weather and of the roads, for five Sabbaths, that very few have attended meeting. People have been very careless; and it seems as if these hindrances were the judgments of God upon us for not improving our privileges when we could. After the roads have been tolerably good during the week, the snows have drifted in, so as to make them next to impassable on the Sabbath.
               "Hope we shall prize our Sabbaths better when the state of the roads will permit us to go again to the house of God. Sometimes it seems good to be there.
               "Have recently lodged in the room where your father first found the Saviour. Every trying ing scene through which I passed there was brought vividly to my mind. There, Jesus said to a poor, lost soul, Live; and I could not but adore him for his kind word. Never shall I forget that time. I could dwell upon it long, but forbear.
               "Sometimes I wish I had fortitude enough to relate to your brothers and sisters all the circumstances connected with your father's conversion, but have not.
               "Lately heard one argue that pride was necessary, and some think they cannot be neat unless they are proud; but heaven is neat, and there is no pride there."
               To the same:
               
                  March 31. You say you hope I am not one who consider the cross of Christ a burden. So far as I know my own heart, that is no burden; but my sins are, which keep me so far from it."
               To the same:
               
                  May 26. What you write of the Lord's doings in Boston rejoices me; but a gloom immediately follows when I think of this place, where there has not been an addition to the church for more than a year. Will God pass us by forever? Too slowly, alas! I follow in the steps of my Lord..... I long to see my aged father once more; but God knows whether it is best, and I hope to be content.
               "Rejoice to know that Unitarianism is falling, and hope, when you write again, to hear from the college at Cambridge. May that seat of learning be shaken by the power of the Holy Spirit, and yet be brought to acknowledge Jesus as divine.
               "He knew how his name would be spoken against, when he compassionately said, 'Whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him.' Should you ever preach, dwell much on the doctrines of the Cross. Ministers do not dwell enough upon them.
               "Sinners may be drawn to Christ by love, when nothing else will move them.
               "In your letters be particular upon the subject of religion. Such a course may do good."
               Thus was this lonely widow, in her cottage among the mountains, where she had to struggle for the necessaries of life, and without a single paper to give her information, watching, with intense interest, the state of religion in city and country, college and seminary.
               From the meager sources to which she had access, she was gathering all possible information concerning the state of the Church and the spiritual prospects of the world; and we know of nothing that she enjoyed more than to have intelligent Christians converse with her by the hour, respecting the things of the kingdom of God.
               She felt an especial interest in the college at Cambridge, where her great-grandfather, her grandfather, her father, and three brothers had graduated; and, though the influence of it had since their day become decidedly Unitarian, she knew that it was founded in prayer for the education of ministers of a pure evangelical faith, and believed that God would yet use it for that end.
               To her oldest son:
               
                  July 17. I have put off writing for some time, hoping to have something cheering to communicate; and I have it, but not respecting this place."
               She then speaks of powerful revivals in towns around, and adds, "The Lord will surely visit us, in wrath or mercy: we shall not be forgotten."
               To her youngest brother, same date:
               "It is almost fourteen years since we met, but I can never forget my friends."
               We question whether one ever found a better friend. No length of time, no distance, no variety of scenes, could obliterate the memory of those whom she loved, from her mind, if they could weaken her attachment to them.
               JOURNAL, July 31. "My soul goeth forth in longings after God."
               Writing to her oldest son, October 6, Mrs. Dawson speaks of having seen the Rev. Jonas King, now Dr. King, of Greece, whose parents lived not far from Westford. His early struggles for an education had been similar to those of her own first-born; but having manfully overcome them, entered the ministry, and spent a number of years in Asia as a missionary, he was now on a visit to his parents.
               The single Sabbath which he spent among his old friends was one of deep interest, and such were the impressions made upon her mind by his preaching and addresses, that she says, "I thought it would be sweet to give up every son I have, to be a missionary."
               She then adds, "My mind is not at ease. I am not satisfied with my present attainments. A Christian ought to be ever active, begging, pleading, searching the heart, engaged in the cause of Christ. But, ah! where am I, who have been surrounded with blessings? What poor returns I make!"
               Then, writing to that brother with whom her father made his home in the serene evening of his life, she says, "Had I the wings of a dove, how quickly would I fly to behold once more my venerable parent!"
               It was a great trial to her to be so far as she was from her kindred, and also to part with her children.
               The following extract from a letter to her son, soon after they parted, shows the latter:
               "I often think of our parting. I awoke early that morning, and felt that the hour for our separation was at hand. All the weakness of a mother came over me, and when you took my hand I found my fortitude giving way. To hide my weakness, I was obliged to ask you to say but little."
               Having learned that her only sister had become a widow, she wrote her as follows:
               
                  October 21. I know every feeling you have, having trodden the same path nearly eight years ago. You have met with a loss that you will never forget.
               "Time will in a measure obliterate the remembrance of other troubles; but the loss of such friends as you and I have been called to part with, cannot be forgotten. I feel my loss as much as I did the first year after my husband's death.
               "How many times during the still hours of night, when my children sleeping around me were lost to all care, have I wet my pillow with tears!
               "We have been blessed with the kindest and tenderest of husbands, of whom we were not worthy; or perhaps we idolized them, and so our heavenly Father took them, that he might have our hearts.
               "We must cheerfully give up all for God, whose promises I have found by experience to be faithful and true. Your sorrows are my own. They bring those through which I have passed, so vividly before me, that I weep as I write. I long to be with you."
               JOURNAL, November 19. "Have arisen early. All nature is yet quiet. Have been pleading with God for a place at the feet of Jesus. What darkness has long veiled my mind!
               "The Saviour's face has been hidden, and I have appeared to myself all black with sin. Yet his blood can make me clean. It is efficacious enough for me."
               To her sister:
               
                  November 20. The day is just breaking. Have been up for some time, musing upon the past. Among my many thoughts you are not forgotten. Your departed husband has been tossed upon the tempestuous ocean much of his life, and now, when he has safely reached the harbor where he rests in peace, you would not recall him.
               "We want our companions to lead us on the thorny road, though, if, Christians, we are not alone without them. Christ is with us, his holy angels guard us.
               "While our heavenly Father corrects with one hand, he sustains with the other. Live near him, and the separation will be short. I often say, O God, let me be found of thee in peace, low at the feet of Jesus; then welcome crosses!"
               To her oldest son:
               
                  December 16. You seem to be full of doubts about your spiritual state. Be much in prayer. Devote yourself wholly to the service of God, Would we reach heaven, we must, as it were, climb Calvary and be crucified with the world; must cling to our Lord, weep at his feet, lean upon his bosom. It will not do to follow him afar off, lest we be left to deny him.
               "Though I long to live near God, my mind has been much tried respecting my own future state. I have greatly feared eternal separation from God. The Christian's race is one that our Leader has run before us. It is a thorny way; but he will not forsake his people."
               After laying her letter aside for some time, in the hope of "having something more interesting ing about the revival then progressing in some parts of the town," and speaking of her second son, fitting for college, she continues it, and says:
               "Oh that he were a Christian, and then how willingly I could part with him! I hopeâ€”it is my daily prayerâ€”that he and some other precious youth may be brought to Christ. I long to do something to advance his cause; but what can a feeble woman do who has done little but sin for almost fifty years?"
               To her second daughter:
               
                  February 29, 1828. We should ever remember that God's eye is upon us, and devote a part of each day to him. Gain the love of your Saviour, and your toils will be the easier. You will bear trials the better, and look forward to the eternal world with joy."
               In the month of April, Mrs. Dawson had the revival intelligence for which she had waited long, before finishing a previous letterâ€”so confident was she of a revivalâ€”and fills a large and closely-written sheet mostly with an account of it.
               "It may be truly said," she writes, "that Jesus of Nazareth is passing by. The attention is universal, and in Westford the work is very powerful. Some old and intemperate people have been brought to see their sins. A little room in a saw-mill, in which the owner used to lie drunk all night, is turned into a place for prayer, and he now spends parts of the nights there in devotion. Having spent several days in that part of the town, I found in almost every house some inquiring what they should do to be saved; while others hope they have passed from death unto life!"
               Though, for many reasons, she felt a peculiar interest in the work in the part of the town above referred to, she speaks of it with deep interest in other parts.
               The son to whom she was writing had been teaching where Universalism prevailed, and probably that led her to write, before closing her letter:
               "May we not, like the poor deluded Universalist, dream of heaven all our lives, and sink down to hell at last! What a disappointment!
               "But if we are washed in the blood of Christ, we shall be raised with him to glory. No clouds will then veil his face from us; no fears will then depress us; no tears will be shed; no anxious cares will be felt; for these mortal bodies will then no more occupy our thoughts. In dwelling upon the Christian's glorious prospects, I almost forget that I am a poor sinner, full of doubts and fears, and in this mortal body confined to earth."
               
               To her youngest brother:
               
                  April 26. I do think heaven is worth a few trials; and few indeed will they appear if we ever reach that blessed world and view them thence. But I feel myself a poor sinner, meriting nothing but eternal death, and hoping for heaven only through the merits of Christ."
               To her oldest son:
               
                  May 11-12. You are now licensed to preach the gospel, and, as a mother who loves you, I entreat you to be faithful. Keep your eye on things above. Be much in prayer. Our Saviour prayed much when he was on earth; but we have occasion for prayer, which he had not.
               "I need the aid of my children, and never needed it more than I did when you went from me; but I never was sorry you went. I intend to use every exertion to help your brothers, and am willing to struggle if they will devote themselves to God."
               To her second daughter:
               
                  June 5. I wish you to meditate much on your future state."
               To her oldest son:
               
                  June 24. My mind has been much, for the last few days, upon the Saviour. I have endeavored deavored to follow him from the manger through every scene.
               "Sometimes I view him as rising a great while before day, and seeking a solitary place for prayer; then as continuing all night in prayer. Then I accompany him in thought to the house of the Pharisee, where a woman creeps behind him and takes a place at his feet. Perhaps she wished none but the Lord to see her. She felt her load of sin, and at the feet of Jesus, which she kissed, poured out her penitential tears. My son, are we at the Saviour's feet? Have we heard him saying unto us, 'Thy sins are forgiven thee'?"
               JOURNAL, Julyâ€”"Have some longings to join the host in heaven; but how unfit I am! Nothing but the power of God can raise me to that blessed world. Precious Saviour, purify me with thine own blood!"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VII.
               FROM THE END OF MRS. DAWSON'S JOURNAL TO HER REMOVAL FROM ASHTON.
               AT the close of the last chapter we gave, so far as we can find, the last entry which Mrs. Dawson ever made in her private journal; though she lived nearly thirty years after that date.
               By the aid of her children, she was made more and more comfortable as she advanced into a serene old age, and we had thought that her journal would be increasingly interesting; but the want of it, for some years to come, is in a measure supplied by her letters, which were written, to some extent, in the form of a journal. These grow more and more abundant as her children matured and went from her, till the infirmities of age made it burdensome for her to write.
               The extent of her correspondence was, probably, the main reason why she discontinued her journal. For one in her circumstances, she wrote many letters and very long ones.
               In the summer of 1828, her friends, who yet remained in the place of her nativity, sent her a pressing invitation to visit them once more. She had not been there for about eight years, and the soul of her father, now in his ninety-second year, yearned to see his youngest child once more.
               To obviate all difficulty on the ground of expense, he offered to defray the whole, not forgetting to provide a boarding-place in Boston while it might be necessary for her to wait there for the packet.
               Mrs. Dawson was not much accustomed to go from home, and, as people then traveled, it was a great undertaking for her to make a journey of two hundred miles by land and sea. Nothing but a strong desire to see her aged father and other dear friends could induce her to attempt it. In a letter to her oldest son, whom she hoped to meet on the way, if he did not visit her before she started, she says, "I long to find my affections more above the things of time; long sometimes for the world above, where I may join the company of saints and angels. But how shall I ever reach that world? Nothing but the blood of Christ can cleanse this spotted soul of mine."
               Thus in almost every letter there is more or less of holy aspiration, faithful exhortation, and statements respecting the progress of religion in her own heart and in the region around.
               It would seem at times as if she inquired of all who passed her humble cottage, "'Watchman man, what of the night?' How is the revival?' if she knew of one anywhere in progress, or, "What is the state of religion around you, within you?"
               So interested was she in all that concerned Christ's kingdom, and so intent upon learning the latest, the best news from the great battle that is everywhere going on between sin and holiness.
               The weary traveler, whether going up or down those four long miles of the "hill country," especially if he was a traveler also in the way to Zion, loved to linger, as he came to the cottage, and slake his thirst from the rill that sparkled at his feet, while he refreshed his soul in spiritual communion with Mrs. Dawson, who was ever ready to speak upon spiritual things. Here many found an arbor on their toilsome way, in which they refreshed both the material and the spiritual man, without falling asleep or losing their roll. The interview rather aroused their dormant graces and accelerated their progress to the celestial city. Here they found humble cottage piety, too rarely seen at this day among those who move in similar spheres; and the longer they lingered, the better were they prepared to go on their way rejoicing.
               In a letter to her brother, acknowledging the invitation to visit them, of which we have spoken, she says, "I return you many thanks, but much is wanting for the journey, and how to secure all I know not. The thought of once more beholding my father, and of parting with my children at home, has robbed me of much sleep."
               She at length undertook the journey, and accomplished it in three days, which was expeditious for those times.
               It was her last visit to the place of her birth, and the last journey she ever made, save her occasional visits to those of her children who lived comparatively near her. She was never able to visit those who settled at a distance from her.
               After spending several weeks with her father, brother, sister, and the other associates of her early days, she bade them all an affectionate farewell and returned to her cottage home.
               Before she set out, her son met her, occupied his grandfather's pulpit, and then accompanied her on her way as far as Boston.
               Writing to him after she reached home, she says:
               
                  October 5. I can hardly realize how I have been tossed about for the last month. The review brings many pleasing reflections to my mind, especially that of the last Sabbath when I saw you in the pulpit. It was just twenty-seven years since I was there, in the greatest tribulation, with you in my arms. I cannot express my emotions. If my heart had not been of adamant, it must have melted, as I contemplated the hand of God with me and mine from that day to this."
               After speaking of one of the very darkest of the many dark periods through which she and her husband had passed together, she says, "I can now look back at times and see the hand of God in all."
               The very month after Mrs. Dawson returned home, she heard of her venerable father's death; and though the event was not unexpected, she felt it much, and was renewedly thankful that God had enabled her to visit him so recently.
               When she received the sad tidings, she wrote to her kindred who survived and remained there:
               
                  November 27. Has the glory indeed departed? I heard last evening that my dear father is dead. The best of fathers, then, is no more. He has been spared to us long; yet how did fond nature wish to detain him! He is now in the presence of God, and we cannot wish him back. What scenes have opened before him! Perhaps he and our dear mother are now united in glory.
               "I cannot describe the feelings I have had since I left you. In thought I have been with you to such a degree that I have had little inclination clination to mingle in society. It seems as if I still had my father's hand in mine.... I hope one day to be with him, and all of God's dear children, in the world where Christ will be all our theme."
               Writing to her oldest son, she says:
               
                  December 6. Have thought much of my friends who are gone, as I think, to glory. How blessed their employment! I long to find 'Christ in me the hope of glory.' It is a great thing for a sinner to appear before God. I have had some longing desires to join the happy spirits above and to be free from sin; but I have a thousand fears about the future."
               To the same:
               
                  January 10, 1829. Believe me, my son, not the man who has the greatest talents is the greatest. It is the humblest Christian who is the greatest man."
               Speaking of the decline of religion in the place of her residence, she says:
               "I often look toward the school-house where, during the past summer, we met three times a week for prayer; but there are no meetings there now.
               "I try to make it my prayer that God would take hold of us by his irresistible power and draw us to himself. Shall we ever be complete in Christ? Feel anxious for the souls of my children, for whom I cannot be here to pray long. The time is short; a few more trials, a few more prayers, and all here will be over."
               To the same:
               "January 11. Awoke a long time before day; and if you knew how anxious I felt for you and my other children, at that silent hour, when all were asleep, you would say, 'Mother, don't be concerned; only believe.' But how can a mother help it?"
               To her sister:
               "February 20. The snow is so deep that I have been shut in for some time, but I often visit you in thought. How much like a grave appears the room that my father used to occupy! But we must turn from the past, so happy and yet so gloomy, and extend our views to the upper world, where I hope eventually to meet our departed friends. How the hope of such a meeting animates me!"
               To her oldest son:
               "March 21. You speak of the storms that beat around you, and I perceive, from what follows, that all is not right within. Though ever ready to hear the complaints of my children, how much more pleasing to hear that they enjoy the smiles of the Saviour! Pray more. Give not up to the prince of darkness. If you are not a Christian, it is time you were. If you have hitherto been living for yourself, it is time for you to live for God. Remember, it is a mother that writes to you, who would fain strew your path with flowers. She seeks your future happiness more than your temporal good.
               "Oh that there were in me a heart wholly devoted to the service of God! I long for the happy moment when we can say that Christ is ours; yet so cold and feeble is my love that I can hardly pray. But Christ is on the mercy-seat.
               "I feel that this world is not my home. As to my past life, it appears like a blank. I never was faithful in anything, never was fit for a mother; but I am a mother, and must give account to God for the souls of my children. Precious Redeemer, appear for me and mine.
               "With reference to being a missionary, I leave it for you to determine. Endeavor to find where you can be the most useful, and, if that is in the missionary field, never let your mother deter you from going. I love you with a mother's love, but I hope I love the cause of Christ more. I shall love you none the less if you are a missionary.
               "Should I study my own comfort only, I should wish to have you where I could occasionally sionally visit you; but I hope I am ready to part with worldly comforts for Christ.
               "Do nothing rashly; but, when the path of duty is plain, press on in it. Your brothers feel anxious about me; but I feel, if possible, a thousand times more anxious about them."
               After speaking of having been kept from the house of God most of the time for six weeks, she says, "The want of the presence of God causes me many gloomy hours."
               Though Mrs. Dawson felt that she never was fit for a mother, it is for the reader to judge whether it had not been better for the world if all mothers had been as well qualified for that important post. Indeed, it may be questioned whether many, in the sphere in which she moved, were ever better qualified, by nature or by grace, for that position.
               In the last letter from which we have given extracts, she speaks of a visit to a sister-in-law, between whose family and her own there was more than ordinary intimacy. The children of this relative were marrying and settling around their mother, and Mrs. Dawson evidently felt, so far as she consulted her feelings, that she would like to have some of her own settle near her; but instead of looking to her own comfort, or wishing her children to make that their controlling object, she would study and would have them study, rather, what would most glorify God. Self, with her, was lost in the divine will, as the rain-drops are lost in the lake upon the surface of which they fall.
               And though she felt desirous, on her own account, to have her first-born settle where she could occasionally spend a little time with him, we may anticipate enough here to remark that she was not permitted to be present when either of her sons graduated at college or at the theological seminary, that she never saw one of them ordained or installed, and, though she lived a number of years after her youngest settled in the ministry, she never heard one of them in his own pulpit, or visited them in their own homes, which were remote from her rural cottage.
               Those sons usually paid her an annual visit and spent a Sabbath with her; and it may well be supposed that she watched their movements, and the dealings of God with them, in the closest manner,â€”that she was often with them in spirit and much in prayer for them; but the increasing infirmities of age kept her from visiting them.
               But, to return: Mrs. Dawson's second and third sons, who had been of essential service to her while their brother was struggling through his course of study, now began to feel that it was time to give themselves up to study or to go into business; and, though their mother approved of their wishes, she wrote to her oldest son as follows:
               "May 17. In regard to myself, the times look dark."
               Then, after telling him what little sources of income she had enjoyed in previous years, and how they had failed her one after another, she says:
               "I have not made any complaint to your brothers or to any one else, I tell you these things, because you seem anxious to know how I am and what my prospects are.
               "The times never looked darker than when you first left me; but how well I have been carried on so far! Let us never distrust a faithful God."
               Speaking of a letter from her third brother, she says:
               "I never saw a person so borne above the world. How troubled I have felt at times for him; but, happy brother, amidst all his poverty he is richâ€”the true riches are his. I look upon him as the richest of the family."
               This brother had a well-trained mind, and was sound in the faith; but bodily infirmities kept him from the active and full discharge of the duties of the ministry.
               These infirmities led his sister to be anxious on his account.
               Closing a letter to her second daughter, she says:
               "May 26. Amidst all the hurry and bustle of life, I hope you will remember that you must die. Keep God always before you. Remember that his eye is upon you. If sinners entice thee, consent thou not."
               To her oldest son, still thinking of going on a foreign mission, she writes:
               "July 10. If God calls you, you ought to leave us. True, the ties of nature are strong; but did you not resolve, before you commenced a course of study, that, if God would give you the desire of your heart, you would devote your life to him?
               "I entreat you not to be concerned about me, though it is true I am obliged to pass through some trying scenes. I often feel that I never did anything with right motives, that I never devoted my children to God as I should have done, and that, if I am ever saved, it will be the wonder of wonders.
               "I have lately felt that the rising generation will serve God better than the one now on the stage.
               "How charming it would be, if you and a few select friends could meet here for prayer this evening! It often depresses my spirits to think that my children are scattered far from me, and that they will probably scatter more and more; but I hope I feel more anxiety about their spiritual state than about that. If I ever feel a little of spiritual peace, the next thought is. Oh, the souls of others yet in sin! Why is it that we are not more engaged? Why, that professors, in general, are sleeping?"
               To her oldest daughter:
               "August 10. I often wish it had been my lot to have my children around me. I am distressed for them; not for their bodies, so much as for fear that their peace is not made with God.
               "Remember that you are not placed here to do your own will. You should keep a single eye to God's glory. May you have that sure hope which will bear you above the frowns and flatteries of the world."
               Writing to her second daughter, the same day, she expresses the same distress,â€”for fear she does not love the Saviour.
               
               She then asks, "What matter is it whether we are poor or rich, if Christ is our portion?
               "Sometimes I have a gleam of hope, and can look forward to the time when I shall join the saints in glory. No gloomy fears, no distressing ing doubts, mar the happiness of that celestial world.
               "No temptations will there allure us from the path of duty. While in the body, we hope, we fear, we rejoice, we mourn; but nothing there will make us sad. Oh, keep your end in view."
               One by one her kindred had removed from the place of her nativity, or been borne to their graves, till her widowed sister only remained there.
               To her she wrote:
               "October 7. I feel sad every time I think of my native place, especially during the month of September. It puts me in mind of the last visit I paid there. Sweet season, you will return to me no more."
               To her third brother, same date:
               "I long to see you and converse with you about that happy world to which we are hastening. When I read your letter, I called my own spiritual state to mind, concerning which I have had many doubts. I never had those exalted views you speak of, and yet I humbly hope we shall meet in heaven. When you enter your closet, remember your sister."
               To her oldest son:
               "November 14. I consider myself under the most solemn obligations to God not to hinder your going wherever he may see fit to direct you; though it was much easier to talk, eight or ten years ago, of parting with you to go on a foreign mission, than to do it at the present moment, when you are about to decide the question of duty.
               "Considering all things, I thought it most prudent not to write you about the time you were closing your theological course, but to leave you, uninfluenced by me, to do as Heaven should direct.
               "A devoted missionary cannot be useless anywhere. There is much to be done in everyplace; and I see enough on every side to make one cry out, O Lord, how long? how long?
               "You, and every child I have, feel tenderly as children; but you cannot understand the feelings of a mother."
               After expressing her great desire to see this son, she continues:
               "Study your duty, and if you ought not to pay me a visit at this time, I hope to bow with submission to the divine will.
               "Remember, God's eye is upon you. He knows what your views are, and whether you do all to his glory. In your preaching, dwell much on Christ."
               So fearful was Mrs. Dawson that she might influence her son to make a wrong decision when he was about completing his course of study and entering upon the active duties of the ministry, that she refrained entirely from writing to him for an unusually long period. She would leave him unencumbered by her advice.
               Mrs. Dawson's son had requested her to have an additional room finished off in her house at his expense. She stood in great need of it, and, when it was done, in allusion to it she wrote:
               "January 2, 1830. My room is the most comfortable I have had for twenty-nine years. Wish you could come in and see how nice it is.... I spend the most of my time by day in it aloneâ€”my children are at school, but if I can have the company of my Saviour, and feel his love in my heart, I ask no more.... There is precious society in heaven.
               "I think much of your brothers and sisters. They are lovely and pleasant to me, but without new hearts all is lost.... I understand that your mind is more inclined to the missionary field. Let Heaven direct."
               Thus were maternal feelings and wants all made to bow to the will of her heavenly Father. Not one word would she utter, not one sentence would she write, to influence a child to swerve in the least, for her sake, from the course which God seemed to point out. On the contrary, she would aid that child at every sacrifice of personal feelings, and to the very utmost of her ability, to do what he thought God would have him do. When the will of the Lord was once known, few, if any, have had better reason to say, with Paul, "I conferred not with flesh and blood."
               To her oldest son:
               "March 6. The trials I underwent when you were in my arms, and those to which you were afterward an eye witness, give me a freedom with you that I do not feel toward any other child.... I am too apt to say, with Job, 'He hath set me up for his mark.'
               "When I am almost overwhelmed with distress for my family, God says, 'Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me.'
               "At times I can see the hand of God in every event through which I have passed, but at present I cannot. The Spirit seems grieved and gone; but I hope for its return.
               "When I look at my sons, and see, in them the image of their father, then trace his happy spirit upward, I hope we shall be united again, and permitted to say to God, 'Here are we, and the children that thou hast graciously given us.'"
               It was now nearly five years since her oldest son went to the theological seminary, and yet he seemed no more ready to leave it than he did years before. He was rather getting more and more deeply engaged in literary pursuits.
               His long delay there occasioned his mother to write him as follows:
               "April 17. I think it is high time you left the seminary and went more directly about your Master's business. I leave it to you where to go; but go; for while you are poring over your books, souls are perishing that you might be instrumental in saving."
               About this time, she says her third son is setting out in earnest to fit for college, and asks why it is that her poor boys all think of acquiring an education. It then occurs to her that she had, in some serious moments, given them all to God, and said to him, "Send them where thou wilt."
               God had accepted her offering, and was inclining her sons to study, that they might be prepared to go where he would send them.
               To her oldest daughter:
               "May 30. My greatest anxiety for my children is that they may be Christians. Life will soon be past; strive to be prepared for the close of it. Give yourself to God. Give me your hand, give him your heart."
               To her oldest son:
               "July 2. Of late I have thought much of our Saviour's words, 'Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.'
               "But this is only said to his own followers, and, of them, to those especially who are called to preach the gospel.... I feel like a poor wanderer who has lost his way and cannot get back to it, though it is in sight. 
                     
                        "'Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it;
                        Prone to leave the God I love:
                        Here's my heart, oh, take and seal it,
                        Seal it from thy courts above.'
                     
                  
               
               "As a minister of the gospel, strive to keep yourself unspotted from the world.
               "The distress of my children fills me with sorrow, a double portion of which is laid upon me since the death of their father, I seem at times to bear and to feel all that he and I had borne and felt together if he had lived; but in every trial let us look up for comfort.
               "Should we be called to part, so as to see each other no more on earth, it will not matter much if we are prepared to meet in heaven. If we are faithful, He is with us."
               To her oldest brother:
               "November 26. Years have passed since we have exchanged letters; but it is not for want of affection on your part or mine. The tender ties are as binding as ever. My affections are not in the least diminished.
               "It would be cheering to me to be where I could hear the voices of my brothers and sister; for I rarely find that warmth of affection among other people that I used to find in our father's house."
               In this letter she speaks of the hopeful conversion of her second son, then about fit for college.
               Thus, after years of prayer, the desire of her heart begins to be granted. 
                     
                        "Though seed lie buried long in dust,
                        It sha'n't deceive our hope."
                     
                  
               
               Mrs. Dawson had seen others converted around her, from time to time, while she was left to fear that her own children were to be passed by. God had been trying her faith in this way for a number of years; but now, to her great joy, this son appears "like a meek and lowly Christian," takes the lead in family prayer, and expresses a desire to spend his days in preaching the gospel.
               "If my children can be created anew, in Christ
                  
                  Jesus, I can part with them to go wherever God shall call them."
               To her sister:
               "December 29. If our lot had been near each other, how pleasant it had been for us! Last year two of my sons taught school in town, and often met at home; but no such meeting cheers me now. Still, I have many mercies."
               After intimating that her second son would probably enter the ministry, if any door opened for him to get an education, she adds, in substance as above, showing that it was no hasty, impulsive remark, "Many have been the trials of my life; but if my children are washed in the blood of Christ, I can part with them to go wherever God may see fit to send them."
               She was ardently attached to her children, and nature prompted her to gather them around her; but grace enabled her to rise above nature, and, with a disinterestedness seldom seen, not only to lay them all at the Saviour's feet, but to consent for them to leave her and go to any place where the Lord had need of them.
               While yearning for their salvation, she consecrated them again and again to God, that he might do with them as he would. Beyond their salvation she had nothing to say, though she pleaded most earnestly for that.
               And, amidst all her trials of parting with them and living far from them, we know not that she ever expressed, ever felt, one regret, not only that she had consecrated them to the Lord to be saved by him, but that she had done it in order for them to serve him anywhere in any way. To her the glory of God in the salvation of men was all-absorbing.
               To her third brother:
               "December 29. It is sweet to think of that tender affection that has ever existed between us. I long once more to grasp your hand, and wish I could make my dear old friends understand how near they are to me.... What are trials, what is poverty, if we can be happy in the Saviour? But I come so far short in everything that I hardly dare to hope: yet I long to feel more love for my Saviour."
               For many years Mrs. Dawson had been going forth weeping in secret places, bearing precious seed, and now, after long waiting, she begins to reap what she had been sowing. In addition to the hopeful conversion of her second son, of which we have spoken, she says, in this letter to her brother, "You cannot realize how I feel when I receive letters from my children, as I often do, saying, 'Do remember me at the throne of grace; plead for me that I may be born again.'"
               
               It may well be supposed that, in answer to such requests, she interceded for her children with renewed fervor, giving God as it were no rest but as she saw evidence that Christ was formed in them the hope of glory.
               She had promised God, in good faith, that if he would renew their hearts he might do with them as he would.
               She never wished to rescind that promise, but "considered herself under the most solemn obligations to God not to hinder their going wherever he might direct."
               It was her unswerving principle to have nature yield to grace, self to God.
               Her second son now seemed "determined to persevere in his studies."
               Few can understand what a personal sacrifice it was to his mother, at her time of life and in her circumstances, to have him take the course which he now contemplated. He was not only amiable by nature, but grace had already made him increasingly lovely. He had already done much for his mother's comfort, and had a prospect of doing more from year to year, if he engaged in some secular pursuit. But his mother was not the one to offer unto God that which cost her nothing.
               Instead of being helped by this son, as she had been and still needed to be, if he studied for the ministry she must aid him as much as possible; yet, instead of opposing his wishes, she cheerfully made all needful sacrifice, gave him her counsel and her prayers.
               Writing to her oldest son, she says:
               "December 3. Tears often flow from my eyes when I see the tender regard of my children for me. Oh that I could help you all! but God sees the kindness of your hearts, and nothing will ever be lost."
               To the same:
               "December 12. Was disappointed in not having a visit from you. Did fondly hope you would spend an evening at least with me; but it costs much to travel, and I wish you to get out of debt.
               "It would be pleasant to have my sons meet here once in a week or two, as a part of them did last winter; but, if Providence orders otherwise, may I be able to say, 'Thy will be done!'
               "If ever my soul goes forth in earnest prayer for my children, it is when they leave me. Then I try in my poor way to commit them to God. This was the case when your brother went away to the academy. I was alone, and think I can truly say I besought the Lord for him.
               "My prayer went forth not out of feigned lips. I received assurance that he would find his Saviour there. When distressed about him since, I have thought of that time and of that assurance, and have been at peace.
               
               "One more circumstance may be mentioned. It was two years last March since three of us agreed to make three youths of this town the subjects of our secret prayers. We often met and conversed about them, and persevered, though we found no answer.
               "Early in October last, I became alarmed about our coldness, and thought that our unfaithfulness was the reason that these youths were not brought to Christ.
               "I named it to my two friends the next Sabbath, and we agreed to set apart a time every morning, before sunrise, for one week.
               "It was about this time that your brother began to hope in Christ. We still supplicate the throne of grace for the other two.
               "I speak of this, not to intimate that our prayers merit anything, but to show, what you have long known, that God is the hearer of prayer."
               Mrs. Dawson's "two friends" survive her, and, by a letter from one of them, the writer learns who those other two youths were. One of the two subsequently entered the ministry, and, after a short career, went home to heaven. The other was a son of their venerable pastor, and is, we fear, yet a stranger to Christ, and living in neglect of the means of grace.
               Should he ever meet these lines, let him remember how he has been prayed for, and that he must yet meet those prayers, and answer, if he can, why he was not moved by them, and by the other means of grace which he early enjoyed, to be reconciled to God.
               By the letter just referred to, we learn, also, that those females agreed to improve every opportunity of uniting in special prayer for the conversion of those three youths, and "not to cease praying for them until they gave evidence of a change of heart."
               It was not long before Mrs. Dawson wished to introduce a fourth youth to be prayed for; and that one, as well as two of the original three, entered the ministry.
               Thus God stirred up these pious females to pray for those youths; and while they were yet praying, from morning to morning, before the sun was up, he heard their prayers for one of them who was at school in an adjoining State.
               Such are the secret springs by which the Lord works, the ways in which he moves to bring about his wonders. He stirs up his people to pray for the things he would grant, and then grants them in answer to their prayers.
               Early in this year (1831), Mrs. Dawson heard of the hopeful conversion of her youngest child, who was living away from her. We suppose it was in allusion to this that she wrote to her firstborn:
               "February 13. Never had a parent such calls for gratitude as I. When I meditate upon the character of the Saviour, as I often do during the wakeful hours of the night, I am lost in astonishment. I am constantly piercing him with my sins and putting him to an open shame, and yet he bears with me.
               "Sometimes I see no reason to think that I am a Christian; but I do long to love Christ with an everlasting love."
               To the same:
               "February 19. The company of my children would be sweet; but I could cheerfully be absent from them, if I could have my Saviour's presence."
               To the same:
               "August 18. I write a line to inform you of God's doings here. More than sixty have indulged hope in Christ in the course of two weeks. Come and spend a little time with us. It is harvest time; come thrust in your sickle and reap. There is not much work done here now. The work of grace is beyond anything I ever witnessed before."
               The whole town in which Mrs. Dawson lived never numbered a thousand people; and at this time it was divided into two parishes. She speaks of the first parish, in which many had indulged a hope, in the course of two weeks.
               
                  September 23. She Wrote a long letter to her oldest son, taken up, for the most part, with an account of this wonderful work of grace, in which it was believed from one to two hundred in that small parish had passed from death unto life; and of that number was the third son of this praying woman.
               "The husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it;" and thus, after years of wrestling prayer, was Mrs. Dawson permitted to see one child after another brought into the kingdom of the Redeemer.
               This was the season when "four-days' meetings" were introduced, generally for the first time, into the evangelical churches of that section of the country.
               As prayerful preparations were made for them in many places, for days, and weeks even, before the time appointed for holding them came, they were at first greatly blessed. Many can look back to them as the time of their espousal to Christ.
               In subsequent years, instead of preparing for them, they looked to the meeting, if the Church was cold, to revive it; if divided, to unite it; if wavering, to establish it; and, in short, to do everything for it, instead of looking to God to own and bless this instrumentality.
               As a consequence, though they continued to be held in some places for several years, they were of doubtful expediency, and were eventually, to a great extent, given up.
               At such a time of reviving as we have spoken of, we should expect to find Mrs. Dawson on the mount; but as she hoped that her children were brought to Christ, and she was eased a little of her anxiety about them, her thoughts turned in upon herself, and she says, "I have a thousand fears about my own future state."
               To her third brother:
               "December 24. I long, my dear brother, to see you, but doubt whether we shall meet again in this world. It matters little whether we do or not, if we are prepared to meet above. Remember me at the throne of grace. Pray that we may be prepared to join in praising God on high."
               Much of this letter is taken up with an account of the "most remarkable revival in those parts, on account of which the year should ever be memorable."
               Piety there had been in a very low state, and many were looking forward to the four-days' meeting already appointed, in the humble hope that it would do much for them. But God anticipated that meeting, and, in answer to prayer, came down with great power nearly two weeks before the time appointed for it.
               Mrs. Dawson writes to two of her sons:
               "February 2, 1832. Be faithful; stand fast, with your lamps trimmed and burning, ready for the coming of the Lord.
               "Keep your eye on Christ. Begin and end every day with God. Watch over your hearts and tempers. Be cheerful, but not light. It is worth while to labor hard for our Lord and Master while we are in the body, if we may dwell with him hereafter. I am willing to be poor if I can do anything for his cause."
               To her oldest son, on the eve of his sister's marriage:
               "March 29. I can assure you, my dear son, that the marriage of your sister brings up afresh the time when I entered that solemn state with bright and flattering prospects. I was as gay as a lark; but through what scenes I had to pass in one short year!
               "Yet, blessed be God, he led us on with hearts so firmly united that no trials could separate us. Together we journeyed for nearly twenty years, and then your father was summoned home. What a cloud was over us then! But how kind our heavenly Father has been! I have seen many trials; but what blessings have been poured out upon me!
               "God is bringing my children, one after another, into his kingdom, and I wonder that my heart is not melted in gratitude to him for his goodness to me and mine.
               "Then, when I look upon those of my children who have not the image of Christ stamped upon them, I say, 'Oh that Ishmael might live before thee!'
               "I entreat you to remember the mercies of God toward us, and have an eye single to his glory. If we are denied many things that are pleasant and desirable, how many mercies are left us!
               "I often think of the Saviour's mode of addressing his disciples after his resurrection: 'All hail!' How could the King of Glory be so condescending? How could he stoop so low? I am amazed at my own ingratitude, and all heaven would wonder should such a wretch be permitted to enter there."
               Her second son had now entered college; and she writes to him, about the same date with the foregoing:
               "Do not be anxious about me. Remember, you did not go to college against my will. Our heavenly Father did not withhold his only Son from dying for me; and shall I hold one of mine back from that course in which he can best glorify God? I should fear a curse, instead of a blessing, should I do it.
               "If you can be the instrument of saving one soul, it is well worth all your pains, and all the self-denial of which I am capable. Do not give way to despondency; there is no religion in such a course. View the hand of God in leading your brother through so many trials; view that hand with you. How he has led you on! Trust him. Lie low before him. Go forward."
               To her oldest daughter:
               "May 3. I address you at the head of your own house. Remember that domestic happiness, like other earthly things, is fleeting. May you enjoy as much of it as is for your good; but set not your affections too much on earth."
               To her second brother:
               "July 8. I took a letter out of the office to-day from you, for Mrs. â€”â€” but our friend is no more here. In her death I have lost one of the best friends I ever had in this town. Others are leaving us, and soon we shall be gone."
               Then, speaking of her family, she says, "How many mercies are poured out upon me! I am sometimes afraid I shall have my heaven here. Not but that I toil hard, which I consider as nothing, compared to the good behavior of my children."
               Then, speaking of the devotion of her sons to Christ, she says, "God has the best right to my children. I hope he will prepare them all for his service. May I be permitted to give all I have and am to Him who carried me through those scenes of sorrow which I endured for years."
               To her oldest son:
               "July 26. You must not expect me to write to you as often as formerly. Each of six other children away from me now claims a share of my attention.... At present I have some longing desires for the rest that remains for the people of God.
               "Sometimes a gleam of hope darts into my mind, and allures my longing soul to the bright day when all the chosen seed shall meet around the throne; but the next moment the thought of poor sinners drives these pleasing visions away."
               To the same:
               "September 5. If your brothers are ever prepared to preach the gospel, as I know my own heart, I never will hinder them from going where God in his providence may call them."
               Strong inducements had been held out to her second and third sons to go West and pursue their studies. But she strenuously opposed that course, and, to show that she was not influenced by selfishness, uttered the language we have just penned, when giving an account of the offer to her son at the seminary.
               She felt that an education procured at one of the older colleges would be more valuable than one procured at the West, and wished her sons where they could visit her during their vacations, render her such aid as they could, and impart to her "spiritual consolation," till she saw evidence that God called them farther from her.
               Continuing her letter to her oldest son, she says, "I could not endure their going half so well as I did yours. When you went, I was younger; my cares and anxieties for my little children occupied my attention; but it is not so now."
               In the course of this autumn her house took fire; in reference to which she says, "I never was more sensible of the protection of Heaven. Had I slept five minutes longer, the fire could not have been put out. Had I any proper sense of God's mercies toward me, I should be overwhelmed."
               Before she brings her letter to a close, she puts some very close questions to the son to whom she was writing, who, against her judgment and that of many others, still pursued his studies at the theological seminary. She wished for a candid did answer to them. Among these questions were the following:
               "Can a minister be as useful while engaged in translating as he could if wholly devoted to the care of souls? Can he write as good sermons? Can he preach as well?"
               This son was much engaged in translating from foreign languages.
               Another incident may come in here.
               A clergyman descending that very steep hill in front of her cottage, had his attention suddenly arrested by it. It appeared to him, when looking down upon it, to be near the foot of the hill. As he drew near, he saw a beautiful vine creeping up the front and along the roof.
               The external appearance pleased him so much that he took occasion to enter.
               Within, there were indications of poverty, but all was neat. A female, apparently over fifty, met him. Her countenance, though marked with care, wore a calmness and serenity that impressed him. He asked some slight question, and then remarked, "You live in a mountainous country." The woman replied, "As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about them that fear him."
               
                  Clergyman. "And can you say that such is the case with you?"
               
                  Woman. "I think I can. I hope I love the Saviour, and think his cause lies near my heart."
               Thus the clergyman went on, till he drew from the occupant of the cottage much of the history of her family. He had found one of the purest samples of cottage piety, now so rare as to be almost unknown. That cottage had been one of the Redeemer's choice spots, had it been in the part of the world in which he moved when he was in the flesh.
               To the same son:
               "November 10. Not long since, amidst the wakeful hours of night, I was meditating upon the judgment. What horror and dismay will then fill the soul out of Christ! When I reflect upon these things, how small the world appears! How astonished I am at my own stupidity!
               "How solemn to think that we must exist forever! and yet how delightful to the Christian, who will be united to Christ, with all the saints in glory!
               "When I can feel that I belong to such a company, I long to be with them; but, looking within, and finding my heart the seat of corruption, then remembering how pure and holy God is, it does not seem possible for me to enter heaven. Christ is my only hope.
               "Some think it very easy to be a Christian. I have never found it so. The Scriptures do not represent it in that light; but we have the promise of Him who cannot lie, that he will keep those who put their trust in him. None shall pluck them out of his hands.
               "How often, when perplexity, doubts, and fears have weighed my spirits down, has he removed my load, and shed light upon my path when that path seemed hedged in on every side!
               "I love to contemplate the scenes through which I have passed, and trace the hand of God in every winding; love to think of him who has been long mouldering in the grave; but more do I love to think of Him who died for us.
               "He has led us all our lives, and is now permitting me to see one child after another added to his own flock.
               "Are you aware, my dear son, that four of my family have confessed Christ, since you were here? How great is the goodness of God!"
               Thus was Mrs. Dawson's cup, from which she had at times drank bitterness and sorrow to their dregs, now filling, as old age came on, with the richest spiritual mercies. Thus was cottage piety maturing for the skies.
               The seed which she had sown amidst much sorrow, and watered, by night and day, with many tears that God only saw, was now springing up and bearing precious fruit.
               She had borne the burden and heat of the day, and now a serene evening, laden with the choicest blessings, awaited her.
               How appropriately could she sing, at this stage of her life, with her favorite Watts,â€” 
                     
                        "The Lord can clear the darkest skies,
                        Can give us day for night;
                        Make drops of sacred sorrow rise
                        To rivers of delight.
                     
                     
                        "Let those, who sow in sadness, wait
                        Till the fair harvest come;
                        They shall confess their sheaves are great,
                        And shout the blessings home.
                     
                     
                        "Though seed lie buried long in dust,
                        It sba'n't deceive their hope;
                        The precious grain can ne'er be lost,
                        For grace insures the crop."
                     
                  
               
               To her second son:
               "November 19, I sometimes hope I shall see all of my daughters, as well as my sons, subscribe with their own hands unto the Lord. Your second sister united with the church two weeks ago....
               "But, oh, the swiftness of time! The summer has gone like a flying cloud, and winter comes hastening on. I am treading the down hill of life; and may it be my lot, as the body sinks, to have the soul rise toward that world to which the Saviour has gone to prepare a place for his people. I ask no more. Often at night I meditate upon the state of the righteous, and also upon that of the wicked. How glorious the one, how awful the other!
               "When all wish to be happy, how astonishing that so few are willing to take the only way that leads to true and lasting happiness!
               "My dear son, persevere in holiness. Look not so much to your own comfort as to the advancement of Christ's kingdom.
               "Take a decided stand for Christ. I lament my own slothfulnessâ€”that I am not more engaged in the duties of religion."
               "November 25. Walking to meeting, the question arose in my mind, What am I going for?....
               "When I think of my own vileness, I ask, How is it possible for me to enter heaven?
               "The blood of Christ makes it possible; that cleanseth from all sin. Christ is the way.
               "Strive not to be the greatest scholar, so much as to be the most humble Christian.
               "It is not so easy a matter to be a Christian. The way is difficult, and when one is converted he has but entered it. We have no promise without perseverance. Have your eye on the Saviour. Cultivate a spirit of prayer. The Lord knoweth them that are his. Carry every complaint to him."
               The following extract from one of her letters will show how Mrs. Dawson was comparatively comfortable on very moderate means:
               "It has always been my custom to do without everything I could, until I was able to pay for what I got. In that way I have kept along without getting badly in debt. Tea is the only luxury I allow myself.
               "Taking this course, people tell me I am the most independent person in town; but I am dependent upon my children for almost everything."
               It is worthy of note, here, that for a number of years before her death she became quite indifferent to that only luxury in which she indulged herself, and to which she was, for a long time, so much attached that she knew not how to dispense with it.
               In another extract, she says, "I care little about visiting, but do love to go to the house of God; and, amidst all my fears, by divine aid, I will take my position at the Saviour's feet, and, if I perish, perish there." Then, referring to difficulties and embarrassments that yet surrounded her and hers, she says, "There will be a way through."
               Again: "I have thought much of the words, 'He is not far from every one of us.'"
               Could we realize this, we should be more watchful.
               "There is nothing that looks to me like enjoyment, save what the Christian has."
               
               Notwithstanding what Mrs. Dawson has just said about visiting, she remarks, "We are formed for society, and I love that of dear Christian friends."
               She then closes the letter, from which we have been making extracts, by saying, "My son, receive this from one who wishes you, above everything else, to let the cause of Christ lie near your heart."
               Her love for the house of God and the place of prayer is spoken of in proper terms by the daughter who lived with her till she ceased to keep house. She says, "Mother was strongly attached to the place where 
                     'Christians meet to praise and pray.'"
                  
               
               She would make great sacrifices to meet with those who assembled for these holy exercises, not as a matter of duty simply, but from love. It was no uncommon thing for her to go alone, in the evening, one mile to a prayer-meeting.
               She delighted to hold converse with Christian friends, and, so long as she was able to go, Sabbath morning always found her in the house of God, unless the weather prevented, and she was there early; for a part of her religion was not to disturb the devotions of others.
               So regular was she in her attendance, that if absent but one Sabbath it would be asked if she was sick. This was true when she had that hard hill to climb. And when she removed her residence, no one thing connected with her new home was a greater source of satisfaction to her than its proximity to the house of God.
               Her own door was ever open for prayer-meetings, and when Christian friends came to see her, some part of the time was usually spent, by her request, in prayer.
               When I think of the prayers offered in her house, a hallowed influence seems to pervade the spot, and it is like holy ground.
               For years, when she could not well get any farther, she would go to the sanctuary, and seemed to be invigorated, soul and body, by going. No sooner was one Sabbath past than she began to anticipate the next. If ever one could say in truth, 
                     "Thine earthly Sabbaths, Lord, we love,"
                   she emphatically could. It was to her, indeed, 
                     
                        "Day of all the week the best,
                        Emblem of eternal rest."
                     
                  
               
               1833. The only pastor Mrs. Dawson had known for a number of years was now getting too aged and infirm to discharge the duties of his office, and the church was occasionally hearing others, with the view of selecting a colleague.
               Under such circumstances, those who loved the truth were watchful against error, and disposed to scrutinize the doctrines of the candidates to whom they might listen.
               
               Mrs. Dawson had no fellowship with any departure from the old paths as taught in the catechisms of the Westminster divines; and with reference to one, whom the church heard for a time, she writes to a son:
               "February 24. I cannot get along with all he sets forth. There are some preachers who do not adhere closely enough to the doctrines of the cross, and we have reason to think that many have entered the ministry who are not fit for it; but God will carry on his own work, and truth will eventually prevail. With reference to yourself, take the Scriptures for your guide, and look more to the glory of God than to your own comfort. The heirs of salvation must not look for their reward here. I say to you, as Paul said to Titus (ii. 7, 8): you can read it at your leisure."
               "March 3. I feel, my dear son, like a mere cipher. It seems as if there never was a person who did so little to promote the good of man or the glory of God. I do not feel satisfied with myself; and yet, if I know my own heart, I am willing to be deprived of the society of my children, willing to spend and be spent for them, if they will spend their lives in the service of God. I have tried in my poor way to carry you all to Jesus, and have said to him, Lord, I have little to give; but if thou wilt accept my children, I freely give them to thee. All I wish for them is that they may be devoted to thy service."
               This, as we have seen, was no sudden outburst of feeling on her part, but a sincere offering, deliberately made, and very often, we might almost say daily, as deliberately renewed.
               To the same:
               "Marchâ€”(?) The winter months have passed, the spring has come. Time waits not. Soon the closing scene will come to all now on the stage; and what a day it will be to many who have had hopes of heaven!
               "The almost Christian, the moralist, and many who would shudder at the thought of doing wrong, must take up their abode with the most wretched of mankind, to say nothing of the other companions, and of the unmitigated sufferings of those who perish. Oh, the horrors of that scene which imagination often paints to my view!
               "Be patient, my son, be faithful, be fervent, and the God of love and peace will be with you."
               To her third son:
               "June 8. I was much disappointed that you did not meet your brother at home. Indeed, disappointment seems to be my daily lot with respect to my children, and the only thing that reconciles me to being so far from them is the hope that they are preparing to spend their days in the service of God. No prayer-meetings in this neighborhood, and very few in town."
               To her second son:
               "July 10. In your course of study, it is highly important to keep your end in view. Let not ambition keep you from secret closet duties. While you strive to be the best scholar, strive also to be the most humble Christian. The vows of God are upon you. If you often groan under the pressure of want, remember how much better to be poor in this world and rich in faith, than the reverse. My prayer is that my children may devote themselves to the Redeemer."
               "July 13. Have been meditating much of late upon that company, spoken of in the book of Revelation, all clothed in white. What a glorious sight! but how much more glorious to be one of that number! Strive to be calm and serene, but engaged in every good work, that when death comes you may look back upon a well-spent life."
               And thus did that son live till he passed away from earth, a few months after he followed his mother to her last resting-place.
               In relation to the minister referred to a little back, Mrs. Dawson writes:
               "July 14. The day of rest has come, but I do not feel as I should about going to church if we had a sound man to preach. If in error, I hope to be enlightened."
               None but sound ministers according to the Calvinistic standard ever found any favor with her, but such as were of that stamp ever had her support.
               She closes the letter which she commenced on the 10th, with these words, "And now, my dear son, I entreat you, live devoted, live prayerful, live humble. Let everything have its proper place, and all will go well."
               To her oldest son:
               "July 15. While I live, I wish to be engaged in something useful. My hands, like my mind, were never made to be inactive. Oh that every faculty of mine, and of my children, might be devoted to Him who has done so much for us!
               "Your third sister is thoughtful, and I have no doubt that she will yet come forth as gold tried in the fire; but it takes some of my children long to decide."
               This dear child was the only one that did not openly profess her faith in Christ before her mother's death; but, though she "died without the sight," her faith was well founded. The child united with the church soon after the mother went to heaven.
               
               To the same:
               â€”(?) "For nearly two years you have given me reason to expect a visit from you. I have avoided saying much about it; but here, at the window at which I am now writing, I have sat days, weeks, months, and I might almost say years, to see if I could not catch one glimpse more of my dear son.... I was in hopes that all my sons would once more meet under my roof. Can you not come once in years to see your mother who is in the decline of life?"
               Such was the yearning of the mother's soul to see her absent ones. The most of them usually paid her an annual visit as long as she and they lived; but there were times when the oldest son was so engaged that, much as he loved his mother, it seemed next to impossible for him to visit her.
               When they had been to see her, one after another, till each one of them had paid her a visit, she used to say, mournfully, that she had nothing more to look forward to for that season.
               In the autumn of 1833, the desire of her heart was so far granted that her sons were all at home at the same time.
               She had not enjoyed such a time for many years before, and never did afterward. The oldest was preaching and pursuing his studies. The next two, in the order of age, were members of college, the youngest had not yet commenced his preparatory studies.
               Once afterward all the brothers were together. It was fourteen years later. The three older ones had come from their respective fields of labor, in as many States, to ordain the fourth; but the mother was not able to be with them.
               Respecting that visit at her house, in 1833 she writes to an absent daughter:
               "I never had a more pleasant visit with your brothers. We had much to do; but that did not hinder our enjoyment. We did want all the absent members of the family here. It never was so hard to have your oldest brother go. The people here would gladly have kept him to preach for us."
               It was a time of considerable religious interest, and Mrs. Dawson's son had repeatedly preached, with great acceptance, to many who had known him from early boyhood, and to others who had grown up during his absence.
               To her third son:
               "November 9. Little did I once think that I should ever address you as a member of college; but God seeth not as man does. In former days, when our means were very small and our family large, I never expected anything but sorrow. Though it was delightful to have my little ones around me, when provisions were short and clothing scarce, I used to look upon you with a bleeding heart, and seek some secret corner to weep in. But how changed now! It seems as if the remainder of my life ought to be spent in supreme devotion to Him who has, as I trust, overruled all for his own glory.
               "Be watchful, prayerful, faithful. Keep hold of that golden chain that is let down from heaven. Lean on the Saviour."
               In allusion to the visit spoken of above, she wrote to her third brother as follows:
               "December 20. Last September I had a visit from my sons; and you may rest assured that the time passed pleasantly. The youngest of them is now beginning to fit for college, and I have a hope, if they are spared, that each of them will become a herald of the cross. God's ways are mysterious, but he has wise designs in all he does."
               We know not how long she had cherished the hope above expressed, but this is the first intimation of it which we find in her letters.
               Once more, alluding to that pleasant visit, she says:
               "It puts me in mind of those happy days I spent under my father's roof, where all was peace, love, and harmonyâ€”the emblem of heaven!
               "When I think of the efforts of my children to make me comfortable, I fear I shall have all my heaven in this world. I envy not the rich or the great; I ask not for the grandeur of earth, but do ask for a place at my Saviour's feet. I would have some humble part among his followers,"
               To her oldest son she says, "I long to hear that you are wholly devoted to the work of the ministry. I have long since given you up to God, and trust that he will direct you."
               We have seen that Mrs. Dawson enjoyed many seasons of prayer, at her own cottage, with those who came to visit her. It was not easy for a minister of the gospel to leave her, if he would, without spending some time in that way; and the same may be said of pious laymen who visited her, and of females, too, when men were not present.
               There is evidence also that she sought like opportunities with her female friends when she visited them at their own houses.
               Much of Mrs. Dawson's happiness, at this period of her life, consisted in receiving visits from her children and in hearing from them. And, though they wrote with some degree of frequency, we wonder not that the time between their visits or their letters seemed long.
               She writes to her oldest son:
               "February 27, 1834. I did think, when I wrote you last and plead for a letter, that you would write; but I know it is not for the want of affection. Other important duties press upon you. I prize my home more and more; for here my children can occasionally come and rest from their toils. One of your brothers speaks of the last vacation as the pleasantest time he ever spent at home; and you cannot think what satisfaction it gives me to have my home pleasant to my children. It cheers me to see them, and to hear their voices in prayer. When you read this, remember that it will be a comfort for me to hear from you."
               To her third son:
               "March 10. You speak of want; gladly would I help you and all my children; but God, who governs all, knows how much prosperity we can bear, and how much adversity we need to make us feel our dependence upon him. Lean on Jesus, and follow the course he marks out for you."
               To her oldest son:
               "April 20. Have heard that good man, Rev. Mr. H., preach. He never appeared so interesting ing before. Tottering on the brink of the grave, he appeared like an angel. In regard to the state of religion, I know not what to say. It sometimes seems as if there was none here; but I trust there are a few praying ones among us."
               The following remark refers to the period that elapsed between the resignation of her aged pastor and the settlement of his successor:
               "I never was more sensible in what a dreadful situation a parish is without a minister than I have been for the last six months."
               To the same:
               "May 4, Sabbath morning. Have been meditating upon that morning when Mary arose early and went to the Saviour's tomb. But looking over our neighborhood, in the valley below me, I see nothing to indicate that any one has arisen. How much of precious, holy time is wasted in bed!.... I was highly gratified by receiving your letter. So God remembers his handmaid. On every side there is something to remind me of my children, of the swiftness of time, and of the great Creator. Xerxes wept to think that his vast army must pass away in a few short years; but how little the most consider!"
               Speaking of the anxiety of her fourth son to study, she not only repeats her firm purpose not to hinder him, but adds, "If he and my other sons
                  
                  can do God's will, and promote his glory, I am not afraid of being forgotten."
               To her third son:
               "July 13, Sabbath morning. Have risen before the sun. The mower has laid aside his scythe, the cattle are at rest, and everything seems to say, 'Disturb not the quiet of this sacred day.'
               "Opposite my window is a nest of young birds, which the old one is continually feeding. It puts me in mind of our Saviour's words, 'Behold the fowls of the air,' etc.
               The anniversary of the visit of my sons will soon be here. The return of it, in anticipation, brings a sort of pleasing melancholy. The review of by-gone days calls up some pleasant reflections; but in looking forward to eternity, I am lost in thought. What a sea without a shore! And why are we so indifferent to its interests?"
               To her oldest son:
               "September 11. I do not wish to alter the course marked out by our heavenly Father for you. All I wish is that you may have an eye single to his glory, and that you may not follow me in any respect in which I have not followed Christ.
               "At times I have been foolish enough to wish my situation different in some respects from what it is; but, if I am one of God's children, I am probably in just the place that is best for me. As to spiritual things, I am very cold; but when I look forward to the heavenly world, how mean does all below the skies appear!
               "Often, when quite alone, meditating upon the past, do I fly in thought to the places where my dear children are. I long for their society; but how selfish! When God spared not his own Son, why should I wish to have one thing contrary to his will? May he direct all and guide us to his heavenly kingdom."
               Some of Mrs. Dawson's children had for a long time felt a growing desire to have her dispose of her "little farm," and either locate near the meeting-house, or reside with one of her married daughters. They thought that her place was too far from the church for her, amidst her increasing years, and that the care of it was too much for her.
               To this desire she refers in the following extract:
               "September 17. I have no wish to change my place for the present. It is a pleasant, retired spot, and God will, in his own time, if it be for the best, provide a better home for me."
               To her third son:
               "October 31. I do long for the society of my children. I love to hear their voices; but it is best at all times to bring our minds to our situation, looking to God for aid."
               "November 29. Let us deny ourselves, and strive as far as we can to do God's will, hoping, believing, and trusting in him."
               To her oldest son (?) 1835:
               After giving an account of the dangerous and protracted sickness of her second daughter, she says, "What a confused life I have lived the past winter! I sometimes long for such retirement as you enjoy; but find consolation in looking beyond this vale to that world where the people of God enjoy eternal peace," Then, referring to the murder of the missionaries, Lyman and Munson, in Southern Asia, she says, "Dark and mysterious are the ways of the great Creator; but all things will work for the good of those who love him."
               To her third son:
               "March 29. I was much pleased to hear from you, and especially to hear of the seriousness in college. I do hope that the precious youth there will all be brought to Christ. I think I earnestly desire a revival here."
               In anticipation of the departure of her youngest son to the preparatory school and thence to college, she says, "I feel that my last earthly prop will soon leave me. May that teach me to lean more and more upon the everlasting arm that will never fail those who do lean upon it."
               To her oldest son:
               
                  April 19. Speaking of the desire of his youngest brother to go on immediately with his studies, and of his leaving her for that purpose, she says, "It is impossible to tell you my feelings; but I know the disposition of my children toward me, and hope God will reward them for their kindness by a double portion of his Spirit."
               To her second son:
               "April 29. I feel disappointed that your stay with us must be so short. Had fondly anticipated a visit from you and your brother, in the hope that you might be the means of awakening some here."
               During the spring of this year, there was a very interesting revival of religion in the college of which these two sons were members; and it was Mrs. Dawson's reasonable hope that they might bring something of the spirit of it with them, and impart it to others, when they came home for their vacation.
               Referring once more to the desire of some of her children to have her remove to the center of the town, where neighbors would be nearer and she could enjoy better advantages than she could where she was, she writes:
               
               "May 31. Society is good, if it is good society; retirement is also good.
               "Should my life be spared for a few years, something may take place in my favor; but until then I would lie submissive at the feet of Jesus. I am willing to deny myself, and to exert myself, if my sons can be in a situation to promote the Redeemer's cause."
               Mrs. Dawson's aged and esteemed pastor, who had some time before relinquished active labors, was now rapidly going down to the grave.
               With reference to him, she writes:
               "June 4. I have been sitting by his dying bed, expecting every moment to be his last. It was a satisfaction to accompany him to the verge of Jordan."
               This good man had for many years been her pastor, had baptized her children and buried her dead. He had always been to her a firm friend and a judicious adviser; and now she found a comfort in being near him as the lamp of life was flickering in its socket.
               To her oldest son (?):
               "As I sit by the window, viewing the clouds beautifully tinged by the rays of the setting sun, my thoughts extend to that happy world which is beyond the reach of Satan's power.
               "What delightful peace must fill the souls of those who have reached that blissful state!
               "Now and then a black cloud passes along and intercepts the rays of the sun; and thus often sin intercepts the rays of the Sun of righteousness, and darkness shrouds our minds.
               "I long to possess that calm and heavenly temper which the Saviour had while on earth.
               "I would ever have my mind clear as the unclouded sky, and be like those whose 
                     
                        'Souls are ever bright as noon,
                        And calm as summer evenings be.'"
                     
                  
               
               After hearing a returned missionary preach, she writes, "Have been very much entertained; and, when hearing him, wished every son I have was fit for a missionary."
               Such was her prevailing sentiment, though, as the infirmities of age came on, she did, at times, long to have some of her sons near her.
               The following extract from one of her letters will show, in addition to those already given, her habit with reference to Sabbath morning, too much of which many, even of God's professing people, waste in sleep:
               "It is the morning of the holy Sabbath, a most delightful morning. The sun is not yet up. How many lose these precious hours in sleep, instead of rising early to praise the great Creator!"
               
               Mrs. Dawson was habitually a very early riser, and, of her many very long letters, parts were often written in the early morning, while all around her were wrapped in sleep.
               Those early hours, especially in summer, were her seasons for meditation, prayer, and praise.
               The following will show how much her comfort, not to say her life, depended upon the good behavior of her children.
               When a class-mate of one of her sons had been expelled from college for stealing, she writes:
               "How I should feel if it was one of my own sons, I can have no idea. All that has kept up my spirits through my widowed state has been the good behavior of my children; but even that is not of us, but of God, who has led us on.
               "May we be watchful, prayerful, humble. Pray for that poor thief and his friends."
               The following will show the kind of society, and almost the only kind, out of her own family, in which she found pleasure:
               "Have had a most delightful visit with Deacon B. and wife, Rev. Mr. T. and wife, a Methodist minister, and others.
               "After the deacon and Mr. T. had discoursed much about the conversion of the Jews, the latter asked if we could not educate one youth in this town to go to them as a missionary. 'We received the Bible from them,' he said, 'and should seek their conversion.'
               "As the visit drew to a close, we had singing and several prayers; after which we parted, with pleasant reflections respecting the manner in which we had passed our time."
               During the month of November, a protracted meeting was held in the place of her residence, and she writes to her third son, on the 4th of that month, "I have risen this morning before four, in order to prepare for the meeting. We meet at five in the morning."
               Thus did she, though now over sixty years of age, and often quite infirm, rise long before the dawn and go a mile up that steep hill, to anticipate the day with a little band of God's people in prayer.
               As the meeting progressed, she wrote again to the same, as follows:
               "How sweet for the Christian to be at last in the world of glory, 
                     
                        'Where congregations ne'er break up,
                        And Sabbaths have no end.'
                     
                  
               
               "I have felt, at times, within a few months, as if I could freely give my sons all to God, and have in my imperfect way dedicated you anew to him.
               "Prepare to go wherever God may call you; and let it never be said that I kept you from going. Though I love my sons, I wish to love my Saviour more."
               To her oldest son:
               "November 5. I can write but little about the world. My mind is so engrossed with the meetings, that I cannot think of much besides. I have some longing desires after my Saviour, and have devoted my sons anew to him.
               "What a wonder it would be if you should all be preachers!"
               To her second son:
               "November 18. Our meetings continued for ten days, and it was hard to have them discontinued.
               "How sweet to arrive where prayer will be turned into praise, and sin will no more impede our progress in the divine life!
               "My family have all gone to the prayer-meeting, and I find it sweet to be alone at times, if I can have the presence of the Saviour.
               "I love the society of God's people, but pray to be delivered from persons who are full of idle talk."
               To the same:
               "November 26. Have been thinking of late of the passage, 'Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give an account thereof in the day of judgment.' Often, in company, the most of the talk is idle; and at home how much of it partakes of that character! But to see youths separating themselves from vain things and walking in the ways of godliness, is most delightful. Continue to live devoted to your Saviour: carry all your complaints to him."
               To a brother:
               "December 18. I write to look up my longâ€”I had almost saidâ€”lost brothers. I very much desire to see them once more while in this tabernacle. I have never, during our many years of separation, felt my affections for them abate."
               Such was her tender regard for her kindred. Years of separation could not change it; the sorrows through which she had passed could hardly make it less. Her affections for her children and her intense anxiety about them could not make her forget those who were children with her in her father's house.
               In the course of this letter, speaking of her own family, she says, "The mercies of God to me call for my most grateful acknowledgments."
               During most of the time that her sons were pursuing their course of study, postage was very high, and, for one in her circumstances, having a large number to correspond with, it was a burden.
               
               She often found it very difficult to pay it, and, being unwilling to burden others with a double share, urges this expense as a reason for not writing oftener, and, in her letter to her brother, above cited, says, "I am obliged to use the utmost economy."
               To her third son, then teaching:
               "December 29. Am pleased to hear that you are so pleasantly situated; but hope you will be out of college as little as possible. I wish yon to finish your course, and then prayerfully follow that calling which Heaven has marked out for you.
               "It is not much that I can do; but I have a heart to sympathize with you in your struggles. The weather has been very cold; but, blessed be God, there is a stream whose gentle flow warms every Christian's heart!"
               To her second son:
               "January 21, 1836. All kinds of provisions have been very high; but he that sitteth upon the circle of the heavens and ruleth all the inhabitants of the earth, will take care of his own. Hard times are sent to show us our dependence upon God. I hope those who distill grain will be led to see the evil of their ways."
               To her oldest son:
               
                  February 20, After making known some of her wants, she says, "Of this you may be assured, I shall run in debt as little as possible. One thing I can say, which few can who have been married or widows nearly thirty-six years, I never bought any article whatever which was not absolutely necessary."
               If she could not help her children, she would tax them as little as possible to help her.
               To her third son:
               "June 25. If any of you are depressed in spirit, you have my tenderest sympathy. I know what such feelings are. Why should I not? The Saviour's face has been in a great measure hid from me for a long time.
               "Have been thinking of your father, Deacon H., and many others, now in glory. Happy souls! They are free from sin, and always behold the unveiled face of the Redeemer. I do not wish them back, but do wish ere long to join them above. My mind is like the weather; but I hope the brightest rays of the Sun of righteousness will soon shine upon us."
               To her oldest son:
               "June 26. In one sense, to your brothers and sisters you have had to stand in the place of a father.
               "Your trials have been many; but your kindness will never be forgotten. It often affects me to tears when I am alone. The Lord will never suffer those children to go unrewarded who are kind to their parents.
               "The thought of a visit from you would cheer me very much. Yet I dare not set my heart upon it, lest I be disappointed; but, come when you will, my arms are ever open to receive you.
               "I am often disconsolate, but the thought that my children are in the service of God, helps me through this toilsome life. How differently I feel when hearing of wars and rumors of wars, from what I do when hearing of revivals! The latter sends a thrill of joy through my soul."
               To the same:
               "August 12. In his last letter one of your brothers wished to know if I was not lonesome. In reply, I may say that I wonder every one is not lonesome who has not a good hope in Christ. As to company, I have as much as I wish; but it is not always of the right kind. There is such a thing as being lonesome in the midst of company."
               To the same:
               "October 18. Had I the pinions of a dove, I would quickly fly to you for a little while."
               At this time, Mrs. Dawson, in common with many others, thought her pastor was dwelling too much upon some of the abstruse doctrines of theology. Respecting this, she writes, "What the end will be, I know not; and how to understand all he sets forth, I know not; but I mean to say to him in person what I have to say." She then speaks of having been to see him, and having had a very pleasant visit.
               Further on, she says, "I know that God will take care of his own. I am of little consequence, but I feel deeply when I think of the millions who are sinking down to hell. Pray for us here, and think of our souls more than of our bodies."
               To her second son:
               "November 24. It is early dawn. I rose this morning between four and five. Our Saviour rose a great while before day for prayer; but how different with poor mortals! Worldly business will call them out, but the interests of the soul are hardly thought of. What a world this is! Sometimes religion is all the theme; at others, if a minister is a little plain, some are almost at swords'-points with him!"
               Mrs. Dawson had now two sons at the theological seminary. The one who had been long a resident there was pursuing his studies and teaching in the seminary. The other was yet studying preparatory to the ministry.
               To her eldest son she wrote:
               "January 1, 1837. It is seventeen years since your father went to meeting for the last time. How sudden the change for him! How dark the cloud that came over us!
               "Darkness, without one ray of light, then veiled my mind; but the cloud has now, in a great measure, passed away, and we can see the hand of God in all his dealings with us. How kindly he has fulfilled his promise! how gently he has led us along! 
                     
                        'Sure there's a righteous God,
                        Nor is religion vain.'
                     
                  
               
               "I regret that I am so insensible to the mercies of God, that my heart is so cold, so hard, while we experience to the degree we do God's loving kindness and tender mercies.
               "You observe that you would give worlds for the approving smiles of your Saviour; and so I say: give me that smile, and the world with all its allurements may go. For the want of it, I often groan in the night season and am troubled."
               From her little cottage home she could see, on the one hand, far up the mountain-side, and, on the other, far down the vale, as it were, beneath her.
               To the former she refers in a part of the following note to one of her sons, dated March 18:
               "How sweet I have found it to have warm-hearted hearted friends to rejoice in my joys and to mourn in my sorrow! But I have lived long enough to find that the friendship of the world worketh death. Those who would find true friends must look for them among the friends of the Redeemer.
               "How often I have sat by my window and watched you as you have left me, one after another, to resume your studies! Last week I thus watched my youngest son, leaving me for that purpose, till he was far up the hill.
               "May God direct you all in ways that will be for his glory. I sometimes think I may leave this retired spot and live with my children, who have ever been kind and tender toward me. The Lord reward them."
               This custom of watching her sons as they went from home, time after time, is brought out in the following note to the oldest of them, of the same date with the foregoing:
               "It is now almost seventeen years since you started for the West. I watched you then till you were out of sight. I felt your departure deeply; but, believing that you were in the path of duty, it was with a kind of melancholy pleasure that I saw you go. Since then I have many times watched you, when you have left me, till I could see you no longer, and then, in my poor way, have sought Heaven's blessing upon you. In turn I have followed your oldest brother till he was out of sight, and then poured out my prayers and tears for him.
               "Then I have followed the next, in like manner, and have gone through with like anxiety, praying for him. And now I have been watching my youngest son till I could see him no more. But who can tell the anxiety of a widowed mother for her children, when they are dwelling far from her in this world of temptation and sorrow?"
               While her oldest son was going through his collegiate and professional studies, his younger brothers did what they could for their mother. He had as much as he could do to aid himself. But by the time that they wished to fit for college, he was through with his profession, and gave her that assistance which they no longer could, till they one after another had completed their professional studies. Then, as they successively finished their course of study and settled in the ministry, they again shared in this filial duty.
               Thus from the time that Mrs. Dawson was left a widow, till God was pleased to take her to himself, had she one or more of her sons to look to and to lean upon, though a part of that time they were small.
               At the time her first-born passed away from earth, the four had for a number of years met the pecuniary wants of their honored parent. But for some years, while the others were struggling up the hill, the duty of meeting those wants devolved mainly upon the oldest; and we often find letters, written to him during that period, beginning much like the following:
               "June 8. Returned from the post-office, where I foundâ€”dollars from you. Instead of taking it from you, wish I had a hundred to give you. May the Lord, who has hitherto been our guide, reward you with a double portion of his Spirit."
               Again:
               "August 18. It comes very hard to ask you for money; but I know of no other way. The Lord reward you."
               Some time before this, God had taken Mrs. Dawson's old and loved pastor to himself, and another had been now for some years in the sole charge of the church.
               Alluding to the trials through which he was passing, she writes to a son:
               "Oh, how much grace and patience a minister needs to bear him up! As you are preparing to preach, prepare for trials and conflicts. No doubt you will have them. But I exhort you to do the work of the Lord faithfully. Probation will soon be over; and what glories await the Christian after death!"
               With the one who wrote this, and the one to whom it was written, probation is over. They have entered upon those glories. Happy spirits, they are with the Lord.
               In the summer of this year, just before Mrs. Dawson's third son was to graduate, a scene of disorder and confusion occurred in the college of which he was a member. It has been spoken of as a "rebellion," and such to some extent it was.
               When a vague report of it reached her ears, she playfully wrote to her son that "she should be sorry to have him expelled from college after he was through."
               She then exhorts him to look to God for direction, to remember that the aged know better than the young, and to comply with all college rules that he could without violating a good conscience.
               Having learned from him that he was going immediately into a school after leaving college, she wrote him:
               "August 19. I think that you ought to rest a little.... Be assured that not a day, perhaps not an hour, will pass but that my mind will wander to the places where my dear children are. When you have time, remember that among these hills is a mother who loves you, and whose sincere desire is that your life may be devoted to God. The world often seems lonely to me. My children and nearest friends are more and more from me; but feeling that they are in the path of duty, I do not wish to keep them around me. I only wish, as I advance toward the grave, to have my soul ripen faster than it does for a better world.
               "And what shall I say more? My mind fondly lingers around you. I do wish to see one son take his degree; but it is not to be so. I must be contented here till the Great Ruler points out some other way for me. It is best for me to be kept low in the vale; but it is a solitary mother's privilege to think of her absent children, and, in her poor way, to commit them to a faithful God,"
               In the autumn of this year her oldest son failed to secure a professorship which he had reason to expect. It was a great disappointment to him, as he had declined other favorable offers in order to be at liberty to accept of that.
               When his mother learned the facts in the case, she wrote him as follows:
               "September 17. I wish to rejoice with you in every joy, and to sorrow with you in every sorrow row. I feel for you, and trust that, as a minister of Jesus Christ, you will learn to practice the patience and submission which you teach others. I long to see you wholly devoted to the ministry.... You are my first-bornâ€”given me when I was overwhelmed with sorrow; and you need not wonder that my feelings are intense on your account.
               "The state of uninterrupted prosperity is dangerous, and perhaps God saw it needful for you to meet with this disappointment; but the trials of earth will soon be over, and the realities of eternity open before us.
               "God's eye, my dear son, is upon you; his guardian angels, I trust, will protect you. Write me soon, and let me know whether you have risen above your trials."
               Again:
               "October 19. Had I the pinions of a dove, I would fly and chat a little with you. We are formed for society; and, when we are in trouble, how precious is the sympathy of friends! Our troubles are all necessary."
               Mrs. Dawson's third son became a member of the theological seminary late in the autumn of this year, though not of the one at which his brothers were. Various circumstances led him to prefer another.
               To him she wrote:
               
                  December 22. In this letter she speaks of the sadness she felt when thinking of the college at which she had had one son, and a part of the time two, for the last six years. She had none to think of there now.
               After inquiring if he found kind friends to care for him should he be sick, she says:
               "I must not borrow trouble, but say to you, as my father did to me when we parted for the last time, 'We breathe the same air, tread upon the same earth, have the same sun to shine upon us, and the same God to rule over us.'
               "Although I feel sad to have you so far from me, I do hope you will be an instrument in the hands of God of pointing sinners to Christ....
               "The kindness of my children bears up my spirits. I often think of their anxiety for me and of the help I have from them. It reminds me of the care the Saviour took of his mother when he was on the cross.
               "I think that Heaven's blessing will rest upon my children for their kindness to me.
               "I close by recommending you to live, as much as possible, above the frowns and flatteries of an ensnaring world."
               To her oldest son:
               
                  February 3, 1838. Speaking of precious revivals vals in other places, she says, "I am not without hope that we may yet be remembered by the Lord."
               Living among the mountains, at some distance from the house of God, she was deprived, to a considerable extent, during the winter months, of the public means of grace. This must necessarily be more and more so as age and infirmities came on, and it made letters from her children the more precious to her, especially as her sons, who had usually paid her a visit during the winter while in college, were now too far from her to do it.
               But, much as she desired letters, she was ever ready to find an excuse for her children if they did not write as often as she wished.
               In her letter, to her oldest son, of February 3, she says, "I do hope that God will find some agreeable situation for you away from the seminary. You have now spent many years there, and I hope you will be willing to go to some other part of the vineyard. You should be wholly devoted to the work of the ministry."
               Such was Mrs. Dawson's wish with reference to her sons; and, with all deference to the judgment of her first-born, she never was satisfied to have him linger, year after year, at the seminary, after his course was complete.
               Speaking of two young men who thought they could not take a theological course for the want of means, though they had received property enough to carry them through college, she says, "It astonishes me to think how my sons have teen carried through. Surely we have the greatest call for gratitude that a family ever had. Let God have the glory."
               In order to see the full ground which she had for astonishment, it may be stated here that her sons set out in life without a dollar, and that, instead of such help from home as the children of indigent parents usually receive while in a, course of study, they were under the necessity of aiding their mother and an invalid sister, from the time of their father's death to the end of Mrs. Dawson's life.
               The mother had an ardent desire to do for them, instead of having them do for her; but it was not in her power to aid them much.
               While it was told her from time to time, by one intimately acquainted with the history of her family, that "God was performing as much of a miracle for her and hers as he did for his ancient people when he took them through the desert," well might she say, "We have the greatest cause for gratitude that ever a family had."
               To her oldest son:
               "May 5. Sometimes I am all down. Everything looks gloomy. What a comfort then to have a line from a dear son! I feel the effects of age, and my mind often goes out after something to cheer me. But there is nothing to satisfy the longing desires of an immortal soul, short of heaven.
               "I greatly desire to have my dear, absent children step in and see me now and then; but still wish them all to be employed in the service of God."
               Having heard of the sickness of a grandson, she wrote to his parents as follows:
               "May 7. I have heard of the sickness of your infant, and had it been in my power should have visited you at once. I never felt more anxious to see you. I know what it is to have a lovely infant taken from me; and, should yours be removed, remember that he who takes it, takes but what he gave.
               "Consider your children as blessings only lent you. Do not place your affections too much upon them; but strive to live so that you and your children may eventually meet in heaven. These afflictions are sent to warn you. And let me ask, Should death call for either of you, are you ready?"
               Thus did Mrs. Dawson endeavor to improve every opportunity, by word or by letter, and to turn every providence to account.
               As soon as practicable, she visited the children to whom the last letter was written, but, owing to the state of her own family, could not remain long.
               Upon hearing of the child's death, soon after her return, she wrote to the afflicted parents as follows:
               "June 14. I regret exceedingly that I could not stay with you; but it was so ordered.
               "This affliction was sent to remind you that you are mortal. Strive to make a proper use of it. Set not your affections too much on the children that are left you. If our heavenly Father sees fit to take them too, it becomes us to bow submissively to his will. You have one tie less to earth, and more time for reading, meditation, and prayer.
               "May you have the presence of God with you. I often think of your pleasant home. How different from mine when I first came into this part of the country! Yet some of my happiest days were when I lived in the woods surrounded by my little ones. I thought if I could only get to meeting on the Sabbath, that I should not care about visiting.
               "But sorrow found me even there. Your father's body has long been in the dust, and near him are three little ones. Though many trials have attended me, I love to think on mercies past;' to think of him on whom I leaned. But God saw it needful to remove him at a time when most of all I seemed to need him. All was darkness then, but God has made light to shine out of it. 
                     
                        "He 'moves in a mysterious way
                        His wonders to perform.'"
                     
                  
               
               To her oldest son:
               "June 17. You remark 'that you feel as if the day-star was just arising upon me.' I wish I knew which way to look for it."
               To her second son:
               "July 1. Your term at the seminary will soon close. If you settle in the ministry, I hope it will be where you can attend to the duties of your profession without being encumbered too much by the world.
               "Our Saviour chose seventy, whom he sent forth to preach, and I think he has chosen you and your brothers as much as he did them.
               "What a privilege, my son, to be one of his ambassadors! Go on and be faithful. Expect not great ease or comfort here, but go where duty calls you, and the Lord go with you and bless you."
               To her third brother:
               "July 12. Many and great have been the mercies of God to me and mine. Not that I abound in this world's goods; but we have spiritual mercies.
               "My youngest daughter and her husband have recently, as we hope, both experienced religion. We are getting old; the realities of eternity will soon open before us. It is uncertain whether we meet again in this world; but that is of little importance, if we can meet in glory. All I can do is to lay myself and mine at the Saviour's feet.
               "Now and then I look forward to the time when I shall pass where sin will never come, and then it is 
                     
                        'Sweet to rest in lively hope
                        That, when our change shall come,
                        Angels will hover round our beds
                        And waft our spirits home.'"
                     
                  
               
               After speaking of difficulties and commotions in the surrounding parishes, Mrs. Dawson writes to her third son, July 23:
               "You must be prepared for trials, if you are to preach. Surely Satan hath great wrath, knowing that his time is short.
               "When will the peaceable kingdom of the Redeemer, extend from sea to sea and from shore to shore? Never was I more sensible that we can do nothing without divine aid.
               "How blind, how stupid, is man! I am greatly troubled with stupidity; am not satisfied with my present attainments, but long to live so that I can look into eternity with delight."
               Then, speaking of her home, she says, "I am tired of climbing these hills, and often wish to be where there is more good society; but if I ever get to heaven I shall find enough of it there."
               Her oldest son had written her, some time before, about passing through the valley of the shadow of death, and in reply she writes to him:
               "August 9. What is the reason that I cannot hear often from you? Are you yet in the dark valley, where you cannot get light enough to write me one line?"
               Then, probably in allusion to the impression of many that her pastor dwelt too much upon the decrees of God, she observes:
               "Jay says, in his works now open before me, 'What have we to do with the decrees of God? His commands and invitations meet our duties and our wants.' Leighton also says, 'The decrees are an abyss into which he chooses to sink rather than attempt to fathom them.' If I can do my duty, I will leave results with Him who died to save."
               To the same:
               
                  September 30. Alluding to some of her wants, she says, "It never was my custom to tell all my trials even to my children. They will help me as soon as they can. I never have studied my own ease; but have aimed to be as little expense to them as possible while they are preparing for usefulness. I do not consider this world a place of rest; but my longing soul looks forward to a place in that bright world where sorrow will be no more."
               To her sister:
               "October 11. I learn that our third brother is dead. The strong tie which has bound us together for more than sixty years is broken. We have been hundreds of miles apart for many of those years; but the same ties which bound us in childhood continued to bind us till he was removed. Thus our ranks are broken. Brother, thou art gone before us. We must follow. I view thee as walking the streets of the New Jerusalem.
               "Oh that I were as well prepared to die! Then it would be sweet to go. Though poor in this world, I believe there was a mansion for our brother in heaven. I feel his death deeply. I have lost his prayers."
               
               To her second son:
               "November 11. You, who are surrounded with books, business, and company, know little what it is to be lonely, or how refreshing to me are letters from you. I sometimes fear you are sick; but neither time nor distance can make a mother forget her children. God will take care of me and mine."
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               FROM MRS. DAWSON'S REMOVAL FROM ASHTON TO THE REMOVAL OF THE OLD MEETING-HOUSE.
               FOR many years after the settlement of that part of the country in which Mrs. Dawson lived, the parish and the town, in the rural districts, were identical.
               The towns were laid out about six miles square, on an average, and the meeting-house was placed as hear the center as practicable; but the center of Olney, of which Westford and Ashton were only well-defined and distant neighborhoods, came near the top of a high mountain, which was quite inaccessible on one side. In consequence of this, their first and, for many years, their only meeting-house was some way from the center.
               The building itself, for the place and time in which it was erected, was large and high, having, as memory serves the writer, more than forty windows, with square pews, and, seats upon hinges.
               Excepting the aged and the infirm, the people stood, during the public prayers, all through that region. As some suppose, they were called the "standing order" on that account. To enable them to stand the more conveniently, when they arose they turned the seats up against the sides of the pews, upon the tops of which the worshipers were accustomed to lean.
               The clatter when the seats were let down at the close of the prayer, must be heard to be understood.
               As approached from the north and northwest, this house stood upon an eminence, while to the south, for a considerable distance, extended a table-land. Thither the families of the parish, with great unanimity, went up to worship for many years. Among them were Mr. and Mrs. Dawson, so long as the two journeyed together below. They usually walked, and occasionally carried an infant in their arms, for the purpose of dedicating it to God in the holy ordinance of baptism. On such occasions, as they had five miles to go, up hill and down, they started the day before, and spent the night with some friend on the way.
               The lofty pulpit of that meeting-house, with its model window, according to the custom of the day, was in the west end of the building. At a little distance from that end, separated from it by a narrow carriage-way, was a neat little cottage, with out-buildings, garden, and orchard. It was so near the church that, when the windows were open, the occupant might hear the preacher without leaving the house.
               To this cottage some of Mrs. Dawson's children had for a, number of years wished her to remove. This would bring her near good neighbors, stores, and the post-office, as well as the house of God. But it was some time before she could think such a change was best for her, and then some time longer before her heavenly Father opened the way for her to sell her place where she lived, and purchase the one that eventually became her home.
               Sometimes she seemed near attaining the object which she now desired; then, unexpected obstacles arose, till she says, "I am tired of climbing the hills," But she submitted to what seemed to be the will of God, confident that he would, if it were for the best, in his own time and way effect the change.
               This he did late in the autumn of 1837, and Mrs. Dawson removed from the cottage, where she had known much joy and some sorrow for seventeen years, to the one fast by the house of God.
               It was a matter of great joy to her scattered children, that she had thus in the evening of life secured the very spot that, of all others, she desired, where, almost without effort, she could enjoy the means of grace and obtain what she needed from the stores without "toiling up the hill." Here the piety that had long adorned the cottage on the hill-side, as well as the ones in which Mr. and Mrs. Dawson had sojourned together, brought forth its richest and maturest fruit.
               As she had passed beyond the meridian of life, she had outridden most of the storms that lay in her way to the haven of rest.
               As she had not her former ability to endure trials, so she had not the trials to endure. It was no longer necessary for her to struggle for the means of subsistence. Her children were more and more able to supply her every want, and they were as much disposed as ever to do it.
               After communicating the fact that she had removed, to her oldest son, she says, November 28, "Could you step in and see us, you would say; 'I am glad mother has moved.' I have now the best house we have ever had, and the Saturday night after we came to it found us, I hope, very grateful for all our mercies."
               Owing to her great repugnance to debts, it was with peculiar pleasure she could add, "I owe nothing for the place out of my own family."
               Speaking about her anxiety respecting one of her sons, from whom she had not heard for some time, she says, "Mothers have a thousand feelings that children can never know."
               To another, who appeared to her delinquent in his correspondence, she writes, "If you knew a tenth part of my anxiety on your account, you would not neglect me as you do."
               "To have my children fail to write, is a trying thing to me." Doubtless there were times when, pressed with studies or parochial duties, her children failed to write as often as they should; but, if they wrote often, the intervals might seem long to the mother.
               On the evening of a stormy Sabbath, she writes, "We have all been to meeting, and find it very pleasant living near God's house. I am getting old, and often wish I had some of my sons near to lean upon; but it is not to be so. Hope they will have a single eye to God's glory and live above the world."
               To her oldest son:
               "January 5, 1839. The date of this letter will carry you back to the hour when your father left the world. I cannot let the anniversary of that event pass without a few remarks.
               "Had I realized, during those times of trial, more of God's goodness to me and mine, I should not have felt that extreme sadness under which I often labored.
               "But we are short-sighted; and how often, after you left me to study, did I wet my pillow with tears during the night-watches! God graciously took your father to himself to open a way for you to preach the gospel.
               
               "I love to reflect upon the way in which he has led us; but lament that I am not more grateful to him for his goodness. May we all have some humble part in singing the praises of redeeming love."
               In her view of God's object in removing her partner to another world, as expressed above, Mrs. Dawson was not alone. In the course of this letter she says, "To-morrow is the communion. With what carelessness do many come to that most solemn ordinance!"
               It has often been remarked that afflictions come not alone: in the history of Mrs. Dawson's family it was so of mercies. After her husband's death, she wrestled with God a number of years for her children, before she was cheered by the conversion of one of them. Then, in the course of a few months, half of her family professed their faith in Christ.
               Now she is to have one of her sons after another, in quick succession, placed over churches as under-shepherds.
               The second one first became a pastor; though her oldest had been licensed and ordained for some years. He had spent those years in teaching and in important literary pursuits.
               The second son was ordained and installed, January 23, 1838, and continued to labor in the same field till his divine Master took him home nearly twenty years later.
               The day after his ordination, his mother wrote to him as follows:
               "I trust you are sensible what responsibilities you have assumed. Souls are under your care. I hope you are aware that it is but a part of your duty to preach. Visiting the sick, the poor, the fatherless, the widow, and pouring the balm of consolation into every bleeding heart; these are duties incumbent upon every pastor. I suggest these things, because many pastors neglect them, especially in the case of the poor. It gives a new impulse to such to receive a visit from their pastor, and I have often been distressed to see them neglected.
               "It is pleasant for a pastor to visit his friends, and hard for him to visit those who are not; but these last, even when he knows them to be such, should not be neglected. But, while doing these things, do not neglect your own health. The soul and body sympathize with each other.
               "I rejoice that you are settled, and hope that the candle of the Lord will shine upon you. Gladly would I have been present at your ordination; but I was not permitted to be, and it is doubtful whether I shall ever see the place where your lot is cast."
               To her youngest son:
               
               "January 26. We need much to keep us humble. Pattern after the Saviour. Let no opportunity to speak or act for him go unimproved. Fill up your station with usefulness. Go to God with all your wants. Seek him with your whole heart, and he will carry you safely through."
               To her oldest son:
               "March 12. I am so disappointed about letters, that I know not how to compose my mind to write.
               "If I could, I would fly and see where you are and what you are doing. This life is made up of disappointments; but in heaven there are none."
               In the early years of her widowhood, Mrs. Dawson usually bad a number of her children around her; and, when they went to the academy or to college, their frequently returning vacations allowed them to visit her. But now they were getting more remote from her, and beginning to engage in parochial duties, from which they had not a stated or frequent release. Hence those quarterly visits became annual, and sometimes, though not often, two or three years would glide away between the visits of a particular child. It is no wonder that she wanted letters often. They were her due. The matter was sometimes made worse than it otherwise would have been, by the irregularity of the mails.
               In a letter to her third son, she says"
               "March 27. A great deal is said about ministers; but the truth is, the fault is in the people. Every one wants a minister to please him, whether he pleases God or not."
               Mrs. Dawson was not of that number. If her pastor preached gospel truth, she felt that it was her business to like it, and to endeavor to profit by it.
               The more it probed the heart, the better; for she felt that hers needed to be probed, and never complained of one for preaching too plainly.
               In her letter of the last date, speaking of her new home, she says:
               "I have no wish to go back to the place we left. I find the neighbors exceedingly kind, and am reminded thereby of your words, 'Always be good neighbors, and you will always find such.'
               "As I know myself, all I wish is to be found at the feet of Jesus. Pray that the cause of Christ may flourish; pray for your brothers and sisters, and for me, as for the most unworthy of all."
               In the course of this year her oldest son was invited to settle about twenty-five miles from her, and the prospect of having one so near her was very cheering; but she was doomed to disappointment.
               Upon hearing that he had declined the call, she wrote:
               "June 3. I am exceedingly pained. How fondly I had anticipated your settlement so near me! I cannot get over my disappointment; but so it is. The Lord reigneth; let the earth rejoice, let the people tremble."
               To the same:
               "July 17. Have just taken a letter from the office, which brings me the painful intelligence of my oldest brother's death. The destroyer is making great inroads among us. Dear brother! how hard he labored to build up a college! How many trials he passed through! but they are over, and I trust he is now before the throne, in a world of peace. I cannot grieve because he has gone home. Happy they who have gained the victory."
               "July 22. I think very much about my dear, departed brother. It seems almost as if I could see him crowned with glory in the presence of the Saviour.
               "Shall I ever reach that world? Am sensible that I do not deserve any favor from God; but hope, through the merits of Christ, to be saved."
               Again:
               "September 24. Oh, my dear brother! I think of him during the wakeful hours of night. How calm and peaceful his temper ever since I can remember!
               "I follow his happy spirit to the regions of eternal day, where he has probably met the brother who departed before him."
               Having heard that her oldest son was about to settle in the eastern part of the State, Mrs. Dawson wrote to the one who was already a pastor, "I hope you will both remain longer with your people than some do in this part of the country."
               Those two sons did remain, according to their mother's wish, each at his post, faithful and laborious as pastors, till God took them to himself.
               Mrs. Dawson's impression was, that the most desirable station on earth for a minister was that of a loved pastor of a loved people.
               During the autumn of this year, she writes:
               "My youngest child is a member of college; but how he is to go on I know not. I should despair of his ever getting through, were it not for the goodness of God to those of my family whom he has carded through."
               
               To her sister:
               "October 28. You will see, by the date, that this is the month and the day on which our mother died, forty-three years ago. What scenes we have passed through since! And now we, in turn, are old.
               "Our brothers, one after another, are taken from us; but it must be sweet to die as they did.
               "They had trials while here; but they are now doubtless before the throne. I would give more for peace of mind like theirs, than for all the world. Let me have the presence of Jesus, and farewell to earth's glittering toys."
               This autumn, Mrs. Dawson was sorely disappointed about visits from her sons.
               The oldest, having accepted a call, took a journey for the benefit of his health just before his installation, intimating in a letter to his mother that he might visit her on his way back; but he was on his journey so long that he had not time.
               The second had fixed upon the Sabbath that he expected to be with his mother, and had sent her word to that effect; but the installation of his brother about that time took him in the opposite direction.
               To these disappointments, after the circumstances were made known to her, she meekly submitted, saying, "Surely my third son will not disappoint me."
               He was yet a member of the theological seminary, and, at the end of the session, yielded to the request of the Tract Society to go South for them, not being aware of his mother's disappointment with respect to his brothers.
               "Thus," she writes to one of the three, "was I sorely disappointed. Not one of you came home; but I trust you were better employed. I have a claim upon my children, and you must remember that I am growing old. I never was so long separated from my sons before; and to be on these cold mountains, without seeing those whom I love, makes me feel lonely. Yet I hope it will do me good, and teach me to look to Him who promises to be with his people till the world shall end."
               Again she writes, "My mind is much upon my absent children, I never thought more of them. The older I grow, the more I cling to them. I wish I could cling more and more to the Saviour.
               "I think much of my dear departed friends, and sometimes long to join the glorious company in heaven."
               To her second brother:
               "December 25. Our once happy family is dropping ping, one after another, into the grave. I have thought much of our brothers who have gone before us. How hard the oldest labored while he lived! but his end was glorious. I look upon the pleasures of the world as a bubble."
               Then, speaking of the long time that had elapsed since she had seen her sons, she adds, "But they must be about their Master's work."
               Such was ever her spirit. As a lonely mother, she longed to have her children with her; but if she could feel that the Lord had need of them elsewhere, and that they were engaged in his service, she would willingly forego the pleasure she derived from their society.
               The last letter of this year was addressed to her third son, who was nearly through with his theological course of study. It was in answer to one written by him. Their letters had so strangely failed to reach their destination that she thinks this is the first she had received from him for six months.
               Respecting it, she writes:
               "December 26. Yours gave me so much animation that I must write you another, though I mailed one for you quite recently."
               Then, referring to her late removal, which gave her children much satisfaction, she says:
               "It gives me very great delight to have them acquiesce in what I have done."
               To her oldest son:
               "January 14, 1840. It is always pleasant for me to write to my children. I should love to write every week."
               "January 19. I have risen early. It is yet dark, and a precious time to contemplate the goodness of God. Though not about to go to the sepulcher with the pious women of old, I hope to meet my Saviour. I feel unworthy of the mercies I enjoy, and at times think, if I were called away, as some of my brothers have been, that I should not have support like theirs in a dying hour. Then, again, my soul is in a calm and peaceful frame, and I am almost lost in, the contemplation of the glories that await the redeemed. But perhaps those glories are not for me.
               "During the wakeful hours of night, I think of the past, especially of those times when my children were about me. Pleasant times! why did I not prize them more and improve them better? But I would not go back."
               To her oldest daughter:
               "Januaryâ€”. I am not accustomed to sleep in the morning. It is sweet, when all around us is still, to think of God's preserving goodness through the night, and to seek his protecting care for the day."
               Happy would it be for all had they a heart to rise early for a similar purpose!
               To her third son:
               "February 5. I feel as if I had never done anything for God's glory. How great are his mercies toward us! How kind he has been to us! If we can have the divine presence, no lot is hard, no event unwelcome. 
                     
                        'How sweet to be where Jesus is,
                        And to behold his face!'
                     
                   How precious his language to his disciples, Lo, I am with you! Let not your heart be troubled. How favored the lot of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, to have Jesus in person with them, and to follow Christ to Gethsemane, and thence to Calvary! How solemn!
               "Oh that ministers would dwell on these themes more!"
               To her oldest son:
               "May 22. I see by the paper that you have quite a revival among your people. Bless the Lord, O my soul, that there is one anywhere. Perhaps God will have mercy on us here yet."
               To the same:
               "July 14. If I am ever so happy as to meet my children in heaven, with what transports we shall talk over our trials here! If there ever was a mother whose heart ought to overflow with gratitude to God for his goodness in giving her the best of children, I am that mother. Even the youngest says, 'My happiness consists much in knowing that you are happy.'"
               The following sentence will show how repugnant it was to her to be in debt: "I long to draw one breath free from debt." We have seen before that her constant aim was to be as free from it as possible.
               To her only sister:
               "July 25. My children have not all been together for eighteen years. I would be very glad to have some of my sons near me; but God has ordered it otherwise. My affections are too much upon them; but I sometimes hope that I love my Saviour more than I do them. I do not like to have you live alone; but the presence of God in the soul is better than all earthly society."
               Speaking of the embarrassments of her pastor on account of his inadequate support, she says, "People will have a solemn account to give, in the day of judgment, for their unwillingness to support the gospel."
               
               During this year, Mrs. Dawson met with the memoir of that remarkable man of God, Lemuel Haynes. After reading it, she commended it to her children, and sent a copy of it to her sister.
               In an accompanying note she expresses her longing desire to spend a few weeks among the scenes of her early life, from which she had been removed about forty years. She ever retained a lively interest in the place of her birth, and loved to meet with those who came thence.
               During this year her third son, having completed his full course of preparatory studies, was ordained and installed pastor of a church in one of the Middle States.
               Having three of her family sustaining the responsible relations of pastors, it is not to be wondered at that she wrote to one of them as follows:
               "I never was more sensible than I have been the past summer, what responsibilities are laid upon ministers of the gospel. Be watchful, faithful, and great shall be your reward. A faithful pastor must visit his people; but there is a great want of fidelity in many."
               Mrs. Dawson mourned, very much, the omission of the monthly concert of prayer for missions; and, after it had been omitted for some months in the church with which she was connected, she requested her pastor to revive it. She also asked one or more of the officers of the church to use his influence to have it observed again; and eventually one was appointed at her own cottage by her request.
               She thought the omission of that concert a great neglect, and indicative of a low state of piety.
               To her second brother:
               "October 2. It is not for want of affection that I write you so seldom. My circumstances do not allow me to write oftener."
               Speaking of her third son as now in the ministry, she says, "It is all of God. In my widowed state I have endeavored to give them all to him, and have besought him to lead them in a way that would be for his glory. I cannot complain, though not one of them is near me.
               "I love to reflect upon God's goodness to me these forty years,â€”to think of past trials, and how he has preserved me and mine through them. I am entirely unworthy of these mercies. "
               In another letter to the same brother, a little later, she says, "It is forty-five years since the death of our mother: 
                     
                        'Friend after friend departs;
                        Who has not lost a friend?'
                     
                  
               
               
               "I often think of friends who have gone to heaven, and long to be with them; but my spirits sink in the view of my own sins. The fullness there is in Christ is my only hope.
               "I long to see you and yours. May we eventually meet, a whole family, in heaven, if we meet no more here."
               Her children, with a single exception, she writes to this brother, were now members of the Church; and that the one who was not, had been in an anxious state of mind for years.
               To the wife of her second son:
               "October 21. Little did I think, when I was left a widow, that I should ever hear three of my sons preach the gospel. Those were gloomy days; but there is a pleasure in thinking of them. God's eye was then upon us, and I tried again and again, in my poor way, to give my children to him.... I do not wish to take any of them back."
               To her second son and his wife:
               "December 5. My only hope is in the Saviour, upon whom I would concentrate my affections. To me this world appears gloomy, especially at this time, on account of the low state of religion in this whole region.
               "Could I fly, how soon I would clasp you in my arms! But this body cannot fly. If we are Christians,â€”and my soul is almost transported at the thought,â€”when this mortal shall put on immortality we shall soar away to worlds unknown, where dear Christian friends will part no more. While laboring for others, remember your duty to yourselves, and see that your lamps are trimmed and burning."
               Speaking of various deaths, she adds those well-known words of Watts: 
                     
                        "'And fierce diseases lurk around,
                        To hurry mortals home."
                     
                  
               
               To her youngest son, in college:
               "December 7. Often do I reflect upon the times before your father died, and upon the scenes through which we have passed since he left us. Often some trifle carries me back to the infancy of my children, and awakens emotions which I cannot suppress. Though I did all I could for the bodies of my children, I mourn my unfaithfulness to their souls. I think children are capable of understanding their state by nature much sooner than most suppose. I do long, at times, to sit under the preaching of some of my sons, and to hear the precious truths of the Bible as they fall from their lips.
               "Remember that my happiness depends very much upon the good behavior of my children and upon their devotion to God."
               Again, at a later date, she says, "None of my family can realize how much my happiness depends upon the spiritual and temporal happiness of my children; and these are so connected that I think a person cannot be temporally happy unless he has true peace within."
               1841. It would seem, from some parts of Mrs. Dawson's letters, that she occasionally feared that her children might grow weary of aiding her; and the existence of such a fear, however groundless, led her to say, in a letter to her second son and his wife, "Be not discouraged: the Lord keeps a record of all your kindness, and you will not lose your reward."
               Speaking of a powerful revival in a neighboring town, she says, "All our encouragement here is, that there is nothing too hard for the Lord." Then, alluding to what one of her sons had said about building a meeting-house in a certain place, she remarks, "I hope they will succeed; for it must be a dreary place to live where there is no worship of the true God."
               Alluding to the past, she says:
               "I often think of the time when I labored hard for my children. Then their presence cheered me; but now, when they are far from me, I am cheered by the thought that they are engaged in the service of God. I think I am willing to be separated from them if they are employed in guiding sinners to Christ. Yet nature clings to them. None can know the feelings of a widowed mother but those who are such. All I ask is, that I may have the presence of the Saviour and communion with him; but I often fear and tremble."
               Thus did the struggle, so often observed before, go on between grace and nature. The one would gather her children around her that she might enjoy their society, but the other triumphed; and she rejoiced if they were serving God, though that service took them far from her.
               To her second brother:
               "June 9. I should be exceedingly glad to see my brothers and their families once more. I think much of my deceased friends, and especially of my husband, since my children are so much scattered, though he has been dead over twenty-one years."
               To her third son:
               "September 13. We took a ride one afternoon to Westford. I had not been in sight of our old home before for eight years or more; and it is impossible to tell you what emotions the sight of that spot awakened in my mind. There your father and I toiled along the rugged path of life together, with our little ones around us. We wore everything to each other. How many spots on that farm are made sacred by his prayers! But he was removed, and I left to travel the dreary path of life alone; and dreary it had been but for my dear children. My son, be faithful, preach the whole Bible, but dwell more on Christ and him crucified than you do on election."
               This last remark was elicited in consequence of the very general impression that her pastor was dwelling unduly upon that and other abstruse doctrines of the Bible.
               In the autumn of 1841, Mrs. Dawson "had a very severe attack of the inflammatory fever," from which, by the kindness of her heavenly Father, she mainly recovered in the course of a few weeks.
               In allusion to this sickness, she says, in a letter to her son:
               "January 8, 1842. The more feeble I am, the more I am attached to my children."
               Her youngest son had, by her request, spent his winter vacation with her, instead of visiting; his brothers, as he had intended to do; and, in allusion to the time he had been at home, she writes, "He has been a great comfort to us, and when he left us to return to college, we were not obliged to part without prayer, as we were once when you were hurried away." It was her wish to begin and prosecute every journey and every undertaking with prayer.
               To the same:
               
                  March 12. Alluding to her pastor, she says, "Dear man of God, I love him as I do my own sons."
               Though he did not dwell sufficiently upon Christ crucified to suit her, she did sincerely love him as a devoted Christian and an indefatigable laborer in his Master's vineyard.
               And such were her feelings toward every pastor she ever had, as soon as she became satisfied that it was his purpose to do the work of the Lord with becoming zeal and fidelity.
               As she advanced in years, and young men took charge, from time to time, of the church of which she was a member, they were to her much as her own sons, and soon learned to go to her with their joys and sorrows, much as they would to their own mother.
               As the most convenient and central spot, and at her request, prayer-meetings were often appointed twice a week at her cottage; and, though few attended, they were precious seasons to her.
               "But, alas!" she says, "the good old fathers and mothers, who used to hold up the hands of the ministers, are gone. They are now before the throne. Shall I ever join them? 
                     'That, mighty God, to thee is known.'
                  
               
               "I have ever been a very unprofitable servant. I long for more love, more holiness, more of a spirit of prayer."
               Alluding to what God was doing elsewhere, she writes:
               "March 15. Are there none here to be brought in? Must we be passed by? I cannot give up yet."
               Thus was this mother in Israel ever wrestling for a revival of religion, unless she was rejoicing in one.
               No sooner was one spiritual harvest gathered in, than she began to labor and pray for another; thinking it "a delightful task to work for God."
               To her second son:
               "July 18. My constitution is much broken. I have frequent ill turns, but hope, with care, to enjoy some degree of health yet. I know not how long God intends to keep me here. I wish to live to him; but come short in everything. I have done so little good, that my life had better be passed in obscurity. I regret that I ever gave you any encouragement of writing a sketch of it.
               "I have had more sickness the past year than I have had during any year before since the death of your father. The grasshopper is becoming a burden."
               To her sister:
               "September 1. With us, time will soon be over. I often ask, Am I prepared to change worlds? I have done little for Christ. My only hope is in his merits. May we be prepared for the change that awaits us."
               1843. Mrs. Dawson's surviving brothers, her only sister, and herself, were advancing in years. She was the youngest of the family; but her troubles and toils caused her to look much older than her sister, most of whose life had been one continued scene of tranquillity.
               In most respects they were much alike; and happy had it been for them could they have spent the evening of their days, as they did the morning, together.
               But their lots were cast far apart. They seldom met, and, owing to circumstances beyond their control, did not correspond as often as they otherwise would have done.
               Writing to this sister, she says:
               "February 6, 1843. My health is poor. I have been confined to the house; but am better, and may be restored. God only knows. Our stay on earth must now be short. Could I bring you here on the wings of the wind, gladly would I do it.
               "Should I live, and my health continue poor, I must give up housekeeping. But I leave the future with Him who has guided us thus far.
               "Should you wish to know my state of mind during my sickness, I would say: 
                     
                        'A heaven I sometimes hope to see,
                        But fear, again, 'tis not for me.'
                     
                  
               
               "It is a great thing to be a Christian. Clouds and darkness are often about me. May we be prepared to join our loved ones in heaven."
               To her second brother:
               "April 14. We are in years, and shall soon be through with earthly things. This life is a checkered scene. It is uncertain whether I ever recover my health."
               After nearly two months, she takes her pen again, and says:
               "I have been brought to the gates of death. My children were all called home. I am now better; but what God is sparing me for, I know not. Hope it may be for his glory. It would take but little to remove me. May we be prepared for our change, come when it may."
               To her second son and his wife:
               "July 3. Through the goodness of our heavenly Father, I am so far recovered as to be able to write; but I feel very lonely, as we have no pastor.... Time passes swiftly, and we shall soon be in eternity. How sweet it must be for the Christian to enter into rest! When I think over the mercies of God to me and mine, my ingratitude amazes me."
               In her estimation, a parish without a settled, evangelical pastor was a gloomy place. Whatever were its natural beauties or its acquired charms, the main attraction of it, for her, was wanting. We have never known one who prized the means of grace more.
               To her oldest son:
               "July 12. My spirits often sink when I think of my scattered children; but the thought that they are in the service of God, reconciles me to all. I desire to leave you in his hands, and pray that you may be complete in the Lord."
               To her second son:
               "September 26. The times here look a little more encouraging. We have a minister hired for three months. How fondly I have anticipated spending the winter with you! but I must abandon the thought of it."
               
               To her sister:
               "September 30. Life to us has been a toilsome journey; but God has not forsaken us. Our mercies far outweigh our trials. Let us bear up a little longer. We shall soon be here no more. If we can have Christ for our friend, and eventually be with him forever, our brief trials will be of no account."
               Her youngest son had now taken his degree at college, toward which she had looked for ten years as the home of one or more of her family. The Rubicon had been passed by him as well as by the others.
               In allusion to the graduation of her youngest son, she writes, in the letter of the last date:
               "What has God done for my poor, fatherless children! How many days and nights of anxiety I have passed on their account! My only consolation has been in carrying them to Him who gave them to me. Many times, in years past, have I wet my pillow by night with tears, and asked why my partner was taken from me.
               "It was long before I could understand God's purpose in that affliction; but I see it now."
               To her oldest son:
               "October 4. I am often depressed, and long to hear you sing one of the songs of Zion."
               That dear son, who knew so much of his mother's joys and sorrows, hopes and fears, could sing at times, with almost angelic sweetness, those precious strains which touched the mother's soul, and bore her away toward those celestial regions where mother and son may now, without obstruction, tune their harps to the praise of redeeming love.
               To her sister:
               "December 26. My health has not been good for eighteen months, and, but for my children, I should be in a poor condition. In my feeble state I have thought much of you. Who will care for you when you are sick? Often do I think of our friends In the place of our birth, and visit them in thought. I long also, though my own home is very pleasant, to be near my sons."
               This sister had no children, and none of her kindred were near her: hence the anxiety expressed for her in the lines above. Mrs. Dawson was now more and more reaping the reward of her fidelity to her children, and of her prayers on their account.
               The little fatherless ones for whom she had wrestled and wept much had grown to maturity, and, with a single exception, were members of evangelical churches.
               The mother had toiled hard for them in days gone by, and now they found it a privilege to afford her all needed aid, as, amid the increasing infirmities of age, she gradually verged toward the grave.
               Her little cottage, sheltered from the rising sun by the overshadowing sanctuary, and from its descending rays by a hillock along the side of which grew her fruits and her flowers, was more and more the resort of the devoted servants of Jesus,â€”the only kind of company she loved, both from public and from private life.
               Such were ever welcome to share with her her frugal meal, or, if weary, to repose in the "little chamber on the wall."
               She took great delight in talking with them about the things of the kingdom, whether on earth or in heaven, and in joining with them in prayer and praise.
               Most hallowed spot! How it comes up before the writer's mind, as he knew it in all the sweetness and sanctity of days gone to return no more! Here Mrs. Dawson, with her invalid daughter, who was learning more and more to sit at Jesus' feet, spent many precious hours. Her sons had been connected with different colleges and theological seminaries, not to speak of the academies and other schools in which they had either studied or taught, and through them she became extensively known.
               The transient preacher, or educated stranger, though not in the sacred office, especially if a Christian, as he passed that way, was apt to call and see the mother for the sake of one or another of her sons, whom he knew; and, having once made her acquaintance, these classes of persons were wont to improve every opportunity to call and see her for her own sake.
               Her cottage thus gradually became the resort of that kind of company with which she had been familiar in her father's house, and in which she found her purest earthly enjoyment.
               Her pastor, too, whose home was near her own, often called, and ever found a welcome.
               Her temporal wants were now well supplied. Thus, after many years of trials and strugglings, was God gradually crowning her advancing years with those very sources of happiness, both in kind and degree, which her nature craved, and of which her early days gave promise.
               In the first years of her wedded life, she had been led into the profound depths of the wilderness where she had sojourned a long time; but now she was rapidly coming up from it, purified as by fire, and leaning the more confidingly on the arm of the Beloyed, because of the way he had been pleased to lead her.
               In March, 1844, Mrs. Dawson heard of the death of her second brother, who departed this life, apparently, in the triumphs of faith, like the two who had gone before him to the eternal world. Thus was she left with only one brother and sister, from both of whom she was far removed.
               One-half of that lovely band of children who once occupied and adorned the village parsonage, in which they were born, had now joined their parents beyond the flood; the other yet lingered here.
               Though she had seldom met her brothers for many years, she deeply felt their departure as one after another they were called away.
               "Dear brother!" she writes; "his death brings the past fresh to my mind. I trust he has met our parents and the brothers who have gone before him where they see Jesus as he is. May we look daily to the world of glory, and plead with God for preparation to enter there in his own time."
               May 20, she-writes, "My only hope is in Christ."
               Again, "I wish to be kept informed in regard to the circumstances of my children. If in prosperity, I would rejoice with them; if in adversity, I would sympathize with them."
               After the dismissal of their pastor, early in the year 1843, the church of which Mrs. Dawson was a member continued vacant for some time.
               It often happened that it had no supply for the Sabbath; which rendered the aspect of things very gloomy to her.
               At length God sent them one who labored among them, with general acceptance, for several years. He found a quiet home for a time in her cottage, and became to her all that a son could be.
               After his first engagement had expired, and while it was yet uncertain whether they would be able to secure his services for a longer time, she wrote to one of her sons as follows:
               "May 30. I thought I prized ministers highly enough before; but, if we have one settled here again, I think I shall prize him more than ever."
               "August 30. A minister needs the prayers of God's people, and their sympathy too."
               To one of her sons, who had spoken of being the poorest of those in the ministry, she wrote:
               "That one is the greatest who is the most humble and lives the nearest to God. I know not that I ever prayed that my children might be great, but that they might be kept from sin, have supreme love to God, stand fast in an evil day, and be guarded against false doctrine; for many deceivers are gone out into the world."
               
               To her second son and his wife:
               
                  September 22. After expressing her fears that they would not be able to keep the minister who had been preaching to them for some time, she writes, "I never had such a sense of the importance of the means of grace in a place, as I have had of late.
               "We do not make half sacrifice enough for the cause of Christ. The thought of being without the preaching of the gospel held my eyes waking. Blessed be God, who has not wholly forsaken us! We expect the minister who has been preaching for us a few weeks past will move into town, and not only preach for us, but live among us. This arrangement takes a great burden from my mind. We hope that God will yet appear for us.
               "I never felt the importance of denying ourselves as I have of late. If I know my own heart, I had rather lie at my Saviour's feet and bathe them with my tears than have all the treasures of the world."
               Millerism was now producing considerable excitement in that part of the country in which Mrs. Dawson lived; and when a poor, ignorant man predicted the end of the world, she said, "We shall see whether God has revealed more to him than he did to his own dear Son," Matt. xxiv. 36.
               1845. The last few years have wrought great changes in the location of the towns and villages in the mountainous regions of New England. We have stated that, in the early settlement of those parts, the churchâ€”which, as the town and parish were identical, was the property of the townâ€”was located as near the center of the district to which it belonged, as practicable. Around it, in most cases, eventually arose more or less of a village, which was the central point for the country around. There were the stores, taverns, post-office, and shops for various mechanical purposes. We know not that a single church in all that region could be found standing out alone, as they often are found in the Middle and Southern States.
               But gradually, as people thought more of manufactures and less of husbandry, locations along the streams became important, and the settlements away from them, and often quite above them, were gradually abandoned.
               This transition had already been going on for some time in Olney; and the progress of it has since been such that our stores, our taverns, our post-office, and our shops are all gone, and we do not think another building will ever be put up in what was once the center of that town.
               Even now, as we write, the traveler finds only a common where once stood a sanctuary that God often honored with his especial presence, and that, as we think eternity will show, was the birthplace of souls and the gate of heaven to many.
               As early as 1845, Mrs. Dawson found empty houses around her, which led her to say, "We should be very lonely were it not for our Sabbath-day privileges."
               Such was her estimate of the means of grace that if she could have evangelical preaching on the Sabbath, attend prayer-meetings during the week, and have a call now and then from her pastor or other pious friends, she seemed contented, though she had, little of what the world calls society.
               Speaking of her minister, she says, "He seems more like a son than anything else." And such was her uniform testimony respecting him, even long after he ceased to be her minister.
               Again she says, "I do love the ministers of Jesus." She loved them as his ministers, and wished for no better entertainment than to listen to them as they discoursed on some important gospel theme, in her own house or elsewhere.
               Now and then she might ask a question; but more generally she would listen in silence, and state her difficulties or ask her questions after the conversation was over.
               To her oldest son and his wife, after the very sudden death of the mother of the latter in their house, she wrote:
               "February 15. How sweet to fall asleep on earth to awake in heaven, where we shall endure sorrow and pain no more! Were we called to go as suddenly, should we be as safe? I often fear that I shall be found on the left hand; but sometimes a gleam from heaven darts into my mind and leads me to hope that I shall eventually join the blessed company above. How sweet to be where Christ is all in all! My prayer for my children is, that they may love God supremely."
               As she had evidence that they did thus love him, in her estimation all was well. In comparison, she had little concern about anything else.
               To her sister she writes:
               "May 23. I am very much favored in living so near meeting.... I never was so sensible as I have been the past year what a privilege the Sabbath is.
               "I long to feel more of the love of Christ; but, if I was ever so sure of heaven, the thought of lost souls would bring a sadness over me."
               Such was the benevolence of her heart. It was not enough for her to feel that she and her children were safe; she would do all in her power to bring others into a like precious state, and forget her own joys in contemplation of the calamities to which others were exposed.
               Again to her sister:
               "August 13. I love to go to the house of God. To be separated from his people and to be shut up with his enemies would be a punishment greater than I could bear."
               Had she continued to live, as she had formerly done, on the hill-side, one mile from the house of God, seldom, at this period of her life, had she been able to attend upon the means of grace, much as she delighted in them. It was long before she could be induced to change her dwelling there for the one close by the house of God; but, when she had done it, nothing could have induced her to retrace her steps.
               Again she says, May 5, "The most I look forward to is the Sabbath. I think I love it."
               After the death of a little grandson, she writes to his mother, "I used to think, when my children were infants, that there was no time when it was so hard to part with them as at that tender age. How they twine around our hearts! But I have altered my mind: the older they grow, the stronger the ties that bind us together."
               Such were her mature views, before she had been called to weep over the grave of an adult child.
               On account of frequent changes in the ministry, and exciting parish meetings close by her cottage, she writes:
               "September 4. I long for the good old paths in which our fathers used to walk. Then, if a minister was settled, it was for life."
               Instead of a pastor, the church in Olney had depended upon supplies for some time. Some were engaged for a year, others for a shorter period. Sometimes they had no preacher; and this state of things led Mrs. Dawson to say, "A place cannot flourish without the preaching of the gospel."
               Her views of her own character are expressed in the following sentence:
               "October 10. Some say their past lives look like a blank; but mine appears rather like mountains of sin rising upon mountains."
               At other times she speaks of her own life as a blank, as others do.
               We often find in her letters remarks like the following:
               "November 15. I should be very lonely but for the frequent calls of our dear minister."
               When asked by one of her children if her pastor tor continued as kind as ever, her prompt reply was, "Kinder than ever. It seems as if he could not do too much for us."
               Thus, in the absence of her own sons, whom "she did desire at times to lean upon," God raised up for his handmaid one who was all that a son could be, in the person of one of his ministers.
               Mrs. Dawson had been a member of the same church from an early period of its existence; and she enjoyed the unwavering friendship of all who ministered to it for any length of time, so long as she lived.
               To her second daughter:
               "December 31. The year is just closing, and I would ask myself, 'Am I better prepared for eternity than I was a year ago?' I dare not say I am.... I seldom go out, except to the house of God, where I do love to go."
               But, much as she had loved the Sabbath and its holy ordinances from the early part of her Christian life, she seems to delight in them more and more, till her earthly Sabbaths faded away into the "nobler rest above."
               1846. For a number of years Mrs. Dawson had a daughter teaching in one of the Middle States, as well as a son settled in the ministry there.
               Writing to the former about the beginning of the year, she says, "May we all, if spared, live more to the glory of God than we have done, and strive harder to build up the Redeemer's kingdom."
               Then she says, "It is twenty-six years since the death of your father. Many are the gloomy days and anxious nights through which I have passed since, and many have been the calls upon me for gratitude and thanksgiving."
               To one in her circumstances, whose large family were, with one exception, far from her, the reduction of postage was a matter for joy. If, after that, she was less careful than before to fill her large sheets, she wrote more frequently.
               To her oldest son:
               "January 23. My mind goes out after my absent children. I sometimes desire to have them near me; but I have long since given you all up to God, who will not, I trust, forsake us now, after he has led us so far through this thorny wilderness."
               Her youngest son had now gone to a distant theological seminary; and it made her feel sad to have him so far from her and from his elder brother, with whom and with whose people he had passed many pleasant days while in college.
               
               In a letter dated May 10, she says, "I am more and more convinced of the necessity of a permanent ministry. What is a place without it?"
               To her sister:
               "June 8. It is evening. The full moon shines into my window; but my mind flies away to your home, where I fancy you sit alone. How I should love to step in and comfort you!"
               She then speaks of a visit she had received from two of the widows of her husband's brothers. The four brothers had gone to their rest; but their widows survived, and they were now well advanced in life. Three of them were thus together for the first time for many years.
               "Before the close of the day, we sent," she says, "for our beloved pastor, who read and prayed with us. Then we sang the words beginning,â€” 
                     'When shall we three meet again?'
                   and parted, to meet no more in like manner, we think, in this world."
               In the spring of this year her fourth sonâ€”her youngest childâ€”was licensed to preach the gospel, and shortly after visited his mother, from whom he had been separated more than two years. If we remember that this child was very young at the time of his father's death, and how his mother had struggled for her children during many years of widowhood, it will readily be seen that this event must have been one of great interest to her.
               How varied the scenes through which she and her family had passed since her oldest son bade her farewell to go and fit himself to preach the gospel!
               The cloud was then before her, and how dark! Gradually it had moved, till it stood behind her, and now it was light in the Lord.
               Could she have seen her daughter, "who had been anxious for years," brought into the fold of Christ, her cup of mercies had overflowed.
               Her sons were not only ministers, but, without exception, they were preaching the doctrines which she had carefully instilled into their minds while they were yet with her in their youthful days. Had one of them preached error instead of truth, her joy in the others had been more than counterbalanced. But there was no such dreg in her cup.
               October 26, she writes, "It is a great thing to be a Christian. I often fear that I never was regenerated; but endeavor to go and tell Jesus my doubts and fears. Happy they who are safe in heaven!"
               To her sister:
               "October 28. It is fifty years since our mother died. How many scenes of joy and sorrow we have passed through since! The approach of winter brings you much to my mind."
               "November 3. It is sweet to review the dealings of the Lord with me and mine. I often feel as if I could lay all my children at Jesus' feet. I ask not for them gold or the honors of the world, but that they may devote their whole lives to the service of God."
               "November 7. The remembrance of my native place is precious, and I often linger there in thought with great interest, though I have been away many years."
               1847. On the verge of seventy Mrs. Dawson says, "I once thought that a person could hardly wish to live beyond that period; but I find that life is sweet."
               The following extract from a letter dated February 13, shows something of the order of her house:
               "We are in the habit of retiring about eight, and of rising about five. We usually take breakfast by candle-light. It is a sweet time, when all around us is still, to read the word of God, sing our morning hymns, and otter up our devotions to God."
               Such was the custom of this mother in Israel, even in those cold midwinter mornings, after she had entered upon her seventieth year. She had ordinarily no pressing engagements to cause her to rise so early; but she found it a "sweet time" for prayer and praise.
               "February 26. I can truly say, Hitherto hath the Lord helped us."
               On the 26th of July she was called to part with the only sister she ever had. They were strongly attached to each other, though they had seldom met for many years.
               This death was a very heavy blow to her. Excepting the dust of departed kindred which reposed there, she had now no special attraction to the place of her birth.
               Her near kindred were dead or removed to other parts of the country. It was said that this departed sister "had no enemies, but many friends," in the community where her whole life was spent, and where, in her very quiet way, she too had been a happy illustration of that cottage piety which we are endeavoring to exemplify. So far as related to her own brothers and sister, Mrs. Dawson was now left almost alone. One of the former only remained to her, and he was in the Far West.
               It was a very solemn time to her when a number of articles that had first belonged to her mother, then to her sister, reached her cottage. They naturally carried her back to early days, when the whole family dwelt together in peace and love at the old village parsonage.
               
               In the month of April came another exciting scene in the parish of Olney, about their minister. An effort was made to raise the means to retain him; but the success of the effort was for a time doubtful.
               This very doubt "distressed" Mrs. Dawson; "made her tremble lest she should lose her pastor, and almost made her envy those who had a minister settled over them whom they could love."
               "It is impossible," she says, in one of her letters, "to tell how the prospect of losing our pastor [supply] affected me for weeks;" but when it was arranged for him to stay another year, her spirit found rest. It was so hard for her to part with a faithful preacher who had been ministering to her, that she urged her sons not to leave their people while they were loved by them, though they were poor, and could get a better support elsewhere.
               "May 27. It is moving-time. One who has been my neighbor ever since I came here, and with whom we have lived in great harmony, has moved, and other neighbors are moving; but so long as we can keep our beloved minister, I do not mean to complain."
               Such was ever her attachment to the faithful ministers of Jesus.
               In October her youngest son was ordained to the full work of the ministry, and took charge of a church. On that occasion, as we have before stated, the three brothers came together from their distant fields of labor to ordain the fourth. They had not all been together before for many years. It was a day of great interest to them and to the community around; but the mother could not be there."
               Referring to it, she writes to one of the sons:
               "November 6. How I longed to be with you! Blessed forever be the name of the Lord, who has seen fit to put you all into the ministryâ€”the most glorious work ever intrusted to man."
               She then glances at the way in which the Lord had led her and hers, from the time in which she was left a widow, and says, "How sad had been my situation, but for the promises which have been fulfilled to me and mine!"
               But the very day that was made joyful to her by this ordination was made sad by the removal, from the parish in which she lived, of the one who had preached to them for several years.
               Thus are the joys and sorrows of life mingled together. What she had been fearing for some time had come upon her. It was a "serious blow to her," and the anticipations of it "had caused her health to decline for six weeks."
               
               She writes:
               "November 18. I desire no higher office for my sons than to have them faithful ministers of Jesus Christ."
               For some time after the removal of their minister, there was no preaching in the church where she worshiped. This led her to say, "The worst of all is to be deprived of my precious Sabbath privileges. But God has wise designs in all he does. I must leave all with Him who has supported me thus far."
               To her second daughter:
               "January 1, 1848. Oh that this might be a happy new year to our souls, and that God would visit his people with his Holy Spirit in an especial manner!"
               Then, speaking of their pulpit-supplies, who came into town on the morning of the Sabbath and left the same day after the close of the services, she says, "For my part, I want a minister on week-days as well as on the Sabbath.
               "It almost gave a finishing stroke to my health to have our former minister leave us; and I could not for weeks shake off the depression of spirits which it caused me."
               Then, recurring, as she was wont to do at the beginning of the year, to the solemn scenes of 1820 and to the way in which God had led her since, she asks, "Shall I now despair? Will not God in his own time grant us a pastor?" To her this was one of the greatest mercies for which she could ask. She then says, "People do not pray enough for their ministers."
               After Mrs. Dawson had seen all her children but one brought into the Church, and that one looked upon as a Christian by those who knew her best, and especially after her sons were all well settled as pastors, it might be expected that she would relax a little in her spirit of wrestling prayer, which had hardly known abatement for many years, and give herself a little rest in the advanced evening of life. But she never felt that her work was done,â€”that her efforts might cease or be suspended. On the contrary, she wrote, the day that she was seventy years old:
               "January 8. Since the ordination of my youngest son, I feel as if I ought to be more earnest in prayer for my children than ever; and so distressed have I been for them, at times, that I have felt as if I ought to be constantly looking to God for them."
               Again, "My sons have lain with great weight on my mind since the youngest was ordained. My daily prayer for them is that they may be found faithful, and not look for the praise of man, but to the glory of God." To her it was not enough that they were ambassadors of Christ: she felt that she "must pray for them more than ever."
               In the same letter she says, "I feel as if I had done little good in the world; but I long to be ready for that rest which remains for the people of God."
               She speaks of this winter as the most lonely she had ever spent in the place. Why was it? She gives the answer in the following words:
               "Hitherto there has always been a minister in the parish; now there is none."
               During the early part of this year, much was said about the venerable church-edifice which overshadowed Mrs. Dawson's cottage, and to which the people of the parish had gone up to worship, ever since the settlement of the town. Some wished to repair it; others, to take it down and build elsewhere. The excitement growing out of this state of things greatly disturbed the one of whom we write. "While our former preacher was with user she says, "none could prize our privileges more than I did; but now, when I am deprived of them, I mourn that I did not improve them better."
               It was at length determined to take down the old meeting-house, and to build another elsewhere.
               But to be deprived of her minister and of the sanctuary within the walls of which she had very often communed with Jesus, been refreshed by his word and ordinances, and seen many devote themselves to God, were the greatest trials she had experienced for many years.
               "These things," she says, "have hurt my health more than anything else." Blow by blow she must see the sacred old edifice demolished, "whence millions of prayers had ascended to God," while a thousand recollections of scenes which had transpired within its walls rose before her mind. Almost every blow that was struck would fall upon her ear.
               "Sad indeed," says her daughter, "was the day to mother when the sound of the hammer was first heard upon that building in the work of destruction. It is hard to conceive what her feelings were as she saw that work going on day after day and week after week."
               She had often seen the glory of the Lord fill that house, as his people went to inquire in his temple.
               Within those walls, she hoped, some of her children had been born again. There five of them had professed their faith in Christ. There she and her husband, in days gone by, had together communed with the Lord. Now to see this house demolished was too much for her. She herself said, "I never had my feelings more tried."
               But from this sight, so sad to her, she turns to that building not made with hands, eternal in the heavens, and says, "Happy are they who are prepared for that glorious habitation!"
               Mrs. Dawson had lived close by this meeting-house for ten years; to it she always had access during the week, and within it, when the weather was warm, she spent much time in reading, meditation, and prayer.
               She writes:
               "July 10. What privileges I have had in years past! but, though men can deprive me of them, they cannot deprive me of communion with God."
               Blessed thought! It has been the consolation of many of the Lord's dear people when deprived of their sanctuary or driven away from it.
               Speaking of parish troubles, she says:
               "July 13. I think it becomes all to search their hearts and see for whose sake these great evils are come upon us.... What a responsibility bility there is resting upon ministers! I cannot bear to hear one of them spoken against." So tender was she of their feelings and reputation.
               To her oldest son:
               "September 30. It is almost a year since our minister left us; and then our troubles began.
               "For one year I have mourned over our desolations, and still mourn over them. I have shed more tears in secret during this one year than for many years before. God only knows my feelings.... Clouds and darkness are round about us."
               Mrs. Dawson thought, not without reason, that she had known troubles in former days; but those of the past seemed light to her, compared with that which was now pressing upon her. In most of those she could see more clearly the hand of God; in these, the hand only of men.
               In the autumn, the meetings, which had been held in a hall, near where the old church had stood, from the time it was taken down, were removed to the basement of the new edifice, about a mile and a quarter from the old spot; and such was the kindness of all parties to Mrs. Dawson and her daughter that the people took turns in sending a carriage for them on the morning of the Sabbath, and in taking them home again at the close of divine service.
               
               Some even proposed to remove her cottage to a spot near the new church.
               Such was the estimation in which she was held by those among whom the most of her days had been passed. Their kindness to her was shown in many ways to the last.
               To her oldest son she writes:
               "November 28. The dear old rocking-chair that was my mother's has arrived. In it she rocked her children, and in it my sister used to sit, till death removed her. Now all but two of us are gone."
               This was one of several old family articles which her son had procured for her and forwarded to her after the death of his aunt.
               To her oldest son:
               "January 13, 1849.... I am sensible that we do not pray enough and trust in God enough. I say 'we' but hope my sons do better than I do. The Lord has done great things for us in times past: let us trust him for time to come. I have heard much of the gold-regions, and it grieves me to think how poor mortals rush for a little glittering dust. Oh that they were as eager for the pearl of great price! All the riches I wish for is a treasure in heaven.... We feel very lonely, not for the want of ordinary society, but for the want of a minister of the gospel."
               "February 21. This is to me the saddest winter I have ever spent in this part of the town; and the trials of the past year, with reference to the church, have injured me more than anything else I have ever endured. As to myself, I feel like a poor sinner at the feet of Jesus, to whom I have found it sweet to carry my family. At times it seems as if every sin I have ever committed was set before me; and I am still troubled much for fear I joined the Church when I should not have done it."
               This fear never ceased to trouble her.
               To her oldest son, when obliged to move and greatly troubled to get a house, she wrote:
               "I am grieved that you are so much tried. If people felt as they should, they would try every way to help ministers along; but the Saviour says, 'In the world ye shall have tribulation.'
               "There is a house not made with hands, to which I trust you will go when you have finished your labors here."
               On the 20th of August, Mrs. Dawson's last brother was called to his eternal home, and she alone remained of a once large and happy family. She felt his loss very much, as she had former losses, though they had been long separated.
               Each successive death in that circle of friends, once so dear to each other, reminded her of her own departure, which could not be far remote; and now, when her last brother was gone, she felt called upon, in a most emphatic manner, to set her house in order.
               To her third son:
               "October 27. I am far advanced in life, and wish to live so as to be ready to leave the world whenever I am called away. I feel very lonely, and am in one sense alone, since the death of my last brother. But all things are in the hands of God, and will work, I trust, for his glory."
               To her oldest son:
               "December 29. The year 1850 will soon be upon us. Well do I remember the year 1800. Sad indeed to me were the scenes of that and the following years. Few have more cause for gratitude and thanksgiving than we have. May God have all the glory."
               1850. Early in this year Mrs. Dawson heard of the death of a much-loved sister-in-law. In communicating the fact to one of her children, she says:
               "My greatest anxiety now is, that we may all be prepared to meet in heaven. I would love to speak of your father, but will only say, though I have known many ministers and other pious people, I never knew one who appeared to live so near the Saviour as he did for the last eighteen months of his life. During the most of that period, we thrice daily bowed around our domestic altar, and had frequent family fasts."
               Mrs. Dawson's once vigorous constitution was now giving way. She writes, "It seems more of a burden for me to get into a sleigh and ride one mile to meeting, now, than it formerly did to walk five miles up-hill and down."
               One of her sons having been spoken of for the presidency of a college, she wrote him:
               "February 12. The highest position I desire for any of you is, that you may be faithful ministers of the Lord Jesus Christ."
               Then, alluding to church difficulties, she says:
               "We need trials and difficulties here, to remind us that this is not our home.
               "The sight of a widow and her little ones puts me in mind of my own little group after their father died. May we ever praise the Lord for his kindness to us, and trust him for all we need."
               "April 24. Have thought much, of late, about poor sinners rushing down to hell. I look upon the children around me, and ask, Where will they soon be? Parents and children seem going the same way.... At times I long to be with the Saviour.... Where are the friends of my early days? Going back to those days, I thence follow my father's family, till they enter eternity and heaven, I trust."
               She writes:
               "May 15. My past life looks dark. It does not seem as if I had ever done anything aright."
               "May 22. In regard to religion, we live between hope and fear. God can break through the clouds and shine upon us. Sometimes I get a glimpse of the world of glory and of the Saviour, and then I long to be with him in that world.... My only hope is in Christ. We do not go to him enough."
               "August 13. During those hours of the night when I cannot sleep, and wish for the morning, I often think that there is no morning to dawn upon the regions of despair."
               "November 6. Am fully sensible that, unless we can have help from above, vain is the help of man."
               To her third son:
               "March 7, 1851. It is a great satisfaction to me that my sons continue to labor where they were first settled."
               "March 29. Your birthday did not pass unremembered. It carried my mind back to the days when my children were around me. Those were pleasant days, though the memory of them often brings sadness, because I was so unfaithful."
               In this letter, she compares ministers leaving a people who are attached to them, to Jonah fleeing to Tarshish, when the Lord sent him to Nineveh.
               Speaking of being deprived of the means of grace, she says, "I cannot forget the old meeting-house, though I try to rise above my feelings. The dear old spot where it stood is before my eyes."
               That spot was in front of her door; and the rubbish that long remained there might well remind her of the desolations of Zion.
               But, great as were her trials with reference to their time-honored sanctuary, a much greater one awaited her before the close of this year, which she looked not for.
               In the course of the summer, her oldest son took a journey for the threefold purpose of visiting old and esteemed friends, improving his health, and collecting materials for a memoir of a venerated uncle. On his way back, he visited his mother, passed a Sabbath with her, and preached twice.
               Respecting that visit, he wrote, "Found mother feeble. Fear this is the last time I shall see her in the flesh. The Lord prepare her for all changes, particularly that of death."
               
               In the course of that visit, he went with his mother to an adjoining town, where one of his sisters was settled. Here they were to part, each to go to their respective homes. In order to see as much as possible of his mother, upon whom he evidently felt that he was looking for the last time, he walked by the side of the carriage in which she was about to return home, for some distance, and then gave her a parting embrace. Still loth to part, he walked on till they came to the burying-ground in which that man of God slept, who seemed to Mrs. Dawson, when she heard him last, "so much like an angel."
               Pausing there, and pointing to the church, full in view, and to the graveyard in which slept several generations, he again put his arms around his mother's neck, kissed her, and bade her farewell. Evidently he did not expect to see her again; and his impressions were correct, though they were not to be verified in the way he supposed.
               Returning to his home, this son was soon taken sick, and, after lingering till the 18th of December, fell asleep in Jesus.
               If many other blows that had fallen upon this handmaid of the Lord had been very severe, none, probably, considering her age and weakness, had been in point of severity equal to this. While there was yet hope that he would be spared, she said:
               "It has been hard for me to say I was willing to part with him.... His sickness has caused me great anxiety; though I believe he would go to the world of glory if he were called away. He is my first-born, given me when I was in great tribulation, and peculiarly dear to me."
               "When she heard of his death, she mourned for him as for an only son, though his long sickness had prepared her in a measure for it.
               She felt "as if her main stay and staff were broken," and said:
               "He has been the one on whom I have been accustomed to lean. He was ever ready to attend to my wants. I often think of his last visit; how he accompanied me on my way home from his sister's. He evidently thought that I should not live long; but I am spared, and he is taken."
               1852-1856. In letters to her children, Mrs. Dawson says:
               "January 18, 1852. It is now one month since your dear brother left the world. I feel his loss very much, day and night. It seems as if I could see him smiling as he did when he visited us last. But, while I mourn his loss, I would be grateful that I have kind children left. Sorrow, grief, and pain will reach the dear departed one no more. No more will he weep over the people of his charge; no more will they hear his voice. We must now leave him, and prepare to meet him in glory."
               "February 26. I have had a gloomy winter. My departed son is constantly in my mind. Happy son, if he has passed beyond the sorrows and trials of this life!"
               "March 24. My dear departed one is still in my mind. I look upon him as in the presence of his Saviour. May we meet him in glory."
               "Mayâ€”? It is not on his account that we mourn; but on account of the loss that we who survive him sustain."
               "July 26. Dear son, I cannot forget thee! Oh that I were prepared to follow thee! Sometimes I long for the day when I may meet my Saviour; then clouds and darkness are round about me."
               "August 16. It is just one year since our sainted one was taken sick."
               Thus, month after month, did she mourn for her son; and thus, by removing one object of her love after another to a better world, was God weaning her from the earth and drawing her to the skies.
               Some of her children now wished Mrs. Dawson to give up housekeeping and make her home with one of her daughters.
               In reference to this, she says:
               "I shall be no better off there about going to meeting than I am here. The Lord placed me here, and, if I am a child of his, he will not forsake me. Cruel people moved the meeting-house from me; but, if my name is in the Book of Life, they cannot take it away."
               Her sanctuary privileges influenced, if they did not control, all her movements. Whatever facilitated her attendance upon the means of grace, had great weight with her; while she saw little inducement to go where she would not be "any better off about meeting," whatever other advantages might arise from a change.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IX.
               FROM MRS. DAWSON'S REMOVAL TO HER DAUGHTER'S, TO HER DEATH.
               AFTER the old meeting-house was given into the hands of those who were to take it down, and while divine service was held in a hall near by, Mrs. Dawson was able to attend with a good degree of regularity.
               "I often remarked at this time," says the invalid daughter whose home was with her, "that I did not think mother would live long unless she could go to meeting. Her life seemed to depend upon it, and she apparently had strength to attend. After the religious services were held at the new church, she was enabled to attend for several years. She did this, first, by the kindness of friends; then, lest she should weary them, she hired a neighbor to take her, and had steps made expressly to enable her to get into his carriage."
               The last time she ever went was about two years before her death. She had become very infirm, though her general health was pretty good. It was communion Sabbath, and she made special effort to get to the sanctuary once more, to commemorate a Saviour's dying love. She was thus finishing her public devotions, and sealing her testimony to the truth of that religion which had been her unfailing support through a long period of years. Fit ending to that part of a life of unshaken trust in God!
               Nothing could have been more appropriate, had she known beforehand that this was the last time she would ever appear in the Lord's courts below.
               When she could no longer get to the house of God, her pastor (for she was again blessed with one) appointed occasional lectures at her cottage, which she enjoyed very much; though she still mourned the loss of her Sabbath privileges, and longed to meet with the people of God in his house.
               But the more she was cut off from the earthly sanctuary, the more she turned to the word of God, meditation, and prayer, that she might be prepared for her removal to that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
               "I seem to see her now," wrote one of her children, concerning this period, after the mother's death, "seated by the window in our sweet little home, with her work in her hands, and her precious Bible open before her on the table. At times she would both work and read; then she would lay down her work and read only; then, taking her work, she would apparently meditate upon what she had been reading.
               "Her hymn-book usually lay by her, which she would often take up, and, after reading in it awhile, would sing in her own way something which showed what her thoughts were upon. Afterward a memoir of her son was published, that shared her attention with her Bible and hymn-book. She loved to gaze upon his likeness that accompanied it, and sometimes 'it seemed as if she could see it smile.'"
               Such is the picture of one, almost fourscore, who had, by the good hand of God upon her, come up out of great tribulation, as she was calmly waiting the days of her appointed time, till her change should come.
               Though deprived of her sanctuary privileges, she had risen so far above the storms and trials, of earth that, while still a member of the Church militant, she seemed to be sitting in the very portals of the Church triumphant. One remove yet awaited her before she departed hence to be here no more.
               Though the neighbors who still continued to live near were very kind, it was no longer prudent for the aged mother and invalid daughter to remain by themselves. They needed some one constantly with them to care for them, and the question of closing their house was seriously agitated, though Mrs. Dawson said, "It is hardly worth while to make much trouble about me. I am sorry people took away the meeting-house; but will not complain if I can have the presence of my Saviour."
               It was not till the autumn of 1856 that anything definite was resolved upon; and in the mean time we find her giving utterance in her letters, which were now less frequent and more brief than formerly, to such sentiments as follows:
               "My main inquiry now is, whether my name is in the Book of Life." "I fear that I shall never be permitted to enter the world of glory; but long to be wholly devoted to the Lord." "My desire is to be prepared to meet my Saviour; to love him more; to be holy."
               During the autumn of 1856, so poor was the health of that daughter, who had been Mrs. Dawson's companion for many years, that entire cessation from care seemed essential to her life. And though the mother at first refused to concur in any plan that would separate them, she eventually came to the conclusion that she must give up her daughter for a time, or soon follow her to the grave. It was at length settled that the mother should pass the winter with her children in Dayton, while her daughter should go for the winter to her sister's in Brandon, where she might hope for needed rest. "Those were sad days when we found that we must part wrote the daughter, at a later day, "though this was only a temporary arrangement, for we both hoped to return with improved health in the spring. When it was known that we were going to leave town for the winter, people began to call, and, for weeks were constantly calling or making us farewell visits. Many sweet seasons of prayer were enjoyed at our house during those weeks; when dear Christian friends asked the Lord to bless us in our absence, and to return us in safety if he saw best. On the Sabbath evening before we left, our pastor appointed a meeting at our house. It was full and solemn. The time could not have been spent better if we had known that this was our last evening there. After meeting, all, not excepting the little children, gathered around to bid us good-by.
               "Early the next morning mother seemed anxious to go, and the last thing she did in that house, where she had spent eighteen years of her life, was to kneel on the spot where she had so often knelt, and offer up our morning devotions. Oh, hallowed spot! I seem to see her there now, and to hear her voice in prayer. All along the way people left their houses and came out to bid us adieu."
               Such, after a residence of fifty-three years in Olney, was the departure of one who had gone at first into the most obscure part of the town, with her broken-down companion, in the hope of obtaining a comfortable subsistence, and of enjoying, away from a noisy world, the smiles of Heaven. How was this esteem of all ages, all classes, won? Not by flattery; for Mrs. Dawson was plain and outspoken, to a proverb. Not by being lavish of wealth; for she had ever been poor. It was a simple tribute offered, by a people noted for strong good sense, to unobtrusive sterling worth,â€”to eminent cottage piety. "By their fruits ye shall know them" (Matt. vii. 20); and whether we take Mrs. Dawson in the family or the neighborhood, in the prayer-meeting or in the Sabbath-school with which she was connected till a late period of her life, in the church or in the world, her life had not been void of fruit, nor had that fruit been of a doubtful character.
               "A woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised" (Prov. xxxi. 30); and no one who has followed the writer thus far will question whether she feared the Lord.
               Though it is now, as we write, nearly a half-century since her companion, whose comparatively brief Christian career was more eminent than her own, left the world, and but a few years less since the whole family removed from the neighborhood where he died, a hallowed influence still seems to hover over the spot that was once their home. So often had every part of it witnessed the fervent devotions of that humble servant of the Lord who had turned much of it from a waste, howling wilderness into fruitful fields, that it seems almost like holy ground.
               The generation that has already come and gone since the Dawsons removedâ€”and we think the same may be true for a generation or two to comeâ€”pointed the stranger to that spot as one where a humble and devoted couple once served God and trained their children, by much prayer, for his service here, and for the enjoyment of him hereafter in heaven.
               To Mrs. Dawson the pain of leaving her old friends in Olney was mitigated by the hope of returning with the coming summer; but those who saw her depart felt that they should see her among them no more.
               After reaching her new home, she expressed herself well satisfied. It was so near her old one that the friends she had left often came to see her, while new ones were acquired from the people among whom her lot was now cast.
               Many who had known of her now took occasion to call upon her and "to be a little acquainted before they reached heaven."
               In this new home she received every needed attention, and was surrounded by the hallowed influences of religion: yet she looked eagerly forward to the time when she might clasp her absent daughter in her arms, and, with her, return to their own home. They had become so identified with each other that it seemed as if they must live and die together.
               Frequent letters passed between them; and though by midwinter, when her health became poor, the mother thought she must have this daughter with her again, it was not till spring was far advanced, six months after their separation that they were reunited.
               Of that meeting the daughter wrote, "I can see her just as she looked when I opened the door. Stretching out her arms, she said, 'Oh, come!' and the next moment I was clasped to her bosom."
               Among the few short letters written by Mrs. Dawson while she was with her children in Dayton, were several to her pastor, for whom she ever cherished sincere respect. From these letters a few extracts will be made before we pass to the closing scene of her life.
               Dayton was at this time without a pastor; and, after thanking her own for his letter to her, she writes:
               "November 28, 1856. A place looks very desolate without a pastor.
               "We often think of our little white cottage in Olney; but pray that we may extend our views to that bright world where parting will be no more.
               "I hope to hear of a revival among your people and all around us; but we have something to do besides sitting still and wishing.
               "The church must be active and hold up the pastor's hands.... But I had almost forgotten that I was writing to a minister! What I have said amiss, you must forgive."
               In the autumn of 1856 one of her sons went to Europe, in the hope of improving his impaired health. When he sailed, his mother hardly expected to see him again in the flesh; but, writing to her pastor, she says:
               "December 8, 1856. I shall feel very grateful if he return home in safety.
               "But what shall we do here, and in places around us, unless God soon appear for us? If his children are faithful, he will appear."
               Thus, to the last, whatever she began to write about, she would come around to the interests of the Redeemer's kingdom, as the bow unstrung returns to its place.
               Her outward religion was the natural radiation of that which was in her heart; and it sat upon her with the ease and grace of a robe fitted by a divine hand.
               It was about as natural for her to discourse upon religious topics as it was to breathe.
               With the year 1857 we enter upon the last of Mrs. Dawson's life. Her work was now almost done. Her reward was near. It had become laborious for her to write; and we have found little from her pen for some time past.
               Having heard of her son's safe return from Europe, she wrote to let him and his family know how much she felt relieved, and added, "Many are the anxious hours I have had on your account; but my consolation was that God could protect you on the sea as well as on the land."
               To her pastor:
               "April 10, 1857. I am now in my eightieth year. My time is uncertain. My anxiety is not how soon I go, but whether I am prepared. All I can do is to cast myself at the feet of Jesus, and, if I perish, to perish there."
               Such were her views as the sands of life were fast running out. She saw no way but Christ,â€”had no hope but in and through him. He was to her all in all. Her confidence in him never wavered. Her distrust was of herself.
               When she and her daughter met in the spring, after they had left their own little home, they were both so feeble that it was thought inexpedient for them, to return to it; and the cottage was sold.
               
               Referring to this, in a letter to her pastor, she says:
               "June 3. Little did I think, when I left you, that I should go back to my old home to live no more. It makes me feel sad. The people of Olney seem very dear to me. Farewell, dear place! The remembrance of many scenes through which I have passed there, presses on my mind." She then exhorts her pastor not to leave his people; "for a parish without a minister is like a house without a roof."
               Sitting by her window, she writes:
               "June 22. The cold, bleak winds are blowing. Sometimes I get a glimpse of the blue sky 'through the flying clouds,' and my mind is led beyond it to our Saviour. I long to feel his love in my soul."
               In the last letter addressed to her pastor, commenced July 17, she says, "I feel unworthy of the privilege of writing. I have been meditating upon the goodness of God and the privilege of having a Saviour."
               In conclusion, she urges him, as before, not to leave his people, but to continue to labor for Jesus, and he would have his reward.
               We have now closed our extracts from Mrs. Dawson's letters, and fall back upon the narrative of her daughter for our information respecting ing the last few weeks of her life, and the closing scene itself. She says:
               "Mother could no longer bear trials and perplexities as she used to do. Our breaking up and leaving our old and tried friends, and her separation from that child who knew her wants, if possible, better than she did herself, had worn upon her.
               "For some time before her death, though comfortable in other respects, she could not walk without help; but she preferred to help herself as much as possible to the last. She did not rest well at night, and in the morning would tell us of the pleasant views she had, during her wakeful hours, of the white-robed company in heaven with their harps of gold.
               "When others were at meeting, it was her custom to have a meeting with such members of the family as could not go; and many times have we thus mingled in spirit with those from whom we were bodily absent. She seemed cheerful, and often even playful; and, as the shades of night gathered around us, she would get one of her daughters on either side, talk of by-gone days, and appear peculiarly happy.
               "She was more and more attached to her children, and showed a tenderness of affection that savored more and more of heaven, as she drew near to it.
               
               "Though she had no disease which led her to think that her end was near, she seemed to be preparing for it, for weeks and months, in an especial manner. Sometimes she would say, 'What if I should knock at the gate of heaven, and it should be said to me, "I never knew you"? How could I bear to spend eternity with those whom I have never loved in time?'
               "Sometimes she feared that she had been a hypocrite all her days, and was incited by that fear to deeper heart-searchings.
               "Two weeks before her death, she had an interesting visit from a distant relative, who remarked that 'the fire of her eye was not abated.'
               "The day he left, she appeared to have taken cold. Our usual remedies had a good effect; and the next day she appeared better. The day following, her strength gave way, and, for the first time since she left her own home, she did not take her place at the table; but, by the help of medicine, she soon resumed it, and continued to take it to the last evening of her life. At dinner, I think, she asked a blessing, as the head of the family was from home. After tea we took our seats, one on either side of her. Sister read and sung to her, and at intervals she talked of her prospects for eternity. Soon her voice began to tremble, she lay down, and had a chill, but was relieved, though she expressed the belief that she should not live till morning.
               "Not more than twenty minutes before she expired, we raised her up. Fixing her last look on me for a moment, then turning her eyes upward, her chest heaved a little, the breath trembled on her lips, and she had fallen asleep. A most peaceful, heavenly expression came over her face, and continued there to the last.
               "She never looked more lovely. She slept, indeed; but it did not look like the sleep of death!"
               Thus was this cottage light transferred from earth to heaven, October 23, 1857.
               "We could hardly ask an easier passage to the grave, she passed so gently away. It seemed but a step across the river. The valley on either side of it was not dark. The light of heaven seemed to shine upon it,â€”to shine through it."
               At her funeral, her pastor preached from Job xiv. 14, last clause; and then they bore to the grave the remains of one who, in the sphere in which she moved, had emphatically done, for Christ and his cause, what she could.
               The way to her new-made grave, by the side of that in which the dust of her husband had long slumbered, lay through the farm in West-ford, on which they had located more than half a century before. But the murmuring streams that, in the days of their darkness and trials, had often been soothing music to their ears, now, swollen by rains, had rendered the ordinary highway impassable, and the funeral cortge was obliged to pass directly by the spot whence the spirit of Robert Dawson went up to glory.
               Thus was the circle of her widowhood complete; and from the very spot where it commenced was she borne on to the side of him whom she loved most tenderly in life, and to whose memory she was ever faithful.
               Standing over that grave, which we watered with our tears, we seemed to hear the cold clay of the one whisper to the dust of the other, "I come! I come!" Thence thought follows the disembodied spirit of Mrs. Dawson, up its track-less way, through the blue heavens, till it is reunited to that of her husband, and they together cast their crowns at the Redeemer's feet.
               Then we seem to see them reclining on some sequestered hill of heaven, recounting, with unspeakable joy, the way in which, together or separate, God had led them on to his kingdom and glory.

               INNER ROME:
               POLITICAL, RELIGIOUS, AND SOCIAL.
               BY THE REV. C. M. BUTLER, D. D.,
               Professor of Ecclesiastical History in the Divinity School, Philadelphia; author of "The Book of Common Prayer interpreted by its History;" "Lectures on the Apocalypse;" "St. Paul in Rome," etc. etc. etc. 1 vol. 12mo. $1.75.
               
                  From the Philadelphia Inquirer. ...No modern volume within our knowledge has so thoroughly entered into an exposition of the government and the social condition of Rome.
               
                  From the Cincinnati Gazette. The book is the result of personal observation as well as the careful study of documents only made public since the surrender of the Venitian capital to Victor Emmanuel. Hence we find disclosures of long permitted wrong, oppression, and cruelty, that startle us even in this day when rebellion has given so bloody a record of crime. It is the duty of every man to read a volume so opportune, and which so clearly indicates that the Old World is about to pass through an ordeal more severe, if possible, than that in which our own land and people have been tried, and, we trust, purified. We commend the volume to the student, the politician, and the practical man.
               
                  From the Rev. Dr. S. I. Prime. No book on Rome or Popery has met my eye so well fitted to show the world what Romanism is at Rome, as this book of yours.
               
                  From Judge Advocate General Holt. My dear sir: I write to thank you sincerely for the volume "Inner Rome." I have read it carefully and with much interest and instruction, and think you have done your friends and the country a good service in thus presenting to them the results of your diligent study of the principles and policy and habits of those who have now the guardianship of this "lone mother of dead empires." Be assured that I shall prize the offering alike for its own worth and as a token of that friendship with which you have so constantly honored me, and which I gladly and gratefully reciprocate.
               
                  From the Rev. Horatius Bonar, D. D. My dear Dr. Butler: I am busy with your work, and find it exceedingly interesting and instructive. One likes to get a view of the interior from one who knows it so well as you do; as for a traveler, like myself, he is not qualified for the task at all, and his pen can only sketch exteriors. You have seen a great deal both of Rome Inner and Rome Outer, and it is pleasant to be introduced by you into one chamber, and another, and another.
