            PREFACE.
            
               Most Courteous Reader:
            
            The Author has only endeavoured to indicate in these pages how Youth may pass into
               Manhood through the portals of Grief; how Manhood may grow into full maturity in the
               practice of self-abnegation, without the lapse of years. For the rest, the story is
               simply told, and appeals to nothing but your gentler sympathies. And if it shall
               happen that the characters herein rudely sketched shall assume shape and identity,
               and grow with you, as they have with him, into living realities, and so awaken your
               kindly interest, then the Author will have accomplished his purpose and won his
               reward.

               CHAPTER I.
               PRELIMINARY.
               YE who listen with credulity to the whispers of fancy, and pursue with eagerness
                  the phantoms of hope; who expect that age will perform the promises of youth, and
                  that the deficiencies of the present day will be supplied by the morrow; attend to
                  the story of "Harwood" and the publishers.
               The foregoing is a slight improvement upon the opening sentence of "Rasselas." It
                  has been quoted to many an unhappy student of rhetoric as the culmination of
                  elegance in English composition. It is an undeniable fact that this history of the
                  Abyssinian prince, admitted to the front rank among English classics, is almost
                  unknown to the present enlightened age; and it may be that it has been ostracized,
                  like Aristides the Just, because humanity cannot stand prolonged arrogant
                  assumption, even if well founded. The courteous reader will, therefore, please
                  note that the above sentence is a quotation. The last thing I should dream of
                  doing would be to kill Harwood by writing too elegantly at the outset.
               To descend to plain prose, then, I invoke the reader's patience while I relate the
                  story of Harwood's birth. And I counsel the cultivation of this virtue the more
                  earnestly, not only because of its inherent excellence, but also because patience
                  is the very attribute that will be most exercised in getting through the following
                  pages.
               More than a dozen years ago I was an exile from home and kindred. It does not
                  matter how this came about, and it is enough to say that the exile was endured in
                  the way of known duty. The Sahara to which I banished myself was the City of New
                  York, and the solitude of that desert was the more horrible from the density of its population. Some good writer, whose
                  name has escaped me, has made a similar remark in different language, and the fact
                  that two writers, who have never met to exchange opinions, should assert the same
                  general proposition, is a strong argument in favour of its verity.
               During the day I was constantly occupied, having charge of interests of
                  considerable importance, and labouring under a consciousness of responsibility
                  that was heavy enough to keep my thoughts employed. But 
                     
                        "When night came o'er the plain,
                        And moonlight o'er the sea,"
                     
                   I found myself longing for human companionship. I wandered about the
                  corridors of the hotel, and looked, with all the curiosity I could muster, upon
                  the various types of humanity that crowded them. In all seriousness, I was an
                  object of pity, because in all the throngs I there encountered night after night,
                  there was not a solitary being that awakened or experienced one thought of human
                  sympathy within me or for me. The hotel life became intolerable within a week. To
                  escape from it I wandered through scores of streets running from the Hudson to
                  East River in search of lodgings. At last I found a house in a quiet
                  neighbourhood, where I rented a room. The excitement of the change and the study
                  of my new surroundings availed for two or three nights, and then the loneliness
                  came back.
               In all essentials my life was a vagrant one. I always got out of the house when
                  dawn arrived, and wandered about the streets aimlessly until breakfast time. I not
                  only wanted companionship but I also wanted good coffee. At the period to which I
                  refer coffee in its virgin state was a very expensive article, but coffee that was
                  made of chicory, baked beans, burnt sugar and sole leather was comparatively
                  cheap. It is highly probable that tea of some sort of chop, unsophisticated, could
                  be found in most of the eating places; but coffee, never! I read with a daily
                  shudder about forty signs in shop windows, which mendaciously announced that the
                  purest Mocha or Java (always roasted and ground, so as to defy analysis) could be
                  obtained within at an absurdly low figure. My early education had been faulty in
                  that I had never been taught to imbibe tea. In my mind's eye this fragrant
                  beverage was evermore associated in some weird fashion with panada, senna and
                  manna, quassia and chamomile flowers. I longed for coffee but I found it not. Why,
                  in the name of wonder, did not some enterprising Yankee open a coffee house on
                  Broadway, and set a little nigger in the window behind plate glass, and let him
                  turn a coffee roaster, fed with the genuine berry in sight of an admiring public?
                  He would have rivalled Astor in wealth by this time.
               I got meals in this vagabond fashion at numberless eating places, from Delmonico's
                  down or up, as the reader chooses. I cannot say that I ate breakfast or dinner. I
                  fed just as a horse does, but did not dine. You cannot dine in a civilized manner
                  while your jaws only masticate in grim silence. They were also intended to be used
                  in conversation; but in my dining places I heard no conversationâ€”nothing but the
                  clatter of dishes and the gnashing of teeth. This was suggestive, and my
                  loneliness increased. I began to pity myself. And here I pause to
                  warn the gentle reader to avoid similar folly. It is the first step toward
                  madness. It is the most indigo-hued of Blue Devils!
               One night I met the landlady as I entered my lodgings, and she very politely
                  invited me into the parlour, saying, "I would find it more cheerful." In sheer
                  desperation I followed her, and she introduced me formally to four men and four
                  women. They were all eight talking when I entered, but my glum countenance
                  dampened them for a little time. I sat by a young lady, and after due deliberation
                  I startled her by announcing that it had rained that day. It is possible that she
                  had learned the fact before, but she was too polite to say so. And then, the ice
                  being broken, all eight began to talk again. They talked at me, across me, under
                  my arm, over my head, and every way but to me. I cannot say what kept
                  them back, but they were somehow repelled. I was negatively magnetized. They had
                  but one topic, upon which they rung countless changes. It wasâ€”wellâ€”let us sayâ€”the
                  taking of Sebastopol.
               My heart was sick of Sebastopol, of Inkermann and of Balaklava. The Charge of the
                  Six Hundred seemed to be a very foolish piece of business, and I had a horrible
                  suspicion that the account was about three quarters lies. But the womenâ€”two of
                  them were deeply piousâ€”made a kind of hideous religion out of the taking of
                  Sebastopol. The Rugged Russian Bear was the Vicar Apostolic of the enemy of
                  mankind. Those of the Six Hundred who rode, as Tennyson says, into the mouth of
                  some place, came out again and were incontinently canonized. I don't believe they
                  came out at all. While the talk went on I sat apart and mused. I thought of
                  thousands of gentle women, and tens of thousands of little children dren, who were widowed and orphaned by the glorious
                  strife over which those four women gloated. There was nothing in their talk to
                  indicate any personal interest in the savage contest, but it is certain that they
                  feasted most ravenously where the carnage was greatest. One of the men was
                  Reverend, and I said something to him about this strange appetite that possessed
                  the women. His answer was a quotation from Holy Writ: "For wheresoever the carcase
                  is there will the eagles be gathered together." He meant me to understand that the
                  women were she eagles, and he thought the eagles were good birds. I did not tell
                  him that those mentioned in his quotation fed on carrion. It was less lonely in my
                  room, and I slipped out unnoticed, leaving them regaling.
               It was too early for bed, so I lighted a cigar. Something that had been said in
                  the parlour brought to my mind a family I had known in another city. There were
                  some remarkable incidents in their history, and as the smoke gathered around my
                  head I began to fill up intervals in their story, weaving a sort of plot. I found
                  comfort here, and getting my portfolio I began to write. It was a total change in
                  my habits of thought: It was the inception of a Purpose: I would write a Book!
               And so, night after night, for months, the work proceeded. My loneliness was gone.
                  The people who grew up into shape and individuality were living realities to me.
                  Oh, reader! if they shall also grow into realities with thee!
               Thus was "Harwood" born. During the day the calls upon my faculties were almost
                  incessant, but I would catch myself or my thoughts at odd intervals slipping away
                  from the unreal events of my daily life to the dear friends who were waiting for
                  me in my portfolio. I always quitted them with regret and returned to them with
                  delight. In them I found companionship and sympathy. I did not force them to keep
                  within any set grooves. I had settled their destinies, it is true; yet I allowed
                  them to reach their various goals in their own way. Ordinarily, they were
                  tractable enough, but sometimes they took the bit in their teeth and bolted. The
                  reader will please bear this in mind, and whenever these characters misbehave in
                  any way, remember that the author was blameless.
               One nightâ€”or rather one morning, for I remember hearing the clock strike twoâ€”I
                  wrote "Finis." It was a great shock to me. For a week I was dispirited and
                  nervous, and then I began a sequel: "The Lacy Diamonds." Have patience, gentle
                  reader; it is progressing.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               BOOK MAKING.
               WHEN "Harwood" was finished I was still a comparative stranger in New York. I had
                  business acquaintances by the score, but I had no intimate friends. The good
                  natured people whom I encountered in my daily occupation treated me well and
                  kindly, but I knew none of them well enough to venture even a hint of authorship
                  to them. Busy men, all of them, hunting dollars while the sun shone, and
                  begrudging the minutes wasted in unremunerative conversation. There were certain
                  topics of absorbing interest to me which would also interest them. But they all
                  looked at these only on one side, and I soon discovered the profitless nature of
                  any discussions.
               It chanced one day that business brought me into contact with a publishing house
                  that had not been long established in the metropolis. The accidental acquaintance
                  thus begun ripened rapidly into friendship. The members of this firm knew
                  something about Sebastopol and the Charge of the Six Hundred, and held my views
                  about that notable conflict. It was very refreshing to me to spend occasional half
                  hours in this pleasant company; and meeting always a cordial welcome, I gradually
                  fell into the regular habit of smoking my after-lunch cigar in their
                  establishment, discussing new books with reference both to their commercial value
                  and their intrinsic merits. Very frequently I would find them engaged in reading
                  and correcting proofs of their own publications, of which they already had a
                  considerable list. I had forgotten "Harwood," which was packed away among sundry
                  fragmentary manuscripts at homeâ€”after taking a journey which will be recounted in
                  the succeeding chapter. I retained a somnolent sort of interest in the bantling,
                  feeling a father's affection for it, mingled with a compassionate appreciation of
                  its demerits. With Touchstone I thought, "An ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine
                  own." So, while I gathered in many new facts, and became somewhat learned in the
                  art of book making, the thought of getting "Harwood" dressed in type never
                  occurred to me.
               As a rule, my friends did not publish fictitious literature. Reams of this
                  description of property were offered to them on the most flattering terms. Nearly
                  all the authors who sent their precious
                  manuscripts generously proposed that the firm should print the work at their own
                  expense, and allow the usual royalty to the writer. I am convinced that none of
                  the authors dreamed of anything less than ten editions, if the work could only be
                  got into print and within reach of a hydra-headed public, waiting with bated
                  breath for copies, hot from the press. As our intimacy progressed I learned the
                  stereotyped form of rejection. "The present state of trade;" "would be pleased to
                  print at the expense of the author, involving an outlay of so many dollars;" and
                  other polite intimations that must have been eminently disgusting to the
                  manuscript makers. There seemed to be an inexorable law that connected authorship
                  with impecuniosity.
               On one occasion I happened to be present when my friends were packing up one of
                  these forlorn manuscripts to return "by express" to the rightful owner. I had
                  heard of its arrival some days previously.
               "Have you really read that great mass of papers?" I inquired.
               "Certainly," answered the junior.
               "How much is there?"
               "Seven hundred and eight pages," he replied.
               "What is it about?"
               "I don't know. The title isâ€”" and he turned the parcel over and consulted the
                  first pageâ€”"'The Remorse of the Victim.' There are some very good things in it.
                  Some of the words are in five syllables."
               "Did you understand them all?" said I.
               "Oh, no," he answered coolly. "I don't think the author understood them either,
                  but that makes no difference. Did you ever read 'Talmanasia?'"
               "No."
               "Nor 'Shanghi?'"
               "No, certainly not," I replied, with a shudder.
               "My dear sir," said he, with a grisly compassion, "you are not abreast of the age!
                  Haven't read 'Shanghi!' Don't you ever read anything?"
               "Yes," I faltered, "I read the Herald sometimes. Have
                     you read 'Shanghi?'"
               "Not exactly read it, but I have sold five hundred copies. It is a
                  great success. The publisher paid ten thousand dollars for the manuscript and
                  copyright. Made money on his investment too."
               This interview made a profound impression upon me. I knew a man who was the happy
                  owner of "Shanghi," and as my conscience forbade an investment in that direction,
                  I borrowed the book, from which I had read sundry extracts when it appeared. That
                  night I sat down resolutely and began the book. I read two chapters at the
                  beginning, two in the middle, and two at the end of the story. I did
                     not have a stroke of apoplexy, nor cerebrospinal meningitis; but I
                  shall die in the belief that an additional chapter would have given me both these
                  ailments with a touch of delirium tremens thrown in. The next day I took "Harwood"
                  with me at lunch time and left it with my friend.
               "I have known you to read about forty bulkier manuscripts," I said, "and I have
                  brought this for you to read. I just want your candid judgment, comparing this
                  with the forty you have read and rejected. Of course I have no expectation of
                  printing it. Read it at your leisure."
               "What is it?" said he.
               "It is a novel which I wrote some years ago. It kept me from going mad while I was
                  making it. If you find, in attempting to read it, any symptoms of delirium tremens
                  creeping over you, I hope you will stop in time. I have not read one line in it
                  since I finished it, and I do not expect ever to read a line of it in the
                  future."
               "All right," he answered cheerfully, "I will read it with pleasure."
               It will only be when the gentle reader closes this book (with a sigh of relief)
                  that he can appreciate my amazement at my next interview with my book making
                  friend.
               "'Harwood' is a first class story," said he, decidedly, "and we will be glad to
                  publish it if you desire us to do so."
               "Are you serious?" said I.
               "Entirely serious," he answered. "We will print it whenever you say the word, but
                  I advise you first to try some one elseâ€”I mean some other publishers."
               "I do not understand you," I replied. "I have little or no acquaintance with other
                  publishers, and if I had I would select your house out of the whole world of
                  publishers. What do you mean by such advice?"
               "Simply this: we are not much known to the trade as publishers, especially of
                  fiction, and our customers are mainly among houses that do not deal in novels.
                  Now, it can do no harm to take 'Harwood' to these other firms which have a larger
                     outlet for just this sort of
                  literature, and if they will print it, giving you a copyright, let them have it on
                  any reasonable terms they may propose. Haven't you written another story?"
               "Yes," I answered with a charming blush, "I have written a sequel to
                  'Harwood'â€”that is, I am writing it now."
               "Well, suppose you get one of these firms who have a large list of novel-buying
                  customers to issue 'Harwood,' and suppose they place it in the hands of five or
                  ten thousand readers, don't you see that another novel by the author of 'Harwood'
                  would have a large sale?"
               The senior partner stood by, apparently endorsing this proposition. These
                  gentlemen have had large experience in book making, I thought, and they must be
                  right.
               "Have you read 'Harwood?'" I asked.
               "Not all of it," he replied, composedly. "I have looked over it. You know, if we
                  print it I shall have the opportunity to read the proofs. Your penmanship is
                  peculiar, very peculiar. I have read manuscript for forty years, and
                  thought I was equal to anything, but yours isâ€”very peculiar."
               It did not seem politic to pursue this branch of the subject. I tucked "Harwood"
                  under my arm and prepared to depart.
               "Do not misunderstand us," said the junior, following me to the door. "We would be
                  glad to publish your book at once, but, for your own sake, and for the sake of the
                  larger circulation, you had better let Pippinville or Charlesburg have it. They
                  have an outlet for ten thousand copies, and that is better than ten thousand
                  separate advertisements. Go to Pippinville! I read the manuscript aloud, and all
                  my auditors pronounced it a first rate story. If you are doubtful, you might
                  submit it to some other critic, in whom you have confidence; but, remember, we are
                  ready to print whenever you say the word. I don't like the title much; it
                  indicates nothing."
               "I'll call it 'The Remorse of the Victim,'" I said promptly.
               "I don't think that would be an improvement. What do you call your other
                  story?
               "'The Lacy Diamonds.'"
               "That is better. Good morning."
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               THE FIRST ORDEAL.
               I HAVE read somewhere of a young mother who waited with unspeakable anxiety for
                  the verdict of society upon her baby. To her it was the loveliest infant that ever
                  wore long clothes. It did not talk or walk, but that mother was entirely satisfied
                  that it could do both if it pleased. She had always rather liked babies, and made
                  full allowance for any little departures from the path of rectitude of which they
                  were guilty; but the peculiarity in her baby's case was that it made no such
                  departures. When it first said "Goo!"â€”which, by-the-bye, is a very common remark
                  for infants to makeâ€”that mother translated the monosyllable into a long speech in
                  English without the aid of lexicographers. If you had the temerity to suggest a
                  possible error in her rendering of "Goo!" this young mother, if polite, would not
                  pluralize the original and apply it to you in words, but she would do so in her
                  inmost soul.
               Some such experience was mine a few months ago when I dug "Harwood" out of a mass
                  of fragmentary manuscripts. You see it was my first born. The horrible dread of a
                  public verdictâ€”the possible bÃªte noir of all
                  embryo authorsâ€”haunted me and kept the precious infant hidden a dozen years. I
                  cannot tell what brought him to light at last, but am free to confess that I
                  entertained a profound affection for him. I did not read the manuscript! There
                  were one hundred and fifty-six closely written pages! It was written on foreign
                  post paper, very thin and flimsy, and the ink had faded a little. I had selected
                  this paper because I intended to mail the manuscript to Parlours' London
                     Journal, which in fact I did. I do not call that the first ordeal,
                  however, because nobody with a grain of sense could expect a journal that
                  published such trash as Parlours' contained would appreciate
                  "Harwood." In due time I got my manuscript back with a polite note (I don't
                  believe the fellow read a page of it), and a gentle rebuke for not sending
                  "postage stamps for return MS.," according to advertisement. It is only just to
                  qualify the above remark about trash, which should be limited to the
                     serial stories in Parlours'. All the rest is of
                  good quality.
               Between the date of "Harwood's" birthâ€”or I should say his death, at the murderous hands of
                  Parlours'â€”and the date of his resurrection, I had written sundry
                  small squibs, waifs upon the broad sea of light literature, and these had met with
                  a fair degree of success. They were printed in a monthly still living, and which I
                  hope may live a thousand years. The editor (may he live a thousand years, too!)
                  has been my true and constant friend, and one strong manifestation of his
                  friendship was in his treatment of my fugitives. He would change objectionable
                  words, and mend my lapses in taste or dictionâ€”never altering but to improve, never
                  touching but to adorn. Sometimes he would wholly reject some carelessly written
                  story, healing the bruise to my vanity by saying "it was not worthy of my
                  reputation!" and he was always right in the rejection, if his salve
                     was a flattering unction. I knew his taste was perfect, his
                  judgment sound, and his scholarship beyond question. Had I been handled by a
                  critic less acute or less friendly I should have been snubbed, and should have
                  laid my pen aside. But he encouraged while he instructed me, and of all the
                  helpers I have met in my literary working he has been most helpful. What can I
                  render him in requital? I dedicate "Harwood" to him with the hand of my heart.
               Having said this much in his praise, the melancholy duty remains to say a word
                     per contra. He is an editor! To fill this
                  office worthily it is necessary that a man should divest himself of ordinary
                  human-attributes. Of course, I refer to editors of magazines, whose chief writing
                  is in the reviews or critical notices of new books. Your regular review writer is
                  not necessarily truculent, as in most cases he does not read the books whose
                  titles he places at the head of his articles, using them merely as mottoes, upon
                  which he builds his essay. He need not read more than a sentence or two (in order
                  to quote) and he scarifies or pats his author on the back without the slightest
                  reference to the special deliverance under review, but with due regard to his
                  previous record, his political or theological proclivities, or any other matter
                  which the reviewer wishes to praise or blame. I know this is the system, for I,
                  also, have written quarterly articles. But this does not apply to your magazine
                  editor!
               The busy bee sucks his sustenance from the opening flower, and it is honey. The
                  gentle lamb that little Laura had, and the cross-grained old ram he became in
                  later months, subsisted on grass. The giraffe that stalks over the arid African
                  desert browses on the tree tops. The ostrich, his countryman, is said to feed on
                  ten-penny penny nails. The fierce Rodent, whose story is so frequently repeated in
                  "The House that Jack built," ate corn or malt, and was eaten in turn by Grimalkin.
                  The larger feline beast that prowls in tropic jungles, with shaggy mane and
                  hideous roar, eats antelopes and other small deerâ€”and man eats meat and bread
                  until he becomes an editorial critic. Then he changes his diet and subsists upon
                  the gore of authors! He tomahawks them, he scalps them (unless they have failed to
                  use the Balm of Columbia and have ceased to be hirsute), and he sucks their blood.
                  He sits upon their carcases like a vampire and fans them with his wings while he
                  drains their arteries!
               As my kind friend belonged to this fraternity it would hardly be supposed that I
                  would trust "Harwood" in his clutches. But I did. It was like sending a dear
                  little infant to play in the lava beds with Captain Jack in the neighbourhood. But
                  I did it, thus arguing:
               If he grinds his bones into powder and gloats over my misery in bereavement, it
                  will be in manuscript, and, therefore, more tolerable. It is far better to be
                  crushed in this form than in print. And, besides, he has to crunch the bones, like
                  Bulwer's Griffin, in solitude, and cannot appeal to an admiring public until the
                  book is published. Then, he has praised my minor efforts once and again, and
                  perhaps he may say, "it is no worse than the current trash of the day!" Or he may
                  have recently gorged himself with the gore of some unlucky wretch who preceded me,
                  and, with sated appetite, would glance complacently over part of the hundred and
                  fifty-six pages. Or he may dismiss me with a graceful wave of his editorial hand,
                  and with compassionate kindness say, "Burn it, my friend, burn it!" These are the
                  various things I expected. I knew he would tell the truth; I knew he
                  would pounce upon blemishes and root them out; and one morning I drank a cup of
                  strong coffee and sent him my manuscript!
               After the thing was done beyond recall I began to repent. I did not much care for
                  the demolition of my book, but I suddenly remembered that my characters would also
                  perish! "Oh, my gentle Ret!" I thought, "how could I be so cruel as to consign
                  thee to such tender mercies! If I had sent thee to visit Scarfaced Charley it is
                  true thy lovely tresses might dangle at the belt of the savage, but now! thou art
                  exposed to a more hideous fate! In painting thee I have dealt so tenderly with
                  thee from the very first that I have grown to love thee, my darling, and now,
                     poof! with one stroke of his pen this
                  vampire will consign thee to blank annihilation." I was heartily miserable.
                     Parlours' murder did not hurt me one whit, but this time, if
                  killed, "Harwood" would be beyond the curative powers of burnt brandy.
               And so passed two wretched days. On the third my manuscript came back, neatly
                  wrapped up and sealed. You know when you bury a fellow you put him in a mahogany
                  box and varnish it. My friend is neat and orderly in his habits, and I fancied I
                  could see him smacking his lips as he wrapped up that corpse, and gleefully wrote
                  my address in those plain round characters of his. I knew, when I should raise the
                  lidâ€”I mean, unwrap the parcelâ€”I should find his "comments" among the bones,
                  written in the same plain hand.
               Brush away the tears from your eyes, dear sympathizing reader, and go on with me
                  to the end. I untied the parcel, found the comments neatly folded reposing upon
                  the first page of my manuscript, and, summoning all my manhood, I opened and read
                  what follows:
               "MY DEAR â€”: You need not be afraid to send that story to any publisher; and as for
                  the critics, you may snap your fingers at them. It is goodâ€”out and out. I had
                  intended taking it by instalments of 30 or 40 pp., but I got so interested in the
                  thing that I went clear through in two sittings. It is natural, affecting,
                  powerful.
               "But â€”"
               The reader need not heed the "buts," though I did. A whole army of "buts" could
                  not vanquish that elegant sentence which I have honestly quoted, every word. You
                  cannot add to it. Oh, reader, be encouraged! If a blood-thirsty editor could say
                  so much, what must thou not say, who art so kind and gentle? Oh, critic! let fall
                  thy blade on vulnerable crests; "Harwood" bears a charmed life!
               Here endeth ordeal the first.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               THE SECOND ORDEAL.
               THOSE "buts" of my friendly critic gave me occupation for several nights. I cannot
                  point out all the amendments he suggested now. The reader will please give him
                  credit for any passages that appear particularly brilliant. The needed emendation
                  was a labour of love, and I was specially elated at the thought that I had
                  "bagged" one of the gunners, whose business was to slaughter romances. As for the
                  restâ€”Thomas, Richard and Henryâ€”I have been snapping my fingers at them, in my
                  mind's eye, ever since I emerged from the primal ordeal. The athlete who comes
                  unscarred from his first arena enters the second with the calm confidence that
                  presages victory.
               It was necessary to make a selection. There are numerous publishers in this happy
                  country, who give to its myriad readers all sorts of printed pabulum. I could not
                  divide "Harwood" to oblige them, and I did not desire to stir up a contention
                  among them by letting them all know the manuscript was open to propositions from
                  type setters. Clearly, I was bound to move cautiously and see what "terms" would
                  be proposed. One at a time.
               The name that first occurred to me was 
                     FIDLER & BROTHERS.
                   There were four reasons for giving this firm the precedence: first, they
                  publish an unlimited quantity of novels. It is probable that they have some mode
                  of classification unknown to the general public, but I arranged them in three
                  classes in my own mindâ€”as those I had read, those I had tried to read, and those
                  from whose titles I had recoiled with unspeakable horror. Among the first class
                  was a recent novel called "Biddy's Mistress." I read this while it was being
                  printed serially in Parlours' Journal, and survived, because I took
                  it in small doses as one takes castor oil in small, gelatinous capsules. The only
                  impression left by the story is a feeling of thankfulness that it is over, and
                  will not have to be taken again. I may as well say here, that "Biddy's Mistress"
                  is by the author of about a dozen similar stories that have appeared serially in
                     Parlours' Journal, and I am satisfied that they were all written
                  by the editor of that periodical. Nothing but the fond blindness of paternity
                  could excuse cuse any editor for printing
                  such astounding trash. And this prolific gentleman is the writer of the polite
                  note that accompanied my returned manuscript, and that contained the complaint
                  about postage stamps! Yet, Fidler & Brothers have reproduced these inane
                  narratives, which, being capsuled, I place in the first classâ€”as those I have
                  read. "Biddy's Mistress" was the last, and my resentment is still aglow against
                  it.
               Now, I argued, if Fidler & Brothers can print and find circulation for
                  "Biddy's Mistress," what may they not do with "Harwood?"
               The other three reasons may be taken together: Messrs. Fidler & Brothers also
                  print three periodicals of their own, and I think they give serials in all of
                  them; one of these has a circulation that is "unprecedented." If, therefore, they
                  should appreciate my work, and present it firstâ€”seriallyâ€”in the unprecedentedly
                  circulating medium; and secondly, using the same type, print it in book form, I
                  should be sure of reaching the greatest possible number of readers. It was not
                  precisely patriotism that inspired me to make the offer to them; it was
                  philanthropy. I wished to confer the greatest good upon the greatest number. That
                  I failed was not my fault; but it was the lasting misfortune of all Fidler &
                  Brothers' clients.
               To recount the story of my failure with this enterprising firm, let us begin at
                  the beginning: I took my precious manuscript and visited their colossal
                  establishment one day about noon. I climbed numberless steps in a spiral iron
                  staircase, in search of the authority who controlled the unprecedented periodical.
                  I found him occupied with a mass of manuscripts, and looking as cool and collected
                  as a blue bottle fly caught in a glue pot; or, if you please, in a mass of
                  amber.
               "Sir," said I, with a polite bow, "I have brought you a manuscript."
               "For the Unprecedented, sir?"
               "Yes, sir; if it should be found suitable;" and I handed the precious packet. He
                  received it very graciously and placed it in a pigeon hole.
               "I will have to trouble you to call again, sir, in about a week," he said. "I have
                  several manuscripts here that have precedence."
               "Before I go, sir," said I, "allow me to show you a note I have just received from
                  another editor, who is also a very severe critic," and I produced my friend's
                  epistle. "You need only read the first sentence to see his estimate
                  of the work."
               He took that note, which ought to be printed in golden letters, and placed in a
                  gorgeous frame, glanced incuriously at it, and handed it back without comment. I
                  thought I had "done" him, whereas I had only "done" Harwood.
               Let me explain.
               The forty unfortunate gentlemen who were smothered in boiling oil by Ali Baba's
                  servant had, no doubt, an affection for each other. Indeed, there is a proverb
                  extant, applied to persons of their occupation, which gives them credit for
                  honourable dealings among themselves. But editors are not troubled with similar
                  amiable weaknesses. My opinion is, they would enjoy cutting each other's throats.
                  So, when I revealed to the editor of the Unprecedented the flattering opinion of
                  the other, I might as well have committed "Harwood" to the flames. Love me, love
                  my dog.
               Punctually, at the end of the week I climbed the spiral stairs again. My editor
                  was ready for me. Doubtless he was ready an hour after my first interview.
               "I have read your book, sir," he began, with the benevolent smile that always
                  precedes rejection. "I found it very interesting."
               "I hope you will find room for it, then, in the 'Unprecedented.'"
               "Well, no," he said, with gushing tenderness, "it does not exactly suit."
               "Will you please favour me with your reason?"
               "It is quite readable," said he, gently, "but it is not quite up to the Mark!"
               I began to get into a rage, not violent, but suppressed. "Harwood" was rejected,
                  so I might indulge in a venomous remark or two.
               "I believe you printed "Biddy's Mistress," not only in your periodical but
                  afterwards in a book."
               "Yes; that is one of Snooks'. We always print Snooks' stories."
               "If you will allow me to say so," I ventured to say, "I think my story is better
                  reading than 'Biddy's Mistress.'"
               "Yes, so do I; but Snooks has a reputation, and I think he writes more in modern
                  style. Your story is a little old fashioned, but it is quite interesting."
               "If you mean by 'old fashioned' that it does not contain any indecent allusions,
                  to make it unfit to appear in any virtuous household, you are certainly
                  right."
               This only made him smile. It occurred to me, also, that there were several old
                  fashioned stories that did not come under that category.
               
               "If you choose to offer your manuscript to the other periodical," said the editor,
                  "it may be they will take it."
               "Thank you, no!" answered I. "I wished to print it in your Unprecedented for the
                  sake of the circulation and consequent notoriety. I am writing a sequelâ€”'The Lacy
                  Diamonds'â€”and I depended a little upon the reputation 'Harwood' might gain to
                  create a demand for that. Of course, I expected your house to print it in book
                  form also."
               "You might apply to them," said the editor politely, "but I don't think they would
                  print it."
               "Of course not," I said, as I rose to leave him; "I could hardly expect Messrs.
                  Fidler & Brothers to do so. As there is no international copyright, they get
                  food for their types without expense. I am sorry you have had to read so many
                  pages of defective penmanship in vain."
               "Oh, that is a mere matter of business," he replied wearily; "while I am reading
                  one I do not have to read another."
               As I revolved around the spiral staircase in descending, I thought I would count
                  the steps. There were seventy-one. If he had rushed out after me and offered me
                  for "Harwood" ten dollars a step for the two times I had surmounted them and the
                  two times I had descended, he would have received a prompt denialâ€”"Harwood" was no
                  longer for sale. Twenty eight hundred and forty dollars would have been no
                  temptation.
               At the last step I found my good humour again. That wretched man up stairs has to
                  sit there day after day, reading manuscripts! How could I harbour resentment
                  against him? And then he has to cater to a depraved taste, and it was not his
                  fault that "Harwood" did not reach the Mark. I wonder if "Biddy's Mistress" has
                  made that attainment? Fidler & Brothers have published it and sold ten
                  thousand copies, no doubt. People have bought the book and read it, all over the
                  country. Heaven forbid that the author of "Harwood" should ever write up to that
                  Mark!
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               THE THIRD ORDEAL.
               ALMOST all modern novel writers have fallen into the pernicious habit of printing
                  their works serially. The fraud was, doubtless, originally introduced by magazine
                  proprietors, who secured a continuance of subscription by stringing out a long
                  novel, by a popular author, through consecutive numbers of their periodicals.
                  Dickens, Bulwer, Thackeray, Collins and others fell into the trap, which (in their
                  cases) was probably well baited; but it is an abominable practice, and, so far as
                  authors are concerned, it is suicidal. People have slidden naturally from books to
                  magazines, and in another generation they will slide from magazines to newspapers;
                  and then the last refuge of fiction writers will be the New York
                     Ledger style of narrative, "To be continued." All of the "deathless"
                  works of Fielding, Scott and others, who lived before serials were invented, will
                  be dead as several door nails!
               I must confess, however, that this choice bit of moralizing is an afterthought,
                  which came to my mind at the end of the third ordeal, which remains to be
                  recounted.
               In addition to the slight stories which I wrote for the magazine edited by my
                  friendly critic, I wrote a multitude that he could not find room for. These were
                  published in various New York periodicals, the best of them in
                     Pippinville's Hebdomadal.
               Nothing could be more satisfactory than the treatment I received from the
                  conductors of this periodical. Of all the papers I prepared for them none were
                  ever rejected, excepting one, and I think that was crowded out, perhaps, by matter
                  from other contributors. At all events, my relations with the
                     Hebdomadal were always pleasant, and I felt certain that I had
                  the inside track there when I concluded to offer my larger bantling to them.
                  Messrs. Pippinville are very extensive publishers also, and have the reputation of
                  liberality in their dealings with authors whom they immortalize with their types.
                  For book printing my prospects were a hundredfold brighter with them than with
                  Messrs. Fidler & Brothers. But I had the "serial" fever still raging, and the
                     Hebdomadal was my next choice, failing the
                     Unprecedented. The editor was a graceful writer, whose
                  occasional contributions I had always
                  read with great pleasure, and it is quite possible that he had a fairish sort of
                  opinion of my offerings, for which he has given me several small cheques.
               When I presented myself and my manuscript to Mr. Bland, therefore, I felt
                  confident that I should find this last ordeal a very smooth one. There might be
                  reasons, such as far extended engagements with other writers, that would bar
                  "Harwood," but I thought his merits would be recognized at least.
               "Good morning, Mr. Bland," said I, as I entered his sanctum. "I have not been in
                  the Hebdomadal for so long a time that you are in danger of
                  forgetting me. The last time I was here you surprised me by returning my
                  manuscript."
               "We are still rejecting very freely," answered Mr. Bland. I don't know whether he
                  intended this for a semi-apology, for a stopper upon further offerings, or for a
                  warning. I was undaunted, however, and I drew out my hundred and fifty-six
                  pages.
               "Well, sir," I said, "I beg to offer you a novelâ€”"
               "Oh, you will have to see Mr. Chokemoff," he answered, hurriedly;" he attends to
                  the publication of books. You will find himâ€”"
               "Excuse me," said I, interrupting him. "I don't want Mr. Chokemoff. I wish you to
                  print this serially in the Hebdomadal. Of course, Messrs.
                  Pippinville will utilize the type already set up, and print it in book form after
                  you have done with it."
               "I don't see how I can do it," answered Mr. Bland, discontentedly. "I already have
                  a serial running, and have no space to spare, unless," he added, after a pause,
                  "it should be for something particularly attractive."
               "Perhaps you can decide better after looking at my manuscript."
               "Very well, leave it with me, then; I will try to look through it in a day or
                  two."
               A "day or two" always means three days at least. I waited three days and called
                  again. Mr. Bland had not had time to examine "Harwood," but he opened the parcel
                  and glanced at it with infinite disgust.
               "Thin paper!" he muttered, wrathfully, "and pale ink! It seems to me that writers
                  go out of their way to give trouble to manuscript readers!"
               "I regret the thin paper very much," I said, "but I intended the story for an
                  English journal, andâ€”"
               "To save a few cents postage you wrote on this abominable paper!" he answered,
                  finishing the sentence for me. "Oh, dear! it is in the form of a journal!" and he
                  turned over a dozen leaves rapidly, "and letters!!" and here his patience entirely
                  forsook him, and he stuffed the thin leaves back into the portfolio with a
                  groan.
               "My dear sir," I began, humbly, "I could not help it. The form in which the story
                  is toldâ€”and most of it is literally trueâ€”"
               "That is no advantage!"
               "Well, the most natural way to get the events narrated was as I have done it.
                  Indeed, I do not see how I could do otherwise. If I could only persuade you to
                  read a little way into the storyâ€”"
               "Leave it until Saturday, then," he said, savagely. "I will read it,
                  but I don't see how I can use it."
               I waited until Monday.
               Mr. Bland was quite composed when I appeared the next time. He had read enough to
                  get humanized a little.
               "I have read part of your story," said he. "It is interesting, but the title won't
                  do. You ought to call it 'Adventures in the Southwest.' The name don't indicate
                  anything. That description of the panther business is very readable; but the title
                  won't do."
               "You have not read enough, sir." I was getting mad by this time. "If you had gone
                  a little further you would have found that the title is very appropriate. Now,
                  please understand the case. I have no difficulty to surmount to get 'Harwood' into
                  type, but I am anxious to secure a large circulation. I am writing a sequel, 'The
                  Lacy Diamonds,' and if I can make 'Harwood' a success the next book will make its
                  own way. If you print it first in the Hebdomadal, and afterwards in
                  a duodecimo bookâ€”"
               "Can't do it," said Mr. Bland, "it will have to be octavo. Could not use the type
                  in duodecimo."
               "Well, I don't care about the size, but I do care about getting the Pippinville
                  imprint. If you would only break your leg, or something, so that you would have to
                  lie about at home for a few days, you might get time to read the whole of the
                  story."
               "Leave it a few days longer," he answered, setting his teeth with desperate
                  determination, "and I will get through it; but I don't see how I can possibly use
                  it in the Hebdomadal. Perhaps the house will publish it,
                  though."
               
               It is possible that the reader has had some experience of battle-fields. If so, he
                  will remember that the excitement that resembles trepidation passes away pretty
                  soon after one gets positively under fire. At first, the guns make a great deal of
                  noise, and the chance of getting hurt appears quite promising, especially if one
                  can see the fellows that are shooting; but in a short time one ceases
                  to notice the dust and smoke and the snappish rattle of the guns, and goes into
                  the business with cold blooded ferocity. I began my series of ordeals with
                  becoming modesty and humility; at the end of the third and last I was
                  bloodthirsty. I knew perfectly well that the next interview with Mr. Bland would
                  be the crisis. I postponed it ten days. He should not say I hurried him.
               I am somewhat discomposed at revealing to the "general public" so many of the
                  secrets of book making, but candour is one of my weaknesses. It may be that some
                  would-be author will light upon these revelations, and, profiting by my
                  experience, he may be led to abandon that Sisyphus-like occupation. It is the
                  easiest thing in nature to write a book; it is somewhat more difficult to get
                  type, as these adventures of mine will prove, and then there is something still to
                  be encountered. Critics? Bah! who cares for critics? If any would-be author dreads
                  them, let him try himself to cut up some other author. He will soon
                  find what a harmless sort of amusement it is! But, rash man, know there is the
                  PUBLIC! Ah, there is the only ordeal to be dreaded! You may get some kind friend
                  (like the present writer, for example) to give you a word of encouragement; you
                  may get through Fidler & Brothers and Pippinville and Co., but beware of that
                  hydra-headed monsterâ€”The Public!
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               THE THIRD ORDEAL CONCLUDED.
               AT the expiration of the ten days I found Mr. Bland in his cosy sanctum. He was
                  waiting for me and his mind was made up. But being a good natured man he intended
                  to let me down gently.
               "I have read your manuscript," he began, "and found it interesting."
               "In spite of the journal and letters â€”"
               "Yes. Those are certainly faults, but not fatal faults. It would have been far
                  better to have told the story in the third person, instead of the first. But there
                  are more serious objections."
               "What are they?"
               "Well, it is an American novel. Nobody wants an American novel. I hardly know how
                  an American novel could be made a success."
               "I believe you have printed two or three in the Hebdomadal, and
                  issued them afterwards as books, and you have had a good sale for them. Indeed, I
                  have been told that the author had obtained a very handsome price from another
                  publisher for her last copyright." This was intended for a shot between the eyes.
                  I knew there must be more or less soreness on that subject, as there is more or
                  less rivalry between publishers.
               "We did print the books you refer to," said Mr. Bland, "but there was something
                     in them. I mean in quantity. Now, yoursâ€”Why, there's nothing of
                  it!"
               "One hundred and fifty-six pagesâ€”"
               "Equal to less than a hundred of print! Have you counted the words?"
               "Yes. There are between four and five hundred words on a page."
               "Well. The Hebdomadal has seventeen hundred nearly. If I were to
                  print "Harwood" serially it would run through about three months and then it would
                  make an octavo of eighty pages. There's nothing of it! I tell you there's nothing
                  of it!"
               "I might enlarge it somewhat," said I, rather disconcerted. "There is hardly any
                  descriptive writing in itâ€”"
               "No use. It is too old-fashioned. And then the date!"â€”and he pulled "Harwood" out
                  of his pigeon hole and viciously tore him openâ€”"Eighteen hundred and thirty-six!
                  Do you know that was nearly forty years ago? Why, nobody was born at that era! You
                  might as well have laid the scene on Mount Ararat and described the landing of
                  Noah and his family. Oh, the date is totally out of the question."
               "My dear sir, I think I have mentioned before that the sequelâ€”'The Lacy
                  Diamonds'â€”"
               "Oh, we have nothing to do with the sequel. The date must be obliterated. You need
                  not have any date. What in the world do you want with a date? Nobody cares about
                  datesâ€”that is, nobody is going to grope in the darkness of remote antiquity when
                  he is reading a novel. Scratch out all the years, and leave the months only."
               "Well, that might be done, I suppose. Perhaps you are right. Anyhow, I perceive
                  the Hebdomadal rejects the story. Give me the manuscript."
               "There's Mr. Chokemoff. You might try him. The story is interesting. I read a
                  hundred and forty pages and then turned over to see how it ended. But there's
                  nothing of it! They might perhaps print it and give you a copyright, if you could
                  make it three or four times as big. I don't see how you could enlarge it, though.
                  Look at this!" and he snatched a book from a shelf, "here is one of those novels
                  you spoke ofâ€”there are four hundred pages of over eight hundred words! Three
                  hundred and twenty thousand words! Now, there is something of that!"
               "I am ashamed to say that I have not read it. In fact, I did not try. Good
                  morning, Mr. Bland."
               My portfolio felt very lank and light as I turned my back upon Pippinville's
                  establishment. I saw great rows of fat books, quartos and octavos, and wondered
                  how the writers had ever got so many words together. Do words roll out of
                  successful writers as water bubbles up from a spring? I saw "Trench on Words," and
                  had half a mind to buy it. I knew a man in New York who could talk straight on for
                  seven years without fatigue, and without saying anything. I thought of getting him
                  shut up somewhere with a stenographer, and so making the requisite number of
                  pages. Words! I had been under the delusion that Ideas were the important
                  things.
               But the objections to "Harwood" looked formidable as I reflected upon them.
                  "Old-fashioned and out of date!" If this is well taken then Ivanhoe and The
                  Talisman come under the same condemnation. Perhaps these critics referred rather
                  to the style than to the matter? And here "Harwood" is possibly faulty. I
                  endeavoured to write plain, simple English, and modern light literature is often
                  made up of dictionaries and encyclopedias. "Journal and letters!" Well, "Rob Roy"
                  is all made up of letters, and "Redgauntlet" is largely so composed, and these
                  books have been tolerably successful. As for the journalistic form, Wilkie Collins
                  has managed to invest it with considerable interest in "The Woman in White." The
                  "Date!" Mr. Bland was particularly cularly savage in his assault upon the date.
                  But I happened to remember a book, entitled "Waverley; or, 'Tis Sixty Years
                  Since." If Sir Walter could go back sixty years I might venture on forty.
               Supposing these disposed of, there remains the unanswerable "Nothing of it!" Poor,
                  little "Harwood!" After my long incubation have I really only hatched out a mouse?
                  Is it only on a par with one of those pious Sunday-school books, whose heroine
                  gets to heaven by having a drunken father, and a mother dying of consumption? One
                  hundred and fifty-six pages! Do you call that nothing? And besides, the story is
                  all told, be it long or short. It seems to me that the time to stop writing is
                  when you have completed your story. Something must be done, however, to enlarge my
                  book, and I suddenly remembered that I could get valuable suggestions from Mr.
                  Vampyre.
               I became acquainted with Mr. Vampyre some years ago in this wise. I had been
                  writing a series of articles for the New York Blazer and found it
                  necessary to read proofs. To do this I was obliged to climb to the fifth story of
                  the Blazer building about twice a week. The proofs were always
                  brought to me in Mr. Vampyre's officeâ€”a little apartment with one window opening
                  on the streetâ€”and I usually made my corrections at his desk. He was introduced to
                  me as "the book editor," and he was and is the most curiously amiable man that I
                  know. Six feet in his stockings, or out of them, weighing about two hundred,
                  bearded like the pard, he is as gentle as an infant, and seemingly incapable of
                  anger. Yet his "Book Notices" are perfectly terrific. The Blazer
                  has only one mission among books, and that is to exterminate them. We became
                  rather intimate while I was making my series (though since these were finished I
                  had not seen him for two or three years), and he would sometimes read passages
                  from his proofs. The contrast between his jolly good nature and the
                  blood-thirsty stuff he wrote was positively ludicrous.
               I found him at his desk on the last day of my third ordeal, and he brought the
                  ordeal to its conclusion.
               "What in the world is that parcel under your arm?" he asked, after we exchanged
                  greetings.
               "It is a manuscript."
               "Too big for the Blazer!" he said; "what is it?"
               "A novel! And I give you fair warning that I am not going to stand any of your
                  slashing. You must speak well of it when it appears."
               
               "Can't do it, my boy! I am sorry for you, but this shop don't deal in 'soft
                  sawder!' If you dare to print that lot of stuff, I'll certainly skin it!"
               "Have you no bowels of compassionâ€”"
               "Not a bowel! But I can probably slash it in such a fashion as to attract
                  attention to it, and that will make it sell. This is all you will care about, you
                  know. Are you going to print it anonymously?"
               "Certainly. But I'm in a quandary, and have climbed up your horrid staircase to
                  ask you for help."
               "What is the trouble? I am quite ready to help you in any way in my power, except
                  by partial criticism. That is not in my line." Here a pallor overspread his
                  handsome face, and he faltered out, "You won't want me to read your
                  manuscript?"
               "Not a word; never fear. But the trouble is that there's nothing of it!"
               "Is that all? My dear fellow, that is precisely the trouble with all the books I
                  review. I got through 'The Double Parricide' last week. It contained five hundred
                  pages, and there was nothing of it, I assure you, especially after I had done with
                  it!"
               "My novel is nothing like 'The Double Parricide,' Mr. Vampyre. It is a very
                  sensible story, and the only serious defect is want of bulk. It won't make enough
                  pages of print!"
               "Well, why can't you keep on writing until you get it long enough?"
               "Because it is finished. How can I 'keep on' when my characters are all deadâ€”or
                  married, which is about as bad? One can't keep up interest beyond the dÃ©nouement."
               "I suppose not," said Mr. Vampyre, reflectively. "How many words have you?"
               "Seventy-five thousand."
               "Great Methuselah! How many do you lack?"
               "Seventy-five thousand."
               Mr. Vampyre whistled softly, and meditated. He is a man of unlimited expedients,
                  and I knew I should get some practical suggestion from him if I waited. His life
                  was spent among books, and he would certainly know what was best to be done. He
                  opened a drawer in his desk, got out two cigars and a match. We smoked five or ten
                  minutes, while he looked over the pages of my manuscript. At last he closed the
                  portfolio with a sigh of relief.
               "Will you leave this bundle of stuff with me until to-morrow?"
               "Certainly."
               "Well, come up again to-morrow. I have an idea! In fact I have two ideas. But I
                  must get through this proof now for tomorrow's paper. Keep a good heart. I see the
                  way out of your trouble!"
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               EUREKA!
               THE misgivings that had preyed upon my mind in the interval between my two
                  interviews with my friend Vampyre were all dispelled by his cheerful greeting on
                  the second morning. He was seated at his desk. There was in his tout ensemble that air of conscious power belonging to
                  men weighing two hundred pounds avoirdupois and adorned with a big beard. He had
                  an enormous roll of manuscript before him from which he appeared to be making
                  selections, as he was busily taking a pile of sheets from the general mass and
                  smoothing them out in a separate parcel.
               "Now, my friend," he began, "sit down here, and heed my major proposition. If I
                  understood you yesterday, your trouble is want of bulk?"
               "Yes, that is the main difficulty."
               "You have no doubt about the quality of the stuff you have scratched down here in
                  these hundred and fifty-six pages? By-the-bye, you write an atrocious hand! Do you
                  know that the printers get paid by the quantity of matter they set up? Well, every
                  minute that you compel a printer to waste in deciphering your abominable
                  hieroglyphics is so much of a fraud. There is no excuse for it in your case,
                  because your manuscript is really legible in spots!"
               "I did my best, Vampyre. The Blazer printers used to say my copy
                  was good."
               "They lied, then. But to my question. Does the matter suit you, as far as it
                  goes?"
               "Yes. Very good judges have complimentedâ€”"
               "Pooh! Don't be misled by praises. Wait until I get my knife at work on you! I
                  have made a memorandum of a dozen passages I intend to skin when it gets to print!
                  Ha! ha! Listen to this: 'As the red gleam
                  of the lightning illuminated the plain Lord Fitzgerald spurred his steed in his
                  mad career. He held the bridle in his teeth, and with petronel in one hand and
                  sword in the otherâ€”'"
               "What in the world are you reading, Vampyre?" said I, aghast, "there is no such
                  passage as that in my book!"
               "Not yet, my boy, but there will be! Now just lay aside your vanity and listen to
                  what I propose. This manuscript," and he laid his hand impressively upon the roll,
                  "was sent to me by a schoolmate of mine. Poor Tom! he was always a little shaky in
                  his upper story, and now all of his lunacy has been collected in this mass of
                  precious stuff! He writes me to 'read it, and to do what I please with it.' Well,
                  now I can serve two friends at once. You can take as many pages of this as you
                  need, and incorporate them in your immortal workâ€”what d'ye call it? Oh!
                  yesâ€”"Harwood." You can change the names, you know, and as many sheets as you take
                  will reduce the lot that I have to burn! For my friendship for Tom demands the
                  bonfire! Just think of it! six hundred and odd pages, of five hundred words each!
                  and all of it very similar to the passage I read to you. I ask you, on your
                  conscience, can I do less than burn them?"
               "All, except what you have selected for me," I answered, with suppressed rage.
                  "You think I can make up the required bulk with such matter as you read?"
               "Exactly! I have picked out the most stirring passages, and I think you might send
                  Tom a cheque for a moderate sum if you use his stuff. Don't say anything
                  uncomplimentary though, for he is as short tempered as the Double Parricide man.
                  But I have not told you about him?"
               "No."
               "Well, you ought to know the story. Probably you can utilize that also. He came up
                  here two hours ago, and was completely out of breath when he came in. I gave him
                  the chair you occupy, and he sat there and fanned himself with his hat about
                  fifteen minutes, while his lungs resumed their normal action. He is a little
                  fellow, about your size, though scarcely so heavy, but as plucky as a dog."
               "Are you Mr. Vampyre?" he said at length.
               "At your service, sir."
               "Did you write the review of the 'Double Parricide' in last week's
                     Blazer?"
               "I did, sir."
               "Well, sir," he said, rising, and stretching himself out as long as he could, "I
                  am the author of that work!"
               "Ah, indeed," I answered politely, "resume your seat, sir. I am glad to meet
                  you."
               "And I am glad to meet you, sir! I have climbed up these infernal steps of yours
                  to tell you my opinion of you."
               "Quite unnecessary, my dear sir. I dealt as lightly with your work as possible.
                  There were many things I intended to say about it, but want of space forbade. For
                  instance, the title is absurd!"
               "What do you mean, sir?"
               "Why no man can be a double parricide unless he is a double fellow, like the
                  Siamese twins. How the deuce can a fellow kill his father twice?"
               "I cannot tell you what his answer was. He talks two or three languages, and being
                  very much excited, he went from English to French and from French to German, and
                  he cursed me roundly in all three. At last, the little whelp made a dive at me. I
                  think he intended to elongate my nose. I caught his arm, then took him by the
                  waistband and dropped him out the window."
               "Vampyre!"
               "Oh, it did not hurt him much. He fell on a wheelbarrow and knocked it into
                  splinters. The owner of the wheelbarrow made no allowance for the altitude from
                  which the author had descended, but collared him incontinently, as he rose from
                  among the fragments. There was a crowd in a minute, and some policemen came up and
                  took them all off."
               "You don't expect me to believe that, Vampyre?"
               "No. But I do expect your readers to believe it, if you present it properly. But
                  that was my second plan. What do you say to my first?"
               "I have to decline. I can't make Lord Fitzgerald assimilate with 'Harwood.'"
               "Well. It would save a good lot of writing. I thought you would probably decline,
                  for all authors think their own productions better than any other's. You could
                  easily mix in these scenes. Why, Tom has a real earthquake in this selection.
                  Listen! 'As the roar of the tempest increased, Lord Fitzgerald was startled to
                  feel the solid rock, upon which he stood, vibrating in the throes of an
                  earthquakeâ€”'"
               
               "My dear Vampyre, such a shocking affair would knock the life out of 'Harwood!' I
                  must positively decline. Let me hear your second plan."
               "It is very simple. How many people have seen your manuscript? I infer that you
                  have been the round of the publishers, or you would not have discovered your
                  attenuated condition."
               In answer to this question, I told Mr. Vampyre all that I have told the reader in
                  the first five chapters. When my narrative was finished, Mr. Vampyre, who seemed
                  to enjoy the story amazingly, clapped me on the back triumphantly.
               "Go in and win, my boy! Write down all you have told me, word for word, and let it
                  be the introduction to Harwood. You will accomplish two or three things at
                  once.
               "First, you will get that much matter in addition, and make your bulk sufficient.
                  Second, you will hide the objectionable journalistic form, which your readers will
                  know nothing about until they have gotten so far into your story that they will
                  have to go on. And third, you will be giving the public some true
                  matter to leaven the lump of fiction you have written."
               "Shall I include my interviews with you?"
               "By all means. If you put in the Double Parricide and tell about the wheelbarrow
                  catastrophe, you had better say my sanctum is on the tenth floor!"
               "That wheelbarrow story is a little too strong, Vampyre, to mingle with my more
                  modest fiction."
               "See there now!" answered Vampyre, "the wheelbarrow story is founded on fact. I
                  actually knew a Hibernian labourer to fall from a scaffolding as high as this
                  window, and to escape with a few bruises. He fell on a wheelbarrow, which was
                  totally wrecked. I am not like you fellows, who weave impossible plots. There is
                  an air of vraisemblance about my yarns which you
                  won't find in your hundred and fifty-six pages."
               "Did you read any of my manuscript?"
               "Ye-es! Oh, certainly!"
               "How much? Tell the truth."
               "Well, my boy, I read the title, and then turned over until I came to the end of
                  the journalâ€”"
               "Which is the end of the book!"
               "Exactly. I read the last page, every word. You'll do!" he continued,
                  encouragingly. "I was greatly pleased with the conclusion!"
               The more I reflected upon Vampyre's plan the more it pleased me. I could not make
                  matter to stick about in odd places. The story was told, and I feared to mar its
                  fair proportions. In my young days, I remember that great statesmen in legislative
                  halls were sometimes put up to speak "against time." I, imitating their worthy
                  example, have been writing against space.
               Oh, injured reader, I have thus led thee along through the foregoing pages,
                  pretending to have an entertaining story to relate, when I was all the time slyly
                  counting the new pages, and rejoicing in the prospect of so much added bulk. No
                  longer will I pursue these devious ways. I am sick of the constructive deceit I
                  have been practicing, the more especially as the end is accomplished which I had
                  in view when I began it. Accept my repentance, gentle reader, and begin the
                     real story on the next page, with unruffled composure. Sincerely
                  do I hope that thou wilt enjoy the reading as much as I have enjoyed the
                  writing.

               HERBERT'S JOURNAL.
               
                  FIRST IMPRESSIONS.
                  
                     BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA, May 1, 1836.
                  
                  I PROMISED my dear Mother that I would keep a journal regularly and
                     systematically; and though I have allowed a week to slip away since I arrived
                     here, it is not too late to begin. I hardly know what to set down for my "first
                     impressions" of Louisiana life and manners; but I want this diary to be as true
                     and faithful a transcript of my real feelings, and as literal a history of my
                     sayings and doings, as I can make it. As it will always be in my power to
                     destroy the record, I need not hesitate about writing with perfect freedom. I
                     may remark one thing at the beginning, which is, that one week's sojourn here
                     has sufficed to make a man of me. I can imagine myself twenty-nine instead of
                     nineteen. As to-morrow will be Sunday, I will have more time and a better
                     opportunity for journalizing, and will therefore postpone the regular beginning
                     of my short story until then.
               
               
                  
                     SUNDAY, May 2, 1836.
                  
                  Just a month agoâ€”that is, on the first of Aprilâ€”I was at work at my desk in the
                     counting-room of Jalap & Julap, wholesale Druggists, of Baltimore. I had
                     had a small fight with Mr. Julap, the junior partner, who pretended to know
                     more about book-keeping than I did, and who consequently undertook to correct
                     some entries I had made. It is worth while to notice here that the quarrel
                     began by Mr. Julap's translation of a French label; or, rather, of a French
                     phrase on an English label. It was on a bottle of English perfumery, and was
                     the well known motto to on the English Arms: "Honi soit
                        qui mal y pense." I had remarked that the first word ought to be
                     written "Honni," when Mr. Julap replied that "honi was the French for honey, and there was honey in the
                     perfumery, no doubt." I was silly enough to endeavour to set him right, before
                     two or three grinning clerks, and then he fell to abusing me for bad book
                     keeping, because I had proved him guilty of bad French. He knew about as much
                     of one as of the other, so of course he made an ass of himself. Mr. Jalap was
                     in New York, so he was fuller of authority than usual, and I could not forget
                     that I was always above him at school, though he was six years my senior. The
                     quarrel would have become serious if we had not been interrupted by the
                     entrance of a stranger, and I resumed my work, intending to renew the contest
                     at the earliest opportunity. The new comer announced himself as Mr. Bayard, of
                     Louisiana, and I soon became deeply interested in him and in his discourse. He
                     had that free, off-hand manner for which Western and Southern men are
                     distinguished, and he came from a State that has always figured in my dreams as
                     El Dorado.
                  "I am looking," said he, after a pause in the conversation, "for a young man
                     who understands book-keeping, and who has some knowledge of drugs and
                     chemicals, to take charge of a store I am about to open in Baton Rouge. Can
                     you, sir, assist me in the search?"
                  Before Mr. Julap had time to reply I had slid down from my stool, and,
                     approaching the stranger, stammered out, "I will go with you, sir!"
                  "And who are you?" he asked, half surprised and half amused.
                  "Herbert Harwood, sir."
                  "And what does this gentleman say?" glancing at Mr. Julap.
                  "Oh, he has my consent, sir," replied Julap with a sneer, "and I can safely say
                     that he knows more about drugs and books than he does about French."
                  "The French will come in good time," said Mr. Bayard, rising and taking his
                     hat, "come to Barnum's Hotel at six this afternoon, youngster, and we will
                     arrange about terms. I like your looks, and foresee that we shall get along
                     famously. Good-bye." He shook hands with me with a kindly smile, nodded to Mr.
                     Julap, and left.
                  That is about all the story. Of course there was a fuss at home, and of course
                     Mother and the girls cried, and I got a little spoony myself;â€”but here I am in
                     Baton Rouge, and as happy as a lark.
               
               
                  
                     CARRVILLE, LA., Sunday, May 9, 1836.
                  
                  I am not altogether certain that it is proper, or in accordance with my
                     Presbyterian training, for me to devote Sabbath days to this work of
                     journalizing. Hereafter I will find some other time, for Mother's sake; for I
                     know she would not approve of a work which is neither of mercy nor necessity.
                     But I am just now so full of an adventure which I had to-day that I must write
                     it down to-night. In the first place, we, that is, Mr. Bayard and I, have moved to the town of Carrville,
                     twenty miles lower down the river than Baton Rouge, and he intends to open his
                     store here. Our goods are coming round by sea from Baltimore to New Orleans,
                     and they will not be at the latter city for two or three weeks, and in the
                     meantime we have little to do, except fixing shelves and counters. Mr. Bayard
                     brought me here last Monday, and left the same day for New Orleans. I expect
                     him back tomorrow. We came in the steamboat "Firefly," which is the regular
                     packet plying between Baton Rouge and the city. The "Firefly" is owned and
                     commanded by a queer old Frenchman named Captain Joli. I shall have some funny
                     stories to tell about him, if we meet often. For example: I was very much
                     hurried on Monday, and wishing to know exactly how much time I had, I ran down
                     to the landing early in the morning, and asked Captain Joli at what hour his
                     boat started? His reply wasâ€”
                  "Ten o'clock, sare, precise! You not here a quarter before ten,
                     you be lef', begar!"
                  The "Firefly" usually arrived from Baton Rouge a little before noon, and when
                     there is a shipment of cotton on our landing the boat remains at Carrville
                     several hours. This was the case the other day, and Captain Joli, leaving the
                     loading in charge of his subordinates, spent an hour or so with me. He found me
                     poring over "La Vie de Washington," and overheard some of my attempts at French
                     pronunciation, which seemed to disgust him considerably.
                  "Pardon, Monsieur Hubbard," said he, "vil you pleese say twenty-eight in
                     French?"
                  "Vingt-huit."
                  "C'est bon! Now say 'huit' by himself."
                  "Ungweet!" I answered, honestly striving to imitate him.
                  "Mille tonnerres! I did not tell you to gront
                     like one peeg! Huit!"
                  "Huit!"
                  "Ah, that is better. It is ver' strange you not talk good French, ven you read
                     him so well. Many peoples speak good French here. S'pose you talk much French
                     every day with Monsieur Carr? I will give you lesson, too. Dis time, I give you
                        huit, oui, dixhuit! You mus' not say
                        'wee,' but oui. Do you observe ze difference?"
                  "Yes, sir. You are very kind, Captain, and I will strive to profit by your
                     lessonsâ€”"
                  "Ah, you have ze small sword also! Come out in ze yard, and I shall give you
                     another lesson. Bah! we do not want ze mask. I shall not scratch your
                     face."
                  "But I may scratch yours, Captain."
                  "I will take ze risque. Allons!"
                  I took down the foils, and we walked out into the little enclosure behind the
                     store. There is a large China tree here, and under its shade the gallant
                     Captain gave me my lesson. I have been a pretty good fencer for several years,
                     and was a favourite pupil of our old Baltimore instructor. But he was an
                     Italian, and therefore did not take to sword play as a Frenchman does. Captain
                     Joli put me through the ordinary exercise, correcting slight inaccuracies here
                     and there, and politely complimenting me upon my skill.
                  "Now, mon ami," quoth the Captain, who began to be fond of me, "regardez! You
                     straddle your long legs too much. Ven I call fendez-vous! you stretch about five feet. You must always keep
                     your legs under you, and be ready for retreat. Now strike my breast, en carte."
                  I gave him the thrust in straight carte. He did not oppose his blade, but
                     simply drew his body back. My foil did not reach him by several inches. He then
                     reversed the proposition, and I avoided his thrust in the same manner. This was
                     a grand attainment. He then put me carefully through the parades of prime, seconde
                     and octave, and made me expert in the
                     semi-circular parry. We resumed our coats, walked into the store, and while we
                     blew a double cloud of fragrant smoke, the Captain finished his lesson
                     verbally.
                  "You cannot tell, mon ami, when you may be required to do sword play in
                     earnest."
                  "Do you mean in a duel, Captain?"
                  "Yes; all gentlemen have to fight some time."
                  "I shall never fight a duel, Captain," I answered, positively.
                  "Che sarÃ¡, sarÃ¡!" responded the Captain,
                     sententiously. I started as he uttered the proverb.
                  "Where did you learn that, sir?" said I, in astonishment.
                  "Ah, that is a villanous motto of a villanous race. It means, 'What will be,
                     will be,' and was ze proverb of ze Medicis. I do not know why I repeated it
                     just now."
                  "It is also the motto of a better race than the Medici," I replied.
                  "It is blank fatalism!" quoth the Captain, "and it is not true."
                  "I understand it to mean the same thing as an article of my creed, sir," I answered, after a pause, "namely:
                     'God hath, from all eternity, foreordained whatsoever cometh to pass.'"
                  "Ver' bad philosophy!" replied Captain Joli. "But to return to ze sword play.
                     Ze sword has always been ze weapon of a gentleman, and always will be. To be
                     master of it there are only two or three principles to learn, and ze rest is
                     mere practice. First: you must look into your adversary's eyes,
                     and learn to detect each change of parade wizout seeing his blade. Second: you
                     must feel his weapon wiz yours, all ze same as if you felt wiz
                     your hand. Third: you must be content wiz enough defence to deflect his blade
                     from your body. One inch from your person is just as good as two yards. If you
                        know you are covered, you fight wiz assurance. And if you
                     observe my rules, and practice patiently, you will become nearly
                     invulnerable."
                  "Suppose two men meet, Captain, who are equally skilfulâ€”if your theory is true,
                     neither will gain an advantage."
                  "Ah! that is not a supposable case. But if it were, one man would get excited,
                     and poof! ze other plug him!" The Captain reflected a few minutes, and
                     continued, "I have had four experienceâ€”ze first time I got a coup in my arm; it
                     hurt like ze diable!"
                  "And the other times, Captain?"
                  "Eh, bien! I am here!" The Captain rose and took his hat. "Au revoir, Monsieur!
                     Ze next time we meet we shall confine ourselves to prime and seconde."
                  When the boat arrived at this place the other day, Mr. Bayard handed me over to
                     a strange gentleman, who was the only other passenger for Carrville, saying he
                     would go on to the "City" (as everybody calls New Orleans), and return in about
                     a week. The stranger was Mr. Charles Carr. I will try to describe him when I
                     have more time. As the "Firefly" pushed off from the landing Mr. Bayard called
                     out, "Good bye, Herbert; take care of yourself!" He has always called me by my
                     Christian name (which he pronounces "Hubbard"), and as Carr and I walked up
                     from the river, he once or twice addressed me as "Mr. Hubbard." I remember that
                     now, though I did not notice it particularly at the time. When we reached the
                     hotel, Mr. Carr walked up to the desk in the bar-room, and entered my name on
                     the register as "Mr. Hubbard, of Baton Rouge." I was so shy and foolish that I
                     did not correct the mistake, and I am ashamed to add, that I have not corrected
                     it up to this hour. I have been introduced to fifty people as Mr. Hubbard, and
                     I really feel like crying when I think how horridly stupid I will look when the
                     truth comes out. Of course, I cannot make everybody understand the case as I
                     understand it. It was awkward to say to the first stranger, "my name is
                     Harwoodâ€”not Hubbard;" because it looked as though I thought myself of so much
                     importance; and every time the introductions took place the difficulty
                     increased. I have not even told Carr, who is a first rate fellow, and who would
                     appreciate my peculiar difficulty if I were to tell him just how I feel about
                     the affair. I have concluded to leave the whole matter in the hands of
                     Providence, and don't intend to let it annoy me any longer, if I can help it.
                     Mr. Bayard will be able to work me out of the mess when he comes back.
                  But all this is not the story I sat down to tell; and I will scratch that down
                     now in as few words as possible, for it is getting late, and I am tired to
                     death and want to go to bed. Well, all last week I was overlooking the men who
                     were fixing up the shelves in the store, directing them as to the width and
                     height, &c., and very lazy work it has been. Every day Charley Carr would
                     ride into town (he lives about two miles off), and spend two or three hours
                     with me, sometimes fencing, sometimes teaching me some new steps in dancing,
                     and sometimes helping me in my French. He fences like some Frenchman I have
                     read about, who could make his sword do everything but talk. I never saw
                     anything like it, and I would give five dollars to see him encounter my old
                     conceited Italian teacher, Mazzi, who used to put on so many airs with us boys,
                     when he twitched our foils out of our hands. Well, well, well! I shall never
                     get to the adventure; I will tell it right straight, without any more
                     circumlocution. Yesterday Carr said:
                  "Hubbard, will you join a small lot of us fellows in a deer hunt
                     to-morrow?"
                  "To-morrow will be Sunday," I replied.
                  "I know that," said Carr, "and as you will not have any men at work here, I
                     thought you could get off on that day."
                  "But I have no horse," I answered, "and no gun; and besides I don't likeâ€”"
                  "Come, come, sir, you shall have Ret's mare. She is a little skittish, and will
                     be all the better after a good gallop; I don't believe we shall find any deer,
                     though, as the season is so late; but we shall have a pleasant time, and you
                     will see something of the country back of the river. I will send a boy in with
                        the mare early in the morning, and
                     you can stop at our house on your way to the meeting place, and get Herbert's
                     gun and accoutrements. I will have all ready for you."
                  Who was Ret? and who was Herbert?
                  As Carr mounted his horse, half an hour later, he turned to me, with a kind
                     smile in his great blue eyes, and said.
                  "Maybe you don't like to spend Sunday in mere amusement; if your conscience is
                     against the frolic I won't urge you to violate your principles."
                  "If you may do it why should not I?"
                  "Oh, I am a free thinker," he replied, half sadly and half contemptuously.
                  I was a little provoked as I noticed the shadow of a sneer in his voice and
                     manner, and I, therefore, made no reply. He rode off without further remark,
                     taking it for granted that I intended to go, though I had almost decided that I
                     should not. With my customary tardiness I had allowed him to fall into the
                     mistake, intending to write an excuse and apology this morning when the boy
                     brought the horse.
                  When I got up this morning I looked out of my window and saw a negro leading a
                     beautiful black mare up and down the street before the door. The mare was
                     curveting and capering about at a great rate, and the man evidently had his
                     hands full. I recognized Carr's servant, Jacobus, who had once or twice brought
                     me messages from his master, and as I watched the gambols of the spirited
                     animal he had in charge, all my good resolutions vanished, giving place to an
                     uncontrollable desire to bestride the magnificent beast. I dressed hastily, and
                     opening the window, called the negro to the sidewalk.
                  "Have you been here long, Jacobus?"
                  "Jist come, Mars'r. Jist hitch my hoss yonder, and was gwine to knock at your
                     door, only dis black varmint would not be quiet. Gosh! Mars'r, she'll take you
                        in a gust dis day!"
                  "Did Mr. Carr send any message?" I asked.
                  "Got um note here, sar," replied Jacobus, pulling his hat off, and taking the
                     missive out of the lining. I believe negroes carry everything in their hats. I
                     descended to the street, and taking the note read as follows:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "DEAR H.â€”We are to start from Maltby's house, where we are to get
                                 breakfast. Jacobus will guide you. Don't ride with spursâ€”the mare
                                 is very excitable to-day.
                              
                                 Yours,
                                 C. C."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  I had pulled on a pair of riding boots, with spurs screwed into the heels, and
                     as I could not easily get them out, I mentally promised to keep my heels away
                     from the mare's sides, and mounted. Jacobus noticed the spurs as he held the
                     stirrup, and exclaimed:
                  "Gosh! Mars'r Hubbard, if you tetch Midnight wid one of dem squrs
                     she'll jump clean outen her hide!"
                  "I can't get the spurs out of my boots, Jake," I replied, "but I will take care
                     she does not feel them."
                  "Werry well, Mars'râ€”you best not. You see, sah, Midnight is lady's hoss, and
                     ain't 'quainted wid squrs. Mars'r Herbert rode her once, and jist let his squr
                     tetch her, and she flung him clean over her head. Him not easy flung
                     neither."
                  "Is Mr. Herbert Mr. Charley's brother?" I asked with some curiosity.
                  "No, sar," answered Jacobus, "Mars'r Herbert is Miss Ret's brudder."
                  "And who is Miss Ret, Jake?"
                  "Him Mars'r Herbert's sister, sar!" replied Jake, innocently, and with the air
                     of a man who was giving valuable information.
                  We rode on in silence for a mile or more. I was not willing to question the
                     negro too closely concerning family matters, though I was burning with
                     curiosity to know who these new comers on the scene could be. I have seen the
                     elder Mr. Carr once or twice, and am inclined to think that I should admire him
                     very much if I knew him better. He must have resembled his son when he was at
                     his age, though there is a great dissimilarity in their appearance now. Mr.
                     Carr is a grey, grave, old looking man, wonderfully courteous and affable,
                     though seemingly habitually melancholy. I remember that he expressed a great
                     deal of interest in me, when Charley introduced me to him, and that he said
                     something about the beauty of Baltimore, my native city. I suppose he really
                     cared very little about me or my birthplace, and I have credited his apparent
                     interest to his natural politeness. It is a great thing, certainly, to be born
                     a gentleman, and Mr. Carr and I have both had this good fortune.
                  As Jake and I rode on I noticed the sweet odours of the country much more
                     apparent as we got further from the river. My walks have hitherto been confined
                     to the bank of the majestic stream upon whose broad bosom I have travelled for
                     so many hundreds of miles. Compared with the rivers of my own State, the Mississippi is very dull and
                     uninteresting in appearance. Its waters seem always muddy, and its margins are
                     so low and monotonous. But one cannot see the steamers passing each hour of the
                     day, and hear the bark of their high pressure engines all through
                     the night, without getting a large conception of the magnificence of this great
                     highway. About two miles from Carrville our horses stopped to drink in the
                     middle of a sparkling little creek, which seemed more charming to me from its
                     contrast to the yellow river I saw every day, and I promised myself the
                     pleasure of many a walk hereafter to so beautiful a locality. My sable guide
                     informed me that this creek was called "Manahio." This is the name of Mr.
                     Carr's estate, and I presume this little rivulet is the one of which I have
                     heard my friend speak. The name is Indian, and signifies "Bright Water." Carr
                     told me that the streamlet separated his father's lands from another estate,
                     whose name he did not mention, and we have projected a fishing excursion to
                     some of the deep pools of the Manahio, to come off in June or July.
                  The valley through which the creek flows appeared to me like some dream of
                     fairyland. I have never seen, in my own colder home, anything like the abundant
                     and gorgeous vegetation of these southern forests. As we rode up the hill,
                     rising abruptly from the water, I checked my horse for a moment to admire the
                     scene. I shall not try to describe itâ€”at least, not now. I will only say that I
                     thought of Buckingham's curseâ€”"marriage and a life in the country"â€”and
                     concluded that the curse might fall upon me, and that it would rest full
                     lightly if I might select this spot for my home and be allowed some small space
                     to seek for my "partner in distress." Just at the ford there are three enormous
                     laurels (Magnolia Grandiflora), their trunks
                     half hidden by the undergrowth, there being no other tall trees in their
                     immediate vicinity. Jacobus had pulled up his horse behind me, and observing my
                     admiration of the scene, he pointed to the magnolias and saidâ€”
                  "Dem is de haunted laurels, sar!"
                  "Haunted!" I exclaimed.
                  "'Deed dey is, sar; plenty of people done seen de ghossesses. Mars'r seed 'em
                     one time. Him nebber ride 'long dis road at night!"
                  "What kind of ghossesses are they, Jake?" I asked.
                  "Well, sar," answered the African, edging his horse a little nearer to mineâ€”"it
                     am purty long story, but we got two mile good yet to git to Mars'r Maltby'sâ€”and
                     of you like to hear him, I'll try to tell him."
                  But I am not going to repeat Jake's story to-nightâ€”two o'clock, by Jupiter!
                     I'll go to bed now, and try to finish this interminable yarn to-morrow. And in
                     order to make the narrative as coherent as possible, I will begin with the wild
                     legend, which, I am ashamed to say, makes me feel extremely uncomfortable
                     whenever I think about it. So I will try to think about home till I fall
                     asleep, and, maybe, I can dream about Mother.
               
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               THE HAUNTED LAURELS.
               
                  MONDAY, May 10, 1836.
               
               I FEEL like a stewed witch this evening, and no wonder. All day I have been
                  harassed by the workmen who are fitting shelves and drawers in the adjoining room,
                  and who were perpetually wanting instructions, and Carr has been here, and I have
                  promised to go with him to Manahio to-morrow night, to return on Wednesday morning
                  after breakfast. I must record yesterday's adventure, while it is
                  fresh in my mind; and I have provided myself with two candles, and mean to write
                  while I can keep awakeâ€”so here goes! Jake's story is the first thing in order, and
                  may be entitled "The Haunted Laurels."
               Five years ago Mr. Carr was parish judge, and his neighbour, Mr. John â€” (the negro
                  called him "Mars'r John" all through his tale, and I forgot to ask his name), was
                  State's attorney for this parish. At that time there was an unusual degree of
                  excitement throughout all the eastern parishes of Louisiana, caused by the
                  persistent efforts of a handful of Abolitionists to induce slaves to abscond, and
                  it was said, also, to incite an insurrection. Very vigorous measures were adopted,
                  some of which were extra legal, and five or six men were arrested, tried and
                  hungâ€”most of them under the authority of Judge Lynch. Among these victims there
                  were two men, father and son, who were arrested under suspicious circumstances, at
                  a plantation in the neighbourhood. They were strangers, and no white man could
                     be found, between the date of their
                  arrest and day of their death, who had ever seen them before. I could not get from
                  Jacobus any very coherent account of the trial of these Densons, or of the
                  testimony upon which they were condemned. Letters were found upon their persons,
                  written by a noted Abolitionist who was tried at Baton Rouge the same year, and
                  who is now in the State penitentiary, sentenced to imprisonment for life. This
                  man, Sumner, who was, perhaps, the most guilty, who openly avowed his sentiments
                  in the court room, was the only one who had a regular trial, and the only one that
                  escaped the halter. His offence, however atrocious in intention and tendency, was
                  one exactly provided for in the law of the State, and the penalty was life
                  imprisonment at hard labour. There is little doubt, however, that he would have
                  shared the fate of his accomplices, if he had been tried under Lynch law.
               The Densons were chained to one of the three laurels on the bank of the Manahio,
                  near the high road, that they might be visible to all passers by, whose
                  recognition of them might avert an impending doom. Two or three dozen young
                  planters from the neighbourhood, armed to the teeth, kept constant guard over
                  them, and precluded the possibility of escape or rescue. At the trial, held at the
                  same spot, each planter present was a judge and juryman, and the prisoners were
                  allowed to defend themselves. Their defence amounted to little more than a plea of
                  not guilty, and they constantly demanded a regular trial before a constituted
                  court, affirming their ability to prove their innocence, if sufficient time were
                  allowed them. At the end of the week they were both hanged on one of the trees of
                  the haunted group. Before the stern sentence was executed the elder Denson made a
                  special appeal to Judge Carr and the State's attorney, as representatives of the
                  law. He might as well have appealed to a couple of tigers. The legend affirms that
                  Denson then predicted the violent death of these two gentlemen, upon the same
                  spot, within some definite period, and promised that both he and his son would
                  haunt the grove until this dire prophecy was fulfilled.
               One morning, within the year, the body of the prosecuting attorney was found at
                  the foot of the gallows tree, dead from a pistol shot in the head. His own pistol
                  was clutched in his hand, and the current belief, at least amongst the
                  superstitious negroes, was that he had shot himself. Jacobus represents this
                  gentlemanâ€”"Mars'r John"â€”as a man of extraordinary courage and prowess. I recollect
                  his exact expression at this part of the story. "Mars'r John," he said, "wor not
                  'feard of two hundred debbles and ghossesses all at once; and ef he had fair
                  chance in the daylight, he could make ghos' and debble bofe run." All that was
                  known about his death was, that he had left Carrville near midnight for his home.
                  His horse was found in the early morning near his house, and a fragment of his
                  bridle lying near his master's body, which was discovered in the bushes, by
                  tracking the footmarks of the animal back to the haunted laurels. At this portion
                  of the narrative Jacobus was visibly affected, and I fancied that I could detect a
                  strange mixture of grief and horror in his tones. He spoke of the deceased
                  gentleman with evident affection, and I thought he regarded his mysterious death
                  as a kind of swindle on the part of the "ghossesses." He said, for instance:
                  "Mars'r John didn't hab no fair shake wid dem. Dey was 'feard to fight him out in
                  de open road, what de moon was shinen; so dey tolled him inter dem bushes, and dar
                  dey busted his big heart, and made him kill hisself!" There was something about
                  the weird manner of the negro that made me feel very uncomfortable, in spite of my
                  consciousness that the whole story was susceptible of a matter of fact solution if
                  one could only get at the clue.
               So far as Mr. Carr is concerned, the prophecy has as yet found no fulfilment. The
                  narrator did not say much upon this branch of the subject. It seems that he
                  resigned his office shortly after the execution of the Densons. That he has seen
                  something uncanny at the haunted laurels Jake does not doubt, but he asserts most
                  positively that he avoids this road in his journeys to and from town, crossing the
                  stream at another ford, a mile higher up.
               He concluded his story just as we reached Mr. Maltby's, begging me to say nothing
                  to "ole Mars'r or Mars'r Charley" about the haunted laurels. "Ef you ebber git
                  chance, sar," he said, as he held the gate open for my entrance into Mr. Maltby's
                  grounds, "and ef you want to know more 'bout dis story, you might ax Miss Retâ€”kase
                  she jis like her fader, and not 'feard ob de debble hisself!"
               A dozen questions rushed to my tongue, but Mr. Maltby's appearance and cordial
                  salutation prevented the utterance of any of them. There! I am heartily glad that
                  I have gotten rid of that horrid legend for the present.
               I wonder what Mr. Maltby, and so many of his guests as were near me, thought of my trencher powers yesterday
                  morning? The ride had increased an appetite that was vigorous enough before, and
                  the coffee was the first Mocha that I had tasted since I left my dear Mother's
                  table. And to cap the climax, there was genuine wheat bread in abundance, which is
                  a rarity in this fair land. Mrs. Maltby said, as we rose from the table, "You have
                  found the way to Highlands, Mr. Hubbard, and I hope we shall see you very often
                  hereafter." To which Mr. Maltby added, "Yes, come out every day that you can get
                  off, Hubbard." These Louisiana people are very kind and hospitable.
               Carr handed me a gun and accoutrements as I remounted Midnight, and renewed his
                  cautions against the use of spurs. I expressed some surprise at the selection of
                  so fiery a beast for a lady's horse, especially as her trot was none of the
                  smoothest.
               "Why, that black rascal has put a curb bit in her mouth," said Carr; "here, Jake!
                  take off that bridle and martingale, and put mine on the mare. She travels better
                  with a snaffle, Hubbard, and you will find her gait pleasant enough. How came you
                  to put the curb on the filly, Jake?"
               "Golly! Mars'r Charley," answered the negro, with a grin, "how I gwine to know
                  that Mars'r Hubbard kin ride like de witches? She done flung Mars'r Herbert todder
                  day!"
               "Keep your eye on her, Hubbard," shouted Carr, as the mare glided ahead; "she is
                  safe enough till she feels the spur."
               I have gotten another object to be attained, namely the possession of that mare. I
                  do not know whether money will buy her, and I am not overburdened with that
                  particular article, if it would. But I mean to own that mare some of these days!
                  Her gait is indescribable. To me, who have been accustomed to trotting horses all
                  my life, it was altogether new. She appeared to "devour the distance" with a
                  motion so light and easy as scarcely to move me in the saddle. These Southerners,
                  who consult their case on all occasions, think more of a horse trained to "pace"
                  than of the fastest trotters; and Midnight has been so carefully instructed that I
                  must consider her matchless. But I am getting along very slowly with my story.
               Mr. Maltby stationed me in a glade of the forest, a mile or so from his house,
                  directing me to watch for the deer whenever I heard the cry of the hounds. "You
                  can either dismount," he said at parting, "and fasten your horse to a swinging
                  branch, or you can shoot from the saddle if you get a shot. The mare will stand
                  fire." So saying he plunged into the woods, winding his horn, and followed by all
                  the yelping hounds. The other gentlemen of the party galloped off, to take
                  "stands," as they call these openings in the woods, similar to mine, and in a few
                  minutes I had lost sight and sound of them all. And now I am at the beginning of
                  my adventure, at last. While I sit here in quiet, hearing no sound but the
                  scratching of my pen over the paper, I feel my heart beating more rapidly and my
                  body quivering with excitement as the memories of the few events I have to record
                  come thronging back upon me.
               After Mr. Maltby disappeared I fastened the mare to a sapling and started in
                  search of water. I had smoked a heavy cigar after breakfast, and my throat was dry
                  and parched. I soon found a tiny rill issuing from the bushes, and thinking the
                  draught would be cooler and purer if I could find its source, I threw my gun into
                  the hollow of my arm, and pushing aside the undergrowth, I splashed my way
                  through, walking in the bed of the rill. As I advanced, the passage grew more and
                  more difficult, and I should have given up the attempt, but for a lamentable
                  obstinacy of disposition, which always makes me persist more resolutely in an
                  undertaking when obstacles thicken around me. My dear, partial Mother speaks of
                  this trait as "one of my few failings." I went on, therefore, getting my gun
                  entangled in the overhanging vines, getting stung in thorny bushes, and growing
                  more thirsty, and more determined to find the spring, till I had probably got two
                  or three hundred yards from my horse. At last I emerged into an "open" of small
                  circumference, and saw the spring, the water bubbling over a bed of pure white
                  sand, and looking deliciously cool and tempting. I kneeled down, and plunging my
                  face in the water, I took the sweetest drink I ever had in my life. As I raised my
                  head and glanced around I discovered that I was not alone. On the other side of
                  the spring, half hidden by the tree against which he was leaning, sat a man
                  clothed in buckskins. His back was towards me, and I could only see his left arm
                  and leg, and the muzzle of an old looking rifle lying across his thigh. He sat
                  perfectly motionless, as I watched him for some minutes and as he must have heard
                  my approach, I wondered why he did not look round the tree to see who I was. I had
                  half a mind to slip quietly back by the way I had come, and, rising to my feet,
                  with this half-formed purpose, and drawing a step back, I got a partial view of
                  his head, and recognized the straight black hair and copper colored skin, of an Indian. I have so
                  long wished to see a real live Indian in something like his "native state," that
                  curiosity overcame every other feeling and I stepped round the tree and accosted
                  him.
               "Good morning," said I, nodding to him as cordially as I could. He raised his head
                  when I spoke and I discovered that he was tolerably drunk. He had a junk bottle in
                  his hand which he held out, offering me a drink.
               "Um!" he grunted, "white brudder come to see ole Injin! White brudder welcome!
                  take drink!"
               "I have just had a drink," I answered, declining the bottle and pointing to the
                  springâ€”"it is better than that in your bottle."
               "Spring good, whisky better! white brudder want moccasin? Come in wigwam." He rose
                  as he spoke, and thrusting the bottle in the bosom of his hunting shirt, he moved
                  away from the tree, dragging his rifle after him.
               "I don't want any moccasinsâ€”that is, not to-day; I must go back to the stand now."
                  I began to feel a little uneasy, and to remember a hundred stories I have read and
                  heard about scalps, roasting before a slow fire, and similar nonsense. The grisly
                  rascal was six feet tall, erect and vigorous, and looked as though he could make
                  mince meat of me in a twinkling. Drunk as he was, he walked without staggering. He
                  faced me again and beckoned to me to follow him.
               "Nebber mind stand," he said, "no deer to-day. Brudder have some Injin's venison?
                  Injin dry him himself; come!"
               "No, I thank you, not this time; good bye!"
               "No whisky, no moccasin, no venison!" said he, angrily striking the ground with
                  the butt of his gunâ€”"what for young brudder afeard?"
               I began to be angry myself now, as well as scaredâ€”angry perhaps because seared. I
                  tried to look as fierce as I wished to feel.
               "I am not afraid of anything," I answered; I never drink whisky. If you will bring
                  me a pair of moccasins to town to-morrow I will buy them, and as for the
                  venisonâ€”well, I will taste your venison. How far off is your
                  wigwam?"
               "Here," he replied, once more stalking away from the spring. I followed him to the
                  edge of the opposite thicket until he arrived at the trunk of a tree that had been
                  prostrated by some hurricane, as was evident from the huge mass of roots that
                  stood perpendicularly eight or ten feet above the surface of the ground. A
                  quantity tity of suckers and vines with long trailing branches and tendrils,
                  sprang from among the upturned roots, and, hanging over the cavity they had once
                  occupied, formed a beautiful bower, which shaded and concealed the rude hut
                  beneath them. The fallen tree had stood on a slight eminence or hillock, and the
                  hollow which its roots had scooped out was still a little higher than the
                  surrounding surface. The hut was formed of long strips of bark, leaning against
                  the base of the tree, and appeared to be watertight; the edges of the bark neatly
                  sewn together and covered in places with pieces of deer hide. I did not enter, but
                  as the Indian pushed aside the rude door I saw two or three pairs of moccasins
                  hanging on pegs, and a bundle of skins lying in a corner. At that instant my
                  attention was attracted by the cry of the hounds, and I was about to hasten back
                  to my stand, when the Indian reappeared, with a piece of smoked deermeat in his
                  hand.
               "Nebber mind stand," he said; "dog no find deer, 'spose him find fox!" He listened
                  intently for a moment and added, "him come dis way."
               I walked hastily along the trunk of the prostrate tree, until I found a place low
                  enough for me to clamber up, and cocking both barrels of my gun, I looked
                  anxiously for the appearance of the deer or fox, whichever it might prove. The
                  Indian followed me, still dragging his rifle after him. I pointed in the direction
                  of the sounds, for the furious baying of the hounds could now be heard distinctly,
                  and they seemed to be approaching very rapidly.
               "Plenty time," said my companion, waving his hand, "fox run dis way, dat way. Dog
                  lose him bimeby. S'pose he climb tree; plenty time."
               He propped his gun up against the tree, and, drawing a long knife from his belt,
                  proceeded to cut a strip of venison. Suddenly there was a crash in the bushes
                  beyond the hut, and I saw the body of an animal glancing through them. The Indian
                  dropped the meat, stuck his knife into the tree, caught up his rifle and fired. I
                  heard a fierce growl, another crash, and again saw the beast bounding over a bunch
                  of tangled vines. He was not over twenty yards distant, and I discharged one
                  barrel at him just as he leaped into sight. Another growl, another mighty bound,
                  and there he was before me, and I saw the long, striped body, and thick tail,
                  gliding through the grass, as he approached me. I took good aim, and gave him the
                  contents of the second barrel as the houndsâ€”a dozen of themâ€”came tearing through
                  the bushes. They were upon him in a
                  moment, and such a babel of growls, barks and howls, I never heard before, and
                  hope never to hear again. I was watching the fight as I reloaded my gun. The
                  Indian was forcing a bullet into the muzzle of his rifle, and I heard him mutter:
                  "Whisky too much! hand shake; no shoot;" when I saw Music, a favorite slut of
                  Carr's, dash at the panther, and retreat on the instant, bleeding and howling
                  dismally. Without a thought, I snatched the Indian's knife from the tree, jumped
                  down and plunged into the melÃ©e. I hardly know how it was done, but I pushed in
                  among the dogs, several of them badly torn, and drove the knife into the beast's
                  side up to the hilt. He must have been already nearly dead, as we afterwards found
                  that both of my shots had taken effectâ€”the first in his flank and the other in his
                  shoulder. The thrust finished him, however, and, after a convulsive jerk or two,
                  he rolled over, dead. Just then I heard the clatter of horses' hoofs, and Mr.
                  Maltby and a stranger galloped into the open.
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               CAPTAIN DELANEY.
               THE strange gentleman was a man to be looked at. He seemed to be about
                  thirty-five, though I do not know if this estimate of his age is within ten years
                  of the truth. He had that indescribable tout
                     ensemble that belongs to very mature young men. His eyes were black
                  and piercing, his hair black, and his sallow face, closely shaven, showed the
                  black roots of his thick beard, around his chin and over his lip. He was dressed
                  with great nicety, in the everlasting blue cottonade unmentionables, and a brown
                  linen frock coat. His shirt bosom was particularly white and smooth, and one got
                  the idea, from a glance at the man, that he would not rumple or soil it if he wore
                  it a month. He wore a black silk cravat and no collar, a broad brimmed Panama hat
                  and kid gloves. Altogether, he was too nice looking for the woods. As he drew up
                  his horse he looked steadily at me, and I touched my hat. He returned my
                  salutation by removing his own, and bowing gracefully, and I observed that his
                  hair, which was crisp and wavyâ€”I feel inclined to write it "kinky"â€”was arranged with care, parted as if it had been done with a rule and
                  pair of compasses. I thoroughly and excessively disliked him at the first
                  glance.
               "Why, what in the world are you doing here, Hubbard?" asked Mr. Maltby, looking
                  with great round eyes at me and the bloody knife in my hand.
               "I believe I have been killing a panther, sir," I replied, with as much modesty as
                  I could muster.
               "The deuce you have! where is he?" and he threw his long leg over the saddlebow
                  and slid down from his horse. "Here he is, by jingo! shot in two places, and stuck
                  to boot! It was your gun, then, that I heard? and here is a rifle shot, right over
                  his car. Somebody had a pop at him before you; I heard the rifle, but this only
                  riled him. Was he coming at you? Where did you get that knife? Do you usually
                  carry a toothpick of that size?"
               "It is the Indian's knife, sir," said I, answering one question out of the
                  volley.
               "What Indian?" said the stranger, speaking for the first time. I looked round to
                  the dead tree, where I had left my hospitable friend, but he was no longer there;
                  I stepped to the hut, pushed the door open and looked inâ€”but my "Injun brudder"
                  had disappeared.
               "He is gone," said I, returning from my fruitless search; "he was at my side a
                  minute ago, just as you came. I cannot imagine what has become of him; he was
                  watching me when I stuck the panther; I saw his head over the tree trunk
                  yonder."
               "What was he like?" said the stranger abruptly, speaking in a sharp, peremptory
                  tone that was rather offensive. I thought he was not treating me with the
                  consideration due to a man of my age, who had just killed a panther. I was in no
                  hurry to answer, therefore, and putting the caps on my gun, I walked towards Mr.
                  Maltby. I am nearly six feet tall, if I am young, and it is not
                  agreeable to be spoken to as if I were a boy. He repeated his question, rather
                  more civilly, and I answered without looking round:
               "Like other Indians, I suppose. Mr. Maltby, what am I to do next?"
               "Get your horse, and we will call in the standers; no deer today, at least not in
                  this drive. I think we had better go home, as the dogs are pretty well used up,
                  anyhow." He mounted his horse, and blowing his horn, the hounds gathered around
                     him, poor Music limping painfully
                  along and whining piteously. "Carr's bitch is badly hurt, I'm afraid; did the
                  beast get her down?"
               "No, sir; she darted into the fight and out again like lightning, hurt as you see.
                  It was then that I seized the knife and stabbed the panther." Seeing that he
                  listened with great interest, I went on, telling him the story pretty much as I
                  have recorded it here. When I had finished, he said,
               "It was a plucky thing to do, youngster, but I advise you the next time to keep
                  your distance. If that fellow had got a lick at you with his paw you would not
                  have been standing here! The Indian must have been old Misty; he lives hereabouts.
                  Where the dickens has he gone, I wonder? drunk as usual! Well, get your horse and
                  come on; we'll ride slowly, and get the dogs home."
               I started through the bushes, but returning to stick the knife back in the tree, I
                  heard Maltby say: "His name is Hubbardâ€”a friend of Carr'sâ€”he's genuine wildcat
                  though, ain't he?" I could not hear his companion's reply, but I heard Maltby say:
                  "Lying! no, no! I'll be sworn the boy told the truth." Confound that spruce
                  blackguard! maybe I'll have a chance to pay him off some of these days.
               I lost myself, and lost much time in getting back to the mare, and had to betake
                  myself to the rivulet at last, and very nearly retrace my steps. At last I found
                  the stand. The mare was restless, and I had considerable difficulty in mounting,
                  encumbered as I was with the gun. I had fastened her by unbuckling the bridle
                  rein, and rebuckling it round the limb of a sapling. I at last got into the
                  saddle, and was trying to buckle the rein, when she stretched out her neck and
                  twitched the bridle out of my fingers. She was off like a shotâ€”right into the
                  woods!
               Under ordinary circumstances I could easily have regained the rein by leaning
                  forward in the saddle, but, as it was, I was kept busy dodging the overhanging
                  branches and managing my heavy gun. Once the muzzle caught in a trailing vine, and
                  as the gun swung round I got a sound knock on the side of my head. I have the mark
                  yet. This accident confused me somewhat, and a few minutes later the catastrophe
                  happened. I had presence of mind enough to shake my feet clear of the stirrups
                  when the mare first bolted, and thereafter I was doing regular riding school
                  practiceâ€”holding on with my knees. And while the sparks were still flying from my
                  eyes I saw a tree galloping up to me, and leaning to the right to avoid it, I
                  accidentally touched Midnight with the spar. She swerved suddenly to the left, the
                  tree struck me full in the breast, and that is all I know about it.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               MISTEONO.
               WHEN I recovered my senses I found myself alone in that wilderness, and felt as I
                  suppose one feels when recovering from a mighty "drunk." My watch crystal was
                  smashed, and my timekeeper had stopped. I picked up my gun and discharged both
                  barrels, hoping that some of my fellow hunters might hear the report and come to
                  my assistance. But the forest was perfectly quiet, though a moment before my fall
                  I had heard Mr. maltby's horn and the yelping of the dogs that followed him. The
                  situation was decidedly unpleasant. There I was, as completely lost as though I
                  had dropped down there from the clouds. I reloaded my gun, expecting to be
                  attacked by three or four panthers at once, though Carr has since told me that
                  they are very rare birds in this latitude. I walked about, gradually growing more
                  accustomed to the peculiar position of affairs, and gradually perceiving how
                  serious the accident really was. The most important fact was that I was lost. I
                  could not even identify the free that had brushed me so nicely from the saddle. I
                  only knew that it was a beech, for I remembered the white spots on the bark. And I
                  counted five or six beeches, all near enough to me, and each looking exactly like
                  all the rest. When I first staggered up I moved about, dizzy and confused, and I
                  don't know how far I had walked from the spot I had occupied between my fall and
                  awakening before I thought of finding my way out of the woods. And then, even if I
                  knew the way, the walk was tolerably long, as I was hurt, and wanted sleep more
                  than anything else. I tried to whistle, but failed; I tried to hum a tune, but
                  broke down with something like a sob. I concluded that the adventure was perhaps a
                  little romantic, but also decidedly disgusting.
               At length I sat down at the root of one of the beeches and endeavoured to collect my energies. I wondered what
                  Miss Ret was like, and what she would think of the loss of her mare; and then I
                  wondered if I should ever see either mare or mistress. I wondered what Carr would
                  think of my manhood. I wondered whether Miss Ret was an old maid of forty or a
                  young damsel of fourteen. She could not be very young, or she could not manage
                  that she-devil of a mare; probably twenty-five. If so, she would think that boys
                  ought not to be trusted with valuable horses. Then I wondered why Carr had not
                  talked to me about her. Was she his cousin or aunt? He called her "Ret," so she
                  could not be his aunt. What did "Ret" stand for? It was very queer if it was her
                  real name. And she had a brother, named Herbert; man enough to own a gun and to
                  ride Midnight. Thank fortune Midnight had thrown him before I ever
                  saw her. I wondered what Mother would think if she knew how I was amusing myself
                  at that particular moment. And then I remembered her ideas of the Sabbath, and how
                  I had violated my own convictions when I started on the hunt. And then I vowed,
                  from the very depths of my heart, that I would never misspend the day again. Then
                  I began to wonder whether I should live to see any more bright Sabbaths dawn upon
                  the beautiful earth. I suppose my breast, which is bruised and still sore, hurt
                  me, for I groaned.
               "Young chief lose hoss? nebber mind, Injin find him."
               I started to my feet, and, turning around, saw my Indian acquaintance standing
                  near me. He was leaning on his gun, and did not look quite so drunk as he was at
                  our last meeting. I noticed the long knife in his belt, so he had been back to his
                  hut since I left it. I did not think about scalps this time, but cordially shook
                  the hand he held out to me. No doubt I looked pale, for I felt very shaky, and
                  when he pulled out the bottle from the breast of his shirt I did not refuse it. I
                  took a mouthful of the whisky, which was horridly nasty, but it seemed to revive
                  me. He nodded when I gave him back the bottle, and put it back in his bosom, and
                  then motioning for me to follow him, he struck off into the woods. He reminded me
                  of a cat creeping along with his noiseless step, and I no longer wondered how he
                  had managed to approach me unheard. Beneath my feet the dry twigs cracked and the
                  dead leaves rustled, while the Indian, a step in advance, moved as silently as a
                  ghost. We skirted a canebrake of some extent, pressed through a dense growth of
                  greenbriar bushes, and at length emerged into the open, a few yards from the
                  Indian's dian's hut. The first sight that gladdened my eyes was Midnight, quietly
                  cropping the grass near the spring. She was secured by a thong, attached to a wild
                  grapevine, which was elastic enough to allow her tolerably wide grazing ground. As
                  she raised her head at our approach I noticed that the vine drew up and kept the
                  thong and bridle clear of her legs. This is, therefore, another lesson in
                  woodcraft that I have learned.
               I walked round the tree, and was about to kneel down for a drink at the spring,
                  when Misty handed me a gourd, which he took from a fork in the tree. If any one
                  who may ever happen to see this record, wants to know what nectar tastes like, I
                  advise him or her to get thrown from a horse at about noon on a May day in this
                  latitude (which is about equal to a July day anywhere else), and to lie stunned on
                  the ground for an hour or so, and then to take a mouthful of awful whisky, and
                  stumble through wild vines and thickets for a mile or two, till he or she is just
                  ready to die of fatigue and thirst, and then to get a gourdful (say half a gallon)
                  of pure, cold spring water, and drink it in the shade.
               After I had satisfied my thirst, and washed down the scalding taste of the raw
                  whisky, I handed the gourd back to the Indian, who replaced it in the tree, and
                  resumed his position, leaning against the trunk. We took a good look at each
                  other. There was not much trace of intoxication left in his countenance now, and
                  he looked more respectable than at our first interview. His long black hair, which
                  was the only head gear he wore, hung straight down over his face and neck. His
                  little, sharp, black eyes were roving over my person, resting upon my face
                  occasionally, with as friendly an expression as such a countenance could assume.
                  There seemed to be a mixture of perplexity and intelligence in these furtive
                  glances into my eyes, as if he were trying to recall my features to his memory,
                  and were baffled each time. He was grave and dignified, apparently waiting for me
                  to address him.
               "Is your name Misty?" I asked. He looked all round the open, then nodding his
                  head, he said,
               "Yes. Injin have 'nudder name when he was warrior. Young chief name Hubbard?"
               "Why, where did you learn my name, Misty?" I answered with surprise, "and why do
                  you call me young chief?"
               "Injin see young brudder kill tiger cat. Young brudder brave, he be warrior
                  bimeby. Injin was chief when he live in the Seminole nole country. Then he have good name. Misteono was
                  warrior before he drink whisky. Now he drunken Misty."
               "Who calls you drunken Misty?" I asked.
               "You hear him. Injin hear him when he hid under the tree yonder. When Cap'n come,
                  Misty hideâ€”no want Cap'n see him."
               "Do you mean the man who was with Mr. Maltby?" I inquired.
               "Yes, Cap'n Delaney. Misteono knew him in Evergladesâ€”Misty know him here."
               "What cause have you to fear him, Misteono?" said I, giving the Indian his ancient
                  name. A fierce scowl passed over his face as he answered,
               "Misteono not feared! time not come yet. See!" he added suddenly, pointing his
                  finger at a snake that appeared for an instant and then wriggled into the bushes;
                  "Rattlesnake no make noise till he ready to strike."
               I unfastened my horse and mounted with considerable agility as I heard the name of
                  the dreaded reptile. They are uncomfortably numerous in this locality, and I have
                  heard enough stories about them from the Carrville people to make me prefer my
                  seat in the saddle to the grassy bank upon which I had been standing. Misteono
                  evidently noticed my trepidation and understood its cause.
               "Rattlesnake not get bad for two, tree moons yet," he said, "and he always rattle
                  'fore he bite."
               "How did you catch the horse, Misteono?" said I, not wishing to pursue the snake
                  subject any further. It is not worth while to deny that I am horridly afraid of
                  all varieties of the serpent tribe; and I believe that this dread and aversion is
                  the instinctive feeling of all men.
               "Him come to the spring to drink. Bimeby he lay down to roll and Misteono catch
                  him before he get up. Know young chief's horse, so take his trail and go back for
                  young chief. How fa' off? Squaw ride himâ€”" Without waiting for an answer he darted
                  to the bushes just as I heard the faint sound of a horn. I rode in the direction
                  of the sound and soon saw my friend Carr, followed by Jacobus. I shouted as soon
                  as they came into sight, and Carr galloped up to me, exclaiming "Here he is, by
                  Jove!"
               There is not much more to tell. It seems that the whole hunting party returned to
                  Mr. Maltby's, and after waiting an hour for my arrival, Carr concluded that I was
                  lost. Learning from Mr. Maltby that he had left me near the Indian's wigwam he had
                  started with Jacobus to look for me.
               "I have been delayed somewhat," he said, "as I came round by Manahio, supposing
                  that you would leave the mare to find the way for you, and I was sure she would go
                  straight home. I was a good deal disappointed, and, indeed, uneasy when I found
                  you had not been there. But when I reached your stand and discovered that you had
                  ridden off eastwardly I made up my mind to hunt for you in the wilderness of the
                  Amite."
               "I did not have a choice of routes," I answered. "Midnight took matters into her
                  own charge as soon as I mounted and soon unseated me. But tell me, Carr, how shall
                  I reward Misty, who has been a true friend in need."
               "Oh, give him a gallon of whisky and he will be grateful while it lasts. What a
                  pity it is that the rascal is such a drunkard! He is one of the best hunters I
                  know. And you ought to see him spiking the fish in the creek by torch-light. You
                     shall see him, by Jupiter! We will change our fishing excursion to
                  the pools of the creek to a regular gigging party, and Misty shall be master of
                  ceremonies. What do you say?"
               "Agreed," I replied; "but where are you going now?"
               "To Manahio, of course," answered Carr, "where you will get some dinner and spend
                  the rest of the day in any way that may suit your fancy."
               "Not to-day, Carr, if you please. Let me go home, take a bath and dress my wounds
                  and bruises. I shall be very happy to visit Manahio some other time."
               "Well, to-morrow evening then, or"â€”seeing that I hesitatedâ€”"say Tuesday. Give me
                  your gun and ammunition and Jake will go with you as far as the ford. Keep the
                  mare till Tuesday and I will come into town after dinner and ride out with you.
                  Good bye."
               I got home safely, took a famous nap after my bath, ate a good supper, and then
                  sat up half the night journalizing. And here have I been doing the same thing
                  to-night, but I'm off to bed.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XII.
               THE DOCTOR.
               
                  TUESDAY, May 11, 1836.
               
               THE postmaster of Carrville, Mr. White, has located his office in a little
                  building adjoining our store. I have allowed him to open a door into the store
                  room, so that I have an oversight of the post-office while I am in our own
                  building. We have a mail twice a week, and I have been sworn in as deputy
                  postmaster, and I find that I shall have all the work to do, which don't amount to
                  a great deal. It takes about fifteen minutes to open and assort the mail, and
                  about as much time to make up the mail that leaves Carrvilleâ€”so that I have
                  undertaken to do fifty hours work in the year for fifty dollars per annum. In
                  to-day's mail there were two letters for me. One from home; all well and happy
                  except for my absence; the other from Mr. Bayard, who is still in New Orleans. He
                  says there is some reason to fear that the Seagull is lost, with all our goods on
                  board, and asks me for a list of invoices, and a memorandum of the insurance. I
                  have answered both letters, and have placed the insurance policies in the iron
                  safe at the hotel. I find that the total amount of purchases is twelve thousand
                  dollars, and that the insurance is for that amount and ten per centum advance,
                  which is according to custom. So, if the Seagull is lost, Mr. Bayard will make
                  twelve hundred dollars, and the difference of interest between the settlement of
                  the claims upon the underwriters and the maturity of his bills in October next. He
                  concluded his letter in these words: "If the ship is ascertained to be lost,
                     one of us will have to go North to collect the insurance and
                  replace the goods." I did not reply to this portion of his letter, because I did
                  not know whether he meant to include me in the "one of us," or whether he referred
                  to a silent partner, to whom I have heard him allude once or twice. It would be
                  too good news if he meant that I might have an opportunity to visit my dear home
                  so soon.
               There are two gentlemen in this place of whom I have been intending to say
                  something ever since I began this diary, and I may as well take the present
                  opportunity to put down my impressions concerning them. Of course, I know very
                  little about them, but they have both been very friendly in their intercourse with
                  me, and I like them particularly. The first is Mr. Robert White, our postmaster.
                  He is a quiet, gentlemanly fellow, about thirty years old; rather good looking and
                  moderately lazy, or, perhaps, I ought to say, indolent. I met him on the night of
                  my arrival, and was pleased with him from the first. Carr tells me that he owns no
                  plantation in this neighbourhood, though his wife has one somewhere in what they
                  call the "TÃ©che Country." I suppose this means the lands lying on or near the
                  Bayou TÃ©che. He lives in a pretty little house on the outskirts of Carrville, and
                  I spent a pleasant hour there one afternoon last week. I called him lazy just now,
                  but when I remember the beautiful garden around his house, which he has adorned
                  with his own hands, and which he is all the time improving, I am forced to recall
                  the slander. Still he seems to be lazy about everything else. He won't do anything
                  about the post-office that he can escape. When he proposed to open the door of
                  communication between the office and our store room, he said:
               "I don't intend to work much among the mails. I did not ask for the appointment;
                  and I should like you to undertake the principal part of the duties at whatever
                  price you think reasonable. You can do all the mail work in an hour each week. The
                  revenue it yields me is very trifling, but it will be advantageous to you to have
                  it located near your store. What do you think would compensate you?"
               "Fifty dollars per annum," I answered.
               "Agreed!" said Mr. White, and that was the bargain.
               The thing that made the strongest impression upon me the other evening when I
                  called at his house, was the profound affection he and his wife entertain for each
                  other. There was no violent demonstration, but it was constantly apparent. The
                  mere inflexions of their voices, as they called each other's namesâ€”"Robert" or
                  "Mary," attracted my attention all the time. I do not believe that I can describe
                  them, or even express what I think about them, but I only know that I have never
                  seen a man and his wife so cordially devoted to each other as Mr. and Mrs. White
                  seem to be. They have no children. I shall probably have more to say about them
                  hereafter. Perhaps the best indication I can offer of the impression their unity
                  of sentiment made upon me, is the fact that I never think of them separately.
               The other gentleman is Doctor Markham, the only physician in this neighbourhood.
                  And now that I have written his name, I am at a loss to begin a description of him. He is probably a year or two younger
                  than Mr. White, and is undoubtedly a right down good fellow. His office is
                  opposite the store and I see him frequently during the day, sometimes mounting his
                  horse to start out on his round of visits, and looking as if he had not fully made
                  up his mind whether to start or not, or which foot he would put into the stirrup.
                  Sometimes, when he comes home, his horse stops at his door and he sits a while in
                  the saddle, as if debating in his own mind whether or not he had better dismount,
                  or call his little nigger "Sam" to help him down. He is the slowest man I ever
                  met, and yet he is a man of excellent sense and sound judgment. His practice is
                  large, and probably would be profitable, if he were not too lazy to attend to
                  collections. This morning, as he was riding away, he called out to me across the
                  street:
               "Hubbard! I wish those drugs of yours would come, I am almost out of calomel!"
               "I can get some for you, doctor," I answered.
               "Where? How?"
               "From Baton Rouge. I can send by Captain Joli, and have it here in a day or
                  two."
               "So you can!" he exclaimed, after meditating a few minutes. "I wish you would send
                  for half a pound." And then he paused again, and added, "Hey! No! Say a quarter of
                  a pound. Maybe it is not good!" Another pause, and thenâ€”"No, you had better get a
                  pound! When yours comes I can use this for external applications. Get up!" And
                  away he went.
               He came back about noon. I have had toothache for a day or two, and to-day it was
                  dreadful. So when the doctor returned, I walked over to his office and followed
                  him into it. He shook hands with me and handed me a chair with great politeness.
                  Then he took off his hat and coat, and bawled out for "Sam." When the young
                  African appeared, the doctor told him to "get some water in the other room." The
                  boy moved with great activity to obey his commands, and presently I heard the
                  doctor splashing in the water in the next room. He came to the door in a short
                  time, rubbing his face with a towel, and wiping his hands as though he never
                  intended to consider them dry. At last he looked at me attentively and said:
               "What ails you, Hubbard? Your face is a yard long!"
               "I've got the toothache, doctor."
               "Hey! Where is it?"
               "In my mouth, sir," I replied with a sickly attempt at a smile.
               "The deuce it is!"
               He pulled open a little drawer and took out two or three horrid looking
                  implements. The pain suddenly subsided, and I began to think what an ass I was to
                  come over there at all. But I was ashamed to back out now, so I allowed him to
                  examine my grinders.
               "Does it ache much?" asked the doctor, after he had found the ailing tooth, and
                  poked about it in a very unpleasant manner.
               "No, sir; it don't ache at all now." He laughed, and I plucked up courage to ask:
                  "Do you think it ought to come out, doctor?"
               "Yes; it will probably ache until you get rid of it; but if you don't want it out,
                  I'll put some kreosote in the cavity; maybe it will get easier."
               "Will it hurt me much to draw it?"
               "Yes; it will hurt like blazes," he replied, with charming candor. "The gum is
                  inflamed and sore; but it will soon be over, and I think you will survive the
                  operation." And here he laughed again.
               "Work your fiendish will upon me!" I exclaimed, in a rage. He put his arm around
                  my head, and passed a lancet around the gum. Then he seized the tooth in the
                  forceps, the heavens and the earth came together with a crash, and the doctor
                  stood over me, flourishing the extracted molar in triumph above my head. Slow as
                  he is about most things, he was fast enough this time.
               "There!" he said, kindly, "you bore that like a stoic. I expected you to howl a
                  little. It hurt, didn't it? Here! take a sip of brandy. I don't often recommend
                  brandy, either. Will you have another tooth drawn?"
               "No, I thank you, doctor. I am sorry to deny you the gratification, too; but the
                  next time I submit to such an operation it will be after I have endured the pain
                  three hundred and sixty-five days."
               "It won't be a wisdom tooth, then," quoth the doctor. "Here, I'll lend you a
                  book;" and he took a volume from a shelf. "It is old Burton's Anatomy."
               "I am much obliged to you, doctor," I answered, "but I have the book, and have
                  already read it through."
               "The deuce you have! Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy! read it through! What d'ye
                  mean? Have you laid it aside as a work accomplished?"
               
               "No, indeed; I read a little every time I get a chance. One does not
                     finish Burton with one reading."
               "How old are you?" said the doctor.
               "Not quite twenty-one;" replied I. And then I thought it was a small business to
                  pretend to be older than I was, so I added: "the truth is, doctor, I am not quite
                  twenty. I am about nineteen and a half."
               "Well, you will be older in a few years, if you live; besides, there is not much
                  difference between nineteen and twenty-one. A man don't have any sense until he is
                  thirty-five or forty, anyhow."
               "I did not think you were so old, doctor," I rejoined with a bow.
               "Who? I? Oh, I don't profess to be very wise; and there are exceptions to all
                  general rules. Are you going? Well, I'll call over to-night and have a talk with
                  you."
               "I am going to Mr. Carr's to-night, but any other timeâ€”"
               "Why, so am I! I have to see that boy again to-day. Well, then, I'll meet you
                  there, if I am not able to ride out with you. Good bye!"
               I have written all this about Doctor Markham, because he can thus describe himself
                  better than I can describe him. Mr. White says his patients are all very much
                  attached to him, and that he could "take his choice" among the young ladies of the
                  neighbourhood, if he were inclined to marry. When I know him better I intend to
                  find out why it is that he keeps single; but I hear Carr's voice, and now I must
                  get ready for our ride. I suppose I shall have to wear a black coat, hot as it is.
                  We won't have the doctor's company, as I saw him ride off an hour ago.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               RET.
               
                  WEDNESDAY, May 12, 1836.
               
               I FEEL so bewildered, and (I don't know why) also so dispirited to-night, that I
                  am half inclined to put my diary away again and go to bed. There is some
                  unfathomable mystery enveloping me, and the matters I have to record are so
                  strange to my mind that I kept awake all last night, thinking and wondering. I
                  believe I have made up my mind to consult Mr. White, and to be guided by his
                  advice. He is a good man, and I can trust him with the whole story. Since I came
                  in from Manahio, this morning, I have had very little to do, and I have spent the
                  day in thinking over the events of last night. The workmen have gone at lastâ€”the
                  store being finished; and I have been alone here all day, as Mr. White went to
                  Baton Rouge early this morning. I cannot go to sleep, if I go to bed, so I will
                  write until I feel drowsy, anyhow.
               After Carr and I crossed the creek yesterday afternoon we turned into a broad,
                  carriage road, which followed the course of the stream for more than a mile. We
                  arrived at the grounds around the house, which is not far from the Manahio, at
                  sunset. Like all residences in this State, the house is surrounded with a broad
                  veranda, and for eight or nine months in the year the spacious "galleries," as
                  they term them, are the living rooms of the family. As we rode up the gravelled
                  road, approaching the house, I saw several persons on this open porch, and my
                  heart beat with mingled curiosity and bashfulness as I perceived that a young lady
                  was one of the party. She was dressedâ€”pshaw! what do I know about her dress! I
                  only noticed that it was black, and looked blacker in contrast with her fair neck
                  and arms. I suppose I ought to call these "alabaster." She has brown hair, brown
                  eyes, generally sad looking, though sometimes bright and sparkling. I don't know
                  whether she is handsome or not. Probably she is, or would be, if she did not dress
                  in black. She is eighteen. I heard Mr. Carr say that she was two years older than
                  her brother, and he told me that he was sixteen. But I am anticipating.
               Jacobus took our horses, and as we ascended the steps Mr. Carr came forward to
                  meet us. He shook hands with me, inquired if I felt any ill effects from my late
                  accident, and then presented me to the young lady, who stood near him.
               "Mr. Hubbard, my dear; Miss HARWOOD, sir!" I bowed and stammered something, as the
                  lady returned my salutation, and Mr. Carr, who had me by the arm, led me to a
                  youth seated in an arm chair, and finished the ceremony, and nearly finished
                     me, by adding: "Mr. HERBERT HARWOOD, sir! The boy had his right
                  arm in a sling, and he put out his left hand to me, saying: "Midnight gave me a
                  tumble, too, Mr. Hubbard. Please excuse my left hand!" He is a bright looking
                  fellow, and decidedly good looking, too.
                  I don't know what I should have said or done in my confusion, if Dr. Markham had
                  not come up, and shaking my hand, inquired: "How is the toothache now,
                  Burton?"
               What under the shining sun does it mean? My name is not a very common name, and
                  here I find a boy bearing it, while I have lost it. There certainly
                     must be some wonderful mystery about the business. How has it
                  chanced that I have never heard the name of this brother and sister before? I
                  remember, when the negro told me the story of the haunted laurels, he spoke of
                  their dead father constantly as "Mars'r John." While I lay awake last night,
                  thinking confusedly of that ghost story and of these young children and their
                  sorrows, of the melancholy expression of the girl's face, and the horrid burden
                  she constantly bears, in the knowledge of her father's death, perhaps by his own
                  hand; and then her brother's name, Herbertâ€”a name given to me in memory of my
                  father's uncle, and so uncommon that I have never known a single individual who
                  bore itâ€”while I thought of all these matters, I vow that I almost fancied the room
                  was haunted. I was foolish enough, at last, to get out of bed, dress myself,
                  excepting my boots, and sit at the window, smoking cigars, and listening to the
                  murmur of the Manahio, which I could hear distinctly in the stillness of the
                  night. But I am not telling my story very coherently.
               At the tea table I sat next to Miss Ret, which is the universal name of Miss
                  Harwood, and had some slight opportunity to look at her and converse with her. She
                  looks actually beautiful when she smiles, which she does very rarely, however.
                  Doctor Markham asked her brother if he felt disposed to ride Midnight again, and
                  if "he would like to have his other shoulder put into place?"
               "I am ready to take another ride whenever Ret will lend me her mare," replied
                  Herbert; "but I am not the only one she has thrown;" and here he glanced slyly at
                  me.
               "I was not exactly thrown," replied I, "the mare brushed me off by
                  running on the wrong side of the tree. Besides, I had no bridle. You
                  must be tolerably courageous, Miss Harwood, to undertake the management of
                  Midnight."
               "Oh, she never misbehaves with me," she rejoined, with a smile; "perhaps she is
                  like most of her sex, restive under masculine restraint."
               "I am always uneasy, however, Miss Henrietta," said Mr. Carr, "when you mount that
                  animal, and I have nearly concluded to forbid your use of her for a year or so.
                  She will, perhaps, be more discreet when she is more matured."
               "Now, father," said Charley, "you must not lay an embargo on Ret's rides. Herbert
                  was thrown because he would spur Midnight, and Mr. Hubbardâ€”by Jove!
                     he had spurs on Sunday, too! I had forgotten all about them! Look
                  at him; he is actually blushing; make a clean breast of it, my friend! She threw
                  you because you spurred her. Hey?"
               "No! Yes! that isâ€”" and everybody, Miss Ret included, began to laugh. I told the
                  story of the accident as soon as they got quiet enough to listen, but I am
                  perfectly satisfied that they all blame the spur. Anyhow, they laughed again when
                  I had finished. It is just possible that the accidental touch of my "armed heel"
                  hastened matters somewhat.
               "How old is your mare, Miss Harwood?" I asked.
               "Four years on the first of July next," she replied. I was about to say something
                  concerning her accuracy in dates, when I observed the smile fade away from her
                  face, which became deadly pale. I thought everybody looked rather grave, and
                  wondered what impropriety there could be in the question and answer. There was a
                  few minutes' silence after her reply, which seemed to be embarrassing, and it was
                  at last broken by the young lady herself remarking that both her brother and I had
                  met with our disasters on the Sabbath.
               "Do you really believe, Ret," said Charley Carr, "that the day had anything to do
                  with the occurrences? Because Midnight must then be more religiously inclined than
                  any of us. Besides, you are in some sort responsible yourself, as the mare is your
                  property."
               "You know very well, Charley," retorted Ret, "that the animal was used on both
                  occasions without my knowledge or consent, and you also know that I should have
                  objected, if my opinion or will had been consulted." This was said with a quiet
                  dignity, and she looked beautiful once more, though she did not
                  smile.
               "I am obliged to confess," said I, interrupting Carr's rejoinderâ€”"that my first
                  thought, when I recovered from the effects of the fall, was, that I deserved my
                  fate for violating the Sabbath. Moreover, my firmest resolution at the same time
                  was to avoid all similar abuses of the day hereafter." They were all looking at me
                  when I said this, Miss Ret very kindly, Mr. Carr very curiously, and Charley and the doctor very
                  incredulously. I went on bravely: "I am not particularly pious, and I know I do a
                  great many worse things; but my Mother would be deeply pained if she knew how I
                  had spent that day."
               "That's right, Burton," said the doctor, patting me on the back, "and I'll knock
                  anybody down that says you are wrong."
               "The resolution was a good one at least," observed Miss Harwood, "whether the
                  motive was proper or not. I mean," she added apologetically, as we rose from the
                  table, "I mean that you might have had even a better motive than love
                  for your Mother." Once more she looked superbly lovely.
               "Perhaps I have, or may have," replied I, in a low tone. She heard
                  me, but nobody else did. She is a wonderful woman, considering her age! My answer
                  was somewhat equivocal, and her look showed that she so regarded it. We were all
                  seated on the gallery a few minutes later, where we found a Mr. Gowrie, an old
                  Scottish gentleman living at Carrville, who had just arrived. The discussion was
                  resumed by the doctor, who observed that all days were necessarily alike to him,
                  inasmuch as people "got sick on Sunday, and had to be visited and prescribed for."
                  I waited for somebody else to answer him until Carr asked: "What have you to say
                  to that, Hubbard?"
               "I don't know why you appeal to me," I replied, "but it is only necessary to say
                  that good people hold that works of necessity and mercy are allowable on the
                  Sabbath. The doctor's vocation includes both classes."
               "My idea," quoth the doctor, "is, that men should cultivate a thankful, and, if
                  you please, a devout frame of mind all the time. I don't believe in any religion
                  that one puts on only one day in seven."
               "That is to say, the Sabbath is the product of mere human superstition," I
                  replied, "or, at least, that actions which are wrong on Sunday are equally wrong
                  on any other day."
               "Exactly," said Charley Carr. There was a short pause. Miss Harwood looked
                  inquiringly at me, as if she expected me to say more. She sat just opposite one of
                  the windows, and the light from the room shone on her face. I could not resist the
                  look. I was foolish enough to fancy that it said, "Answer him," in a tone that was
                  at once imperious and gentle. Mr. Carr appeared restless, and tired of the
                  conversation. Master Herbert was whistling softly; nevertheless, I ventured one
                  more shot.
               "You seem so well satisfied with your conclusion, Carr, that it is almost a pity
                  to disturb your serenity, but I will just say another word: if we are creatures at
                  all, we owe allegiance to the Creator, and He has expressly commanded a special
                  observance of one day of the week. He has forbidden certain things on the Sabbath
                  which He enjoins upon us during the week."
               "That is verra weel put, young gentleman," observed Mr. Gowrie, "but it does not
                  contain all the argument." We were all slightly startled by this remark. Mr.
                  Gowrie had walked out from the village, and declined the invitation to supper when
                  Mr. Carr found him on the gallery, saying he had already supped. He had been
                  listening very quietly to the conversation, and this was his first remark. There
                  was something pugnacious in the tone, which awakened the doctor's pugnacity in
                  turn.
               "I should like to hear an argument, Mr. Gowrie," said he, "if there is one."
               "It is no' easy to state it in full, but the septenary division of time seems to
                  be written upon the nature of humanity. It is found among heathen tribes, who
                  never heard of either Jewish or Christian Sabbath."
               "But that proves nothing about the establishment of a special day for religious
                  observance. Does it, Burton?"
               "I beg to refer you to Mr. Gowrie. My side of the debate is in his hands now, and
                  I am well content to leave it there."
               "D'ye happen to know," said the Scot, "why the Sabbath came to be observed at
                  first?"
               There was a slight pause, and then a sweet voice answered, "For in six days the
                  Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the
                  seventh day; wherefore, the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it."
               "Preceesely. The young leddy has given the best possible answer. If you believe
                  the words she has quoted have authority, I suppose there need be nae mair
                  argumentation."
               "I have an objection to put in just there," said Charley Carr. "The day, you
                  observe, is not the day referred to in Miss Harwood's quotation."
               "And I have another slight objection," quoth the doctor. "I happen to be a
                  geologist, and, therefore, I can never believe that this earth was made in six
                  days."
               The Scot settled himself in his chair, took a pinch of snuff, cleared his throat,
                  and answered:
               
               "I'll just tak' one objection at a time, and begin with yours, doctor. Geology is
                  a fine science, and I cherish a great respect for it, but it is no' quite so auld
                  as revelation. Then, its professors dinna agree verra weel amang themselves. I
                  know of a dispute, in which a few millions of years are involved, between twa of
                  your maist famous professors in Scotland."
               "But they agree in rejecting the six days story, anyhow."
               "Ay, ay," answered Mr. Gowrie, "they agree in many points; but I am no' certain
                  about the sax days mysel', and, in fact, I dinna care a bawbee whether it was sax
                  days or sax million ages. D'ye happen to have a copy of the Scriptures at hand,
                  Miss Harwood."
               Miss Harwood rose, stepped through the window into the room, and reappeared in a
                  moment with a Bible in her hand, which she offered to Mr. Gowrie.
               "If I may be so bauld," he said, "I'll trouble you to read the passages I want; my
                  eyes are no sae young as they were forty years ago."
               "With pleasure, sir," replied she. "I can see perfectly by this light."
               "Weel," began the theologue, dogmatically, "there were twa things which God gave
                  to man in Eden that he brought out wi' him. He left somewhat in a hurry and
                  brought very little else. The first was the marriage relation, the second was the
                  Sabbath."
               "That is a striking remark," said Dr. Markham, "and I am pleased to admit it; but
                  the six daysâ€”"
               "Bide a wee, we'll hae the sax days soon enough. Please to read a varse or twa of
                  the second chapter of Genesis, Miss Ret." She read three verses, and Mr. Gowrie
                  stopped her. "There is the whole story ab
                  initio. I tak' it for granted that you young gentlemen will admit that
                  these varses contain the whole original account of the institution of the
                  Sabbath."
               "Yes," answered Charley and the doctor in a breath.
               "Weel," said Mr. Gowrie, very slowly and composedly, "there is na word aboot the
                  sax days there."
               Miss Harwood read the verses again. There was a pause. Everybody appeared
                  reluctant to "tackle" the Scotsman. He looked very grisly, as he sat there in the
                  dim light, audibly chuckling.
               "I cannot see the force of the omission, Mr. Gowrie," said Miss Ret, at last.
                  "Will you please explain?"
               "Certainly, so far as I can. I think the Sabbath was hallowed because God
                     rested, not because He worked. He could have made the
                  world in sax minutes, if He pleased, or He may have wrought through countless
                  ages. It maks no differ in either case, as it is the Rest we celebrate on the
                  Sabbath."
               "Mr. Gowrie," said the doctor, elaborately, "I am sure you err in calling the day
                  'the Sabbath.' It is probably owing to the misfortune of your Presbyterian
                  education. The day observed by Christians (except Seventh-day Baptists), whatever
                  their mode of observance, is in no sense of the word 'the Sabbath,' which is a
                  peculiarly Jewish institution, and belongs to the seventh day of the week alone.
                  If you observe the seventh day you observe the Sabbath; if the first day, be as
                  rigid as you please, it is 'Sunday,' or 'the Lord's day,' if you like, but not
                  'the Sabbath.' You might as well call Easter 'the Passover.'"
               Here was another pause. At first I thought Mr. Gowrie was floored, but happened
                  again to hear his truculent chuckle. I looked intently at him, saw his eyes
                  twinkle, and waited for his answer.
               "I dinna ken whether you'll hae the patience to hear the answerâ€”"
               "You can't get off so easily, Mr. Gowrie," said Charley, delightedly; "we'll
                  listen to you all night, if necessary."
               "Less time will do, Maister Charley, and I am the mair willing to answer the
                  doctor, because I answer you objection of yours at the same time. Will the young
                  leddy please read a varse or twa from the fourth of Hebrews?"
               "What verse, sir?"
               "Aweel, begin wi' the fourth varse."
               And Miss Harwood read:
               "For He spoke in a certain place of the seventh day on this wiseâ€”'And God did rest
                  the seventh day from all His works.'"
               "That is to say," said Mr. Gowrie, expounding, "He so spoke in the second chapter
                  of Genesis, which Miss Ret has already quoted. Now, in the 5th chapter of
                  Deuteronomy and at the fifteenth varse, Moses says the Lord commanded this
                  observance because He had brought the tribes out of Egypt. There was always before
                  the mind of the Jew the Rest of the land of Canaan, after his toilsome wanderings
                  throughout the forty years, and the constantly recurring Sabbath was, to the Jew,
                  an earnest, and pledge, and type of that Rest. But in the eighth varse of this
                  fourth of Hebrews the writer says Joshua did not obtain the true Rest, because God afterwards spoke of
                     another day. Nothing could be more clear and explicit than this
                  statement. Now, doctor," and he produced a little volume from his pocket, "I'll
                  just trouble you to read the next varseâ€”the ninth."
               "The doctor took the book, and stepped to the window. "Why it is Greek!" he
                  exclaimed.
               "Preceesely," answered the Scot composedly, "and a verra fine tongue it is."
               "I am rather rusty in Greek, Mr. Gowrie," said Markham, "but I'll try. The ninth
                  verse, fourth chapterâ€”here it is! Um, um!"
               "Ye need na' read the Greek, doctor, please translate into English."
               "Well," said the doctor, "it reads somehow thus: 'There remains therefore a rest
                  and a Sabbath-keeping to the people of God.'"
               "And the next varse," said Mr. Gowrie, "gives the reason. It is because Christ
                  also has ceased from His work, and entered into His rest," to wit, on "the first
                  day of the week, when He arose from the dead, preceesely as God ceased and rested
                  on the last day of the week." He rose as he spoke, and with great dignity
                  continued, "it is easy to preach from so clear a text as this. If the Jew had a
                  Sabbath, sanctified by the completion of God's great work of creation, surely the
                  Christian has a Sabbath, sanctified by the completion of God's great work of
                  redemption. And I'll just add, doctor," and he turned suddenly upon the medico,
                  "if you will take the trouble to look at the twelfth chapter of the Acts, at the
                  fourth varse, ye'll find that the writer there calls the Passover Easter. Your
                  illustration was unfortunate. Gude night, Miss Ret, I am verra much obliged to you
                  for listening so patiently. Gude night, gentlemen." And chuckling at a great rate,
                  he went crunching on the gravel towards the gate. In a moment he was hidden by the
                  trees, but we heard him once or twice chuckling in high glee.
               We all laughed. The discomfited appearance of the doctor was very funny, but did
                  not seem to disturb him at all. He sat there where the Scot left him, meditating.
                  At length he sighed softly.
               "I tell you what it is, Burton," he said, "any man who tackles a Scotch
                  Presbyterian on Theology had better keep out of reach of the fool-killer. I
                  thought I had him down, but I hadn't!"
               "Some of Mr. Gowrie's positions are new to me," I answered, "but his whole
                  argument was tolerably strong."
               "Mr. Gowrie is one of the most remarkable men I have ever met," observed Judge
                  Carr; "he is very thoroughly educated, and has more than once given me from memory
                  long 'quottations,' as he calls them, from classical authors, that were perfectly
                  accurate. He is also very fond of lighter literature, a very severe critic of
                  modern poetry, especially that of Moore and Byron, but with sound judgment and
                  rare taste. He is an excellent business man, exact and scrupulous in all his
                  dealings, seeming to take delight in the dryest details of commercial affairs.
                  Once or twice I have, for mere amusement, engaged him in controversy upon
                  theological subjects, and I must say that he has always forced me to believe that
                  his points were well taken, and, in fact, impregnable. He has a sly way of
                  yielding points which appear to be vital, and then coming down suddenly, and with
                  tremendous force, in an unexpected quarter. His curious dismissal of the 'Sax
                  days' appears to illustrate this peculiar habit."
               "What do you think of Mr. Gowrie's positions, Mr. Hubbard?" said Miss
                  Harwood.
               "It seems to me," replied I, "that his statements were all perfectly logical. A
                  quaint remark of his just occurs to me. I was speaking to him this morning about
                  an infidel book that has recently appeared, entitled 'The Free Thinker,' and his
                  comment was 'ay, ay, I hae perused you book. The maist remarkable thing I found in
                  it was the title. The author, instead of being 'free,' is in bondage to the maist
                  extraordinary ignorance, and there is no sign in his book of any 'thinking' of any
                  sort." I turned to Charley and added, "You may as well abandon your flimsy
                  theories, mon ami, and rely upon the immutable
                  facts of an existent Deity, and therefore a Divine Revelation."
               "You are taking for granted every thing that you ought to prove," said Carr; "the
                  existence of a Deity, the fact of a Divine Revelation, andâ€”"
               "Oh! Charley! Charley!" Miss Ret is certainly in love with my friend, I think, and
                  she is as evidently disgusted with what he calls his 'free thinking.' I don't
                  believe, however, that he is settled in his infidel opinions, but rather suppose
                  he talked for the sake of argument. I'll have it out with him hereafter.
               His father interposed at this point:
               "We have been waiting for this opportunity, Mr. Hubbard, to hear from you an
                  account of your adventures last Sunday," he said. "Charley tells me that you did
                  not give him more than the outlines of
                  your story, so if you please we will postpone polemics, and listen with great
                  pleasure to your account of the panther hunt."
               "If you please, father," said Charley, "I would like to ask Hubbard
                  one question before we change the subject. Why did you go on this unhallowed
                  expedition last Sunday? I presume the views you have just expressed are not
                  altogether new to you?"
               "I hardly know why I did not decline your invitation when it was given. I
                  recollect that I offered some objection and I think you did not give me time to
                  refuse. However, I had determined to send you a note of apology by
                  Jake, butâ€”"
               "But what?" said Miss Harwood.
               "But my good resolutions vanished before the desire to bestride your mare as soon
                  as I saw her. After I once mounted, I confess I did not think much of the day
                  until Midnight and I parted company."
               "There!" said Charley, triumphantly, "I said it was all your fault, Ret, or your
                  mare's fault, which is the same thing. She is a dumb brute and not
                  responsible."
               "I want to hear about the panther now," replied Miss Harwood. Her brother ceased
                  whistling, and drew his chair up. I had a very attentive audience. They all
                  listened with a flattering silence while I narrated the panther story. I tried to
                  say little about the actual encounter, which was no great shakes after all. The
                  brute must have had some forty buckshot in his body before I gave him the coup de grace. When I finished the recital Carr
                  observed that my account did not exactly agree with Mr. Maltby's. "He said that
                  you rushed in and knifed the brute while he was still fighting the dogs."
               "I believe I did," I answered; "it was all over in a minute. I saw Music dash at
                  the panther and get an ugly scratch, and you know she is a pet of yours and mine.
                  I suppose I was induced to take an active part in the dispute on her account."
               "Mr. Maltby says he would not have stood in your shoes for the best plantation in
                  the State. The panther was more dangerous because wounded, and poor Music can
                  testify that he was not quite so nearly dead as you suppose."
               "Please tell me, Mr. Hubbard," said Herbert earnestly, "what you thought when you
                     went in."
               "I don't remember," replied I, laughing at his earnestness. "I had not much time
                  to think. I saw the dogs flying about, and when I first got a good view of the
                  panther he was on his back, fighting with all four of his feet. As I ran up a dog
                  passed me and darted at his throat, and in the struggle that followed he turned
                  over on his side. I think I put my foot on his fore leg and thrust the knife into
                  his body, just behind the shoulder."
               "That was just it," said Charley Carr. "Maltby thinks it was the pluckiest thing
                  he ever saw or heard of. It is curious, by-the-bye, what became of the beast.
                  Maltby went with one of his boys in the afternoon to skin him, but could not find
                  hide or hair. Old Misty could not be found either, nor has he been seen since
                  Sunday."
               "There was a person with Mr. Maltby on Sunday," said I, "called Captain Delaney, I
                  thinkâ€”"
               "Delaney!" said Miss Harwood, with a start.
               "Yes; at least the Indian told me that was his name. I mentioned his because I
                  wished to know if any of you could tell me anything about him."
               "Captain Delaney lives in New Orleans," said Mr. Carr. "He comes to this parish
                  occasionally. When he is in this neighbourhood he stays at Mr. Maltby's. I think
                  he is related to Mrs. Maltby."
               "Is he in the army, sir?" I inquired.
               "Noâ€”that is, he was a captain of volunteers in the Florida war, and
                  he still retains the title. At present he is aâ€”"
               "A sportsman," said Charley, when his father paused, as if he were hunting for a
                  word to describe the sleek gentleman's occupation. "Sportsman" in this latitude
                  means simply a gambler.
               "I was going to say a gentleman of leisure," continued Mr. Carr. "He seems to have
                  plenty of money always. Charles calls him a 'sportsman,' I suppose, because he
                  plays for money, but I think he has never been suspected of unfairness. Most of
                  the gentlemen in this vicinity have played with him, and though he generally wins,
                  his good fortune is attributed to his superior luck, or skill, or both
                  together."
               Here the doctor started up, saying he must "be off." Jake brought his horse to the
                  step, and after he had deliberated some five minutes, he finally made up his mind
                  to put his left foot in the stirrup. He mounted while he was making his farewell
                  speech.
               "Do you keep yourself quiet for a day or two longer and you shall have your fiddle
                  again. You had better get Burton here to
                  give you some lessons. He plays like the witches! Good evening. Never mind the
                  gate, Jake. Mr. Hubbard will open it for me. Come, Burton, walk down to the gate;
                  I want to speak to you."
               As soon as we got out of earshot of the occupants of the porch, the doctor, who is
                  very thoughtful and considerate, began:
               "I only wanted to say to you, Hubbard, that you must not allow yourself to admire
                  Miss Ret too much. She is mortgaged to our friend Charley, I suspect."
               "Much obliged for the warning, doctor," replied I, laughing, although I felt
                  rather provoked, "but there is not the slightest danger in my ease."
               "I don't know about that, Burton. She is the finest girl in this State, or in any
                  other, that I know of."
               "No doubt. Nevertheless I am safe enough."
               "The devil you are! D'ye mean that your young affections are already placed?"
               "Yesâ€”upon myself. I am not young enough to fall in love with the first pretty girl
                  I see. Besides, Miss Ret is not so remarkably beautiful. Oh, please tell me what
                  there was about my question that was mal
                  apropos. I mean, when I inquired how old Midnight was."
               "Nothing amiss on your part. The mare was foaled on the night that Mr.
                  Harwoodâ€”died. I'll tell you about it to-morrow. Here's the gate. I advise you to
                  go back by that walk to the left. I hate to be crunching over gravel when I can
                  get on the soft grass. Good night."
               I turned off the carriage road as the doctor advised and presently came to a
                  beautiful little bower, covering a rustic seat. I sat down here and puffed at my
                  cigar, thinking over all the matters I have been scrawling down here. It is
                  probable that the time slipped away faster than I imagined while I was indulging
                  in my "maiden meditations, fancy free." At last I threw away the stump of my cigar
                  and was about to resume my walk when I heard footsteps on the carriage road, which
                  was near the path, and as they drew nearer I heard Miss Harwood's voice. She has a
                  remarkably sweet voice, and I paused to listen.
               "The doctor calls him Burton," she said.
               "That's not his name, though," said Charley Carr. "Stop, I have a note from him in
                  my pocket now. I can read it by moon-light." He fumbled in his pocket and I heard
                  the rustling of the paper. "It is signed 'H. H.,'" said Carr, in a tone of
                  vexation.
               "'H.' does not stand for 'Burton,'" said Miss Ret.
               "It must be 'Henry,'" observed Carr.
               "Maybe it's 'Herbert,'" said my namesake, and then the young rascal began to humâ€” 
                     
                        "Old Mother Hubbard,
                        She lived in a cupboard."
                     
                  
               
               "Hush!" said his sister, "he might hear you and perhaps he would not like it. I
                  think he must be a namesake of mine, brother; your name is not very common."
               "I shall call myself 'Henry' hereafter, anyhow," said I, advancing; "Miss Harwood
                  has not left me a choice."
               They all laughed, though I thought the young lady was somewhat embarrassed, as she
                  observed,
               "We did not know you were so near."
               "The doctor recommended the walk to me, and I was tempted by the beauty of this
                  arbour to rest while I finished my cigar. I have overheard very little of your
                  conversation. Dr. Markham calls me 'Burton' sometimes, because we both admire an
                  author of that name."
               "I can very easily find out Hubbard's Christian name," said Charley, "as some of
                  the Carrville people will know it."
               "Very well," replied I; "in the meantime I am to remain Henry Hubbard, at your
                  service."
               "Your initials are the same as mine, Mr. Hubbard," said Herbert, "and Ret's too.
                  Isn't that funny?"
               "Yes. But I know something still more unaccountable; and that is, that I am
                  acquainted with a Baltimorean whose name is precisely identical with yours."
               "Herbert Harwood!" exclaimed all three.
               I watched them to see what effect the announcement would produce. Carr and Herbert
                  expressed nothing but surprise, while Miss Harwood appeared to be discomposed.
                  Maybe this was only my fancy. But she said immediatelyâ€”"we are keeping Mr. Hubbard
                  standing all this time. Let us go back to the house." Charley and her brother
                  walked on ahead, and I had the honour of walking by Miss Ret's side. I think she
                  lagged a little behind purposely, to say to me, "At another time I will be much
                  obliged to you for a fuller account ofâ€”your Baltimore acquaintance. It is possible
                  that Herbert and I may have relations there of whom we know nothing, or very
                  little."
               I made no reply to this. I thought once or twice of bolting out the secret of my identity with these possible
                  "relations," but there was some inflexion in her voice, or something in her
                  manner, that kept me silent. It's of no use for me to try to say what it was. I
                  don't know. But I will know, if it pleases heaven!
               Ten o'clock came pretty soon. Charley escorted me to my sleeping apartment, in
                  which everything was nice and comfortable, and left me, wishing me "pleasant
                  dreams!" I hunted for the dreams till midnight, and then got up and dressed. My
                  room opened on the second story of the verandah, and I spent most of the night
                  sitting at the window and on the door-sill, smoking, wondering, dreaming perhaps,
                  but not sleeping. I left this morning before anybody was up except Jake, who got
                  my horse for me.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               HERBERT.
               
                  
                     THURSDAY, May 13, 1836.
                  
                  I HAVE been thinking a great deal about Miss Harwood to-day, and trying to
                     recall all that I have ever heard about my father's family. I think there must
                     be some relationship between this young lady and myself, as I cannot otherwise
                     account for the interest I take in her and all belonging to her. It would be
                     quite absurd to suppose that the short time I spent in her society was long
                     enough to create any specialâ€”I was going to sayâ€”regard, independently of an
                     instinctive recognition of kinship, if there is such a word. It
                     may, and probably will turn out that I am her forty-seventh cousinâ€”that is
                     always supposing myâ€”friendly feeling to be the result of a blood relationship,
                     recognized by me through some mysterious faculty of the mind. In that case,
                     however, theâ€”liking, if I may so call itâ€”ought to be mutual, and I am bound to
                     confess that I cannot remember that she gave any evidence that way; though I
                     think I remember all her looks and words. I have not much to record as the
                     events of to-day. If Mr. White had returned I should have had some talk with
                     him about the matter. I don't know now whether I had better tell him about my
                     change of name or not. I wrote a letter to Mother about it to-day and tore it
                     up afterwards. I don't know what to think about an engagement between her and
                     Charley Carr. While she appears to be devotedly attached to him, I could not
                     see any tokens of very flaming love on his part. It would be truly horrible for
                     such a girl as she is to marry a man who did not half love her! But what
                     business is it of mine? I'll quit writing on the subject.
                  I have been in the post-office all day. There are not many applicants for
                     letters here, except on the day after the mail arrives, so I have been
                     uninterrupted most of the day. At dinner at the hotel I noticed a stranger on
                     the opposite side of the table, and intended to look at the register to
                     ascertain who he was and where he was from. He is a slight, pale young man, a
                     little bald, wears near-sighted spectacles, and looks as if he had burned any
                     quantity of midnight oil. I forgot about the register when I came out, and was
                     seated behind the counter in the post-office smoking my after-dinner cigar,
                     when the stranger entered the office.
                  "Is there a letter for 'Hamilton?'" he asked.
                  "Yes sir!" replied I, going to the letter box and selecting it. It was
                     addressed to "the Rev. Philip Hamilton, Carrville, La."
                  "You have a good memory, sir," he observed politely. He opened the letter, read
                     it rapidly and then put it in his pocket.
                  "I remembered your letter, sir," said I, when he had got through with it,
                     "because it had the Baltimore post mark." He was turning away as I spoke, but
                     came back immediately.
                  "Ah!" he said, with considerable interest. "Are you from that city?"
                  "Yes sir, it is my birth-place."
                  "The hotel keeper told me you were Mr. Hubbard;" here he bowed. "I asked your
                     name, because I fancied that I saw in your face a resemblance toâ€”some one I
                     have met in Baltimore;â€”perhaps a relation of yours?"
                  "I have a Mother and two sisters there, sir, and no other kindred that I
                     know."
                  "Ah! then I must have fancied a likeness. Good afternoon, sir."
                  "Won't you walk in and take a smoke with me?" said I. "I can't invite you into
                     the post-office; but if you will step into the street and come in at the door
                     at the right, we can fumigate the whole of the adjoining house."
                  "Thank you, you are very kind." So he came in. I gave him one of my regalias,
                     and we were soon puffing away in the empty store room.
                  
                  I found my new acquaintance very entertaining. He is very fond of a joke, and
                     cracks a good many himself. Most of the preachers that I have known have been
                     so grave and solemn that I have always fought shy of their society. Mr.
                     Hamilton asked me some questions about Baltimore; said he had been there within
                     a month, though he knew very little about the people. He preached twice in one
                     of the churches there, Doctor Nevins', I believe, and had become a little
                     acquainted with some of the members of that congregation. He is going to preach
                     in the Presbyterian Church, in Carrville, on the next Sabbath, and I intend to
                     go hear him. He knows everything, and I hope we shall be good friends.
                  This evening, after tea, I went into the playing room at the hotel, and saw Mr.
                     Maltby and Mr. Carr playing a game called euchre, with Captain Delaney and an
                     ugly fellow that I have seen in town two or three times. I have heard that he
                     is an overseer on some plantation in the neighbourhood. His name is Beckett. I
                     spoke to Maltby and Mr. Carr, but did not notice the others. They seemed to be
                     playing a pretty high game; that is, Mr. Carr and Delaney were betting ten
                     dollars a game. I only staid a short time. The game is somewhat like whist; the
                     best cards, however, are the knaves of trumps, and of the other suit of the
                     same colour. I did not like to see old Mr. Carr gambling, though almost
                     everybody out here does it. They did not keep the play up very late, as I saw
                     Mr. Carr, Maltby and Beckett, riding out of town an hour or two ago. This was
                     the first sight of Delaney that I have had since last Sunday. I heard him say
                     that he was going to New Orleans to-morrow. I hope he will stay there.
               
               
                  
                     FRIDAY, May 14, 1836.
                  
                  Ah, me! Let me recount things in order. First, the mail last night brought a
                     letter for "Judge Carr." It was postmarked New York, and had come "by express
                     mail, postage seventy-five cents, prepaid." Next, Charley came in this morning,
                     and went on to New Orleans in a transient steamboat. By-the-bye, Delaney went
                     in the same boat. I showed the letter to Charley, who requested me to send it
                     out to Manahio, if opportunity offered, or if none presented, and, if "I would
                     be so kind," to ride his horse out, with the letter, in the afternoon. We both
                     concluded that the letter was important, as it had come out of the ordinary
                     course. Third: Mr. White returned last night, and took possession of the
                     Reverend Mr. Hamilton, moving him, bag and baggage, from the hotel to his
                     pretty cottage. After dinner they both came in, and when I told Mr. White about
                     the letter, he said he would remain in the office with Mr. Hamilton, and if I
                     would like the ride, I had better act upon Charley's suggestion. So I found
                     myself, early in the afternoon, on the banks of the creek and near the haunted
                     laurels.
                  This was the first time, since I heard the legend, that I had the chance to
                     take a near look at this locality, so I turned off from the road, and pushing
                     through the undergrowth, I reached the trunks of the big trees. They stand near
                     the bank of the creek, in a triangle, the sides of which are probably eight or
                     ten yards long. My first thought, after I had fastened the horse to a swinging
                     branch and dismounted, was, that the little area would be a splendid place for
                     a quiet duel. The ground is level and smooth, and the bushes, which were thick
                     enough outside of the trees' shadow, would conceal the combatants effectually.
                     I looked in vain for some traces of the tragedy which had been enacted on this
                     spot; but it is probable that time has effaced such dismal memorials, if they
                     were visible five years ago. It was here, too, that John Harwood died his
                     mysterious death, and I felt the old melancholy feeling coming over me, which
                     took possession of me, and kept me awake the other night. I don't know why I
                     should not be affected by the sad countenance of his orphan daughter, and I am
                     not ashamed to own that I am affected, whenever I think of her
                     (which is pretty nearly all the time). The thing that plagues me most is the
                     conviction that Charley don't appreciate her, and, therefore, will never be
                     able to comfort herâ€”bah! what a dreadful ninny I must be!
                  The day was hot, and I took off my coat and vest, half disposed to take a bath
                     in the creek. While I was thinking about it I heard a horse neigh, and
                     presently I heard the tramp of his hoofs. My horse neighed in reply, and in a
                     minute or two a Spanish pony poked his way through the bushes, bringing on his
                     back no less a personage than Master Herbert Harwood.
                  "Hello! Mr. Hubbard! Why, what the dickens are you doing here?"
                  "That's just what I was going to ask you," replied I, shaking his
                     hand. He slipped down from the saddle, and throwing the stirrups over the
                     cantle, he let the pony go, saying: "Here's some elegant grass, Dick, and you
                     may eat your belly full. I never hitch Dick; he always stays where I leave him.
                     I have to turn the stirrups over,
                     though, for once he tried to get on himself; at least, I found him
                     with his hind foot in the stirrup. I am going to bathe in here, please; so are
                     you, ain't you? That's jolly! I've got two towels." By the time he had got thus
                     far, he had wriggled himself out of his coat, and was fumbling at his
                     collar-button with his left hand. I perceived that his right arm was not of
                     much use to him, though he had gotten rid of the sling.
                  "Let me help you," said I, unfastening his button.
                  "Thank 'ee! My arm hurts me a little, and the doctor says I must not use it
                     much, yet awhile. Now, sir; please pull my shirt right over my head! Thank 'ee!
                     I can manage the rest. Boots and trousers come off together, you see! Why don't
                     you undress?"
                  He slipped off his drawers and stockings, and waded out into the stream, and
                     was pretty soon up to his neck. He did not attempt to swim, but wading back
                     towards the bank, he crawled up on a log, one end of which was resting on the
                     shore. It gradually sank with his weight, until only his head was visible above
                     the water. I was getting out of my boots when he recommenced his harangue.
                  "I say, Mr. Hubbard! You know Jake went in after Midnight the other morning? I
                     mean the day after you were out at Manahio?"
                  "Yes."
                  "Well, he found she was hard to lead, so he got on her back, and she gave him
                     an awful hyste!"
                  "Was he hurt?" I asked. He made no reply, but I heard him splashing in the
                     water. I had my back towards him, and was tugging at my last stocking, when it
                     suddenly occurred to me that he had slipped off the log. I ran down to the edge
                     of the creek, saw the log bobbing up and down, but the boy had disappeared! I
                     was stripped, with the exception of my drawers, and without a moment's
                     hesitation I plunged into the stream. As soon as I got into the current I
                     allowed my body to float with it, diving whenever the water was too deep for me
                     to see the bottom. The laurels stood in a little cove, and there is a strong
                     eddy just along the bank; I suppose that is the reason the creek is deeper
                     there than at the ford. It is probable that Herbert was carried back, up the
                     stream, by this return current, as I found, after I had floated and swam twenty
                     or thirty yards from the log, that the creek was too shoal for his body to get
                     lower down. Accordingly I put forth all my vigour, swimming along the bank,
                     until at last I saw his arm, and then his white body above the surface for an
                     instant, near the spot where I at first entered the water. In another minute
                     his arm was around my neck, nearly choking me, and I was half swimming and half
                     crawling towards the bank. I scrambled up somehow, and laid him down on the
                     grass. He was not entirely insensible, though he still clutched me round the
                     neck, and I had some trouble to get rid of his convulsive grasp. Altogether, I
                     was pretty well used up. However, I began to rub him vigorously with a towel,
                     trying to remember what was the proper treatment for half drowned people. He
                     muttered something about "hurting his arm," and I propped him up in a sitting
                     posture, handling him as tenderly as I could. Gradually a little colour came
                     into his cheeks and light into his eyes. He had not been three minutes in the
                     water.
                  "I say!" he began, after looking all roundâ€”"at sun and stream and plain"â€”as if
                     he were trying to decide where he wasâ€”"I say, why didn't you come when I called
                     you?"
                  "You must have called me while you were under the water, old fellow. How came
                     you to get under? I saw you wading just before you disappeared."
                  "I slipped off the log yonder, and it struck me on my lame arm, and then I kept
                     falling down, down, till the current caught me. But I thought I called you to
                     help me."
                  "I thought you were astride of the log until I looked for you, and when I found
                     you were not, I jumped in, and have been as far as the ripple and back again. I
                     found you at last close by the bank."
                  "Well, then," said Herbert, "I've been drownded!"
                  "Not quite," replied I, laughing, "but you were not very far from it. Can't you
                     swim?"
                  "Yes, a little, but my arm hurt me so! I say!" he continued, his lips quivering
                     and the tears springing to his eyesâ€”"I say, you have saved my life!"
                  "Maybe so, but never mind that. How do you feel now?"
                  "Oh, I'm all right now, only a little weak. Would you mind helping me dress?
                     Thank'ee! But I'll dip myself in the water first. I've gone and muddied my
                     legs!"
                  While he was performing his ablutions I took off my drawers, and wringing them
                     out, hung them on a bush in the sun. They were nearly dry by the time I had got
                     him dressed. His tongue seemed to be the only member that had not lost its
                     usual vigour, as he talked incessantly.
                  
                  "Look here, Mr. Hubbard! honour bright! didn't you hear me sing anything while
                     I was in the water?"
                  "Not a note."
                  "Not 'Old Mother'"â€”he paused.
                  "'Old Mother Hubbard, she lived in a cupboard?'" replied I. "I heard you sing
                     that the other night."
                  "Did you mind it? Ret gave me fits about it."
                  "Of course I didn't," I replied, "you may sing it to me as often as you
                     like."
                  "That's a jolly good fellow!" and here he insisted upon shaking my hand while I
                     was trying to get his shirt over his head. "Well, I thought I sung that while I
                     was in the creek. It's a dog on ugly name though, ain't it?"
                  "Yes, but I have another name andâ€”"
                  "May I call you Harry?" he shouted, "oh, that's prime! but you are such a big
                     fellow that it don't seem polite. S'pose I call you cousin Harry?"
                  "That's the very thing," answered I, poking his arm into his shirt sleeve, "and
                     I'll call you Cousin Herbert."
                  "Will you? Oh, ain't that jolly?" and he pulled his arm out to shake hands
                     again. "Well, I call Charley Carr 'Cousin Charley,' and he's not my cousin, you
                     know."
                  "No, I don't know; I thought Mr. Carr was your uncle."
                  "No, he ain't; no relation at all. He is guardian for me and Ret. We've always
                     called him uncle, but he ain't."
                  "Well, now, do you hold still till I get you dressed, and we can talk as we
                     ride. I am going to Manahio with you."
                  "Just shake hands once more, Cousin Harry. Thank 'ee! now I'll be still as a
                     mouse." He kept his word, and we were soon dressed. As we rode along the
                     beautiful shady road, which I believe I've mentioned before, my new cousin did
                     an immense amount of talking, and I learned from him many things that I have
                     been wanting to know. I avoided asking him about his family, because I intended
                     to get the information I wanted on that point from his sister, if I ever had an
                     opportunity. This opportunity arrived sooner than I expected or hoped. When we
                     reached Mr. Carr's house I saw Midnight in Jake's custody, with a side saddle
                     on her sleek back.
                  Mr. Carr came out on the gallery, welcomed me very politely, and expressed his
                     acknowledgments for "my kindness" in bringing the letter. After he had read it,
                     I proposed taking his reply back with me, as I could send it to New Orleans by
                     this evening's boat and it could go by express mail immediately, from the city.
                     His answer to this offer was, "that the letter could only be answered in
                     person, and it was doubtful whether the matter was of sufficient importance to
                     warrant a journey to New York." Herbert had vanished into the house, and now
                     reappeared with his beautiful sister, who was dressed in a riding habit. She
                     walked straight up to me, as if she were about to knock me down, and holding
                     out her little white hand, which I took clumsily enough, she saidâ€”
                  "Oh, Uncle! Herbert would have been drowned if Mr. Hubbard had not saved him!"
                     There were tears in her eyes and her voice.
                  "How! what! when?" exclaimed Mr. Carr, with astonishment.
                  "I was taking a swim, sir," said Master Herbert, "and I slipped off a log, and
                     hurt my arm, and then I suppose I fainted; anyhow, cousin Harry had to swim
                     ever so far before he found me."
                  "Your cousin Harry!" said Mr. Carr, "what cousin Harry?"
                  "I believe that is to be my title, henceforth, sir," said I. "Since I had the
                     good fortune to pull Herbert out of the Manahio, he has been looking out for a
                     name for me, and I am very well satisfied with the one he has chosen." All this
                     time I was holding Miss Ret's hand, like a booby. I suppose I looked at her
                     with a very warm, cousinly glance, and perhaps I squeezed her
                     little hand. I daresay; I was mad enough to do anything, for she was looking at
                     me with her big brown eyes, in which the tear-drops still glitteredâ€”anyhow, she
                     drew her hand away, and I think she blushedâ€”a little.
                  "You have not yet told me how all this happened," said Mr. Carr, looking
                     alternately at me and Herbert; "how did it chance that Mr. Hubbard found your
                     bathing place?"
                  "I was already there, sir," I answered.
                  "Where?"
                  "At the Haunted Laurels."
                  "The Laurels!" said Mr. Carr, staggering back as if he had been shot. Miss
                     Harwood ran to him, as he sank into a chair, and I kept on talking, hoping they
                     would all think that I had not noticed his extraordinary agitation.
                  "Herbert would have been in no danger, sir, if he had not hurt his arm. I think
                     you had better prohibit similar excursions until he gets over his escapade with Midnight.
                     By-the-bye, Miss Harwood, you are going to ride her this afternoon?"
                  "Yes, sir, I was going to Harwood with a message from uncle. But it will answer
                     as well to-morrow; won't it, uncle?"
                  "Yes, yes," replied her guardianâ€”"put the mare away, Jake, and Mr. Charles's
                     horse, alsoâ€”Mr. Hubbard will stay with us this evening."
                  "Don't postpone your ride on my account," said I, rising, "but rather allow me
                     to ride with youâ€”that is, if you are going towards town. I have to be there
                     this evening to attend to mail business, otherwise I should be too happy to
                     remain."
                  "Are you well enough for me to leave you, brother?"
                  "Oh, I'm all right," answered he, swaggering about the gallery, "only I want
                     the sling again."
                  "Well, then, we will go, if you are ready, sir," to me. "Jake, bring the
                     horses." And a few minutes later we were pacing down the drive, Jake following
                     at a respectful distance. He was gorgeously attired, and had a livery band
                     around his hat, and seemed proud of the honor of attending upon his future
                     young mistress. We passed out of the gate and I waited for her to say something
                     that would lead to the questions I wanted to ask her. As we came in sight of
                     the creek I inquired about the depth of the water.
                  "The stream is fordable in many places," she replied; "there are some deep
                     places which they call 'pools,' but I think they are two or three miles lower
                     down, near the mouth of the stream."
                  "It is deep at theâ€”the place where your brother was bathing."
                  "You mean at the Laurels; yes, I have heard that it was deeper there. How did
                     it happen that you were there to-day?"
                  "I was on my way to Manahio, with a letter for Mr. Carr, and turned off to look
                     at the trees. I was resting under their shade when your brother came."
                  "Herbert says you risked your life to save his! Oh, Mr. Hubbard, I have not
                     much left to live for, and if my brother had died there to-day, I think I
                     should have died too!"
                  "I don't deny that I was instrumental in saving his life, but I ran no risk. I
                     can swim across the Mississippi. You need not look so gratefully at me. The
                     gratitude is due elsewhere. If I had not been drawn to the spot, by what seemed
                     only idle curiosity, but which both you and I know was direct and special
                     Providence denceâ€”Herbert would have been drowned." She covered her face with
                     her hands and we rode on in silence. After a time I said: "You implied, the
                     other night, that you would tell me something about the Baltimore Harwoods, or
                     rather that you would ask me some questions about them."
                  "Oh yes. Do you know them well? How many are there of them?"
                  "I know them very intimately. There are four persons only in the familyâ€”Mrs.
                     Harwood, Miss Alice, Miss Grace and Mr. Herbert. I know they have no
                     relationsâ€”at least not on this side of the ocean."
                  "Alice! Herbert!" she exclaimed, "and the family of English origin?"
                  "Yes, their immediate ancestors were English."
                  "Do they resemble us? I mean me or my brother?"
                  "I cannot say that they do. And yet, when you smile, you do look
                     like dear Grace."
                  "'Dear Grace!' Oh, indeed! Mr. Hubbard! I perceive now why you
                     were so eager to talk about your Baltimore friends. Like me, is she? I take
                     that for a compliment, anyhow. She must be particularly lovely in your
                     eyes!"
                  "You are entirely mistaken," I stammered.
                  "Come, sir!" she said, still laughing merrily, "Do you mean to say that you are
                     not in love?"
                  "I am afraid I am," I answered, and I believe I groaned.
                  "Well, don't distress yourself, I won't pursue the subject, Mr. Hubbard."
                  "I wish you would not call me Mr. Hubbard!" I exclaimed petulantly.
                  "I think I might follow Herbert's example, and call you Cousin Harry, if you
                     like that better. I am beginning to believe that your friends are truly cousins
                     of mine, and I would only be anticipating a little if I gave you that
                     relationship." All this was said in a gay tone, very different from her usual
                     manner. The ride must have put her in good spirits.
                  "If you will honour me so much, Miss Harwood, I will be extremely
                     grateful." She looked surprised, and I continued, "You don't know how I hate to
                     be called Hubbard, but I will tell you the next time I see youâ€”that isâ€”I
                        think I will. And now, if you will explain to me the possible
                     relationship between you andâ€”my friends in Baltimore, you will confer a great
                     favour upon me. I have powerful
                     reasonsâ€”I might say I have a right to know all you can tell
                     me."
                  We had by this time arrived at a fork in the carriage road, one branch of which
                     is the direct road to Carrville, the other leading across the Manahio, by a
                     ford more than a mile above the Laurels. She turned her horse into this road,
                     remarking that "I could get to town that way." I followed her across the creek,
                     wondering what she was thinking about the matter, and what she was going to say
                     about my request for the history of the Harwoods. She was evidently thinking
                     upon the subject, and arriving at some conclusion.
                  "I believe I understand you," she said at length. "You shall have all the
                     information I can give you. You have a right to ask on two
                     accounts. You have saved my brother's life, and there is no one living that can
                     be affected by the history I can furnish you, unless it should happen that the
                     Baltimore familyâ€”but they are your friendsâ€”" She considered a
                     moment, and then added: "Promise me that no member of that family
                     shall know what you learn from the papers I give you."
                  "I cannot. It would not be possible for me to keep such a promise."
                  "Well, promise me that you will reveal what you learn from them to no one
                     except your wife."
                  "I may safely promise that; I shall never have a wife."
                  "There is something very strange about this matter," said Ret, with an air of
                     great perplexity. "I suppose it is not proper for me to ask what it is?"
                  "I can tell you this much," I replied desperately: "I think I love a lady, or
                     that I would love her if I dared. But I have reason to thinkâ€”or
                     knowâ€”that she loves my friend. I have been told that there is even an
                     engagement."
                  "I was going to ask you if your friend loved her, but if there is an engagement
                     between themâ€”"
                  "I don't know. If I knew that he loved her as she ought to be
                     loved, I think I could endure it." She listened with great interest, and I was
                     encouraged to go on. "At times I doubt whether she has the kind and degree of
                     affection for him that a wife ought to have. My ideas on the subject are
                     peculiar, and perhaps romantic. If I should ever marry, I should require my
                     wife to love God supremelyâ€”and then to give me every other thought
                     and feeling of her heart, and, in requital, I would love her as no man ever
                     loved before, or ever will again."
                  "And you doubt whether these feelings are mutually entertained by Miss Harwood
                     and your friend?"
                  "I do."
                  "If your suspicions are well founded," she said, speaking slowly and
                     deliberately, "they ought never to marry. And if you could be certain that your
                     feelings have not warped your good judgment, you would be justified in using
                     any lawful means to avert the doom that awaits them. Your friendship for one
                     and your love for the other, equally demand your interference to break an
                     engagement which, if fulfilled, will entail a life of misery upon both."
                  She said this with great earnestness. We had entered a beautiful avenue, and
                     were approaching a house far superior in appearance to any of the residences I
                     had seen in the State. It is-built in the style of English cottages, with
                     pointed gables, and looks like pictures I have somewhere seen, probably in some
                     book of architectural designs. A broad verandah extends along the wide front,
                     and the windows opening upon it descend to the floor, having inside shutters,
                     which fold back against the frames. Jacobus took our horses, and we stood on
                     the floor of the verandah, looking at the beautiful prospect before us.
                  "This is Harwood, sir," said Ret, "and I bid you welcome to my father's
                     house."
                  She rang the bell, and the door was opened by a little coal black African, who
                     showed a mouth full of ivory as soon as he saw us. I heard him bawling out from
                     the back of the house, after we had passed into a drawing room on the right of
                     the hall, "Oh, mammy, mammy! Here Miss Ret done come, wid a nudder gemp'lum!
                     Uncle 'Cobus, too!"
                  "It is a wonder that 'Uncle 'Cobus' was not the first to be announced," said
                     Ret, laughing; "here comes Aunt Chloe."
                  A fat, middle aged negress came waddling into the room, dropping me a curtsey,
                     and a "Sarvant, Mars'r!" as she passed me. She waddled over to Ret, and,
                     shaking her hand, said, "La! Miss Ret, I'se right down glad to see you! But dis
                     room ain't bin dusted to-day. Ef I'd knowd you was gwine to come, I'd hab it
                     all fix up!"
                  "Never mind, Aunty," said Ret, "I am only going to stay a little while. Send
                     Phany for Mr. Beckett."
                  "De oberseer done gone to town, Missee," replied Chloe.
                  "Well, then, I'll ride over again to-morrow. Tell him I'll he here at four o'clock; and, Aunty, please to
                     bring me the black key box. It is on the table in my room." While Aunt Chloe
                     was absent, Ret said, "Since my father's death we have lived altogether at Mr.
                     Carr's. There is no one about the house excepting Chloe and her son,
                     Phany."
                  "Phany?" said I; "that is a queer name."
                  "His name is Aristophanes. The negroes like big names for their children, and
                     father always gratified them by getting the longest names he could think of.
                     Thank you, Aunty." She unlocked the box with a key that was attached to her
                     watch chain, and taking a bunch of keys from the box she opened an iron door in
                     the jamb of the fireplace. She took a package from this recess, and, relocking
                     the door, replaced the keys in the ebony box, which she gave back to Chloe,
                     instructing her to return it to her chamber.
                  "These letters," she said, giving me the package, "are arranged according to
                     their dates. You will, perhaps, have to read them all if you desire to know the
                     full history of the Harwoods. Some of them are old, and the ink has faded, but
                     they are all legible. I have read them several times. You will
                     understand, when you read them, why I wished to impose the restrictionsâ€”"
                  "I wish you could trust me," I said, earnestly, "and let me judge how much of
                     the story I may reveal, and how much of it I should consider private and
                     confidential."
                  "Well," she said, after a pause, "read the letters, and if you think afterwards
                     that you should be freed from your promise, I'llâ€”consider it."
                  I assisted her to mount Midnight, and when we passed out of the avenue into the
                     road, she observed that there were two ways by which I could reach Carrville;
                     "The most direct route is a succession of blind paths, and you might easily get
                     astray in the woods. If you have the time to spare, you had better ride round
                     by the Laurelsâ€”I am going home that way."
                  "I have the day before me," I answered; "my mail duties do not begin till late
                     in the night. I would go back to Manahio with you if it were not for this
                     package. I am dying to get at it."
                  "What have you heard about the Haunted Laurels?" she asked, as we rode along.
                     "Do not hesitate to tell me, I know the common legend, and should like to
                     correct any wrong impressions you may have."
                  I told the story as I heard it. from Jacobus, only saying that Mr. Harwood had
                     been found there dead, from a pistol shot.
                  "It is partly true and partly false," she remarked, when I had finished. The
                     Densons were almost undoubtedly guilty; but my father rather tried to deliver
                     them from the doom they suffered. They did not threaten Mr. Carr or my father
                     with any unusual calamity; but one of them, the elder, said just before he
                     died: 'We will haunt these Laurels for five years to come, and cheat those
                     cursed Harwoods, yet.' Sometimes I think my father attached some particular
                     meaning to the threat, but he never said so." I expected her to say something
                     about her father's death; but she did not, and I did not dare to ask her then.
                     When we reached the Laurels, she said she wanted to see the scene of Herbert's
                     accident, so we rode through the bushes, which I endeavoured to separate for
                     her passage. I pointed out the places where he had disappeared; where I sought
                     for him; where I found him; and where we landed. We went back to the road, and
                     I held out my hand at parting.
                  "I have said nothing to you, sir," she said, her dear eyes once more
                     overflowing, "about my gratitude. I hope you know that I can never forget what
                     we owe you."
                  "Pray, Miss Harwood, say no more about it. I have great cause of gratitude to
                     God, who allowed me to be instrumental in saving your brother, since youâ€”" I
                     was going to say she might think kindly of me for Herbert's sake; but I
                     stopped. She seemed to understand me, however, but she said nothing; and so we
                     parted.
                  Since I came home I have concluded not to read the letters. It would be
                     dishonourable. She does not know who I am, and she would not have given them to
                     me if she had known my name. I opened the package and looked at the address and
                     signature of the first letter. It is dated "H. M. S. Orpheus, off Malta,
                     December 1, 1800;" and was signed "Herbert Harwood." I therefore know that the
                     letter was written by my grand uncle, and although I was burning with
                     curiosity, I resealed the package, which I shall take back to her to-morrow, if
                     I live. She said she would be at Harwood at four o'clock. So will I. What will
                     come of that interview only Heaven knows. I am resolved toâ€”be guided by
                     circumstances.
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XV.
               KINDRED.
               
                  SATURDAY, May 15, 1836.
               
               WHEN I sat down last night and opened the package of letters, I was in a state of
                  excitement which I can neither understand nor describe. The tones of my dear
                  cousin's voiceâ€”for she is my cousin, I knowâ€”and the light of her
                  eyes, were still with me; and I felt my heartâ€”nay, I feel it at this
                  momentâ€”thumping my ribs, as though it wanted to get out and go after her. I
                  suppose there is something about her forlorn condition as an orphan that excites
                  my sympathy. All the intense curiosity I felt to dive after the mystery that was
                  hidden in the letters, did not keep me from spending a solid hour in recalling all
                  her looks and words. Alas! I can find nothing in them that indicates any interest
                  in me. She regards me, no doubt, as a poor devil of a clerk, who has come to this
                  far off country to make money, and who has been fortunate enough to get some
                  slight claim upon her, by pulling her brother out of the water. This is the exact
                  state of the case, and I were a double distilled goose to suppose anything
                  else.
               The letters were all open, one laid upon another, and I looked only at the date
                  and signature to the top letter. I endeavoured not to see the
                  address; but I think I did see "My dear John." I immediately replaced
                  the wrappers, and adding a new one, I got sealing wax and secured the package,
                  which I addressed to "Miss Henrietta Harwood, Manahio."
               After dinner Mr. White was here, and I asked him if he would be postmaster while I
                  "took a ride." He consented, and I was astride of Charley's horse, and cantering
                  out of town pretty early in the afternoon; of course I was an hour or two too
                  early. When I crossed the creek I looked at my watch, and found it was only two
                  o'clock. Half an hour would take me to Harwood, or to Manahio, either, so I had an
                  hour and a half too much time. I rode on slowly, keeping the main road, and
                  thinking of yesterday's ride, and trying to invent some pretext to take me to
                  Manahio, so that I might accompany Ret in her ride to Harwood; but I was too
                  stupid to concoct an excuse that would satisfy me. I would adhere to my original
                  plan, which was to be at the latter place at about four o'clock. Presently I heard
                  the hoof strokes of a horse behind me; but I did not look back until he was near
                  enough for me to hear the rider sayâ€”
               "Charley Carr's horse! Hello! Hubbard!"
               It was Mr. Maltby.
               "How d' ye do?" he said. "You are going to Highlands to dine with me? That's first
                  rate."
               "I have dined, thank you," replied I; "but I will ride a little way with you. Are
                  you from town?"
               "No, I have been down the creek, trying to survey a little. My land joins Judge
                  Carr's and Harwood, at a point near the creek, and none of us have any fences up.
                  I want to cut some timber, and don't want to cut any of my
                  neighbour's in mistake."
               "Do the lands of the Harwood estate lie on this side of the creek?" I
                  inquired.
               "Yes, a portion of them. Harwood is an original section, and the survey of that
                  estate is perfect. The line crosses the creek at the ford, and I think it just
                  takes in the big laurels."
               "Isn't it a fine estate, Mr. Maltby?"
               "Oh, yes; poor John spent much money in improvements, and was considerably
                  involved when he died. It won't make much difference to the children, however, as
                  Judge Carr holds the mortgage."
               "How much is the mortgage, and what is the value of the estate?"
               "Harwood is worth one hundred thousand dollars. Carr's mortgage is for fifty
                  thousand. He advanced money to John, and I think he also holds bills of sale,
                  giving him the ownership of the niggers, or of part of them. There was some
                  arrangement made, by which one half of the estate should go to Herbert,
                  uninvolved, and Ret won't want any estate, you know, as she is going to marry
                  Charley."
               "But suppose she does not, what estate has she then?"
               "Just none at all, I reckon. But the match has been settled long ago, and it will
                  be first rate on both sides. Ret is a splendid girl, and you know what Charley
                  is."
               "Yes." I tried to keep up an appearance of indifference, but I was on fire. "When
                  does the wedding come off?" I coughed, to hide the trembling of my voice, as I
                  asked the question.
               "Pretty soon, I reckon. Maybe Charley has gone to the city to get his toggery
                  now?" here he looked at me inquiringly.
               "I don't know. He did not tell me."
               
               "I think I'll persuade Carr to settle that mortgage on Charley; for if the Judge
                  bets as high all the time as he did t'other night he'll be flat broke before he
                  dies."
               "I noticed that he was betting pretty high," I said; "ten dollars a game, wasn't
                  it?"
               "Ten dollars a game, and twenty-five on the rub," replied Mr. Maltby, "and he did
                  not win any rubs that night. He must have lost a thousand at least."
               "He must have a strong back to stand many such losses," I observed.
               "Well, I shouldn't wonder if he was short of funds now. He has been going it
                  tolerably strong with Delaney single-handed, and I must say that Delaney has the
                  devil's own luck!" He hesitated, and then added, "look here, youngster, all this
                  is confidential, mind you! D'ye remember last Sunday, when Delaney and I found you
                  after you killed the panther? Wellâ€”he had been playing euchre all the morning with
                  Carr, and must have won like thunder!"
               I looked at my watch and found it was three o'clock, so bidding Mr. Maltby
                  good-bye, I rode back to the creek, and thinking I might overtake or be overtaken
                  by Midnight and her mistress, I pushed on at a good pace. But I reached the long
                  avenue without seeing any traces of her, and concluding that I would go on boldly
                  and wait for her, I fastened my horse near the house. I rang the bell and
                  Aristophanes showed his black visage in a few minutes.
               "Well, Phany, has Miss Ret come yet?"
               "No Mars'râ€”walk in, sar!" and he ushered me into the drawing room. I sat down in
                  the arm chair where she sat yesterday, and tried to resolve to do right. Maltby
                  had made me happy and most miserable. She was poor! Heaven be thanked! But she was
                  soon to be rich by a marriage, which I felt ought not to be solemnized. What
                  should I do? What is my DUTY? I covered my face with my hands, and made a baby of
                  myself.
               "Lor' bless us! Is you sick, young mars'r?" It was Chloe.
               "No, Aunty!" said I, starting up and wiping my eyes, "not very. I have had a
                  dreadful pain just here in my side; it is better now. Don't tell any one that you
                  saw me crying over such a little affair;" and I slipped a dollar into her hand.
                  "How soon do you expect Miss Harwood?"
               "She not gwine to come to-day, sar," she replied. "'Cobus bin here for oberseer to
                  go over dar. Missee Ret sick!"
               "Sick! Good Heavens! How sick?"
               "Only headache, 'Cobus says. S'pose you ride over, sar?"
               "If I could do any goodâ€”pshaw! what a fool I am! here, Aunt Chloe, is a package
                  which Miss Ret gave me yesterday. Where shall I put it? It is important, and I
                  want to put it in a safe place."
               She pulled open a drawer in a secretaire in the room, and I placed the letters in
                  it, closed and locked it, and put the key in my pocket.
               "I will give the key to Miss Ret, Aunty," I said, as I came away; "did Jacobus go
                  to town after doctor Markham?"
               "Lor' no! Mars'râ€”Miss Ret don't want doctor for headache! yah, yah, yah! S'pose I
                  git you somethin' for pain in your side, Mars'râ€”am got some first rate yarb
                  tea!"
               "Never mind, Aunty, I am pretty well now. Good-bye." I got my horse, and gave
                  Phany a quarter as he stood grinning at the gate, andâ€”here I am back again. I am
                  learning a hard lessonâ€”I am learning to wait. Oh for patience, and
                  wisdom, and strength, and manhood!
               SABBATH, May 16, 1836.
               One week ago I was in the green woods at this hour, careless and indifferent about
                  everything except present enjoyment. I was looking forward with a pleasant
                  curiosity to the time when I should know who Ret was and what she was like. What
                  changes one short week has wrought! I am a different man to-day. I am ten-years
                  older. I used to have a theory upon which I reposed with great complacency. It was
                  this: no contingency can occur in which I need be doubtful as to my course, so
                  long as my reason will show me what is honourable and right. And now I am
                  perplexed with doubts. I decide finally upon a course, and give my resolve to the
                  winds an hour later. I find myself saying to myselfâ€”"Let us wait for the
                  emergency, and then it will be time enough to decide." But I hear the church
                  bell.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVI.
               A PARTING.
               
                  
                     MONDAY, May 17, 1836.
                  
                  WHEN I went to the church yesterday I arrived in time to assist Miss Harwood to
                     alight from Judge Carr's carriage. Herbert followed, greeting me warmly, and
                     then Mr. Carr. The latter invited me to sit in his pew. Mr. Hamilton was
                     already in the pulpit. His manner and the tones of his voice attracted me, from
                     the utterance of his first short prayer. His text was "Deny thyself," and I
                     have certainly never heard such a discourse as he delivered. My attention was
                     riveted. I heard every syllable of the sermon, which was spoken, not read, and
                     I could now write down in order the divisions of the discourse, and the
                     arguments and appeals occurring under each head. I believe a profound and
                     salutary impression was made upon my mind, for I no longer feel doubtful or
                     desponding, though I am far from happy. I can wait for the emergency, and think
                     I shall do right when the emergency comes. After the sermon Mr. Hamilton
                     announced that there would be service in the afternoon at "Harwood Chapel,"
                     and, as we came out of the church, Mr. Carr suggested that I should ride out
                     with them, and if I felt disposed, "I could attend the service at the chapel."
                     Herbert seconded the invitation on the instant. I did not accept immediately,
                     waiting for some indication of Miss Harwood's wishes. I did not get it. She
                     looked at me inquiringly, and I accepted, saying I would get Charley's horse
                     and overtake them. I rode beside the carriage, talking and listening. Ret was
                     quiet, answering when spoken to, but volunteering no conversation. When dinner
                     was over she disappeared, and Herbert and I walked about the grounds, he
                     chattering and I smoking. I had observed at dinner that I would go to the
                     chapel if "any of them" were going, and Ret replied that she would go on
                     Midnight. I was impatient for the hour to arrive. It came at last, and we
                     started, she and Iâ€”no groom, for Sunday is the negro's holiday. If I dared to
                     make such a choice, I could wish that my life ended when that ride was over. I
                     was weak enough to be happy while it lasted.
                  "Where is Harwood chapel?" I inquired, as we entered the avenue leading to
                     Harwood.
                  "It is on an edge of the plantation, beyond the house. We go very nearly by the
                     same road as that we passed over the other day. The chapel was built by my
                     father, for the accommodation of the blacks belonging to the three plantations,
                     Manahio, Highlands and Harwood."
                  "Then this afternoon's service is for their benefit?"
                  "Yes, but there is always a good attendance of whites, and they are always
                     particularly welcome."
                  "I hope you have entirely recovered from your indisposition of yesterday?" She
                     looked surprised. "Chloe told me you were sick."
                  "Where did you see Chloe?"
                  "At Harwood. I was there yesterday, hoping to meet you. I took back the
                     letters. The package is in the right hand drawer of the secretaire in the
                     drawing room. Here is the key."
                  "Have you read all these letters?"
                  "I have read none of them. I opened the package and saw that one of the letters
                     was written by Captain Sir Herbert Harwood, of the British navy, and I know
                     that he was the grand uncle of Herbert Harwood, of Baltimore."
                  "I have suspected as much," she replied, taking the key; "but I cannot
                     understand why the knowledge of this relationship decided you to return the
                     letters unread."
                  "Because you were not willing that your relations should know anything or
                        everything that may be revealed in those letters. I could not
                     read them, if I regarded my own honour, because one at least of that family
                     would know all that I could learn from them."
                  "I thought I made an exception of that one member," she said,
                     smiling. "I think if you had read the letters you would have justified my
                     course. However, we will talk about it hereafter. There is the chapel."
                  Half a dozen well dressed negroes surrounded us as we rode up in front of the
                     building, taking possession of the horses, and overwhelming us with polite
                     attentions. Mr. and Mrs. White, Mr. and Mrs. Maltby and Mr. Hamilton were
                     standing apart, in the shade of the trees. We joined them and entered the
                     chapel together. It is a plain building, weather-boarded on the outside and
                     white-washed. The "white folks" occupied the front seats, and the house was
                     soon filled with a well behaved and attentive audience. The singing was
                     positively wonderful, though somewhat marred by the necessity to "line out" the
                     hymns, after the Methodist fashion.
                     The overseer, Beckett, whom I saw playing cards in town the other night, was
                     there, and I caught him eyeing me curiously once or twice. Mr. Hamilton
                     preached a plain, simple and beautiful Gospel sermon, which was understood by
                     the most untutored of his listeners. It was near sunset when we started on our
                     homeward journey, and we rode slowly, enjoying the calm beauty of the early
                     summer. I talked about the discourse of the morning, and expressed my
                     admiration of the minister in very warm terms.
                  "I have enjoyed to-day's sermons very much," she said, "but I did not suppose
                     that a discourse on self-denial would have been considered so appropriate by
                     you."
                  "Ah, you don't know how much I have been strengthened in my better purposes by
                     Mr. Hamilton's teachings this morning. Neither do you know how much I need all
                     the support I can obtain, to keep me in the course of honour and duty."
                  "I do not know, of course, what particular temptations you may be called upon
                     to overcome, and if I did, I am not qualified to counsel you."
                  "Pardon me, Miss Harwood, but you alone can give me the counsel I need. Don't
                     look at me with such an astonished expression, or I shall never find courage to
                     go on. I am reluctant to say what is upon my mind anyhow, because the kindness
                     with which you have listened to me hitherto is due to the slight service I was
                     able to render your brother. Don't interrupt me, please! I mean to say that you
                     would never have allowed the present terms of intimacy to exist between us if
                     it had not been for that fortunate accident."
                  "There are no accidents," she replied.
                  "I am rejoiced to believe it, and I regard your brother's peril, from which I
                     was permitted to rescue him, as the interposition of a kind Providence in
                        my behalf. Otherwise I might never have known you as well as I
                     know you now."
                  "I understand you," she said, gently, "and although you speak slightingly of
                     your instrumentality in saving Herbert, I know from your own description, as
                     well as from his, that you exposed your own life to danger. If another had been
                     there, instead of you, my brother would probably have died. You have spoken
                     very much in riddles about the matter that interests you. May I ask you one or
                     two questions?"
                  "A thousand."
                  "Less than that will do," answered she, laughing. "Suppose you knew that the
                     father of Grace Harwood had been guilty of an act of peculiar infamy, to which
                     he was instigated, and in the performance of which he had been aided by her
                     motherâ€”"
                  "If there is a living man who will dare to say so," I replied, while I
                     struggled fiercely to keep down the raging tempest her words had raised in my
                     bosom, "I will slay him like a dog."
                  "There is no living man that I know of to encounter your sinful anger. The
                     testimony to this sad story comes from the grave."
                  By this time I was perfectly calm. I had reflected, even while she was
                     speaking, and had decided that some strange mystery was to be cleared up. That
                     such a foul charge could be true of the noble gentleman I dimly remembered, or
                     of his widow, my angelic Mother, was simply impossible.
                  "I was excited by your cruel words, doubly cruel coming from you, to speak
                     intemperately. Pray, forgive me. I am perfectly cool now."
                  "I do not blame you," answered Ret; "your anger was natural, considering the
                     relations you sustain to that unhappy family. I think I
                     shall burn that package of lettersâ€”"
                  "I charge you not to do so," said I, interrupting her. "Miss Harwood, do you
                     believe that I am an honest man and a gentleman?"
                  "Undoubtedly I do," she replied, astonished at my vehemence.
                  "Then I implore you to intrust me with those letters once more, and without any
                     restrictions. Nay, let me have them, with the full certainty that every line
                     shall be read by Herbert Harwood, the son of the man whose memory they
                     blacken."
                  "You don't know what you ask. You require me to send unutterable misery into
                     the midst of a family of innocent children. If I had destroyed those papers
                     before I saw you, none of this could have happened."
                  "It is you who are in error," I answered; "you don't know how
                     fatal the mistake would have been if you had destroyed this record. I am young,
                     but I have a man's heart and a man's arm. I will right this dead man's memory
                     and clear the stain upon this living woman's name. I devote myself to this
                     work, body and soul. Oh, if you had known that loyal gentleman! Oh, if you knew
                     that spotless lady! You would then know, as I know, that no infamy could ever
                     attach to their names. It is you, you who shall admit it! I swear
                     it to you before heaven!"
                  
                  "I cannot withstand you," she answered, as we entered the grounds at Manahio,
                     "you shall have the letters, and do with them as your honour and conscience
                     shall dictate. You said just now that I was interested in you on Herbert's
                     account. I am much more interested in you on your own. Oh, I am so
                     sorryâ€”" and I saw the tears in her eyes by the fading light,
                     as I assisted her from the saddle, "I am so sorry that I should
                     have been instrumental in making you unhappy."
                  "If I ever know happiness again, in this life, it will be you who shall confer
                     it upon me. When may I have the letters?"
                  "To-morrowâ€”no, on Tuesday. Mr. and Mrs. Maltby will be here all day to-morrow,
                     and I cannot be absent. Can you wait till Tuesday?"
                  "Yes, yes. I will come for them on Tuesday afternoon, shall I?" and so it was
                     settled. We went into the house. I staid to tea and then rode home in the
                     night.
               
               
                  
                     TUESDAY, May 18th, 1836.
                  
                  I don't know how much time I shall have to write, but while I am waiting for
                     the steamboat, I may as well get as much as I can recorded. Last night there
                     was a mail from New Orleans, and in it a letter from Mr. Bayard for me. He says
                     the loss of the Sea Gull is confirmed, and he wants me to join him on board the
                     "Queen of the West," which he expected to arrive at Carrville some time to
                     night. She is bound for Wheeling or Pittsburg, and I am to go on to Baltimore
                     and New York to collect the insurance and replace the goods. I went over to Mr.
                     White's this morning, and announced my intention to leave Carrville to-night,
                     and begged him to take charge of the Post-office to-day, and let me off. He
                     growled a good deal at the prospect of making up and assorting mails for two
                     months, but set me free soon after breakfast. By ten o'clock I was at Manahio.
                     I found Judge Carr in his library among a huge pile of papers, and accounted
                     for my appearance by saying that I was going to New York, and came to offer my
                     services if I could transact any business for him there. "You said, sir," I
                     observed, "that the letter I brought you the other day could only be answered
                     in person, and I thought I might be able to represent you, if you would like to
                     entrust me with the business." He was evidently pleased with the attention, and
                     expressed himself in polite terms, as under great obligations to me. Selecting
                     the letter from the mass of papers before him, he requested me to read it. It
                     is as follows:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "NEW YORK, May 1, 1836.
                              
                              "DEAR SIR:â€”I have at last got entire control of the mine, and,
                                 according to agreement, I offer you one-fourth interest. The total
                                 cost, with expenses, is about two thousand dollars; your proportion
                                 being, of course, one-fourth of that sum. I am sure the profit will
                                 be good, and it may be enormous. If you accept, let me hear from
                                 you (with remittance) on or before 30th June. I shall not be able
                                 to keep the stock beyond that date.
                              
                                 "Very respectfully yours,
                                 "GEORGE CALLAHAN."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  "Now, Mr. Hubbard, it is not a long story. Mr. Callahan is a stock broker in
                     Wall street. About a year ago I was in New York, and he and two other gentlemen
                     were negotiating for this mine. From his representations I was induced to
                     promise to take a fourth part of it if it should prove as good as they
                     predicted. If I could go there I would be governed by circumstances. If I was
                     not satisfied that the investment was a good one I should not hesitate to
                     decline it; and I would not be misled by the visionary schemes of speculators.
                     Will you, can you spare the time necessary to look thoroughly into the affair?
                     If so, take the letter and act for me according to your judgment."
                  "I will attend to this business with great pleasure, sir," I answered, "and if
                     the money must be paid I shall have control of a sufficient sum from the
                     insurances I am to collect, and you can either settle with me when I return or
                     remit it to New York."
                  "I thank you very much, sir," he replied, rising as I was about to leave him.
                     "I suppose I need not ask you to dine with me, as you say you must hasten back.
                     Good-bye, sir; I hope you will have a pleasant trip, and that we shall soon
                     have you back again."
                  As I rode away I saw Master Herbert with a fishing rod strolling down the
                     drive. I had not asked for his sister, because I intended to go straight to
                     Harwood and wait for her, as I knew she would go there for the letters. I
                     called out to the boy as I approached himâ€”"Hello, cousin Herbert, don't get
                     drowned again to-day; I shall not be able to pull you out. Farewell! I am going
                     North to-night."
                  "When are you coming back?"
                  "In about two months. Is your sister home?"
                  "No. She went to Harwood half an hour ago."
                  
                  "Well, I must be off. Tell Charley good-bye for me."
                  I reckon Charley's horse thought some bad words as he flew along the road to
                     Harwood. I threw the bridle to Jake, who was fastening Midnight to the rack,
                     and walked up on to the verandah, and through the French window into the
                     drawing room. Ret was seated at the secretaire fitting the key to the lock when
                     I entered. She started, and uttered some exclamation when she saw me.
                  "I hope you will pardon me, Miss Harwood, for coming so abruptly, but I am much
                     hurried. I am going away to-night."
                  "Going away!" She pushed the chair back, and looked at me earnestly.
                  "Yes; I start for Baltimore to-nightâ€”on business. I shall be away two months,
                     perhaps longer; I hope you will not forget me."
                  "I shall not forget you," she answered, very quietly.
                  "You will give me the letters?" She opened the drawer and handed me the
                     package. "Thank you. If I never come back I will destroy them. If I do come
                     back I will return them to you."
                  "I understood you to say that you would be back this summer," she said, in the
                     same quiet tone. "Why do you now say you may not return."
                  "Because I will not look upon your face again if I fail to unravel the dark
                     mystery that is hidden in this packet."
                  "There is nothing in the letters that can possibly affect you," said Ret; "if
                     you fail to disprove the things that trouble you, there are many compensations,
                     even in this life, for all its disappointments."
                  "There is more than life involved in these fatal letters. I would rather die a
                     thousand deaths than believe what you say they reveal. But I shall not fail!
                     Farewell! and may you be as happy as I wish you to be. If I am not permitted to
                     see you again, you may perhaps be happier in the reflection that one miserable
                     man is less miserable because he can remember you and your kindness."
                  "Must you go?" she said hurriedly, as I moved away.
                  "Yes. better that I should! Words are trying to break from me that should not
                     be spoken! Will you forgive the presumption if I ask you one question, personal
                     to you alone?" She did not answer, but looked steadily at me. "Well, I will not
                     ask it. I prefer leaving you with a kind expression on your face. Do you wish
                     me to succeed in my effort to make you think as I think of your kindred in
                     Baltimore?"
                  "I will pray for your success every day while you are goneâ€”and also that you
                     may have grace to endure that which you cannot avert or change."
                  She pausedâ€”then said suddenlyâ€”"What did you wish to ask me?"
                  "I heard that you would be married very soon, is it true?"
                  She became pale as a lilyâ€”then blushed very red. I thought she
                        pouted.
                  "I do not expect to be married very soon."
                  "Not this summer?"
                  "Not this summer."
                  "Thank God!" and I rushed out of the house. I wonder if she thinks I am a
                     lunatic.
                  There is the steamboat bell!
               
            
            
               A BUNDLE OF LETTERS.
               
                  LETTER I.
                  
                     H. M. S. ORPHEUS, OFF MALTA, December 1, 1800.
                     
                        TO JOHN HARWOOD, Esqr., London.
                     
                  
                  
                     My dear John:â€”I hear bad news of you, my boy. You and Barnard
                     have been quarrelling again! What shall I say to you, you young lubber? If I
                     could only get at you with a rope's end I should die happy. I know you will
                     have excuses enough, but there can be no satisfactory excuse. How is it that
                     Allen, who has always been a good lad, can avoid these quarrels, while you, you
                     fiery young puppy, are always getting into them? When I was at your age I never
                     had any fights except with my brothers. If I had lived in the same house with
                        cousins I think I should have lived at peace the year round.
                     Your father and Allen's father used to combine forces to thrash me, but they
                     never did it, my boy! I suppose it is all right and natural for brothers to
                     fight a little, but it is heinous for cousins to squabble. Now, just for the
                     sake of argument, let us suppose a case. Suppose it were true that Barnard was
                     always in the wrong, and that you were always in the right? Even then you might
                     consider your aunt's peace of mind,
                     and endure a little for her sake. But I won't scold any more.
                  There is some prospect of relief from this cruising ground for the old Orpheus.
                     I am told that my ship will be ordered home soon, and it is hinted that I shall
                     have sailing orders in another direction. It will be very pleasant to be among
                     you young scamps, even for a few months, and if I have no more ill accounts in
                     the meantime, there will be a grand distribution of guineas at Harwood House
                     when I come! I don't expect this hint to have any salutary effect upon you,
                     however, but just let Barnard know what is in prospect, and perhaps he will
                     behave better. I expect you to keep straight from love to your old
                     uncle. If you are still bent upon your American explorations, I shall not
                     oppose you, though it is a wild goose chase. But youngsters won't
                     learn in any other school than the school of experience.
                  There is a regular Levanter blowing to-day, and the ship is rolling
                     tremendously, so that writing is no easy task. If the wind holds, and I get my
                     orders, I can slip through the straits in a jiffy!
                  
                     Your affectionate uncle,
                     HERBERT HARWOOD.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER II.
                  
                     H. M. S. ORPHEUS, OFF MALTA, December 1, 1800.
                     
                        TO LADY ANNE HARWOOD, London.
                     
                  
                  
                     Dearest Anne:â€”I enclose two letters to the boys, which you will
                     please seal and deliver to them, after possessing yourself of the contents.
                     From your account, I feel sure that Barnard is altogether to blame, and Allen's
                     letter, which I also enclose, strengthens this impression. You will see from my
                     letter to John, that I have hopes of seeing you in a few months, and if the
                     necessary repairs are put upon the ship, I shall perhaps be with you the
                     greater part of next year. I need not tell you, dear wife, that the prospect is
                     very cheering to an old sea dog, who has been knocking and being knocked about
                     the world for two long years, in which time he has been far from home and
                     kindred. The changes in the Government, to which you refer, cannot affect me
                     very materially. If we are going to have a peaceful time, and I am no more to
                     hear the roar of the Orpheus's broadsides, I shall hang up my sword in the
                     library at Harwood House, and retire upon half pay. To tell you the truth, I am
                     concerned about those young whelps at home. John is so violent and impulsive
                     that I am continually expecting to hear of some mad exploit of his that may
                     embitter his whole future life. I know that all his instincts are generous and
                     noble, and if he is properly managed and controlled, he will add honour to the
                     old name. I understand your hint about promotion, &c. Women are always
                     ambitious! But I am entirely indifferent about such vain gewgaws. It is enough
                     to belong to the race from which I sprang, and I really believe I accepted the
                     little title I received with the peaceful stroke of His Majesty's sword only to
                     please you. Sir Herbert Harwood, knight, is no greater personage in my opinion
                     than plain Captain Harwood was; and, as for money, we have more than enough for
                     all probable contingencies. You know my income has nearly doubled since I
                     received my inheritance, and I have been able to lay aside Â¥5,000 for each of
                     the boys and Alice, without impairing my estate one bit. I want this to go to
                     Allen, as good as it was when I received it, and, maybe, far better. Allen does
                     not know anything about my will; of course, you will not tell him. There will
                     be another mail bag in a week or so, by the Chester, and I will write
                     again.
                  
                     Your devoted husband,
                     HERBERT HARWOOD.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER III.
                  
                     LONDON, October 9, 1800.
                     
                        TO CAPTAIN SIR HERBERT HARWOOD, H. M. S. Orpheus, Mediterranean Squadron.
                     
                  
                  
                     My dear Uncle:â€”Aunt Anne does not know that I am writing to you,
                     and I thought you could tell her yourself, if you wish her to know what I write
                     about. I have been here about two weeks; all the rest are at Harwood House, and
                     I shall be able to get back in a few days. Dear Uncle, I am sorry to say that
                     Barnard and John don't get along together at all, and I wish now that you had
                     carried out your plan, and sent them to different schools. I don't care which
                     one goes with me, but I hope you won't send us all three together. Barnard has
                     got Aunt Anne's permission to go
                     down to Scotland to shoot. He was invited by the young Laird I wrote you about
                     last month, Macailan, of Linmuir. You know his place is somewhere near Glasgow.
                     Uncle, he is another bad fellow, and a great deal worse because he has plenty
                     of pocket money. He and Barnard are very intimate, and I think Alice likes this
                     Scotchman very much. I don't believe Aunt Anne will tell you about the last
                     quarrel between John and Barnard. It was all on account of Macailan, who came
                     in to dinner one day quite drunk! He is only seventeen or eighteen, though he
                     is a big fellow. Aunt Anne had Lord and Lady Morton to dinner that day, and
                     John tried to persuade the other boys to stay in their rooms, as they were not
                     fit to be seen in respectable society. He offered to stay with them, and so did
                     I. Macailan swore at us dreadfully, and said he meant to "walk down with Leddy
                     Morton, who was na fit to be married to sic an auld pike as my Lord." Barnard
                     encouraged him, and told John he was a low fellow, and not a proper person to
                     associate with gentlemen. I managed to get John away that time, but after
                     dinner he and Barnard had it out. Macailan behaved so improperly at the table,
                     that Aunt Anne had to reprove him, and at last told Barnard "to take Mr.
                     Macailan out with him, as he was evidently not well." We were all four out in
                     the park in the evening, and before we came in John had thrashed both of them.
                     The Scotchman could not use his fists at all, but Barnard fought pretty well.
                     John is such a tiger when he is in a rage that all the school boys are afraid
                     of him; but he is not a bit quarrelsome, and only had four fights last half. I
                     had more than that myself.
                  I don't think Aunt Anne will allow Barnard to invite his friend to Harwood
                     House any more. It surprises me that Alice should see anything to admire in
                     him; but she accompanies him and Barnard on all sorts of expeditions, whenever
                     Aunt Anne will allow her to go. I wish you would not send me any more cheques,
                     dear Uncle, until I ask you for them. I have more money now than I know what to
                     do with. If you had not forbidden it, I should like to divide my surplus cash
                     between John and Barnard; but Alice is my banker, and she has ever so many
                     guineas of mine now stowed away for hard times.
                  
                     Your affectionate nephew,
                     ALLEN HARWOOD.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER IV.
                  
                     LONDON, November 1, 1800.
                     
                        TO MASTER BARNARD HARWOOD, Linmuir, near Glasgow, Scotland.
                     
                  
                  
                     Sir:â€”I see no impropriety in answering the questions you put in
                     your letter of 15th ultimo. There is no need to mark communications of this
                     sort "private and confidential," inasmuch as all letters addressed to lawyers
                     upon private business are so regarded. There is no entail. Sir Herbert has full
                     control of his property. If, however, he should die without a will, the estate,
                     or that portion of it which your uncle received by inheritance, would descend,
                     first, to your cousin Allen, next to your cousin John, and lastly to yourself.
                     You young gentlemen occupy precisely the same position with regard to the
                     estate as that occupied by your respective fathers. Lady Harwood's annuity
                     would probably absorb about one-half of the revenues. In regard to Miss Alice
                     More, there has never been any formal and legal adoption, and I presume Sir
                     Herbert's will would make provision for her. She is the daughter of a brother
                     officer of Captain Harwood's, who was killed in battle, when both he and
                     Captain Harwood were lieutenants. She has no inheritance whatever, that I know
                     of. If Sir Herbert had made a will, and the instrument was in my charge, you
                     are aware that I could not with propriety reveal to any one any of its
                     provisions.
                  
                     I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
                     TITUS PARCHMENT,
                     Solicitor, &c.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER V.
                  
                     H. M. S. ORPHEUS, OFF MALTA, December 10, 1800.
                     
                        TO LADY ANNE HARWOOD, London.
                     
                  
                  
                     My dear Anne:â€”I have only time to write a line by the Chester,
                     and that is to announce that the Orpheus follows in her wake. I received my
                     orders to-day, and shall set sail for old England tomorrow. The Chester will
                     beat us a week or more. I shall go direct to London, and thence to Harwood
                     House. If these plaguey orders had only come a month sooner, I might have eaten
                     Christmas dinner with you.
                  
                     Your devoted husband,
                     HERBERT HARWOOD.
                  
               
               
                  
                  LETTER VI.
                  
                     LONDON, D.
                     
                        TO BARNARD HARWOOD, Esq., Linmuir, near
                     
                  
                  
                     Sir:â€”I am not in possession of any information in regard to a
                     settlement of Â¥5,000 upon you or upon Miss More. If Sir Herbert has made, or
                     intends to make any such settlement, he has kept the matter entirely to
                     himself. I would respectfully suggest, if you deem it advisable and proper to
                     institute an investigation on this subject, that you direct your inquiries to
                     your uncle himself. While your motives may be perfectly justifiable, you at
                     least lay yourself liable to unfavourable impressions, produced upon the minds
                     of your friends, by your continued attempts to obtain the information you want,
                     outside of your own family.
                  
                     I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
                     TITUS PARCHMENT,
                     Solicitor, &c.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER VII.
                  
                     LONDON, December 20, 1800.
                     
                        TO BARNARD HARWOOD, Esq., Linmuir, near Glasgow, Scotland.
                     
                  
                  
                     Sir:â€”We never reveal the condition of any of our accounts to
                     second parties. Should Sir Herbert Harwood desire to know the balance in our
                     hands, he must, under our invariable rules, apply to us directly, or through
                     his known solicitor, Titus Parchment, Esq.
                  
                     We are, sir, very respectfully, yours,
                     CARY, BULLION & Co.,
                     Bankers.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER VIII.
                  
                     HARWOOD HOUSE, December 21, 1800.
                     
                        TO BARNARD HARWOOD, Esq., Linmuir, near Glasgow, Scotland.
                     
                  
                  
                     Dear Barnard:â€”We are all surprised, and some of us grieved, that
                     you should decide to be absent at Christmas. Mother thinks it possible that
                     father may be home, as we know that his ship has been ordered to Portsmouth.
                     Lord Morton says he may be here any day now. I burnt your letter to me, as you
                     requested. Are you sure that you know your own heart on that subject? I am too
                     old for you, Barnard; five years older than you are, and you are only fifteen.
                     If it were possible to get your uncle's consent to such a marriage, you would
                     have to wait at least six years, and then I would be twenty-six. I do love you
                     very dearly, certainly, but I have never thought of you as a possible husband.
                     Do you know that I shall have positively no fortune at all? My poor father had
                     nothing but his pay, and all that I have had since his death I have received
                     from my second father, Sir Herbert. It is possible that he would give me a
                     portion, if I married with his consent, but I am sure he would think your
                     proposal to engage yourself to me nothing else than insanity. I am not mistaken
                     about the Â¥5,000 laid aside for you and your cousins. I saw one of father's
                     letters, in which he said he had put this sum away for each of you. You will
                     have to return to us before long, as your uncle will certainly be home within a
                     month. We will talk further about your absurd proposals when you come.
                  
                     Affectionately yours,
                     ALICE MORE.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER IX.
                  
                     LONDON, June 1, 1801.
                     
                        TO SIR HERBERT HARWOOD, Bart., Harwood House, Essex.
                     
                  
                  
                     Dear Sir Herbert:â€”I am very happy to address you under your new
                     title, which, I see by the papers, has at last been conferred upon you. You
                     will allow an old friend to say that he is disappointed. I expected you to
                     change your knighthood for something better than a baronetcy. However, it may
                     be only a stepping stone. I have obeyed your instructions, and have taken a
                     thousand shares of Wheal Pentland in the name of your nephew, Mr. Allen
                     Harwood. Your cheque for Â¥5,000 exactly pays for the stock. I hope his trip to
                     Corn wall has not damaged his intellect. Though as you require me to keep the
                     secret of this investment, perhaps he don't know how rich he is to be. I have
                     filed the certificate with your other papers in my possession. Will you allow
                     me to say (in confidence) that your nephew, Barnard, will be all the better for
                     your presence in England, if you will keep him out of bad company?
                  
                     Faithfully your friend and servant,
                     TITUS PARCHMENT.
                  
               
               
                  
                  LETTER X.
                  
                     NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA, May 1, 1803.
                     
                        TO LADY ANNE HARWOOD, Harwood House, Essex.
                     
                  
                  
                     My dear Anne:â€”We are back in this Frenchified city, after a
                     regular cruise up the muddy river on which it stands. John is so infatuated
                     that he declares his desire to remain here all his life. I have been with him I
                     don't know how far up the river, and have bought him a lot of land back in the
                     country. It is pretty much wilderness now, and I must admit that it is very
                     beautiful. He has called it "Harwood." It has cost a good lot of money, though
                     the property dealers here say it was a great bargain. I have consented to let
                     him remain here, as he is so eager to begin to work his "plantation."
                     By-the-bye, John is an American citizen by birth, you know. I wonder if that
                     will account for his preference for this half-civilized country! My poor
                     brother, who was sent to Canada on some public business, contracted the disease
                     of which he died in that cold latitude, and his wife died in the States when
                     John was born. John has resumed his law studies, and will remain in this city
                     most of his time, until he passes his examination. He expects to be "admitted"
                     in two years. There are not so many formalities to get through with, and I
                     suppose the examination is not so rigid here as at home. The birth of my son
                     and heir has not affected the prospects of any of the boys, except Allen, who
                     has a small fortune already, though he does not know it. Do you remember that
                     he came from Cornwall two years ago, with flaming accounts of some copper
                     mines? I invested his Â¥5,000 in mining stock, and it has more than doubled in
                     value already. I intend to keep this secret till all of them are of age. I
                     suppose I shall have to give up my project of getting Barnard into the Navy, as
                     he seems to have no bias in that direction. But as he has become so steady and
                     well behaved he shall choose his own profession. If the predictions of the
                     knowing ones of New Orleans may be relied upon, John's fortune is also made, as
                     the prospective value of his estate up the river is enormous.
                  I am happy to hear such good accounts of my youngster, the future Sir Charles.
                     Since I have acquired a title to transmit, I may as well give it to the embryo
                     baronet in advance. I hope he will value it as lightly as his father does.
                  
                     Your devoted husband,
                     HERBERT HARWOOD.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER XI.
                  
                     
                        LONDON, July 10, 1804.
                        
                           TO SIR HERBERT HARWOOD, Bart., Harwood House, Essex.
                        
                     
                     
                        My dear Sir Herbert:â€”With this I send by special messenger the
                        lead-covered box containing the ancient coins and jewelry; the box has
                        probably never been opened since it was bequeathed to Mr. Allen's mother
                        until to-day, when I took an inventory of its contents. Some of the diamonds
                        must be of great value, and the coins are also very rare and would fetch
                        double their weight in guineas any day. You will remember that the box was
                        sent to me from the executors of Lady Denham, for transmission to Mrs. Lacy
                        Harwood, who died before the packet was sent. Since that sad event I have
                        had charge of it, keeping it by your directions as guardian, until Mr. Allen
                        should attain his majority. The only other property belonging to the estate
                        of Lacy Harwood, Esq., or rather to his son and heir, Mr. Allen, is the
                        certificate of 1,000 shares of Wheal Pentland. I have enclosed this
                        certificate in the box also, with the inventory of jewels and coins. The key
                        is fastened to one of the handles, and the box has been sewed up in a strong
                        linen case by Mrs. Parchment under my supervision. I have also inclosed it
                        in thick outside wrappings, corded it and sealed it. If you receive it with
                        the seals intact, you can rely upon the safety of the contents.
                     
                        Very sincerely, your friend and obed't serv't,
                        TITUS PARCHMENT.
                     
                  
                  
                     (The following was written in Sir Herbert's hand at the bottom of this
                        letter:)
                     I have not opened the box. It is on the hypothenuse just nine feet from its
                        juncture with the base.
                     
                        HERBERT HARWOOD.
                        April 30, 1808.
                     
                  
               
               
                  LETTER XII.
                  
                     NEW ORLEANS, May 10, 1808.
                     
                        TO LADY ANNE HARWOOD, Harwood House, Essex, England.
                     
                  
                  
                     My dearest Anne:â€”Allen and I will return to England by the next
                     packet. John is fairly settled on his plantation, living in a comfortable log
                     house, which he affirms to be superior in accommodation to all the buildings in
                     this city. He is practising law, and
                     is very popular with his neighbours. I have not bought a plantation for Allen,
                     as I cannot discover that he has the slightest desire to possess one. He has
                     enjoyed himself as much as possible, with John and his friends, hunting wild
                     beasts in the country back of "Harwood," and narrowly escaping with his life in
                     two separate encounters, one with a bear, the other with an Indian. The latter
                     adventure however happened on the west bank of the big river. He shall tell you
                     and Alice the story himself. I have kept the secret of his little fortune from
                     him, and everybody else excepting you and Parchment. I wished him to come to
                     some decision about his future before I put him in possession. I think this is
                     the last trip I shall take in this direction. I was compelled by circumstances
                     to put Allen's lead-covered box in a place of security, and have made a
                     memorandum on Parchment's letter, which I will explain to you when I get
                     home.
                  If you should be correct in your suspicion that Macailan wishes to marry Alice,
                     I shall be glad to give my consent. The lad has become quite steady, and with a
                     good wife like Alice (who is too old for him, though), he will become settled.
                     I take it for granted that Barnard has given up his boyish notion. The birth of
                     my two boys has made some change necessary in my intentions, but I still
                     propose to give Barnard a good start in life. He is quite old enough now to
                     make up his mind.
                  
                     Your devoted husband,
                     HERBERT HARWOOD.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER XIII.
                  
                     LINMUIR, August 1, 1808.
                     
                        TO LADY ANNE HARWOOD, Harwood House, Essex.
                     
                  
                  
                     My Lady:â€”Can you spare dear Alice for a few weeks? I have set my
                     heart upon having her with me while the young gentlemen are here. Macailan
                     expects Mr. Barnard about the middle of the month. If he comes, and you can
                     oblige me so much, he can escort Miss More. I would offer my son's services, as
                     he is now in London, but suppose you would prefer the other arrangement. I will
                     promise to allow her to return at whatever time your ladyship may appoint.
                  
                     I am your ladyship's servant,
                     HESTER MACAILAN.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER XIV.
                  
                     LONDON, August 3, 1808.
                     
                        TO BARNARD HARWOOD, Esq., Harwood House, Essex.
                     
                  
                  
                     Mon Cher:â€”My mother is going to invite Miss Alice to Linmuir, and
                     as I am so disreputable a scamp she will arrange for you to attend her to
                     Glasgow. You are to go down on the 15th. I have not been able to learn anything
                     from the old wretch of a lawyer. Denham was with me when I called on him. He
                     was speering about some lead-covered box which was left by will to your dear
                     Uncle Lacy's widow by his stepmother. Denham is such a close fellow that I
                     could not pump much out of him, but I think he claims some jewels, which he
                     affirms were in the box, and which he says were "family jewels," and not in her
                     power to bequeath. The lawyer gave us no satisfaction; he did not even admit
                     the receipt of the box, and referred Denham to his mother's executors. From the
                     few hints he dropped, I conclude that Denham was about as fond of his
                     stepmother as the devil is of holy water, or as you are of your cousin John.
                     Sir Herbert and your nice cousin Allen will be here in a week, and old
                     Parchment politely invited me to reserve my inquiries till they arrived!
                  I am off to Linmuir to-morrow.
                  
                     Yours,
                     MACAILAN.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER XV.
                  
                     LONDON, August 4, 1808.
                     
                        TO LADY ANNE HARWOOD, Harwood House, Essex.
                     
                  
                  
                     My dear Lady Anne:â€”Although Sir Herbert will be here in a few
                     days, I think it advisable to notify you that I have been applied to by the son
                     of Sir Mark Denham, who claims some property (personal) which was bequeathed to
                     Mrs. Lacy Harwood by Lady Denham, the stepmother of this young man. It is
                     possible that he may apply to you in Sir Herbert's absence, and I only wish to
                     say that the claim is entirely ridiculous. It is well known that Sir Mark
                     Denham married his second wife solely for money, and it is also well known that
                     every pound of her property was settled upon her. I drew the marriage
                     settlement myself. There has never been any controversy about her real estate,
                     which went to her heir-at-law, or
                     about her money, stocks, etc., which were distributed according to the
                     provisions of her will. Nobody knew anything about the contents of this
                     particular box until I opened it at Sir Herbert's request, about four years
                     ago. It is as clearly Allen's property as his coat is. If this young Denham
                     should apply to you, I would respectfully advise that you give him no
                     information whatever. I can imagine no possible way by which he could learn
                     that the box contained any articles of value except through Sir Herbert or some
                     member of his household. Should Sir Herbert go to Harwood House before I see
                     him, please show him this letter.
                  
                     With great respect, your ladyship's obedient servant,
                     TITUS PARCHMENT,
                     Solicitor, etc.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER XVI.

                     Sir:â€”In reply to your inquiry, left at our banking house last
                     night, we have to inform you that the exact balance standing at your credit is
                     Â¥11,080 18s. 4d.

                     Sir:â€”Your cheque for Â¥1,000 to order of Mr. Allen Harwood was
                     presented by that gentleman yesterday and paid. According to our invariable
                     rule, we hereby notify you that your account is overdrawn to the amount of Â¥224
                        6s. 8d. The dividends that will be paid in on 1st
                     proximo will, however, place your account largely in credit.
                  
                     Very respectfully yours,
                     CARY, BULLION & CO.,
                     Bankers.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER XVIII.
                  
                     LONDON, September 28, 1808.
                     
                        TO SIR HERBERT HARWOOD, Bart., Harwood House, Essex.
                     
                  
                  
                     My dear Uncle:â€”The ship will sail this forenoon, and I write this
                     on board. I have drawn the money for the cheque, and have it now buckled around
                     my waist. As soon as we get fairly out at sea I shall place it in my trunk, as
                     the weight of the belt makes it a very undesirable part of my dress. My dear,
                     kind uncle, I may not live to see you again, and I would not willingly die
                     without saying how deeply I feel all your kindness to me. I know from Aunt Anne
                     that you intended me to be your successor in the possession of Harwood House
                     and of most of the fortune you have added to your original inheritance. I know
                     you will believe me when I say that I rejoice with all my heart that those
                     plans of yours were disarranged by the birth of my dear little cousins, Charles
                     and Allen. And now I am going to communicate an old secret to you. You know
                     that I accumulated a considerable quantity of guineas in the hands of my trusty
                     banker, Alice; well, after I came from Cornwall, seven years ago, I took this
                     money and invested it all in Wheal Pentland. I sold out yesterday, and there is
                     another thousand pounds in my belt, besides your munificent gift. So you see,
                     dear uncle, that I am rich. I tell you the secret now because I know you will
                     be better satisfied to allow your estate to go to the boys unincumbered with
                     any unnecessary legacies. Barnard told me you had laid aside a sum for each of
                     us, but as I am already provided for so amply, you can mark me off. You cannot
                     obliterate the lessons I have learned from your example, uncle, nor can you
                     take back the education you have given me.
                  What do you think of my having a young lady confided to my care, all the way to
                     Calcutta? She is the orphan daughter of a dissenting minister, who died here
                     six or eight months ago. She has an uncle in India, who has invited her to his
                     home, and her friends here are now in the cabin with her. They introduced me a
                     little while ago. She is very pretty and interesting, and I mean to fall in
                     love with her during the voyage. Her name is Miss Devere.
                  I am just informed that the steamboat is about to leave the ship. Good-bye, my
                     dear uncle.
                  
                     Your attached nephew,
                     ALLEN HARWOOD.
                  
               
               
                  
                  LETTER XIX.
                  
                     LONDON, October 3, 1808.
                     
                        TO LADY ANNE HARWOOD, Harwood House, Essex.
                     
                  
                  
                     My dear Anne:â€”I have only time to write a line. It is a forgery
                     of one cheque for Â¥10,000. I start for Scotland by the coach in five
                     minutes.
                  
                     Your devoted husband,
                     HERBERT HARWOOD.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER XX.
                  
                     GLASGOW, October, 10, 1808.
                     
                        TO LADY ANNE HARWOOD, Harwood House, Essex.
                     
                  
                  
                     My dear Wife:â€”The news I have to communicate to you will plunge
                     you into affliction. I cannot doubt any longer that Barnard and Alice have
                     conspired to perpetrate a most infamous crime. When I reached London last week
                     I went directly to the bank, and demanded a sight of the cheques I had drawn
                     since they furnished me with their last statement. All were right excepting one
                     for Â¥10,000. This cheque was a remarkably correct imitation of my hand, and I
                     should not think of doubting the signature if I did not know that I had never
                     drawn such a cheque. It is payable to Barnard Harwood's order, and endorsed by
                     him. I asked no questions at the bank, but went directly to Parchment and
                     stated the case. He recommended me to start at once for Glasgow, and recover
                     the money from my nephew, without making any stir. It would kill me if the
                     boy's villany should be generally known. I met Mr. Macailan at the coach office
                     in this town, and he informed me that Barnard and Alice were married before
                     they arrived at Linmuir together;â€”that they had gone to London after spending a
                     few days with them, and had taken passage for Leghorn. He knew nothing about
                     Barnard's supply of money, except that he declined a loan which the Scotchman
                     says he offered him. Barnard told him that he could not live without Alice, and
                     that I had violently opposed their union, so they were forced to abscond.
                  How much of this account is true I cannot determine. I know that part of it is
                     false. Lord Morton has been here just a week, and he saw Barnard and talked
                     with him since his arrival at Glasgow gow. He informs me that Barnard and Alice
                     were staying at the same inn with him. I have been there and found his
                     portfolio, containing a number of letters. I suppose he left it in the hurry of
                     his departure. I shall remain a few days, and if I discover no satisfactory
                     traces of them I intend to return to London and get Parchment to put one of his
                     bloodhounds on the scentâ€”only to discover the whereabouts of the unhappy pair,
                     however. I shall acknowledge the cheque. They have only stolen that which I
                     have long intended to give them; but their heartless disregard of you and me,
                     and of the name they bear, cuts me to the quick.
                  
                     Your devoted husband,
                     HERBERT HARWOOD.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER XXI.
                  
                     
                        LONDON, December 2, 1808.
                        
                           TO SIR HERBERT HARWOOD, Bart., Harwood House, Essex.
                        
                     
                     
                        My dear Sir Herbert:â€”My clerk, Mr. Blinker, has just returned
                        from Scotland, and I hasten to lay before you the result of his
                        investigations, premising that you may rely upon the accuracy of his
                        statements, and the soundness of his deductions. My instructions to him,
                        which have been faithfully observed, precluded the possibility of exciting
                        any suspicions upon the minds of the parties with whom he came in contact;
                        and now that the facts are elicited, there is no reason to suppose that any
                        one will ever hear of the transactions, excepting those immediately
                        concerned. I have instructed Mr. Blinker to furnish me with a written
                        statement of his proceedings, and I now enclose that statement. You have
                        only to account for your nephew's marriage and absence from England, and I
                        presume you have already decided to allow the simple truth on this point to
                        go to the world, namely: that your nephew, having married contrary to your
                        express wishes, has gone abroad with his bride, having received
                        the portions you had laid aside for both himself and your adopted
                        daughter.
                     
                        I am, my dear Sir Herbert, very faithfully your friend and
                           servant,
                        TITUS PARCHMENT.
                     
                  
                  
                     P. S.â€”I beg you to observe that I have taken my son, Alfred Parchment, into
                        partnership, as indicated in the annexed circular. In any emergency, during
                        my absence from London, you may safely intrust to him any business that
                        would be confided to his father.
                  
               
               
                  
                  LETTER XXII.
                  
                     
                        TO TITUS PARCHMENT, Esq., Solicitor, &c., London.
                     
                  
                  
                     Honoured Sir:â€”In re, Sir H. H.
                     and others. Acting under your instructions (verbal), I have obtained all the
                     information you required concerning the payment of a cheque for Â¥10,000 drawn
                     by the aforesaid Sir H. H. to the order of, and endorsed by Mr. B. H., and also
                     concerning the subsequent movements of the said B. H and others.
                  My brother, Silas Blinker, is a clerk in the banking house of C. B. & Co.,
                     and as it was necessary that I should obtain the facts without asking questions
                     to excite suspicions, I was compelled to spend two consecutive evenings at my
                     brother's house, and allow him to reveal voluntarily all that I now proceed to
                     communicate. I was also obliged to lay three separate wagers (in a friendly
                     way), and to lose all three, involving an outlay of eighteen shillings. This
                     amount and other small amounts you will find in the enclosed schedule of
                     expenses.
                  On the fifteenth day of August, of the present year, Sir H. H.'s coach stopped
                     at the banking house before mentioned, at 11.10 A. M. Five shillings were
                     expended in the wager relating to the accuracy of this date. Mr. B. H.
                     descended from the coach, leaving Miss A. M. inside, and entering the front
                     office, presented the cheque, remarking that he was in haste, as he wished to
                     catch the Oxford mail, which started precisely at noon. The cheque was paid as
                     soon as he had written his name across the back. The other thirteen shillings
                     were expended in two wagers, one as to the identity of Miss A. M., and the
                     other as to the fact that there was no Oxford mail that left the city at noon.
                     There was a mail to Unbridge, which started from the Red Ox Inn at that hour. I
                     went on the third day direct to Glasgow, according to your directions, stopping
                     only once, at Dumfries, where I saw the marriage of B. H. and A. M. duly
                     registered, according to the Scotch law, under date of August 19th, 1808. I put
                     up at the Thistle Inn, in Glasgow, at which place. Mr. and Mrs. B. H. had spent
                     ten days, namely: from the 25th of September to the 5th of October. They had
                     been to the wild country called "the Highlands" for nearly a month previously,
                     and had spent three days at Linmuir, before they came to the Thistle. They went
                     from Glasgow to Liverpool, and took passage and sailed in the ship Tempest, for
                     Baltimore, in the United States of North America. The ship sailed on the 11th
                     of October.
                  The most of this information I obtained from the agent of a Scotch gentleman,
                     who lives near Glasgow, and although I asked no questions whatever,
                        he asked a great number of me, and the evidence in the case I
                     was obliged to gather from the inquiries he propounded. As I was careful to
                     corroborate everything by additional testimony, you may rely upon the facts
                     stated.
                  
                     
                        This 2d day of December, 1808.
                     
                     Very respectfully your humble servant,
                     SAMUEL BLINKER.

                     LONDON, March 26, 1810.
                     
                        TO SIR HERBERT HARWOOD, Bart., Harwood House, Essex.
                     
                  
                  
                     My dear Friend:â€”It is my painful duty to communicate to you
                     intelligence of the most sorrowful character. Your noble nephew, Allen, is no
                     more. The account of the circumstances attending his death I have obtained from
                     the master of the ill-fated ship in which he sailed for Calcutta. I know that
                     you have long been ill at case, as no news of this vessel has reached England
                     since she was spoken off the Cape, more than a year ago. She was attacked in
                     March of last year by a French privateer, and escaped capture after an
                     obstinate fight of several hours' duration. She carried four guns, and the men
                     fought with a valour becoming British seamen. One of the masts of the privateer
                     was at last carried away by a fortunate shot, and the Indiaman escaped in the
                     darkness of the night. But poor Allen had been very severely and probably
                     fatally wounded early in the action, and when the storm arose in the night, he
                     was lying helpless in the cabin, apparently near his end. The ship had been
                     much damaged by the Frenchman's shot, and was altogether unseaworthy, when the
                     master and crew decided to abandon her in the boats, as she was evidently
                     sinking. A young lady passenger, a Miss Devere, refused to leave the wreck
                     unless Allen was also taken, and from the shipmaster's account, the two boats,
                     all they had that could live in that sea, were already overladen. He also
                     refused to forsake the ship, and the crew, probably mutinous, had pushed off and left the
                     three to their fate. Later in the night, when the storm had somewhat abated, he
                     was able, with the young lady's assistance, to lower the small boat, into which
                     he managed, with great difficulty, to get some water and provisions. He says he
                     was in the boat stowing the kegs, when a sea struck her, and parted the line by
                     which the boat was fastened to the ship. By the time he had got out his oars he
                     had lost the ship in the darkness. The brave fellow endeavoured to keep near
                     the vessel until daylight, when he could find no vestige of the Hesperus in
                     sight. He admits that he might have drifted to a considerable distance from the
                     wreck in the night, but says positively that she must have gone down within a
                     few hours after he left her side. He was picked up three days afterwards by the
                     same privateer, and was compelled to do an ordinary seaman's duty on board,
                     until a few months ago, when the privateer was captured by a British
                     man-of-war. He came to London from Portsmouth only yesterday, and was brought
                     to me by Lord Morton this morning.
                  There are two facts connected with this melancholy story that afford some
                     slight gleam of comfort. As soon as the character of the privateer was
                     ascertained. Allen was the first to propose a determined resistance; and
                     volunteering to assume any post that the master deemed him competent to fill,
                     he was given command of one of the guns, and fought with the bravery of a lion,
                     until he was carried senseless into the cabin. He fell, my dear friend, as you
                     would have him fall, fighting the enemies of his country. The other fact is,
                     that the intercourse of five or six months had produced a profound mutual
                     attachment between Allen and Miss Devere. This young lady must have been a very
                     superior woman, well worthy of the devotion of such a man as Allen. Consider,
                     my friend, that while we have been so sadly bereaved,
                        they went through the dark valley together.
                  
                     With great sympathy your friend,
                     TITUS PARCHMENT.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER XXIV.
                  
                     LONDON, April 1, 1810.
                     
                        TO JOHN HARWOOD, Esq., Baton Rouge, Louisiana, U. S. America.
                     
                  
                  
                     Dear Sir:â€”I am requested by Sir Herbert Harwood to write to you
                     in his name, to inform you of the sudden death of your aunt, Lady Harwood, and
                     also of the loss of the ship Hesperus on her voyage to India, with all her
                     passengers and crew, excepting the master of the vessel. Your cousin, Allen
                     Harwood, was passenger in this ship. Lady Harwood's health has been failing for
                     some time past, and the intelligence of Allen's death probably hastened her
                     demise. Under this double affliction Sir Herbert is nearly inconsolable. He has
                     just been offered the command of a ship, and I have no doubt he will accept the
                     position. There is no probability that the war will terminate for years to
                     come, and Sir Herbert will find in the active duties of his old profession the
                     most agreeable deliverance from the scenes of his recent sorrows. He desires me
                     to convey to you the assurance of his affection. If he accepts his appointment,
                     he proposes to leave his little boys under the joint guardianship of Mr. Titus
                     Parchment and
                  
                     Your obedient servant,
                     MORTON.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER XXV.
                  
                     LONDON, November 14, 1810.
                     
                        TO JOHN HARWOOD, Esq., Baton Rouge, Louisiana, U. S. America.
                     
                  
                  
                     My dear Sir:â€”Captain Sir Herbert Harwood died on 30th ultimo, of
                     wounds received in a naval engagement, off Cape de la Hogue. By his will I am
                     instructed to send you his writing desk and contents, which will go by the
                     packet that sails from Liverpool to New Orleans on 20th instant. I am inclined
                     to think that Sir Herbert had a presentiment of his approaching death, from the
                     papers I find since I have entered upon my duties as executor. The present
                     baronet, Sir Charles, and his brother, are with Lady Morton in Devonshire.
                     Please acknowledge the receipt of the writing desk. If you happen to know the
                     address of your cousin Barnard, who has never been heard from since his
                     marriage and departure for Leghorn, will you please inform him of the death of
                     your lamented uncle? I have sealed up the desk, and know nothing of its
                     contents.
                  
                     Very sincerely your obedient servant,
                     MORTON.
                  
               
               
                  
                  LETTER XXVI.
                  
                     LINMUIR, NEAR GLASGOW, February 6, 1811.
                     
                        TO JOHN HARWOOD, Esq., Baton Rouge, Louisiana, U. S. A.
                     
                  
                  
                     Sir:â€”I received your communication dated December 26, 1810, and
                     have at last concluded to notice it. I am, however, at a loss to conceive by
                     what right you have addressed me on this subject, or any other. I know nothing
                     whatever of the movements of Mr. Barnard Harwood. He told me, the last time I
                     saw him, that he was going to Leghorn. He may have gone there, or to the
                     States, or to the devil, which is about the same thing, in my opinion. As you
                     appear to have adopted that contemptible country, you will probably not agree
                     with me.
                  
                     Yours,
                     HECTOR MACAILAN, of Linmuir.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER XXVII.
                  
                     LONDON, 14th May, 1811.
                     
                        TO JOHN HARWOOD, Esq., Baton Rouge, Louisiana, U. S. A.
                     
                  
                  
                     Dear Sir:â€”In looking carefully over the memoranda left by my
                     father, who was very methodical and precise, I can find nothing about the box
                     you mention, excepting the following entries in his "estate book." I give you
                     the entries entire:
                  "June 8th, 1785. Received of William Lipscomb and Thomas Dale, executors of
                     Lady Denham, widow of Sir Mark Denham, Kt., one box, covered with sheet lead,
                     contents unknown, for transfer to Mrs. Lacy Harwood, widow, to whom said box
                     was bequeathed by said Lady Denham."
                  "June 10th, 1785. Mrs. Lacy Harwood died at Harwood House on 8th instant. I am
                     directed by Sir Herbert Harwood, Kt., and Captain R. N., to retain the box in
                     my possession, it being now the property of Allen Harwood, infant son of Mrs.
                     Lacy Harwood, deceased."
                  "July 10th, 1804. Sent the above mentioned box to Sir Herbert Harwood, Bart.,
                     by the hands of Samuel Blinker, having taken inventory of contents by Sir
                     Herbert's directions. Inventory enclosed in the box with other papers belonging
                     to Allen Harwood, Esq."
                  These are all the memoranda on the subject. In regard to any claim that may be
                     set up by Mr. Mark Denham, I happen to know that all the property, real and
                     personal, of Lady Denham, was entirely at her own disposal, and could not have
                     been inherited by her stepson, even if there had been no will.
                  
                     I am, sir, very respectfully yours,
                     ALFRED PARCHMENT,
                     Solicitor, etc.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER XXVIII.
                  
                     BALTIMORE, May 11, 1811.
                     
                        TO JOHN HARWOOD, Esq., Baton Rouge, La.
                     
                  
                  
                     Dear Sir:â€”There is no such person as Barnard Harwood residing in
                     this city, nor has there been for the past ten years, unless he moved in the
                     humblest circles. I have examined the marine lists for the year 1808, and no
                     ship of the name you mention entered our port in that year. Please remit me
                     twenty dollars, which will cover all the expenses of the search.
                  
                     Very respectfully, yours, etc.,
                     THOMAS R. SMITH,
                     Attorney-at-Law.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER XXIX.
                  
                     
                        NEW ORLEANS, La., May 3, 1812.
                        
                           TO JOHN HARWOOD, Esq., Baton Rouge, La.
                        
                     
                     
                        My dear Harwood:â€”We are as certain to have war, within a few
                        months, as that we live. There is no remedy. I am making all my preparations
                        to move to Manahio, and shall be able to get a weekly mail, at least, to the
                        village, Carrville. Let us decide to-go quietly to work on our plantations
                        and wait for this storm to pass. I have a young son, who made his appearance
                        a few weeks ago. I wanted to give him your name, but my wife is obstinate,
                        and insists that he shall bear his father's. There will be no law business,
                        either here or at Baton Rouge, that will be of sufficient importance to us
                        to keep us away from home. Don't think of the folly of building your house
                        this year, and don't delay your
                        marriage on account of the small dimensions of your present domicile at
                        Harwood. Your house is better than nine-tenths of the country houses in this
                        State.
                     
                        Yours, very truly,
                        CHARLES CARR.
                     
                  
                  
                     P. S.â€”Maltby has just been in and informed me of your intention to take the
                        above advice before you get it. He says you will be married
                        this month, and that you intend to go direct to Harwood. Accept my
                        congratulations, which are about as much in advance as my good counsel will
                        be in arrears.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER XXX.
                  
                     NEW ORLEANS, October 17th, 1831.
                     
                        TO JOHN HARWOOD, Esq., Carrville, La.
                     
                  
                  
                     My dear Harwood:â€”Allow me to introduce to your acquaintance the
                     bearer of this letter, Mr. Edward Delaney, late of Pensacola, Florida. He has
                     some business to transact in your neighborhood, and I shall gratefully
                     acknowledge any attentions you may be able to show him. He is a distant
                     relation of my wife's family, or at least she supposes he is, as she is related
                     to the Delaneys, some of whom reside in the Flowery State. I think Mr. Delaney
                     wishes to gain some information from you relative to the two abolitionists who
                     were hanged near Carrville last summer.
                  
                     Very truly yours,
                     FRANK MALTBY.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER XXXI.
                  
                     PENSACOLA, Fla., January 10, 1832.
                     
                        TO JOHN HARWOOD, Esq., State's Attorney, etc., Carrville, La.
                     
                  
                  
                     My dear Friend:â€”There is a Scotchman, named Gowrie, who has some
                     sort of a mercantile establishment in Carrville, who can tell you more about
                     Mr. Delaney than I can. He lived here eight or ten years, and I am
                     comparatively a newcomer. I have heard, however, that he is a widower and
                     appears to be rich. He plays high, and wins, generally. There is some rumour
                     about his having committed acts of great cruelty among the Indians in the
                     Everglades, where he had an indigo plantation, probably five or six years ago.
                     He sold out there, I am told, because an Indian chief had a fierce quarrel with
                     him and his life was in danger. Those Seminoles are becoming very troublesome.
                     Don't get into any quarrel with Delaney. He is a bad fellow when crossed, and
                     very prompt with his pistol. He shot the Indian I mentioned above, upon small
                     provocation, and wounded him very severely, thus exciting the enmity of a whole
                     tribe, and making the neighbourhood too hot for himself and very uncomfortable
                     to the other planters. He is here very rarely now-a-days, and seems to come
                     merely for the purpose of visiting his wife's grave. He has no children.
                  
                     Yours sincerely,
                     RICHARD TALBOT.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER XXXII.
                  
                     NEW ORLEANS, April 3d, 1832.
                     
                        TO JOHN HARWOOD, Esq., State's Attorney, etc., Carrville, La.
                     
                  
                  
                     Dear Sir:â€”I have found the three bales of cotton that were
                     missing. They were in the warehouse of Messrs. Campbell & Co., the marks
                     and numbers almost obliterated. I was able to identify them by my mem. of
                     shipment. The person you speak of was living in Pensacola when I first arrived
                     there. He had a house in the town, and lived alone. His wife had been dead
                     several years. This is all that I feel at liberty to communicate by letter, but
                     may be able to answer any proper questions when I return to Carrville, next
                     week.
                  
                     Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
                     ANDREW GOWRIE.
                  
               
               
                  The following letters were enclosed in a separate wrapper, which bore this
                     endorsement: "Since the death of the two Densons I found the enclosed papers in
                     a negro cabin on my plantation. I endeavoured to save the lives of these
                     miserable men at the Lynch trial, but I stood alone. These new papers only
                     serve to make their guilt more apparent, though I still regret that I was not
                     able to obtain for them the regular legal trial they demanded.
                  
                     
                        June 20, 1832.
                     
                     JOHN HARWOOD."
                  
               
               
                  
                  LETTER XXXIII.
                  
                     NEW ORLEANS, 1st May, 1830.
                     
                        TO MATTHEW DENSON, Baton Rouge, La.
                     
                  
                  
                     Friend and Brother:â€”The good cause is progressing. I leave this
                     city to-morrow, and will join you at the place you have selected for your field
                     of labour early in next week. Lose no opportunity that may offer for informing
                     our brethren in bondage of the remedy for the evils they suffer. All that is
                     now needed is concert of action. The remedy we propose is desperate, but the
                     disease is worse.
                  
                     Your fellow worker,
                     C. SUMNER.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER XXXIV.
                  
                     NEW ORLEANS, July 8, 1830.
                     
                        TO MATTHEW DENSON, Baton Rouge, La.
                     
                  
                  
                     Dear D.:â€”You are running a great and unnecessary risk. Let the
                     niggers take their chances until the other matter is settled. I own that I
                     should not go into mourning if you could persuade them to kill all the planters
                     in that particular neighbourhood. If we could manage them afterwards, they
                     could, perhaps, aid us in our search. Don't write to me under any
                     name. If you can find the thing we will divide fairly, but
                        I know that this part of the world will be very unhealthy
                     afterwards. With an old friend I may venture to dispense with the formality of
                     a
                  
                     SIGNATURE.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER XXXV.
                  
                     NEW ORLEANS, July 18, 1831.
                     
                        TO MATTHEW DENSON, Baton Rouge, La.
                     
                  
                  
                     Dear D.:â€”Your messenger reached here in safety, and if he were
                     wise he would not return. He, however, avows his determination to share your
                     fate. I tell you again, you are incurring a terrible risk. If you
                     suppose that you can escape, through any legal quibble, dismiss that delusion
                     from your mind instanter. You can never obtain a regular trial, but will be
                     strung up to the nearest tree if you are caught. That madman, Sumner, is
                     already in jailâ€”fortunately for himâ€”and all the rest of his gang are known and
                     will be caught. Burn this up. I am not a coward, yet I am shaking now with
                     apprehension. If you do not instantly give up all the
                     schemes for the present, and work your way into another State, through the
                     woodsâ€”or any way off the public roadsâ€”we shall meet no more on this side of
                     Tophet! Yet you are such a headstrong devil, that I know you will
                     not profit by my advice. I swear to you that I will hunt for the valuables when
                     this fanatical scheme and the schemers are both disposed of and forgotten, and
                     I will divide fairly with you, as agreed. I swear it to you, by the name I
                     bear, or ought to bear. I can tell you nothing about the trees. I only know
                     that there are some in the neighbourhood, as you will find to your cost, when
                     you are dangling from one of them. I will repeat to M. the exact conversation
                     that was overheard, and you can draw your own conclusions. Once more, I charge
                     youâ€”fly!
                  
                     NEMO.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER XXXVI.
                  
                     NEW ORLEANS, August 1, 1831.
                     
                        TO MATTHEW DENSON, Carrville, La.
                     
                  
                  You are lost, both of you! It is possible that this may reach you in time, and
                     only possible. Sumnerâ€”the damned foolâ€”had a list of names and "fields of
                     labour," and these are found. You and your son are therein located in
                     Carrville. If it chances that you are still free when you get thisâ€”look not
                     behind you!
                  
                     NEMO.
                  
               
               
                  LETTER XXXVII, AND LAST.
                  
                     
                        June 20, 1832.
                        
                           TO HENRIETTA HARWOOD, Harwood.
                        
                     
                     
                        My Darling Child:â€”I have selected the letters in this packet,
                        and arranged them in order, addressing them to you. Most of the day has been
                        given to this occupation, and the task is now finished. When you receive
                        this, which will not be until your father has exchanged this world for a
                        better one, I wish you to keep
                        the letters together, and to read them when you will, and to dispose of them
                        thereafter as your excellent judgment and your enlightened conscience shall
                        dictate. And while I wish you to know all of the story therein
                        unfolded, I do not desire my dear boy to know any part of it. Since your
                        mother's death you have been my most constant companion, and my most
                        intimate friend, and I feel that this intercourse will grow closer and more
                        intimate as your mind expandsâ€”if it should please God to spare me. But if it
                        is otherwise ordered, my daughter, let it comfort you to know that your
                        whole life has been one unchanging comfort to me; and also, that I confide
                        your brother to you, with a strong and abiding conviction that you are fully
                        equal to the responsibility of the charge. Darling Ret, your father thanks
                        God for the gift of his precious daughter every hour of his life.
                     You will know from Judge Carr, to whose legal guardianship I have confided
                        my children, what I have thought would be best for you, in regard to your
                        settlement in life. Need I say, dear child, that this is only an expression
                        of my opinion, and by no means intended to bind you, should you make a
                        different choice. Only one word of counsel, darling, do I leave with you on
                        this subject. Never marry until you are sure that your husband
                        is the "foremost man" of all your world. Do not be misled by outward
                        attractions of any sort. You come of a high race, and should never mate
                        except with a gentleman of rare honour. But I can freely trust you in this
                        also.
                     Besides you and Herbert, I have no living kindred in Americaâ€”that is, I do
                        not know that I have. If I have, they are not such as you will wish to know
                        or acknowledge. I have two young cousins in Englandâ€”or had twenty years
                        agoâ€”as you will understand from the letters. Farewell, my daughter!
                     
                        Your loving father,
                        JOHN HARWOOD.
                     
                  
                  
                     P.S.â€”There is a man called Delaney, whom you have seen once or twiceâ€”I find
                        myself instinctively recoiling from him. Trust my instinct, Ret, and avoid
                        him.
                  
               
            
            
               HERBERT'S JOURNAL, RESUMED.
               CHAPTER XVII.
               MR. DENHAM.
               
                  
                     BALTIMORE, MONDAY, June 14, 1836.
                  
                  I HAVE been home nearly a week, and have enjoyed myself as much as was
                     possible, under all the circumstances. Most of the time has been spent in
                     Insurance offices and in the stores. I have almost finished my Baltimore work,
                     and expect to start for New York to-morrow. It is possible that I may be
                     detained there 30 or 60 days, as the underwriters there may insist upon the
                     time mentioned in their policies. Mr. Bayard has gone to St. Louis, and will
                     remain there the rest of this year. He has given me carte blanche, and I am to employ any assistants I may want when
                     the goods reach Carrville.
                  Mother and the girls know most of my Louisiana historyâ€”it is barely possible
                     that I mentioned Miss Harwood as little and as slightly as I could. I cannot
                     endure that even my Mother should know all that I might reveal. I have not
                     spoken of the letters at all. Grace got me into a corner yesterday, and asked
                     me some extremely embarrassing questions. I was rascal enough to pretend that I
                     was in love with maltby's little girl! and I praised her to the skies. She is a
                     little slip of a girl, about fourteenâ€”a mere child! Grace asked me the colour
                     of her eyes and hair. I hope I told the truth, but am not certain. At last she
                     asked me "what sort of a bonnet she wore!" I did not
                     swear, but the exclamation I uttered got me off without cross-examination.
                     Mother gave me a lectureâ€”I don't know how longâ€”about my change of name, as if I
                     could help it! I have prevailed on her to promise, however, that she will write
                     to Mr. Henry Hubbard when I go back, and I have promised to resume my name "as
                     soon as possible." Dear Mother is kind to me, and yielded at last, against her
                     judgment. Alice don't want to hear much, except when I happen to speak of Mr.
                     Hamilton. She is such an old blue stocking that she listened with great
                     attention while I repreached the two sermons I heard. She heard him all the
                     time when he was in Baltimore, and was introduced to him at somebody's house,
                     where he happened to call. If she had known he was going to Louisiana she would
                     have sent some message to me! That
                     would have been a nice business! I daresay he saw some family likeness, when he
                     said I reminded him of some one he had met here. Dear me! I said nothing about
                     his self-denial sermon fitting me so exactly. I spoke of Miss Harwood as the
                     promised wife of Charley Carr all the time. Oh! how earnestly do I long to
                     believe that I lied every time I did it! Mother asked for my journal once or
                     twice. I told her the last time that there was only about one week's record in
                     it, and that I could give her a verbal history in less time than it would take
                     to read the record. Oh, Ret! my whole life is compressed into that short
                     week!
               
               
                  
                     TUESDAY, June 15, 1836.
                  
                  My trunk and I arrived at the steamboat wharf just five minutes after the boat
                     started. So I left my baggage at the office and walked back to my Mother's
                     house, carrying my little portfolio containing my letters and this journal, and
                     some other letters. I have made it a rule to keep this always
                     under my own eye since I left Carrville. On board the "Queen of the West" I
                     left it in my trunk, but carried it in my hands from Wheeling to Baltimore.
                  I let myself in with my latch-key, and, walking softly, intending to pounce
                     upon Mother and the girls suddenly, I slipped into a little closet adjoining
                     the drawing room. I had been there but a few minutes when the door bell rang.
                     As I could get out of the closet into the hall if the visitor entered the
                     drawing-room, I seated myself and waited patiently for the "call" to be over.
                     When the servant opened the door I heard a man's voice, saying:
                  "Does Mrs. Harwood reside here?"
                  "Yes, sir, walk in."
                  "Give her this card, and say I will be obliged if she will favour me with a few
                     minutes' conversation," and he walked into the parlour.
                  I soon heard my Mother's silks rustling, as she passed the closet door, and
                     when she got into the parlour, I thought I would slip out and go back for the
                     girls. Before I got out of earshot, I heard the visitor say:
                  "Mrs. Harwood?"
                  "Yes, sir! Mr. Denham, I believe?"
                  I resumed my seat.
                  "Yes, madam, I am Mr. Denham. I have called to see if I could find a relation
                     of the late Sir Herbert Harwood, of Harwood House, Essex."
                  "My husband was the nephew of Sir Herbert Harwood, sir," replied my Mother.
                  "I suppose so, madam, from information I received."
                  "Resume your seat, sir," said my Mother, and they sat down. The idea of going
                     away flashed across my mind, as I did not like being an eavesdropper; but I was
                     rooted to the spot by the next words.
                  "I am not at liberty to say all I know, madam," resumed the visitor, "but it
                     will perhaps be sufficient to say that your sonâ€”you have a son I think?"
                  "Yes, sir; Herbert!"
                  "Precisely, madam. Mr. Herbert Harwood is particularly interested in the
                     matter. For the present, however, I am obliged to act very circumspectly; and I
                     may add that your son especially should know nothing of what I may say to you."
                     There was a pause.
                  "Proceed, sir," said my Mother, at length.
                  "Pardon me, madam. Do I understand you to agree that what I reveal is to be
                     considered confidential?"
                  "My son has just left the city, sir. He may not return for several weeks. You
                     will have to allow me to decide when I have heard what you say you have to
                     reveal." There was another pause.
                  "I see you distrust me, madam, and I will frankly state the case to you. I am a
                     lawyer, and my personal interest in this business depends entirely upon the
                     success of my effort to place your son in possession of a large sum of money.
                     Now, if he should hear too soon of this good fortune, and deem it advisable to
                     make any personal effort to secure it, he would almost certainly derange my
                     plans, and probably lose the fortune altogether."
                  "My son is a man, sir; and a gentleman by birth and education. You may safely
                     rely upon his honour."
                  "Undoubtedly, madam!" replied her interlocutor. "You shall judge for yourself
                     whether or not to include him in our confidenceâ€”"
                  "I do not comprehend what you mean by our confidence, sir." My Mother is a
                     regular queen when she chooses to put on her majesty. I could hardly refrain
                     from peeping into the room to see how Mr. Denham took that shot.
                  "I perceive that there is no confidence on your side at least,
                     madam," said he; "and I fear the whole business will fall through for want of it. It is absolutely
                     necessary that I should see all papers that your husband may have left. I do
                     not object to the presence of your son or yourself while I make the
                     investigation. Nay, I only ask that you, or either of you, should read the
                     papers in my hearing. If I am to proceed in the case thereafter, I must insist
                     upon full liberty to act without the interference of any one."
                  "My husband left no papers relating to his connection with the family of Sir
                     Herbert, excepting those written by himselfâ€”"
                  "Those are precisely the papers I want, madam," said Mr. Denham eagerly.
                  "The only papers in my possession, sir, are contained in a packet addressed to
                     my son."
                  "No doubt, madam; they are all important in this matter."
                  "Well sir, I can do nothing without consulting my son. If you desire it I will
                     write to him by the next mail. I can have an answer in about a week."
                  "I must content myself with your decision," said he, rising. My Mother rang the
                     bell, and he passed into the hall. As the servant opened the door I peeped into
                     the passage, and saw his crisp, black hair, the nicely fitting kid glove, and
                     the glossy silk hat he was adjusting on his wicked skull.
                  It was Captain Delaney.
                  As my Mother walked up the hall I emerged from the closet and met her.
                  "Herbert! my son! what has happened?"
                  "Nothing, Mother. The boat left me, and I must postpone my journey until
                     to-morrow. Please come into the drawing room again."
                  "You are ill, Herbert? your face is pale, andâ€”"
                  "I am quite well, dear Mother. You had a visitor just now?"
                  "Yesâ€”a Mrâ€”Denham," she said, glancing at the card in her handâ€”"the most
                     intensely disagreeable man I ever met!"
                  "What makes you say so, Mother?"
                  "His tout ensemble; the glance of his sharp,
                     black eye; the tone of his voice; the motion of his gloved hand; his seeming
                     determination to accomplish his purposesâ€”coute qui
                        coute." Oh, excellent Mother!
                  "I have heard all your conversation, Mother. Please forgive me. I was in the
                     closet all the time he was here. Don't scold me, please, but listen. I know
                     this man. I have seen him in Louisiana, and have heard more than I have seen.
                     He is now working out some devilish plot affecting me, orâ€”John Harwood's
                     children. Oh, Mother! help me to circumvent him."
                  "Why are you so excited, Herbert? where are you going?" I went into the closet
                     and got my portfolio; I laid it in her lap, and then putting my arms round her
                     neck I hid my face in her loving bosom.
                  "I have not dealt candidly with you, Mother. Read all of my journal, and all
                     the letters, and you will then be able to counsel me. I am ashamed of myself,
                     Mother; I should have told you everything. Where are the girls?"
                  "They are both outâ€”will not be home until evening. Suppose you go after them;
                     they are at Mrs. Leland's. Go, my son, and I will read while you are all away.
                     Mrs. Leland will be very glad to have you. Come home early." So I went.
                  When we got home Mother was in her own room. It was about ten o'clock, and the
                     girls soon retired. I took my candle and came here into my chamber. My Father's
                     portrait is hanging over there by the window, and I was standing before it,
                     looking into his eyes and trying to remember how he looked when I last saw him,
                     when Mother came into the room. She laid my portfolio down on the table and
                     held out her arms to me. She held me in her embrace a moment, and then we sat
                     down.
                  "My poor boy!" she said at last, "does your Father's picture say anything to
                     you?"
                  "Yes, Mother. It tells me that I am the son of a noble gentleman and of a
                     matchless lady! I don't need any other lesson."
                  "I have read your journal, Herbert, and all those letters. You have acted well,
                     my son, and I am proud of you."
                  "I think you may trust me, Mother. And now I want my Father's letterâ€”may I have
                     it?"
                  "It is here, in your portfolio. It was to be given you when you were of age. I
                     think that time has come, dear, hasn't it?"
                  "Yes, ma'am."
                  "Do you want to read it to-night, Herbert?" she said, as she kissed me at
                     parting.
                  "Yes, Mother. We will talk about it to-morrow. Let me light you. Good
                     night!"
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               ALLEN HARWOOD'S LETTER.
               
                  BALTIMORE, May 1st, 1826.
               
               
                  My Beloved Son:â€”It is proper that you should know some part of the
                  history of your family, and while you are now too young to understand the story,
                  the time will probably arrive when it will be full of interest. I am admonished by
                  many unmistakable tokens that my career is nearly ended. Yours will be only begun,
                  my son, when you read these lines. May it be as happy as your Father's has been,
                  and far more useful.
               My grandfather was the second son of John Lacy Harwood, Baron Morton of Lavington,
                  Devonshire. The Harwoods are a very old family, and have always piqued themselves
                  upon their ancient name. From the wars of the Roses down to the accession of the
                  House of Hanover, it has always happened that the branch of the family from which
                  you spring has espoused the cause which modern historians have pronounced to be
                  right. There have been many vicissitudes in their history, but through them all
                  the Harwoods of Essex and Devonshire have ever maintained their reputation as
                  valiant soldiers, wise statesmen and spotless gentlemen. Therefore, the cumulative
                  power of the example of these worthies has been felt through succeeding
                  generations; and all the members of the family that I have known, with one
                  exception, have acknowledged and been governed by this influence. In this
                  democratic land there is a growing disposition to ignore and despise all the
                  claims of lineage and blood; but I charge you, my son, to live and die worthily,
                  to let the controlling emotions of your moral nature, the words of your lips, and
                  the acts of your life, all accord with the record of the race from which you have
                  descended.
               The lordship of Morton, with the Devonshire estates, the principal of which is
                  Lavington, were all conferred upon my father's grandfather, John Lacy Harwood. My
                  grandfather was a younger son of the first Baron Morton of Lavington. He died in
                  1760, leaving four sons, namely: Herbert, Lacy, John and Barnard. My earliest
                  recollections go back to about 1790, when my uncle Herbert was the only survivor
                  of these four gentlemen. My father, Lacy Harwood, died soon after my birth; my
                  uncles, John and Barnard, died before 1790â€”leaving, each of them, a son, whose
                  sole inheritance was his father's name. My uncle Herbert was an officer in the
                  Royal Navy, and died about fifteen years ago, after winning a victory that cost
                  him his life. You bear the name of this noble gentleman, my son, and I trust you
                  to transmit it to your children without stain or blemish.
               My grandfather's estate, according to English law, descended to his eldest son,
                  and the portions of both of my cousins were very small. We were all three brought
                  up in our uncle's house, and I should have inherited his fortune if he had died
                  without issue; but he left two sons, who were born to him, after we three had
                  arrived at manhood. My cousin John had an estate somewhere in Louisiana, bought
                  for him by our uncle, who had been created a baronet by George III, and whose
                  estate had reached a value nearly double the amount of his inheritance. He was
                  munificent in his gifts to his nephews, and intended to purchase a similar estate
                  for me after the birth of his heir. But I had long desired to win a fortune for
                  myself in India, and my kind uncle yielded to my wishes.
               Before I proceed with my own story, I have a few words to say about my cousin
                  Barnard, and about his wife, Miss Alice More, who was Sir Herbert's adopted
                  daughter. What I say to you on this subject I wish you alone to know. So far as I
                  am aware, your Mother and I are the only living repositories of these secrets, and
                  I communicate them to you, hoping you will be warned by an evil example, as you
                  will be stimulated to good by that of your grand uncle. The history of his life is
                  a part of the history of his country, and in all her glorious annals I could find
                  no name to bestow upon you that was more worthy than his.
               From his early youth Barnard was fierce, wilful, imperious, exacting and
                  revengeful. This much I know. I am obliged to think he was also
                  covetous and even dishonest. He was the one bad product of a goodly tree. At
                  school, and at home during the holidays, he was a perpetual thorn in the sides of
                  John and your father. I avoided quarrels with him by avoiding his society, but he
                  and John spent their early lives in one long battle, with occasional hollow
                  truces. About the time I attained my majority, uncle returned after a long absence
                  from England, and placed Barnard at a different school, and shortly afterwards
                  John was finally settled in Louisiana. Just about the time of my departure for
                  India, Barnard and Alice were privately married in Scotland, and sailed for Leghorn, it was said, immediately.
                  I do not know what to say of Alice. I loved her very dearly, and I am now disposed
                  to believe that she was misled and overruled by Barnard, whose one redeeming trait
                  was his profound affection for her. Their marriage was opposed by Sir Herbert on
                  account of the disparity in their ages, Alice being five or six years older than
                  her husband. Neither of them had any fortune, as we were all alike dependent upon
                  Sir Herbert's kindness, and it was because I was not willing to take any part of
                  his inheritance from his natural heirs that I determined to seek my own fortune in
                  the East. I try to think of you, Herbert, as a matured man, while I write this,
                  and to believe that you will appreciate the sacredness of the secret I am about to
                  tell you. I am afraid that Barnard obtained whatever money he had by a direct
                  robbery. This was enough of degradation, it would seem; but to crown the act with
                  peculiar infamy, he chose for his victim the kind, unsuspecting uncle, in whose
                  house he had lived from his infancy! I do not know this, but there is
                  not the shadow of a doubt upon my mind concerning the sad story. I have told it to
                  you, trying to distinguish between facts and suspicions, because it is possible
                  that you may some day encounter your unworthy relative. He is able to deceive you
                  or any one, but with this knowledge of his character you need not be deceived, if
                  you should ever chance to meet.
               I come now to my own history, and have little more to say. Your mother will
                  communicate all you may desire to learn. I first saw her on the voyage to
                  Calcutta, and learned to appreciate her value before we had been many days at sea.
                  Like me, she was an orphan, and poor. She was going, a passenger in the same ship,
                  to India, at the invitation of her uncle, who was in moderately prosperous
                  circumstances. On the voyage the ship was attacked by a French privateer, and
                  although not captured, was so badly damaged that she was abandoned by her crew in
                  the midst of a storm. I had been severely wounded and was supposed to be dying,
                  and the crew refused to transfer my almost lifeless body to the overladen boat.
                  Alice, my Alice, your noble Mother, refused to leave her affianced
                  husband while the vital spark still lingered, and the master of the Hesperus also
                  resolved to share our fate. The crew left us, and were no doubt drowned an hour
                  afterwards. The master was swept away in a small boat, which he was supplying with
                  provisions for our escape, and was afterwards picked up and saved. We were
                  rescued, Alice and I, from the sinking vessel by an American merchantman, and your
                  Mother saw the wreck sink before we had reached the deck of the Chesapeake. We
                  saved, that is she saved my baggage and her own, and our joint
                  fortunes amounted to a little more than ten thousand dollars. Before we reached
                  this city, to which the Chesapeake was bound, we had spoken two British cruisers,
                  and I had sent letters to my uncle, informing him of my safety, by both of them. I
                  afterwards learned that he had died before either of these letters reached
                  England, if they ever did.
               The day of our arrival in Baltimore was the happiest day of my life. Your mother
                  and I were married at the office of the British Consul, and the certificate she
                  now has bears his signature and official seal. I commenced the business from which
                  I am now retiring with the capital I had saved from the wreck of the Hesperus, and
                  the blessing of Providence has so far attended me that I am able to leave my
                  family in the possession of a modest competence. You will have to make your own
                  way in the world, my son; if you desire riches you must earn them. In this land,
                  strict attention to a vocation and economy in expenditure will rarely fail of
                  obtaining enough for any reasonable wants. I wrote to my cousin, John Harwood,
                  addressing him in New Orleans, and informed him of my marriage and my happiness. I
                  received in reply a letter from a Mr. Denham, an English gentleman, who stated
                  that poor John had died just as the last war between England and this country
                  began. He had contracted a diseaseâ€”some malignant fever, and died on the eve of
                  his own marriage.
               Next to my uncle, whose kindness and affection followed me through my whole life,
                  and to whom I am indebted for all that I have, John Harwood occupies the highest
                  place in my memory. Though he was ever rash, impulsive and passionate, he was also
                  ever brave, generous and true. I loved him very dearly, and if he had lived, it
                  would have been my pleasant duty to bid you honour him, as you can now only honour
                  his memory. I visited him with Sir Herbert at his home in Louisiana, just
                  twenty-three years ago, and we three gentlemen explored a portion of the western
                  bank of the great river, hunting during the day and sleeping in the open woods at
                  night. It was then a wilderness, and there were occasionally parties of unfriendly
                  Indians, from the farther West, who roved in small bands almost within reach of
                  the settlements on the banks of the Mississippi. I was once attacked by a scout of
                  one of these wild tribes, and should probably have been slain in the encounter but for the courage and
                  address of my cousin John. The savage had surprised me, and mastered my rifle, and
                  we were struggling on the ground, my strength gradually yielding under the
                  pressure of the iron muscles of the Indian, when John suddenly arrived and rescued
                  me. I shall never forget how he dashed upon the truculent savage, tore him from my
                  relaxing grasp, and wresting the knife from his hand killed him with his own
                  weapon. Mr. Denham's letter informed me that he was engaged to settle his estate,
                  by the guardian of Sir Charles Harwood. I presume the title to the property had
                  remained in Sir Herbert Harwood, though I know that it was my uncle's intention to
                  convey it to John. If Mr. Denham's letter had not so explicitly stated the
                  contrary, I should have gone South to look after this property, for my children's
                  sake; but this gentleman could have had no conceivable motive to deceive me, and I
                  am forced to conclude that my uncle had retained the title deeds.
               My story is ended. It is not probable that you will ever see any of the members of
                  the family whose history I have just recounted to you. I have few memorials to
                  leave you. The most valuable is my watch and seal, bearing the Harwood arms. The
                  watch is even now somewhat antiquated, and when you are old enough to wear it it
                  will no doubt be out of fashion; but, if it has no other value, the inscription on
                  the caseâ€”"From Sir Herbert Harwood, Baronet, to his dear nephew and heir at-law,
                  Allen Harwood, London, 1801"â€”is a rich legacy, because it reminds me of my loving
                  uncle, and will serve to remind you, my dear son, of both him and
               Your loving father,
               ALLEN HARWOOD.

               WHEAL PENTLAND.
               
                  
                     WEDNESDAY, June 16, 1836.
                  
                  MY Mother and I have spent most of this morning in mutual explanations, and we
                     have enlightened each other amazingly. She began, after reading my Father's
                     letter, to unravel the Denham mystery. The rascal Denham, or Delaney, has been
                     prowling about the neighbourhood of Harwood, to find and carry off the box of
                     jewelry which he supposes to be hidden there. It is my box, so he
                     is trying to steal from me. His object in getting my Father's papers is
                     evidently to eke out the imperfect information he already has, and which he
                     probably obtained from Barnard Harwood. We have concluded to meet him as
                     follows: I shall write to my Mother, as soon as I reach New York, declining to
                     treat with Mr. Denham without some more definite statement, and inviting him to
                     correspond with me upon the subject through my Mother. I want a letter from
                     him, because I think he is the writer of those letters to the Densons, and, if
                     so, I can prove it by comparing them. I don't know what will be the next step,
                     but I am going to keep the secret of my interest in the matter from Captain
                     Delaney by keeping my Hubbard name awhile longer. If I escape meeting him here,
                     I shall have the advantage when we meet again in Louisiana, as I will know
                        his secret but he will not know mine. I shall try to be in time
                     for the steamboat this evening.
               
               
                  
                     NEW YORK, SATURDAY, June 19, 1836.
                  
                  After prowling about this big city all day I feel rather tired. There will be
                     some delay about collecting the insurance money, and I don't know how long I
                     shall be detained. I wrote the letter to Mother as soon as I arrived here, and
                     expect to have a reply some day in next weekâ€”probably about Wednesday. The
                     largest amount of our New York Insurance is in the New York and Baltimore
                     Consolidated office, and I spent about three hours there today. When I got
                     access to the secretary I found him poring over some huge account books, and
                     apparently very much perplexed. He soon disposed of my business by appointing
                     to-morrow for the investigation of my claim; and remarking that he was very
                     much annoyed by the state of his accounts, I offered my assistance. He has to
                     make a semi-annual report on the 1st of July, and there is a large error in his
                     balance sheet which he has not been able to find. I told him that I was an
                     accountant of considerable experience, and that I would look for the mistake
                     while he examined my insurance claim. He agreed at once, and I went to work. It
                     is only necessary to say that I have thus far discovered nothing, except that
                     the mistake must be in one of three or four large accounts. Mr.
                     Hardy, the secretary, is not much of an accountant, and he has been wasting
                     valuable time and labour in looking for his error in impossible places. He says
                     he will give me five hundred dollars if I get off his balance sheet before the
                     month is out, so I am going to work
                     in earnest on Monday. I must find out now where to go to church to-morrow.
               
               
                  
                     NEW YORK, MONDAY, June 21, 1836.
                  
                  I have spent this entire day over the insurance books, and begin to see
                     daylight. The original error was an uneven sum, and I have found two or three
                     small ones, and am now looking for precisely one hundred thousand dollars. I am
                     sure of finding that, by a regular and systematic examination of all the large
                     accounts, taking them ab initio. When I make
                     my next entry here, I shall be able to record my victory. The whole thing is so
                     simplified by my fortunate discovery of the small mistakes, that I feel
                     entirely confident of success to-morrow or on the next day.
               
               
                  
                     WEDNESDAY, June 23, 1836.
                  
                  A good long yarn to spin to-night. I found the error, and gave Mr. Hardy the
                     balance sheet this morning. I have now in my pocket a nice crisp new note for
                     five hundred dollars, which was the more acceptable, because Mr. Hardy seemed
                     to pay it with genuine pleasure. Received a letter from Mother, enclosing a
                     note from Mr. Denham, which I may as well copy here:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 BALTIMORE, June 21, 1836.
                                 
                                    "To Mr. HERBERT HARWOOD, New York.
                                 
                              
                              "Dear Sir: Mrs. Allen Harwood has shown me a letter
                                 from you, in which you decline my proposition to look over your
                                 Father's papers, without fuller information from me as to the
                                 object in view. Briefly, I may say, that I expect to obtain such
                                 information from these papers as will enable me to secure to you a
                                 sum of money, which you would inherit as the son of Allen Harwood,
                                 Esq. It is not possible for any one to obtain this money without
                                 the information which I alone can give. If I succeed, I shall
                                 require your obligation to pay me a percentage of the amount
                                 obtained; and I shall also require that you put me in possession of
                                 certain data, which I am sure will be found among the papers left
                                 by Mr. Allen Harwood. These data will, no doubt, have to be
                                 collected from old letters, &c., or other memoranda; and as I
                                 cannot specify more explicitly the kind of information I want, I
                                 can see no way to arrive at the desired end save by a careful
                                 examination of the papers referred to. My address for the present
                                 is Barnum's Hotel, Baltimore.
                              
                                 "Very respectfully yours,
                                 "MARK DENHAM."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  The writing is identical with that in the letters signed "Signature" and
                     "Nemo," in Ret's packet. I have not yet answered Mr. Denham.
                  I am at a loss to account for this man's conduct; that he designs to gain
                     possession of the box, left by his stepmother to my grandmother, I can easily
                     understand. But why should he change his name to Delaney, and how does he know
                     anything about my Father's family? He has been hunting this lead-covered box
                     for more than five years, and this is his first appearance in this latitude. He
                     is undoubtedly the same man who volunteered the lie which deceived my father,
                     and prevented a natural intercourse between the cousins, which might have led
                     to the discovery of this property. John Harwood died in the belief that my
                     Father had perished in the Indian Ocean; and my Father died in the belief that
                     his cousin had fallen a victim to some southern fever, in 1812. On one hand, I
                     am forearmed by the knowledge of Denham's rascality, and by a tolerably clear
                     insight into his motives and intentions; but, on the other, I feel as though I
                     am fighting in the dark, and with an adversary having cat's eyes. I think I
                     have decided to write to Mother, requesting her to tell Mr. Denham that I shall
                     call upon him, if I conclude to entrust the matter to him. If I can evade him
                     until I get back to Louisiana I may be able to spoil all his nice plans.
                  After I left Mr. Hardy this morning I walked down into Wall street, to hunt up
                     Mr. Carr's correspondent. I found his office at last, on the second floor of a
                     house which seemed to be occupied entirely by stock brokers. Every door had a
                     little tin sign on it, and all the signs bore the word "stock broker," in
                     addition to the names of the occupants of the rooms. Mr. Callahan's office is a
                     dingy looking back room, furnished with two or three chairs, two desks, some
                     files of newspapers, and two spittoons. The office was taking care of itself
                     when I entered. There was a card sticking upon the front door, bearing the
                     following inscription: 
                        At the Board. Will return at noon. Take a seat.
                     
                  
                  Supposing the invitation to be addressed to me, I seated myself, and taking one
                     of the files, I found it contained some comparatively tively recent numbers of the London
                        Times. I have long had a curiosity to see this paper, and was
                     buried in one of its editorials, when I heard a great shuffling of feet on the
                     stairs, and presently the door opened and Mr. Callahan and another gentleman
                     entered the office. I laid aside the paper, and rose as they came in, and Mr.
                     Callahan waved his hand, saying, with a slight Hibernian twang:
                  "Keep your seat, sir; I shall be at leisure in a moment."
                  He and his companion went off instantly into an animated dialogue, which they
                     kept up in an almost unknown tongue. The broker began by saying: "I took a
                     thousand shares of Pacific Canal to-day, me boy, at nine and three-eighths. You
                     can have it or not, as you plaze."
                  "I'll take it," said the other; "but it was only a quarter yesterday."
                  "Thrue for you! but there is a corner in it!"
                  "The deuce!"
                  "Sure there is thin!" said Mr. Callahan. "It'll be ten, or ten and a half
                     to-morrow."
                  "Why didn't you go deeper!" said his companion.
                  "Oh, I was not fool enough to run it up on meself, ye divil; but niver mind. It
                     is good enough for you as it is."
                  "Well, you want the money?"
                  "Send me your cheque in the mornin'. Let me see, nine and three-eighths, and
                     the commissionâ€”ninety-four hundred and forty-three, seventy-five. Ye'll not
                     want a statement?"
                  "I guess I can cypher it out!" drawled the other. What about the copper?"
                  "Illegant! but it will not be on for a week or so. I'll let ye know in time.
                     Good day! Now, sir; if you'll excuse me, I'll draw me coat. It's hot as
                     blazes!"
                  He looked quite cool and collected as he sat opposite me in his shirt sleeves.
                     He had a sharp nose, and a pair of flimsy looking red whiskers. I handed him
                     his own letter to Mr. Carr, and while he was reading it I made up my mind, if
                     either of us was to be taken in, it would not be Mr. Callahan. When he had
                     finished the letter he refolded it and bowing to me, said:
                  "You represent Mr. Carr, I presume, sir?"
                  "Yes, sir; I have that honour," I replied.
                  "Well, sir; will you favour me with your instructions?"
                  "Will you oblige me, in the first place," said I, "by letting me understand a
                     little about this stock? Mr. Carr's instructions to me were extremely vague,
                     and I must be guided by my own judgment in the matter. I left Louisiana very
                     unexpectedly, and had no opportunity for much conversation with him on the
                     subject."
                  "With all the pleasure in life, Mr.â€”"
                  "Harwood, sir."
                  "Happy to meet you, Mr. Harwood. I believe you are Mr. Carr's ward; but we
                     always call him Judge. Isn't he a judge or something of that sort?"
                  "Not at present. He was parish judge some years ago, but resigned his office.
                     He retains the title, however, almost universally. I am notâ€”"
                  "Oh, well; divil's the difference! About the stock. Judge Carr was here in the
                     summerâ€”a year agoâ€”and I had just returned from a trip to the copper regions on
                     Lake Superior. While I was there, my travelling companion, who is a geologist
                     and mineralogist of considerable ability, induced me to join him in the
                     purchase of a tract of land, which he thought very promising for mining
                     purposes. We did buy it, and the former owner stipulated for a fourth part of
                     the stock in part payment, when we had formed the company and issued
                     certificates. All this has been done. Mr. Carr proposed taking a fourth
                     interest at the same time. The original cost of the land, with the expenses of
                     getting a charter and other incidentals, amount all together to two thousand
                     dollars. The former owner has received his certificate for twelve thousand five
                     hundred shares. Mr. Ludlow, the mineralogist, has his certificate for a like
                     amount; I have mine, and here is Judge Carr's all complete, except the filling
                     in of his name. The charter establishes the corporation with a capital of fifty
                     thousand dollars, in fifty thousand shares of one dollar each."
                  "I don't understand," I answered; "I thought you said the cost was only two
                     thousandâ€”"
                  "Oh, the value fixed to the shares is only nominal; but nobody in the world
                     knows anything about the cost excepting the parties interested. When the stock
                     comes upon the market it will represent a property valued at fifty thousand
                     dollars. You need not laugh, I can sell the whole of it in an hour for very
                     nearly that sum."
                  "Do you really mean, Mr. Callahan, that you can get for Judge Carr's portion
                     anything like ten thousand dollars?"
                  "That's precisely what I mean, sir. The stock has never been regularly before the board, but I have had
                     private offers for my interest from several well informed men."
                  "Well, sir," said I, taking my hat, "I shall decide to-morrow about the matter.
                     You know I am acting for another, and must, therefore, he as prudent as
                     possible."
                  "Certainly, sir," rejoined Mr. Callahan; "and if you conclude to resign Mr.
                     Carr's interest I will make you a present of five hundred dollars, either now
                     or to-morrow."
                  I went to Mr. Hardy's office, but he was out, and I am going back there
                     to-morrow to see him and get his advice. Though I don't see how I can hesitate,
                     if a very small percentage of Mr. Callahan's story is true.
               
               
                  
                     THURSDAY, June 24, 1836.
                  
                  Mr. Hardy told me this morning that I ought by all means to take the stock. I
                     did not tell him the original cost, as I thought that was not my secret. But he
                     says it will undoubtedly sell at a dollar a share as soon as it is on the board
                     list. Acting upon this advice I went down into Wall street again, and, it being
                     after noon, I found Mr. Callahan in his office. I had forgotten all about Mr.
                     Carr's commission, when I was with Mr. Bayard on the Mississippi, and not
                     feeling at liberty to use his money, I paid Mr. Callahan my beautiful five
                     hundred dollar note. It cost me a struggle, too, as I had determined to expend
                     a large part of this money in presents for my Mother and sisters. But I knew I
                     was pursuing the proper course, so I swallowed my regrets. Mr. Callahan asked
                     me if I was certain that Mr. Carr's name was Charles, and, as I could not
                     remember positively, he proposed-to fill up the certificate in my name. There
                     is a blank form on the back for transfers, and he took my signature (which he
                     pronounced "a beautiful specimen of caligraphy") in the transfer book.
                  "It would be necessary for me to have Mr. Carr's signature, anyhow," he said,
                     "as I have never seen his writing and could not identify it. It is probable
                     that he will wish to divide his stock, and if so, the directions for transfer
                     must come from you. His letter enclosing the certificate for transfer will be a
                     sufficient voucher."
                  I put the certificate away in my pocket-book, remarking that I was now one
                     fourth owner of the "Lake Shore Mine."
                  "That's just it!" replied Mr. Callahan, "and if the Judge should happen to
                     disapprove of your investment, it will be about the luckiest thing that could
                     happen to you."
                  "It seems very strange, Mr. Callahan," said I, "that so small a sum of money
                     should buy so large and valuable a piece of property."
                  "Did you ever happen to hear of Wheal Pentland?" said Mr. Callahan.
                  "Wheal Pentland!" replied I, with a start; "certainly; I have heard of a copper
                     mine of that name in Cornwall."
                  "That's just it!" said he again, with considerable emphasis. "Do you happen to
                     know the early history of that mine?"
                  "No, sir," I replied, beginning to be enormously interested.
                  "Well, then, I'll relate it. About thirty years ago a small party of
                     gentlemenâ€”there were only eight of themâ€”bought the mine, formed a company and
                     got a charter. The par value of the stock was five pounds a share, but there
                     was never more than one pound paid in. Very soon after the company was
                     organized one of the stockholders sold out his interest in small lots at par.
                     He thought he was making a good thing of it, and so he was, considering his
                     original outlay. The other seven, or their heirs, hold the balance of the stock
                     to this day. Here is a late number of the Times; will you plaze
                     look at the quotation of Wheal Pentland?"â€”he handed me the paper, pointing to
                     the column containing the informationâ€”"you see it is quoted at twenty-five
                     pounds a share."
                  "It is true," I answered, somewhat bewildered. "It is set down here just as you
                     sayâ€”one pound paid in and quoted at twenty five pounds, offered."
                  "Just so. There is none for sale, however. When the eighth owner had sold out
                     his proportion the most of it was bought at higher prices by the other
                     stockholders. The last lot that was on the market was sold in small parcels of
                     one hundred shares. It was sold by trustees to close an estate, and it sold up
                     to twenty-five pounds, which has been the standing bid for some three or four
                     years back. It is paying large dividends upon the advanced price."
                  "Do you expect the Lake Superior mine to do as well as Wheal Pentland?"
                  "Upon me sowl, I don't, thin!" he answered. "But copper mines are generally
                     remarkably profitable or utterly worthless. I do think the Lake Shore mine will
                     be found in the former category. It has been carefully examined by scientific
                     gentlemen, and the quality of the ores is unusually good, and the quantity is
                        supposed posed to be
                     inexhaustible. I don't mind telling you, in confidence, that I intend to sell a
                     small portion of my stock when it reaches two dollars a share, and I shall put
                     the balance of it away for my children."
                  "To go back to Wheal Pentland, sir, allow me to ask you a question or two. My
                     father owned some of this stock, but the certificate wasâ€”lost. I have reason to
                     think it still stands in his name. If my surmise is correct, it has stood in
                     this condition for nearly or quite thirty years, and I suppose there is an
                     accumulation of unclaimed dividends. Now, what steps should I take to find out
                     something about it?"
                  "How much of the stock did your father own?"
                  "A thousand shares."
                  "What!" exclaimed Mr. Callahan, starting up from his seat; "a thousand shares
                     of Wheal Pentland! Well, by jingo! that bangs the divil! And all the back
                     dividends! Why, by me sowl, you are talking about a hundred and fifty thousand
                     dollars at least!"
                  "So it seems, sir. I didn't know, until quite recently, that my father owned
                     this stock. He never knew it. It was bought for him by his uncle,
                     who hid the certificate somewhereâ€”I don't know whereâ€”intending to surprise his
                     nephew with the gift at some subsequent time. But he died before the gift was
                     made, and I am almost positive that the stock still stands in Allen Harwood's
                     name."
                  "Well, one thing is pretty certain, anyhow," said Mr. Callahan, after rubbing
                     his head in great perplexity, "and that is, that no man in his sinses is going
                     to slape long with such an avalanche of money hanging over his head. Have you
                     taken any steps whatever in the business?"
                  "None, sir. I just asked you for advice upon that point."
                  "Suppose you have the ease in my charge for the present. Give me your name and
                     your father's name here in writing; also the name and residence of your
                     father's uncle, and the date of the purchase, as near as you can remember
                     it."
                  "It was in 1801."
                  "Very good. Write it down and lave me your address in Louisiana. You shall hear
                     from me in about sixty days."
                  I took out my pocket-book, preparing to deposit a fee with Mr. Callahan, when
                     he put a stopper upon the proceeding by saying there would be no expense
                     involved in the mere investigation.
                  "I have a correspondent in London to whom I am writing anyhow, and it is only
                     the addition of a few lines to my letter. If we get the stock I shall charge
                     you the usual commission when the transfers are made."
                  "I have only a word more to say, then," I remarked, as I took leave of my new
                     friend; "my father was married in the office of the British Consul at
                     Baltimore, and the certificate in my mother's possession has his official
                     signature and sealâ€”"
                  "All the better, Mr. Harwood; there will be no difficulty about getting the
                     money beyond some little formalities. Good-bye, sir; I hope to have the
                     pleasure of writing you good news before the year is out."
                  I shall start for Baltimore to-morrow, D. V. I wrote to Mr. Mark Denham
                     to-night, merely saying that I had no private papers of my Father's which I
                     would allow any stranger to see. I also remarked that the record I had of Mr.
                     Denham's former friendly offices did not encourage me to trouble him with my
                     family matters, which were already in "very skillful hands." I thought the last
                     remark would settle him.
               
               
                  
                     BALTIMORE, MONDAY, July 12, 1836.
                  
                  Mrs. Leland invited all of us to spend some days with her at her country house.
                     The weather has been hot and the country delightful. We have all been there
                     since I returned from New York. I came into town two or three times a week to
                     attend to business matters, and I am now ready to return to Louisiana. I expect
                     to start to-morrow morning. Dear Mother is up stairs writing a letter to Ret. I
                     don't know what she will say to her, but I am going to take the letter. I can
                     trust Mother.
                  I saw Captain Delaney Denham get into one of the Frederick cars a week ago. He
                     has started for the South again, no doubt. The servant we left at home says he
                     called twice during our absence, but left no message. I am pretty sure he did
                     not see me. I feel a sort of presentiment that the rascal will work some evil
                     upon me some of these days, and I am half ashamed to say that the thought makes
                     me nervous. I know that I am not afraid of him, yet the idea of
                     meeting him again at Carrville makes my heart beat faster. What folly this is!
                     I won't endure it any longer, so I'll quit thinking about him.
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XX.
               HEARTBROKEN.
               
                  
                     CARRVILLE, LOUISIANA, WEDNESDAY, Aug. 4, 1836.
                  
                  OH, I have seen her again! Why should I write any more? The rest of my life is
                     a blank, for I love her! Yes, yes. All the story is told in a word. I love her
                     so, that the wildest expressions that come into my mind are tame and
                     meaningless. I love her without one little spark of hope, but I love her the
                     more, because I know that the miserable secret must be forever hidden in my own
                     bosom until it eats away my vitals. All the while I have been away I have
                     thought of her, dreamed of her, and longed for her. I thought of the joy with
                     which I should tell her that I was Allen Harwood's son. I thought I should give
                     her Mother's letter, and watch her while she read it. Oh, how mad I have been!
                     Oh, why did I ever awaken from that foolish dream! While the steamboat was
                     crawling down the long river I counted the hours that must intervene before I
                     could look upon her fair face again. I cannot write any more to-night, for I
                     feel that I am going mad! I am going outâ€”far into the countryâ€”into the woods,
                     and will try to walk myself into weariness. Shall I ever sleep any more?
               
               
                  
                     MIDNIGHT.
                  
                  I believe I am sobered again, and may be able to write something like a record
                     of to-day's events. I feel sad enough, Heaven help me! but I hope I am able to
                     meet whatever Providence may have in store for me with the front of a man.
                     There is nothing to say about my journey from Baltimore. All I know about it is
                     that it continued many long days, and that she was at the end of
                     it. Whether I studiously ignored the fact of the engagement between her and
                     Carr, or whether I had thoughts of entering the lists against him in spite of
                     it, I don't know. I never said, even to myself, that I loved her, until
                     to-night. I was in a dream. How rudely have I been awakened from it!
                  The steamboat arrived here just after daylight this morning. After breakfast I
                     walked over to Mr. White's and was warmly greeted by his householdâ€”himself, his
                     wife, and Mr. Hamilton. I learn, by the way, that the latter is formally
                     installed pastor of the church in this village. Mr. White offered me his horse,
                     and I started for Manahio. Before I reached the creek I met Jacobus, and got
                     the following budget of news: Mr. Carr, the Judge, is in Baton Rouge; Miss
                     Harwood and her brother are keeping house at Harwood, having moved over there
                     shortly after my departure for Baltimore. For the last month Miss Ret has had a
                     guest, a relation of her mother's family, Miss Lucy, or Lucille Latour. Mr.
                     Charley spent most of his time at Harwood, and was there that moment.
                  I wonder now that the truth did not flash upon me while the negro was speaking,
                     for I remember the leer upon his black face when he said "Mars'r Charley pooty
                     nigh live at Harwood now!" But I was only conscious that a half hour more would
                     bring me to the presence of my idol, and, spurring my horse on the road to
                     Harwood, I soon forgot everything else. When I reached the house there were
                     evident signs of habitation about it. The windows were open. There were chairs
                     on the broad verandah. I heard a sweet voice singing a French song, and the
                     piano accompanimentâ€”the sounds issuing from the drawing-room, where I saw her
                     last. While I fastened my horse at the rack, where Charley's was already
                     standing, I heard a man's voice join in the chorus, and recognized Carr's
                     magnificent bass. I walked up the steps, and into the room through one of the
                     French windows, and was clasped around the waist in a moment by Herbert, who
                     exclaimed:
                  "Oh, Ret! here's Cousin Harry!"
                  The music suddenly stopped, and Ret came forward, holding her hand out to me. I
                     took it an instant and dropped it, for I was awake at last! When I entered the
                     room she and Carr were standing at the piano, his arm around her waist, and the
                     bright smile upon his handsome face told me how happy he was. I hardly looked
                     at Miss Latour when Carr introduced me, for I was watching Miss Harwood, and
                     noticing the embarrassment of her manner. Women know things by intuition, and I
                     suppose she knew that I knew how matters stood between her and
                     Charley. We talked a little about my absence and about the changes that had
                     occurred while I was away, until I asked for a renewal of the music.
                  "Come, Cousin Lucy," said Herbert, "come, sing that song once more."
                  "Yes, come on Lucille," said Charley, "there is another stanza. Listen, Harry,
                     to the sweetest music you ever heard. I mean the bass part, of course!" They went to the piano
                     again and Ret remained upon the sofa.
                  "You were singing when I came in," I said to her; "I hope you will allow me to
                     hear you once more."
                  "I was not singing; I do not sing," she answered.
                  The song commenced again and we were silent. When it was finished, I selected
                     an English song and asked Miss Latour to sing that. She complied with a great
                     deal of grace, and sang it charmingly, her little accent making it only more
                     piquant. She speaks one language about as fluently as the other, though I think
                     she prefers her native tongue.
                  "I owe you a drubbing, Master Harry," said Charley, when we were all out on the
                     verandah, "for going away without seeing me, and I intend to give it to you
                     now. Herbert, go get your foils and masks."
                  "Oh, that will be charming!" said Miss Latour. "Here, you shall fight on the
                     lawn, and I will crown the victor;" so saying, she began to collect some
                     flowers, which were growing luxuriantly all around the verandah, and with
                     nimble fingers twined them into a wreath.
                  "Well, I know whose temples that wreath will adorn," said Charley, grasping his
                     foil. "Come on Harry, and meet your fate!"
                  "I have already met it!" I answered, as I followed him. As I passed Ret I
                     caught her eye. She had heard me and was looking at me earnestly and sadly. Oh,
                     Ret! does she know how miserable I am?
                  I went through the salutations mechanically, and there were two or three
                     introductory passes before I gave my attention to the business on hand. She was
                     sitting there looking at me, and suddenly I determined to conquer. Carr was
                     fencing with his accustomed skill and confidence, but I attacked him
                     vigorously, and at last touched him slightly on the breast.
                  "Hit, by Jove!" he said, dropping his point.
                  "Not quite, not quite!" exclaimed Miss Latour, dropping her hands, "Try
                     again."
                  "Yes," I said, "we won't count that. Come on."
                  We struggled five minutes longer, and Carr's hand raised suddenly, and I knew
                     he was going to give me his favourite thrust, en
                        seconde. If I had not caught it so frequently before in our
                     various encounters he would have had me, but I parried the thrust and disarmed
                     him the next instant. I bowed to him, and taking off my mask, I knelt at the
                     little French lady's feet, while she placed the wreath on my head.
                  "How pale you are," she said, as I rose.
                  "Am I pale?" and I felt the blood rushing back to my face.
                  "No, not now. Charles, mon ami," she added in
                     French, "what a handsome fellow your friend is?"
                  "Very," said Charley in the same language, "and he also understands
                     French!"
                  Miss Latour blushed scarlet, and everybody else laughed. She made some slight
                     attempt at explanation and apology, and as Carr continued to laugh, she ran
                     into the house. During the morning Miss Harwood made two or three attempts to
                     entertain me, but I could perceive the restraint which she tried to hide. If it
                     were not for the ever present dread that she also knows that I love her, I
                     think I could better endure my own sorrow. But the thought that she has
                     penetrated my secret, and pities me, drives me mad! I would have
                     pleaded business in town and left; but my horse was put away, and I had not
                     energy enough to make the effort. I knew that Carr would oppose, and I did not
                     wish to contend with him. He was so obstreperously happy and jolly that my long
                     face must have offered a fine contrast. Herbert hung about me, and asked
                     several times "what the dickens was the matter with me?" After dinner Charley
                     and I lighted our cigars and walked out on the lawn. I had put my arm through
                     the wreath and it attracted his attention as we started for our walk.
                  "Look here, Harry," he said, "I am going to fight you again for that
                     wreath."
                  "I'll give it to you," I said, "that is if you won't tell Miss Latour."
                  "I'd rather fight for it," he said.
                  "Well, here are the foils. Let's have it out at once."
                  "With this understanding," said Carr, "I am to hit you once, to make us even,
                     and then I am to hit you again for the wreath."
                  "Agreed." He was very eager, and in a few minutes he had the prize on his arm.
                     Why should I grudge him this poor triumph?
                  "You did not fence half so well this time," said Charley, doubtfully.
                  "Indeed, I did my best. The ladies were not looking at us this time, and I
                     missed the inspiration."
                  
                  "By Jupiter! I believe I lost this morning because she was looking
                     on," said Carr. "Hubbard, my friend, I am going to tell you a secret."
                  "Let us sit down here," I said. Now, I thought, if there is enough manhood in
                     me to endure the formal recital of all that I had seen, it will be put to the
                     test. We sat down in the shadow of a fig tree on the lawn, and he was too much
                     interested in his own happiness to notice me very closely.
                  "I am going to be marriedâ€”"
                  "So I supposed," I answered calmly. "Come now, skip all about your happiness
                     and her sweetness. I will take all that for granted."
                  "Well, I thought while Herbert was getting the foils and we four were standing
                     together on the gallery, that we would make two very passable looking couples
                     to stand up before the parson."
                  "No doubt about the beauty of the ladies anyhow," I replied, "and the less we
                     say about their partners the better."
                  "I am sure your beauty is established upon the very best
                     authority. Poor Lucille! She never dreamed of your understanding French. You
                     see we have been talking about you during your absence, for I had set my heart
                     upon having you for groomsman, and Lucille has been anxiously waiting to
                     inspect you, to see if you would do."
                  "Have you consulted Miss Harwood on the subject?" I asked. I was holding myself
                     in an iron grasp, trampling upon a thousand thoughts, as they arose in my
                     mind.
                  "Undoubtedly. She approves of my choice entirely. Dear Ret gives you credit for
                     first knocking the foundations from under my free-thinking theories. I told her
                     of our conversation on the subject, just before I went to New Orleans. You know
                     I am no longer an infidel."
                  "I am heartily glad to hear it, dear Carr," I replied, shaking his offered
                     hand. "And now, dear friend, will you do me a kindness, a real
                     kindness?"
                  "Why, Harry! what ails you?" answered Carr, in amazement at my excitement. "I
                     will do anything you ask me."
                  "Then do not talk to me any more about your marriage until the time arrives."
                     He gazed with wondering eyes at me as I continued. "Dear Charley, since I saw
                     you last something has happened. I know you will not ask me what it is, but I
                     tell you this muchâ€”something has occurred to me since we parted, or has been
                     revealed to me at least, that has inflicted a wound which no time can heal. I
                     look for nothing in this life but grace to endure. Alas! I am not the
                     lighthearted boy to whom you were so kind, and who learned to love you so soon.
                     I am a man, old in sorrow and in self-denial. Do not look at me with those
                     sorrowful eyes, or I shall break down."
                  "I suspect I know, or guess, Harry. It was in Baltimore, was it?"
                  "No. Don't ask me any questions," and I stamped violently. "I only wish to say
                     to you that while the wound is so sore any talk of marriage maddens me. Will
                     you bear with me a little while?"
                  "Surely. If you would rather not be groomsmanâ€”"
                  "But I am not going to allow you to recall that invitation. I hope I am equal
                     to the emergency. My new manhood is hardening day by day, and I shall be placid
                     enough soon."
                  "And happy, Harry, I hope."
                  "Nevermore," I said, pressing his hand. "When are you to be made happy?"
                  "Next month, I hope. She says October. I wanted to be married sooner. But she
                     vows she won't be married this summer."
                  Her last words to me were that she would not be married this summer!
                  "It is all settled then," I said, as we walked toward the house. "I will be
                     ready when you want me."
                  The ladies and Herbert were seated on the verandah. The boy had a handsome cane
                     in his hand which he brought to me, saying bashfully:
                  "I wanted to make a nice speech, dear cousin Harry, when I gave you this.
                     Please take it with my love. I got Charley to buy it for me while he was in New
                     Orleans, but you went away before he got back. I wrote to him the day after you
                     and I were swimming."
                  "I thank you, cousin, for your beautiful present, and I shall value it very
                     highly for your sake. Why, it is a sword cane!"
                  "Yes, pull it out," said Herbert. The blade is broad and strong, and as long as
                     the cane. It is truly a formidable weapon.
                  "I walked down Chartres street," said Carr, "after I received Herbert's letter,
                     and I met Captain Delaney in one of the stores. He was buying a cane exactly
                     like this, and I thought I could trust his judgment. You see it is not at all
                     like the ordinary blades you find in
                     sword canes. It is a regular sword blade, and if you can manage it as well as
                     you did the foil this morning, you need not beâ€”"
                  "But you have got the crown," said Lucille.
                  "Yes, ma belle. We fought for it fairly. I hit him twice, plump and fair, and
                     he was obliged to relinquish it."
                  I came away at dark. After I got to town I tried to write a brief account of
                     the day's proceedings, but I had been subjected to severe tension all day, and
                     there was a reaction. I feel wonderfully calm now, and wonderfully miserable
                     too.
                  After I had tried in vain to record in my diary all that I have now written, I
                     started out for a walk. I suppose it was nearly or quite ten o'clock. I walked
                     out on the Baton Rouge road, and noticed nothing until I arrived at the bank of
                     the Manahio. I wanted to go to the Laurels. I don't know why, but I was first
                     conscious of this desire when I found the creek rippling between me and the
                     trees. The obstacle only served to interest me a little, but did not cause me
                     to alter my intention for a moment. I slipped off my boots and trousers and
                     waded across at the usual ford, and then sat down on the soft grass and
                     dressed. I had enough sense left to remember that there might be snakes in the
                     long grass, and to replace my boots. I then walked into the grove and sat down
                     at the root of one of the big trees. I heard nothing but the chirp of ten
                     millions of insects in the trees, the croak of frogs in the distant bayou, and
                     the murmur of the stream. I thought of the affectionate boy whose life I had
                     saved at that spot, and tried to resolve that I would exert the influence I
                     might have over him to do him good, not only for his sake, but also for the
                     sake of another who loved him. I tried not to think of her, but it was so
                     recently that she sat there just before me, while her horse pawed the ground
                     impatiently. Then I thought of the legend which had peopled this locality with
                     horrors, and I rose to my feet involuntarily and glanced round the grove. Why
                     should I deny that I felt my heart thumping painfully against my ribs as I
                     descried a figure slowly and noiselessly advancing into the area? There was a
                     cloud over the moon and I could only see the outlines of a tall form, which
                     seemed to be human, but which moved without a sound. I had my new cane in my
                     hand, and instinctively drew the sword, and advanced a step from the shadow of
                     the tree. As I drew near I thought I recognized Misty, and a moment after he
                     spoke.
                  "Young chief come back? Welcome! Shake hand!"
                  I slipped the sword back into the sheath, and cordially greeted my old friend.
                     He was very much changed in appearance. He still wore his hunting shirt, but
                     the leggings were gone. He had a tomahawk and knife in a broad belt, which also
                     bore a bullet pouch. His powder horn was suspended under his left arm by a
                     thong, and he carried his rifle in his hand. On his head was a cap made of
                     raccoon skin, with several feathers stuck in it. There was no sign of
                     intoxication about him. Altogether he looked like a warrior. He noticed my
                     surprise, and spoke again.
                  "Misteono hunter no longer. Warrior again. Let the young chief go to Indian's
                     wigwam, and get the skin of the tiger cat. Misteono dressed it for young
                     brother."
                  "You don't mean to-night, my friend?"
                  "No, no!" he answered. "Bime-by. Brother find the skin and take it. Misteono
                     going away."
                  "Where are you going, chief?" I asked.
                  "Yes, chief again! Misteono's tribe is on war path. Chief going to lead
                     them!"
                  "When are you going, Misteono?"
                  "Soon go. Want one scalp to take back to my tribe. Get it bimeby."
                  At this instant I heard voices and the tramp of horses' hoofs. The Indian held
                     up his finger to enjoin silence, and listened intently. The sounds came nearer,
                     and I heard some one say,
                  "Not to-night, dâ€”n it. I don't half like this neighbourhood after dark!"
                  "Pooh! don't be a fool!" said the other. "Come on, I want to look at these
                     trees." I thought I recognized this voice, and almost as he spoke the two came
                     into view, through the bushes. They saw us, just as I recognized Captain
                     Delaney and Becket. The latter wrenched his horse round, saying,
                  "There are the Densons, I swear!" and he galloped off, followed by
                     Delaney. The moon was shining on their faces, and I could detect the look of
                     horror which sprang into them as they caught sight of us in the shade of the
                     trees. In a few minutes we lost the sound of their horses' hoofs.
                  "Cap'n brave warrior," said the Indian, "he not come back to-night. Young chief
                     going back? Misteono go to wigwam. Good night."
                  This was a queer adventure, and it has set me to thinking. I will overhaul
                     those letters again to-morrow. I have an idea! I am happy to say that I am
                     weary at last, and I believe I shall sleep a little.
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXI.
               RECOGNITION.
               
                  
                     THURSDAY, August 5, 1836.
                  
                  I HAVE read a little of yesterday's record to-night, and I am half ashamed of
                     myself. I am twenty to-day, and ought to be man enough to endure the rubs of
                     this life. I have been going about to-day, and feel much more like my old self.
                     Perhaps I may be able to look back upon these trials when the wounds heal up,
                     and see how they have done me good. If this wedding were only over, and the
                     whole thing finally settled!
                  Mr. Gowrie keeps a store here, and ships cotton for the neighbouring planters.
                     He is a thorough Scot, with high cheek bones and sandy hair and whiskers. He
                     takes snuff, and it is a treat to see him helping his little turned-up nose to
                     its refreshment. He is snappish and cross-grained, but is honest and
                     intelligent. I think he is rather a favourite with his clients. I walked down
                     to his establishment this morning, as I saw Becket there, and wanted to hear if
                     he was telling his adventure of last night, but he was not. He and Gowrie had
                     been disputing about the shipment of some cotton, and as I stepped upon
                     Gowrie's gallery I heard him say,
                  "I'll no do it, Maister Becket. I wadna alter my books for the whole Harwood
                     plantation."
                  "I might as well talk to a stone as to you," replied the overseer. "Good
                     morning, Mr. Hubbard. By-the-bye, you are from Maryland. Did you ever go down
                     to the mouth of the Chesapeake in one of those pungy schooners that do the
                     turtle fishing?"
                  "No, sir."
                  "Well, I have. I'll tell you how they manage the beasts. After
                     they get them on deck, they just head them off till the turtle gets his foolish
                     head against the mast. Then they are safe. They will keep butting away at that
                     mast while the voyage lasts. We always called them Scotchmen,
                     because they were so darned obstinate and stupid. Good morning," and he rode
                     off.
                  "Ay, ay," said Mr. Gowrie, "walk in, sir. So yon chap is a countryman of
                     yours?"
                  "I don't know, sir. I am a Marylander, but I never saw him until I came here.
                     May I ask what the difficulty is between you?"
                  "Oh, just nothing. I have always shipped the Harwood cotton, and I believe the
                     young leddy has been investigating Mr. Becket's accounts. Anyway, he wanted me
                     to give him a statement of shipments under false dates, but I would not do it.
                     That's all."
                  "You were perfectly right, sir," said I.
                  "Why, one might as well tell a lie with his tongue as with his pen, ye know. I
                     am too auld to begin that business."
                  "I am sure you would never violate the truth, Mr. Gowrie. 
                        
                           'Lord of the Isles, my trust in thee
                           Is strong as Ailsa rock.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "Ay, ay," replied the Scot dryly. "But I wadna quot at all, if I were you,
                     unless I could quot correctly."
                  "Do you mean, sir," said I, half amused and half offended, "that I have
                     misquoted Sir Walter."
                  "Just so. Sir Walter never wrote the lines as you quot'd them."
                  "I would be willing to lay a small wager that you are mistaken, Mr. Gowrie. I
                     read Sir Walter very constantly, and the passage from the Lord of the Isles I
                     read only to-day."
                  "Weel, it is a puir cause that has to be bolstered up by a bet," and Mr. Gowrie
                     walked into an inner room and returned with a well thumbed volume. "Here is the
                     book, and ye can satisfy yourself."
                  I soon found the passage, and sure enough I had changed a word. "It is 'firm' as Ailsa rock, Mr. Gowrie. I acknowledge my error."
                  "It is no guid to be too positive, ye see," said Mr. Gowrie, with a grin of
                     satisfaction. "I was sure of the case, because I know the pome almaist by
                     heart; besides, I am weel acquaint with the locality, having seen Ailsa Craig
                     more than once, when I lived in Glasgow."
                  "Are you from Glasgow?" I inquired, with sudden interest.
                  "Yes, I was born near the city, and lived there a gude mony years."
                  "Did you ever know or hear of Hector Macailan, of Linmuir?"
                  "Macailan!" and he stared at me with astonishment. "And where did you hear that
                     name?"
                  "I have seen the name in some family papers in my possession. If you know
                     anything about this laird, I should like to ask you a question or two."
                  
                  "Ye may ask the questions, and I'll tell you no lies if I am not able to give
                     you the information you want."
                  "Did you know Mr. Macailan, of Linmuir?"
                  "Yes, I knew such a mon."
                  "Did you ever see a Mr. Denham, who visited Mr. Macailan thirty years ago?"
                  "It is just possible that I did. I'd rather ye wad not be so particular about
                     names, ye see."
                  "Well, then, please answer me one more question. Have you ever seen here, in
                     Carrville, anybody that knew Macailan, or that you knew in Glasgow?"
                  "Come into the back room, Mr. Hubbard. Jamie! Jamie!" A small likeness of Mr.
                     Gowrie answered the summons and came forward. "Keep a look out a wee bit,
                     laddie. I am gaun into the counting room. Call me if anybody comes." So saying,
                     he led the way into his counting room, at the back of the building. He handed
                     me a chair, and then perched himself upon a high stool that stood at the
                     desk.
                  "Ye seem to be a respectable young mon, Mr. Hubbard. I have seen you twice at
                     the church, and ye listened to the minister instead of gaping round the church,
                     as most young men do. I think the better of you, too, because ye can read
                     Walter Scott, I'll find ye plenty of young men in this town that can quot' 'Don
                     Juan' for you by the yard;â€”but not many that ever heard of 'The Lord of the
                     Isles.'"
                  "Walter Scott is a great favourite of mine, sir; though he is rather hard upon
                     Presbyterians sometimes."
                  "Weel, let him have his fling! What was it you were wanting to ask? Ye need not
                     just call people by their names. I can understand you without that."
                  "I have reason to think that a man is sometimes in Carrville, under a different
                     name, who once visited Mr. Macailan in Scotland. It concerns me very much to be
                     certain of the fact, as I might be able to thwart some evil intentions of
                     his."
                  "It is vera curiousâ€”but John Harwood said vera much the same thing to me the
                     night before he died."
                  "He probably had the same reasons." Mr. Gowrie looked at me very curiously.
                     "I'll tell you in confidence, Mr. Gowrieâ€”that I am related to the Harwoods,
                     though they do not know it, and I do not wish them to know it at present. You
                     need not hesitate to trust me. I hope I shall do whatever I do in the fear of
                     God."
                  "I'll no deny," said Mr. Gowrie after a pause, "that I have seen a person here,
                     and also in Pensacola, who vera much resembles a friend of Macailan's. He is an
                     aulder man than he was thirty years ago, but he looks vera much the same." Here
                     Jamie called his father, who slid down from his stool. "Ye need na' refer to me
                     as having given ye any information," he added, cautiously, as we left the
                     officeâ€”"ye know that I am only positive about a resemblance after all!"
                  I am going to Harwood again to-morrow.
               
               
                  
                     FRIDAY, August 6, 1836.
                  
                  This has been an eventful day. I spent most of the morning in a revision of
                     Ret's bundle of letters, and I came to the conclusion that the lead-covered box
                     is hidden somewhere in the Haunted Laurels. The three trees stand in a
                     triangleâ€”almost a right angle. I have seen them again to-day, and have decided
                     just where the probable spot is, namely, on a line between the two trees most
                     remote from each otherâ€”because that line is the hypothenuse of the triangleâ€”and
                     nine feet from the tree that stands on the margin of the creek. I had noticed
                     several times the relative position of these trees, and the other night when I
                     was there I remember that the well known problem about the "sum of the squares
                     of the base and perpendicular being equal to the square of the hypothenuse,"
                     kept coming into my mind. That, joined to the fact that Delaneyâ€”who has somehow
                     got some information on the subjectâ€”had the hardihood to visit the spot near
                     midnight, occurred to me while I was writing in my journal, after I had
                     returned to town on Wednesday night. I am going to make a thorough
                     investigation to-morrow.
                  After dinner, when I had the pleasure of seeing the spruce captainâ€”who however
                     did not pay any attention to meâ€”I got Mr. White's horse and went to Harwood. I
                     stopped at the Laurels only long enough to notice the exact localities a little
                     more particularly. I am hastening to record my interview with Ret, which is to
                     me the most interesting of the events of the day.
                  The doors and windows were all open when I reached the house, but no one was
                     visible. I rang the bell, and Phany came immediately. I asked for Miss Ret, and
                     learning that she was at home I walked into the drawing room, while Phany went
                     to announce me. When she came I was startled to see that she wore a white
                     dressâ€”though there were black ribbons about her person. She looked so differentâ€”but oh, so lovely! There was
                     also something in her manner betokening her constant consciousness of her
                     approaching happinessâ€”a nervous and hurried manner of speaking. Heaven forgive
                     me!â€”I cannot help feeling that she does not love Charley Carr as
                     much as she thinks she does! But I have promised myself to bury that subject
                     out of sight.
                  "Lucille has gone with Charles and Herbert to Mr. Maltby's," she said, after a
                     few commonplaces about the weather. "Lucille wished to ride Midnight, and I
                     have been left to my own resources all day."
                  "I am glad it has so happened," I answered, "as I want to talk to you a little.
                     Carr has asked me to assist at a certain ceremonyâ€”"
                  "Yes, yes!" she said hurriedly, "he told me. Are those the letters you got from
                     me?"
                  "Yes;" and I gave her the packet. She touched a bell on the table, and Phany
                     appeared.
                  "Phany, go bring the black box from my room. You have done with the letters?"
                     she said inquiringly.
                  "For the presentâ€”yes. Though I have something to say to you about them."
                  "That will do, Phany," said she, as she took the box. The boy vanished, and she
                     replaced the packet in the closet in the chimney jamb. She then resumed her
                     seat, and looked at me, waiting with apparent anxiety for the next word.
                  "When you gave me the letters I presume you thought your cousins in Baltimore
                     were Barnard Harwood's widow and children; is it not so?"
                  "Certainly."
                  "They are not. Mrs. Harwood is the widow of Allen Harwood, who was supposedâ€”"
                     She had leaned forward, covering her face with her hands, and I saw the tears
                     coming through her fingers. I never could endure the sight of a grown woman
                     shedding tears, and I was greatly shocked.
                  "Miss Harwood! Ret! shall I ring the bell? You are ill!
                  "No, no!" she said, without looking up. "Go on."
                  "I have a letter here which Mr. Harwood left for his son. I thought you perhaps
                     would like to read it, and have brought it with me."
                  "Oh yes!" she said, taking my father's letter. "Will you excuse me a little
                     while? There are some books on the table. I will return presently."
                  I waited a long timeâ€”it seemed hoursâ€”but she did not return. I opened the
                     booksâ€”but I don't know what they were about. Then I went to the piano, and ran
                     my fingers over the keys. There is a composition of Beethoven's which I learned
                     long agoâ€”I forget the name of itâ€”and I began to play it. As I went on with it I
                     grew calmer and sadder. While I was playing she came back. She stood by the
                     piano, and I thought the melancholy strains of the music affected her, for her
                     eyes were still moist.
                  "You seem to play with great feeling," she said, when I left the instrument.
                     "You don't look as happy as you should be."
                  "Who? I? I am not happy. Are you pleased to know that your relations are not
                     the family of Barnard?"
                  "I have been in my room," she answered, gravely and solemnlyâ€”"trying to thank
                     my beneficent Father for the unspeakable joy this letter has brought to me;"
                     and she gave me back my letter. "I cannot understand why you should feel
                     differently."
                  "I was intrusted with another letter," I said, and I gave her my Mother's; "if
                     you will read it now, I will go back to Beethoven;" and I went through the
                     piece again. I looked round at her once or twice while I was playing, and I saw
                     her brush the tears from her eyes as she refolded the letter, though her face
                     was like sunshine.
                  "Do you know the contents of my letter?" she asked.
                  "Not one word of it."
                  "I will perhaps let you see it at another time," she said, putting the letter
                     in her key box; "I want to read it again before I decide upon that point. And
                     now please to tell me why you are not happy."
                  "Do not ask me, Miss Harwood."
                  "You called me 'Ret' just now!"
                  "Did I? Pardon me, I did not know it until it was too late."
                  "You wished me to call you cousin Harry two months ago. Have you changed your
                     mind since then?"
                  "No indeed! I wishâ€”"
                  "You wish what?"
                  "I wish I might venture to call you cousin Ret," I said.
                  "Well, you may, cousin Harry. You see I set you the example. Didn't you risk
                     your life to save Herbert's?" she said impetuously, the tears springing to her
                     dear eyes again.
                  I took her hand and kissed it. Oh how near I was to an insane confession of
                     everythingâ€”my relationship, and my love! I don't know what restrained me. I walked away to the
                     window, and stood there, with my back to her, resolutely choking down every
                     thought and impulse while I reflected that I must tell her before long that I
                     was her cousin, as I was not willing to wait upon her bridegroom under an
                     assumed name.
                  "You will not allow me to offer you any consolation because you will not tell
                     me why you require it. Something has occurred since you left Louisiana, which
                     you have not told me?"
                  "You are so much changed since I first saw you," I replied, avoiding her look.
                     "Then you were composed and self-possessedâ€”though you were sad;â€”now you are
                     nervous and impetuousâ€”yet I do not believe you are much less melancholy.
                     By-the-bye, I will bring Burton out to you to read."
                  "You also are changed since you saved Herbert's life. Before, you were cheerful
                     and apparently contented;â€”now, you are moody and restless andâ€”mysterious."
                  "I cannot tell you the cause of my unhappinessâ€”because I know your kind heart
                     wouldâ€” Oh cousin! there is an impending calamity ever before my eyes! I cannot
                     escape itâ€”do what I will. And I am trying to fortify myself in advanceâ€”trying
                     to see clearly the path of duty and honour, and trying to banish every selfish
                     consideration that might lead me astray. It is a dire struggleâ€”but
                        you cannot help me. I must go through this trial alone."
                  "You have told me nothing about my cousin Alice and her children," she said
                     suddenly; "are they well?"
                  "Quite wellâ€”all of them."
                  "Are you sure?"
                  "Yes. I saw them the day I left Baltimore. They are all well and happy."
                  "I shall ask you no more questions, but I intend to unravel this mystery in my
                     own way. Have you seen Captain Delaney?"
                  "Yes," I replied, with a start; "it was about him that I wished to talk to you.
                     I saw him at midnight on Wednesday at the Laurels."
                  "What were you doing at the Laurels at midnight?"
                  "Iâ€”nothing. I was not well and could not sleep, so I walked out there and
                     stayed an hour. Never mind me, but listen to what I have to tell you."
                  "Stop a moment!" she said, while the blood rushed into her face. "You were here
                     on Wednesday. Did Charles say anything thingâ€”do anything that displeased or
                     troubled you? Answer me, if you please."
                  "Nothingâ€”nothing! Carr has been my constant friend, and has never given me a
                     moment's painâ€”at least not intentionally." She looked steadily at me while I
                     spoke.
                  "What were you saying under the fig tree yonder? I saw you from my window, and
                     I saw that you were violently agitated."
                  "You must have fancied that. Carr was telling me about hisâ€”marriage"â€”I got the
                     word out with an effortâ€”"and we talked about very little else."
                  "What did he say about me?" she asked, quietly.
                  "Nothingâ€”except that you did not object to my participation in the ceremony."
                     As I looked into her bright eyes and upon her burning cheeks I almost gave way
                     again, but I did not. "If you don't want to drive me mad please talk about
                     something else."
                  "I am satisfied. Now for Captain Delaney!"
                  "In the first place, then, he has written a letter which he signed 'Mark
                     Denham.' I saw it, and I saw him in Baltimore. The writing is precisely like
                     that in those letters signed 'Nemo' in your packet. If you remember Allen
                     Harwood's letter to his son you will recollect that a Mr. Denham informed him
                     of your father's death fifteen or twenty years before it occurred. I believe
                     Captain Delaney was the author of that epistle, also."
                  "Do you think he is Mark Denham?"
                  "I do. While I think of it, I wish to say that he is very intimate with your
                     overseerâ€”Becket. I have seen them frequently together. Becket was with him at
                     the Laurels the other night. They saw me and the Indian half hidden in the
                     shade of the trees and took us for ghosts of the Densons. They were frightened
                     and galloped away. Now, this Denham is capable of any villany, and I think you
                     should watch your overseer."
                  "He is going to leave Harwood next week. I have reason to thinkâ€”indeed I know
                     that he is not strictly honest. Herbert has undertaken the management of the
                     plantation himself."
                  "I advise you to keep watch in the meantime. Do not think me foolish; but I am
                     labouring under a constant presentiment of evil to come from the hands of this
                     bad man. Will you ask Herbert to invite me to stay here at night for three or
                     four nights to come? Don't look at me so reproachfully! If the evil that I
                     dread threatens you I would be here to guard you."
                  "I am sorry you think a formal invitation necessary. While Herbert lives and while I live you will be more
                     than welcome at Harwood, at any hour, day or night, for all time to come."
                  "I thank you, and I regret that I asked for an invitation. I will
                        happen to be here then. Now, please understand the case. I
                     don't want to say anything to Charley, because I don't want to alarm him, and I
                     don't want him to know all that we know. It would seem to be more proper for
                     him to stay hereâ€”"
                  "It would be very improper," she said, her cheeks burning again. "Your
                     arrangement is the best."
                  "Well, let Herbert ride a little way with me this evening on the near road to
                     town. If I once see the road I shall know it hereafter. I want to walk out here
                     after dark and return early in the morning. I want to happen to
                     visit you ladies and Herbert for two or three evenings consecutively. I will
                     bring my violin and some music, and if I am so forgetful as to remain until
                     late you will offer me the hospitality of Harwood. Is it agreed?" She bowed her
                     head. "Well, now about the lead-covered box. I believe it is buried in the
                     Laurel Grove, and I believe Denham thinks so, too. I have been jumping at
                     conclusions female fashion latelyâ€”"
                  "Female fashion! what do you mean, sir?"
                  "I mean, by the exercise of that rare faculty of intuition by which women
                     arrive at facts without the trouble of logical deduction. You need not frown,"
                     I continued, laughing, "it is a much higher faculty than any possessed by men.
                     Do not suppose, I implore you, that I am so base as to think or speak
                     slightingly of women. I have a Mother and two sisters."
                  "Yes; I know you have," she answered, composedly.
                  "Indeed! and where did you get the information?"
                  "From various sources. From Mr. Hamilton, after you went away, and from
                     yourself before that, and from other testimony since you returned."
                  A light suddenly dawned upon me. What a blind ninny I have been!
                  "Oh, Ret," I said, "do you indeed know that I am your cousin?"
                  "How could you doubt it, cousin Herbert! how could you otherwise account for my
                     behaviour! Do you think Mr. Hubbard, with all his fascinations, could have
                     arrived at the present stage of intimacy with my Father's daughter!"
                  I suppose I looked as bewildered as I felt, for she threw herself back in her
                     chair and laughed heartily.
                  "When you have done laughing," I said pettishly, "I should like to ask you a
                     question."
                  "I am sober again, cousin," she answered, wiping her eyes; "but you looked so
                     comical just now that I could not help it," and here she went off again.
                  "I suppose you and Carr have amused yourselves enormously at my expense," said
                     I, beginning to get in a rage.
                  "Come, sir, that is unkind and impolite," she replied, gravely; "no one knows
                     your secret. I don't know why you changed your name, but I have never felt at
                     liberty to tell even Herbert. I don't know when I first began to suspect you,
                     but you sealed the packet of letters when you returned them the first time with
                     that seal on your watch chain, I suppose. Let me see it. Yes! it is the Harwood
                     arms and motto, 'Che sarÃ¡ sarÃ¡.' I thought
                     you were Barnard's son, and I have had many a good, quiet cry since you went
                     away, thinking over those fatal letters."
                  "Please keep the secret a little longer, dear cousin. I want to circumvent Mr.
                     Denham, and I am stronger while he is ignorant of my true name. But I did not
                     change my name," and I told her all the story, just as it occurred.
                  "You are remarkably bashful, indeed, sir," said Ret, when I had concluded; "but
                     I can understand how you allowed the mistake to pass at first and how the
                     peculiarity of the position embarrassed you with each addition to the number of
                     acquaintances. Pray, how do you intend to enlighten everybody when you resume
                     your own more euphonious name?"
                  "I don't intend to trouble myself about that," I answered indifferently; "so
                     that my friends understand the ease I care nothing about vox populi."
                  "If you will allow me to say so, cousin, I think this is a defect in your
                     character. I have seen it manifested more than once. You owe it to yourself and
                     to society to maintain a spotless reputation in all things. I do not mean that
                     public opinion should have the slightest influence upon you where any principle
                     may be involved, but you are bound to see that your influence over men is not
                     damaged by your indifference. Your influence is a talent for which you are
                     responsible to God, who gave it."
                  "If I had you for my mentor, dear cousin," I answered sadly, "my life might be
                     made to accord with the perfect lawâ€”so far as poor humanity can attain to
                     perfection."
                  "You have been blessed with a far better mentor," she said, blushing a little; "here is your Mother's
                     letter. You may read it now." As the letter is not long I will copy it
                     here:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 BALTIMORE, July 12, 1836.
                              
                              
                                 My dear Cousin:â€”Herbert's intelligence of his new
                                 found kindred in Louisiana has filled me with gratitude to God for
                                 His goodness, and wonder and adoration for His special providence.
                                 All that I know of you, my dear, I know from reading my son's
                                 journal, and as I know that he has written nothing but the truth, I
                                 have learned to love you though I have not seen you. I have left
                                 him to select his own time to reveal himself, under the name he
                                 bears, to every one in that far-off country who has been deceived
                                 by his careless indifference. He thinks you have not penetrated his
                                 secret, but I can see that you know him. As I am well acquainted
                                 with all the circumstances attending the early life of my dear
                                 husband, I know that the children of his cousin John would have
                                 been peculiarly dear to him if he had lived to see them. And Lean
                                 also understand how easily you were led into the supposition that I
                                 and my children were the family of Barnard Harwood. If we had heard
                                 of your existence in the same way we should have arrived at the
                                 same conclusion concerning you. I feel that I shall see you some
                                 day and will love you the moreâ€”the more I know you. Herbert does
                                 not know what I have written. He has not asked to see this letter.
                                 Write to me, my dear child, and believe me
                              
                                 Your loving cousin,
                                 ALICE HARWOOD.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  "And now, sir," said Ret, imperatively, as I gave her back the letter, "I want
                     to see your journal, if you please."
                  "Not for a million worlds!" I exclaimed, starting up in horror.
                  "I desire to know, sir," continued she, without noticing my exclamation, "what
                     you have written about me."
                  "That is precisely what you must not know," I replied. "Mother is a wonderfully
                     wise woman, but she don't know everything." She was silenced. No
                     doubt she conjectured some part of the truth. I'll be hanged if I don't believe
                     she would discuss the matter of my loving her with every drop of my blood, with
                     every breath I draw, and with every impulse of my life, in as cool and
                     businesslike a manner as possible. She would demonstrate the folly of my
                     passion, and show me how the straight path of duty must be pursued through a
                     life of self-denial and usefulness. It is all true, but these reflections do
                     not restore to my heart its former vigorous and cheerful pulses.
                  I came away just as Carr and his companions returned. Herbert came all the way
                     to town with me, and took my violin and music out with him. I have promised him
                     to walk out to-night after mail duties are over.
                  HARWOOD.â€”MIDNIGHT.
                  When I had finished with the mail, I walked over to the hotel and went into the
                     playing room. Judge Carr was there, playing euchre with Captain Delaney. I was
                     seated at one of the tables near them, and overheard Delaney say "game!" Mr.
                     Carr looked anxious and excited. They whispered a while, and then Delaney said,
                     loud enough for me to hear, as he was shuffling the cards, "the whole debt now
                     against the mortgage. Cut!" I walked over to their table and held out my hand
                     to Mr. Carr, as I had not seen him before since my return. He shook hands with
                     me and was very affable.
                  "Will you please let me say a few words to you, sir," I said. "I must get some
                     information from you before the mail closes."
                  He rose from his seat, and I led the way out of the room. He followed down
                     stairs and stopped when I reached the street.
                  "Where are you going, Mr. Hubbard?" he said.
                  "Only to the post-office, sir. Please walk down there with me. I will not
                     detain you long."
                  I let myself into the office, and then went through the door into the
                     store-room, and admitted him. I lighted a candle, and we sat down for a
                     talk.
                  "I bought the Copper stock for you, sir."
                  "Good Heavens! Did you not receive my letter?"
                  "No, sir. I got no letter from you. Mr. Callahan did not know your Christian
                     name, and he has filled up the certificate in my name. There is a form of
                     transfer on the back, and I will fill it up at once, if you will tell me your
                     initials.
                  "I am not able to pay for this stock, sir," said Mr. Carr, in great excitement.
                     "I wrote to you immediately after you left, directing my letter to the Hudson
                     Hotel, as you told me. I have drawn all the money my crop will bring, and more
                     too."
                  "That is a matter of no consequence, my dear sir. I paid for the stock with my
                     own money, and you can repay me whenever it suits your convenience. The stock
                     is enormously valuable, and you can sell it to-day at twenty times its
                     cost."
                  "If this is true, Mr. Hubbard," replied lie, absently, "why should you not take
                     the stock yourself?"
                  
                  "I should be very glad to have it, Mr. Carr; but, of course, I shall do no such
                     thing. I do not need the money, and if you don't wish to retain this stock, I
                     will order Mr. Callahan to sell it at once for your account. You will receive
                     enough to replace the value of your crop for this year at least."
                  "Please let the matter stand, then, as it is," he said, rising; "I will see you
                     again to-morrow. I must go back to Delaney. He will be impatient."
                  "Mr. Carr." He stopped. "I did not bring you here, sir, merely to talk about
                     the stock. I implore you to get your horse, and go home without seeing Delaney
                     again. I know that he is a great scoundrel, and I know that he is
                     cheating you."
                  "By what right and upon what evidence do you dare to say so?" said Mr. Carr in
                     astonishment. "Do you know that your life would not be worth an hour's purchase
                     if I repeated to Delaney what you have just said?"
                  "I will save you the trouble of repeating it, sir," I answered coolly; "if you
                     go back to the playing room I shall go with you, and say it to Delaney
                     myself."
                  "Are you mad, Mr. Hubbard? Delaney would shoot you with as little compunction
                     asâ€”"
                  "I do not fear to incur the risk, sir. I happen to know some portion of his
                     former history, and I know he is a villain. If you wish to hear what evidence I
                     have of his present rascality, I will tell you that I saw his handkerchief
                     spread over his knees just now, and saw the knaves of hearts and diamonds lying
                     upon it. He intends to play them at the proper moment, and get possession of
                        the mortgage." He started as I said this, and I went on. "If
                     you will get your horse and go home it will be the best course. I will walk
                     with you as far as Harwood. If you decide to go back and lose the mortgage, and
                     thus leave Charley pennilessâ€”for I know how much you are involvedâ€”I swear to
                     you that I will prevent it, by charging Delaney with his thieving before all
                     the people in the room. If I cannot otherwise prevail upon you to quit playing
                     with him, at once and forever, I will try this last step. In honour you do not
                     owe him one cent, so your debt to him is nothing. Be persuaded, sir, to go with
                     me to-night, and think over the matter. You can ruin yourself as well
                     to-morrow."
                  He was vanquished. We went back together to the hotel, and looking into the
                     playing room we saw Delaney engaged in a four-hand game.
                  "You must excuse me to-night, Delaney," said the Judge, "I have to go home at
                     once."
                  Delaney nodded to him, glanced darkly at me for an instant, and we left. I
                     walked beside Mr. Carr's horse as far as this house, and when we parted he
                     grasped my hand with great fervor.
                  "You have awakened me, my young friend, to a sense of duty to myself and my
                     son." Here he held up his right hand and continued solemnly: "I swear, before
                     God, that I will never gamble again." After a little pause he went on. "I have
                     also decided finally about the Lake Shore stock. Unless you lose
                     by your kindness in attending to this business for me, I shall never take the
                     stock. It is yours to sell or retain, as you please."
                  "My dear sir, you do not believe what I tell you. The stock is worth ten or
                     twelve thousand dollars."
                  "So much the better for you. I have thought over the matter, and shall not
                     change my determination. It is yours. Good night, and God bless you."
                  He thinks he has settled the matter, but I also have decided. I shall sell the
                     stock, take out my five hundred dollars, and give the balance to Charley.
                  We had a lively time in the drawing room. Lucille, who is a darling little
                     woman, played accompaniments for me. After playing an hour she called Ret to
                     take her place, and she and Carr walked out on the verandah. I have a
                     composition called "Echoes from the Mountains," which is more of a duett than
                     any of my other pieces. Lucille refused to attempt it without preliminary
                     practice, and Ret asked for it at once. I set the piano part up before her, and
                     she played it without hesitation. She seemed to catch the ideas of the
                     composer, and we went through it delightfully. Herbert looked on with
                     astonished eyes, as I went through the gymnastical part of the
                     performance, playing high up on the finger board, and dealing largely in
                     harmonics. The listeners made us repeat the performance, and were loud in their
                     applause. Ret plays wonderfully. Oh, how sweet would have been my life if I had
                     been permitted to win her for my life's companion! It was quite late when Carr
                     left, and Herbert brought me up here to "my room," as he calls it. "It is your
                     room always, cousin Harry; nobody else shall ever sleep in it. Ret says
                     so."
                  Since he left me the house has become quiet, and I have been sitting here
                     writing ever so long. It is time I was seeking "tired nature's sweetâ€”"
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXII.
               THE CRISIS.
               
                  HARWOOD, SATURDAY NIGHT, August 7, 1836.
               
               I WAS interrupted last right. There was a tap at my door, and when I opened it
                  there stood Ret and Herbert in the hall.
               "Somebody is trying to get into my room, cousin," said Ret. I knew you had not
                  retired, as I saw your light and heard your pen going." She spoke with perfect
                  composure, while Herbert, who had his gun, was full of excitement.
               "Where is your room?" said I.
               "Here across the hall. The window opens on the verandah roof. Some one is on the
                  roof cutting the shutter."
               "Is there a light in your room?"
               "No."
               "Cousin Harry," said Herbert in a whisper, "let me go down on the lawn while you
                  go to Ret's window. Maybe I'll get a pop at him when he tries to get off."
               I stepped softly into the room and listened. I heard the knife cutting into the
                  shutter in the thin part of the panel. Herbert had gone down stairs. I had my
                  sword cane but no firearms. I put out my hand to open the shutter, when some one
                  touched me. It was Ret.
               "Do not incur any needless risk by your rashness, cousin," she said with a
                  tremulous voice. Before I could answer some one on the lawn said, in a loud
                  whisper,
               "Come down! They are awake!" and I heard Herbert's gun go off with a bang. I
                  dashed the shutter open and caught a man by the collar as he was retreating from
                  the window. His face was covered with black crape. He had a large knife in his
                  hand, which he dropped in the short struggle. In a moment I was thrust back into
                  the room and the robber gained the edge of the roof. He seemed to hesitate about
                  leaping down, and while he paused I slipped through the window, sword in hand.
                  Before I reached him he leaped, and I heard Herbert's second barrel. I took the
                  sword blade in my mouth, and feeling for the spout with my hand, I let myself down
                  from the roof, and was on the lawn in an instant. But it was dark as a wolf's
                  throat, and nothing was visible. Presently I heard voices in subdued whispers at a
                  little distance, and calling out to Herbert to follow, I ran toward the sound.
                  There was a momentary shuffling of feet, and then I heard the hoof strokes of
                  horses as the marauders galloped off. Ret and Herbert were on the verandah when I
                  went back.
               "Are you hurt?" said the former, anxiously.
               "Not a bit; but the rascals are off. What did you shoot at, Herbert?"
               "At a man on the lawn. I heard him whispering, though I could not see him. I hit
                  him though, for I heard him swear when I fired."
               "And your second shot?"
               "Was at a fellow who tumbled off the roof. I missed him, I know."
               "Well, we may all sleep in safety now. They will not be back to-night," said I, as
                  we reentered the house. "Cousin Ret, where will you sleep?"
               "In my own room," she replied.
               "If you would feel safer, Herbert and I will sit up and play chess all night."
               "No, you shall not; I am not afraid. You may come and see how much damage is done
                  to my shutter."
               There was not much harm done; the fellow had marked out a square place in the
                  panel just over the bolt, and had chipped away a little of the wood. If he had
                  succeeded in getting the piece out, he could have put his fingers in through the
                  hole, and drawn the bolt back. As we refastened the shutter I saw her black key
                  box on the table near the window.
               "Ah, here was the attraction!" I said. "Do you keep the box here usually?"
               "Always."
               "Good night then, Cousin Ret; do not hesitate to call me if you are alarmed again;
                  but you will not be disturbed again to-night."
               "My debt to you is getting larger," she said, as I left the room.
               "Pshaw! Go to sleep and forget it, then;" and so I left her. Herbert declared he
                  would stay; but she sent him out after me. He reloaded his gun, and slipping back
                  into bed, vowed he would "keep awake any how." I told him I would read awhile
                  then, and in a few minutes he was sound asleep. I put out his candle and came back
                  here to "my" room.
               We agreed this morning that we would say nothing about the night alarm. Lucille had not been awakened, and the
                  servants did not appear to have heard the shots. Ret sent Herbert to see if Mr.
                  Becket was on the plantation; but he came back with the information that he had
                  ridden to town the evening before and had not returned. He is to leave on Monday.
                  He says he is going to Florida to take charge of a plantation there. I asked Ret
                  this morning, as she and I promenaded the verandah before breakfast, if Becket
                  could possibly know where she kept her keys. She said he doubtless did, as she had
                  sent Phany or Chloe for the box several times when he was at the house. He also
                  knew that the box contained the key of the iron closet, as he had seen her open it
                  recently, when she was settling his account.
               "I have concluded," said I, still reasoning female fashion, "that the robbers last
                  night were Becket and Denham. I saw them together in the gambling room at the
                  hotel."
               "Are you in the habit of spending your leisure time in that intellectual
                  amusement?"
               "I? I never gamble, Cousin."
               "What were you doing in the room last night?"
               "I went there after Mr. â€” a gentleman I wished to see."
               "Was it Uncle? I won't insist upon an answer," she said, as I was silent; "but I
                  am sure it was he."
               "It was; but he will go there no more. He solemnly promised, when he left me last
                  nightâ€”here at your gateâ€”that he would never gamble again."
               "Tell me all about itâ€”every word!" and she stamped her foot impatiently.
               "Come sit down here then, you tyrant. I pity your future husband." She looked at
                  me with an indescribable expression, and I told her all about it.
               "Please don't say anything to Charley. I would not have told you, or any one else,
                  if I could help it. I ought not to tell you, as it is none of my business."
               "What are you going to do with your stock?" she asked. "I won't tell anybody
                  anything you tell me."
               "I have no stock. If you mean this Lake Shore mine, I am going to send it to the
                  broker to sell, and I am going to give the proceeds to Charley."
               "Let us go in to breakfast," she said, rising.
               We played "Echoes" once or twice afterwards, and then I took my cane and walked
                  down to the Laurels.
               I crossed the creek dry shod, at a narrow place half a mile above the ford, where
                  there was a large tree fallen across the water. I then walked down the Manahio
                  road to the haunted grove. It was about nine o'clock, and the morning was lovely.
                  I had walked briskly, and had got pretty warm; so I took off my gloves, coat and
                  vest. When I reached the Laurels, and pushed my way through the bushes, I saw a
                  man in his shirt sleeves, with a spade in his hand, kneeling over the spot I had
                  selected as the probable locality of the lead-covered box. He had a tape measure
                  in his hand, and was ascertaining the distance from that spot to the near tree. It
                  was Captain Delaney.
               "What the devil are you sneaking about here for, sir?" he said fiercely, starting
                  to his feet. "Begone while your skin is whole!"
               This temperate and soothing salutation had the natural effect upon me. I kept down
                  my rising passion, but I felt in every bone of my body that the hour had come for
                  my struggle with that rascal.
               "You forget yourself very strangely, sir!" replied I, haughtily. "As I have not
                  the honour of your acquaintance, I should like to know by what right you address
                  me at all."
               "It is just possible," he said, after looking steadily into my eyes, and finding
                  that I returned his stare without flinchingâ€”"it is barely possible that you may
                  have brains enough to take your slim body away from this neighbourhood before I
                  knock them out of your head."
               "And it is also barely possible that you may find out that I am not to be scared
                  by the mouthing of so poor a bully as you are. There is nothing very terrific to
                  me about Captain Delaney or Mr. Mark Denham."
               He stooped down and picked up the spade, and then took a step toward me. I dropped
                  my coat and vest, and drew the sword from my cane.
               "So!" he said, pausing, "you would prefer a hole in your lank body, instead of a
                  crack on the crown? I give you one more chance, if only because you have had pluck
                  enough to brave me thus far. Will you apologise for your insolenceâ€”and go, and be
                  dâ€”d to you?"
               "It does not require any particular amount of pluck to brave a gentleman of your
                  calibre, Mr. Denham. I have no apologies to make, and I am not going away until I
                  get a certain lead-covered box for which you are searching."
               
               He threw the spade into the bushes, gathered up the tape-line, and took his cane,
                  which was leaning against the tree. It was precisely like my own. He drew the
                  blade out and threw the scabbard down at the foot of the tree, with the tape-line.
                  He then saluted gracefully, and, advancing a step, crossed his blade with mine.
                  While we fenced, he talked:
               "It is almost a pity to put so promising a youth out of his misery," he said; "but
                  your knowledge is so extensive, that it is dangerous to society for you to be at
                  large any longer."
               All this time he was trying my skill, changing his parades with great celerity,
                  and keeping me tolerably busy in parrying his thrusts. Captain Joli's "principles"
                  stood me in stead rarely to-day.
               "I thought the same of you last night, sir, when I spoiled your little adventure
                  at Harwood;" he winced a little, but kept on fighting; "and I intend to see that
                  you are not allowed to cheat poor old men out of their inheritance, or to rob
                  defenceless women, hereafter. Your role in this locality is about
                  over, sir." I was trying to get him into a passion, but he was cool as ice.
               "You might have got off with the loss of your ears," he replied, "if you had not
                  made that last remark. I am surprised to find that you should be bold enough to
                  aim so high in your regards as to the lovely Miss Harwood. Her estimate of you is
                  probably much lower than you suppose."
               "I also had the pleasure of making your journey to Baltimore of no avail; as I
                  revealed the secret of your identity with the charming Captain Delaney, and also
                  with the correspondent of your friends, who took leave of society about this
                  locality five years ago." He sprang back a step or two, and stood gazing at me
                  with an astonishment which he did not try to conceal. I watched him narrowly,
                  expecting him to dart suddenly upon me. "I am not fighting a duel with you, Mr.
                  Denham. If you will go quietly away, and leave Carrville never to return, I will
                  not interfere with you. I know you to be a great scoundrel, and I can satisfy
                  anybody that knows you, that you are not entitled to the name of gentleman; but if
                  you will go, I will be silent on the subject, and leave you in the hands of
                  God."
               "Who the devil are you?" he said at length.
               "No matter. I am a gentleman, and I will keep my word. Will you
                  go?"
               "Not until I kill you. No man ever braved me thus and lived! You will be dead in
                  five minutes!" and he advanced again to the centre of the area and assaulted
                  me.
               As I look back upon that final encounter I remember that I thought the man's
                  muscles must be made of steel. He evidently meant to kill me, and I was beginning
                  to think I would have to kill him to save my own life. I had depended upon cowing
                  him by the revelations I made, but I had calculated upon encountering a man of
                  different metal. I could feel the vigour of his strong arm at the very point of
                  his weapon, and once or twice his sword glanced past my throat almost grazing it.
                  He did not strike at my body at all. The advantage with me was solely in that I
                  was defending myselfâ€”not attacking him. But I soon found that he calculated upon
                  this forbearance and pressed me more fiercely. He had not touched me, when I took
                  advantage of an opening, and slipped my blade into the fleshy part of his arm,
                  just above the elbow. I saw the shirt sleeve become crimson in a moment, but he
                  only ground his teeth and fought with a little more caution. I was cooler than I
                  am now while I write about it. Neither of us uttered a word, and there was no
                  sound except the stamp of our feet as we traversed the little area, and the
                  continued rasping of steel against steel. I think we fought fall fifteen minutes
                  in this way. At last he struck at my breast with a fierce lunge en tierce, and, as he recovered, I thrust my sword
                  through his wrist. I saw the point as it came out through his arm, and he dropped
                  his weapon as I withdrew my own. In another moment he was upon meâ€”my sword again
                  passing through his shoulderâ€”and gripping my throat with his left hand, he bore me
                  to the ground, and knelt upon my body. I was virtually disarmed, as my blade was
                  still in his shoulder, and I saw him feeling in his bosom for the knife, which he
                  at last drew out with his wounded hand. I mentally offered a brief prayerâ€”for I
                  thought my hour had comeâ€”when I heard the crack of a rifle, and my enemy rolled
                  over on the grass.
               I thought he was dead, as I sat there beside his body, trying to get back the
                  breath he had nearly choked out of mine, but a convulsive twitching of his limbs
                  showed me that he still lived. I then kneeled over him, and saw that the bullet
                  had entered his right breast. There was not much blood issuing from the wound,
                  though his right sleeve was red from the shoulder to the wrist. While I stood
                  irresolute, trying to decide what ought to be done, I heard a horse splashing
                  through the water at the ford. I ran
                  out of the grove and met Doctor Markham as he rode up the bank.
               "Oh, doctor! God must have sent you here!" I exclaimed. "Come quickly! there is a
                  man dying here in the grove!"
               "The deuce!" answered the doctor, "and what may be the nature of his disease,
                  Burton?"
               "Oh, come, doctor! he will bleed to death!"
               "Bleed!" and the doctor dismounted and followed meâ€”"why didn't you say he was
                  hurt? Hitch my horse, please. Why it's Delaney, by all the gods!"
               "Yes, sir, and I am afraid he is killed." The doctor opened his shirt bosom and
                  looked at the wound; then he told me to get his saddle bags. When I got them he
                  opened one end and took out a case of cruel looking instruments, and, selecting a
                  probe, he passed it carefully into the wound. Delaney groaned.
               "I am afraid you won't groan very long," said the doctor, rising. "Burton, we must
                  get him to some house. It is too far to town. I wonder if we might take him to
                  Harwood?"
               "Is it too far to Maltby's?"
               "Yes," answered the doctor, decidedly. "His only chance is to get him to some
                  place with as little motion as possible. Jump on my horse and ride over to
                  Harwood, and ask Ret if I may take him there; and if yes, bring four niggers back
                  with you, with a door and a pillow."
               "A door?"
               "Yes; take some door off its hinges to carry him on. Have you lost what little
                  sense you used to have? Be off!"
               I picked up my sword, wiped the blade on the grass, and replaced it in the
                  scabbard, and unfastening the doctor's horse, I galloped back to Harwood. When I
                  arrived I rode up to the verandah and called Herbert out of the parlor.
               "Send your sister here, dear Herbert. I want to see her alone, just a moment." She
                  heard me, and came out as her brother retired, his eyes dilated somewhat beyond
                  their usual dimensions.
               "What has happened?" she said, pale and tremulous; "there is blood on your hands
                  and face!"
               "It is Denham's. I am afraid he is dying, or dead! Some one shot him near The
                  Laurels, and Doctor Markham has sent me to tell you that his life depends upon
                  prompt treatment, which can be given no place but here. He will die, Markham says,
                  if we attempt to carry him to town or to Maltby's."
               "What shall I say? Do you decide the question," she answered.
               "He will die, anyhow, I believe. He is shot in the breast."
               "Did you do it?" she asked, coming a step nearer and speaking in a lower tone.
               "No, thank God! Yet he would have killed me in another minute. I was in his power,
                  and his knife was almost at my throat. I will tell you hereafter. Herbert! Captain
                  Delaney has been severely wounded down on the creek, and Dr. Markham thinks he had
                  better be brought here. What do you say?"
               "By all meansâ€”hey, Ret? You know uncle is his friend. We can put him in the spare
                  room on this floor."
               "Go back, then, cousin," said sheâ€”"take some men with you. Herbert, brother, go
                  attend to it. I will have the room prepared."
               Herbert got his horse, and we were soon on our way back to The Laurels with four
                  stout negroes, who bore a stable door and a pillow. When we arrived we found
                  Denham was conscious. The doctor had bound up the wounds on his arm, and was
                  giving him water from the creek. He was placed carefully on the door, the pillow
                  under his head, and Herbert started with his negroes, crossing the creek at the
                  ford. I walked beside the doctor's horse as we followed them.
               "Are you going to tell me what your share of this business is?" asked the doctor.
                  "What did your bloody sword mean, and who has been making the holes in Delaney's
                  arm, cutting two arteries, and doing other mischief?"
               "I believe I gave him all the wounds except the shot, doctor," replied I. "He
                  first insulted me very grossly, and then assaulted me. I met him by accident, and
                  when he attacked me I was obliged to defend myself. I stabbed him in the arm on
                  purpose, as I did not wish to kill him."
               "If I had not arrived when I did he would have bled to death. You severed two
                  arteries, one of them a large one. Who shot him?"
               "I don't know. He had me down and was about to cut my throat when I heard the
                  shot, and he tumbled over."
               "What the deuce set you to quarrelling? I thought you were a peaceable young
                  man."
               "So I am. I tell you he swore at me, and at last attacked me with his sword. I was
                  compelled to fight or run, andâ€”"
               "Well?"
               
               "I had never learned to run."
               "I cannot imagine where the bullet came from," said the doctor, after we had gone
                  a half mile in silence. "It is out of reachâ€”probably in the lung. The man will
                  die, Burton, I think."
               "The shot came from this side of the creek, doctor. No one could have seen us from
                  any other quarter. Besides, I remember that I was lying with my head towards the
                  stream, and he was kneeling on my breast. My sword was sticking in his right
                  shoulder, and I could not draw it out, pinned as I was to the ground. I tried to
                  get it out, as I wished to put it through his body, and I must have hurt him
                  horribly in the effort."
               "His shoulder is very much lacerated, and the artery is divided, I think,"
                  answered the doctor. "I could not decide positively without a more thorough
                  examination. But the wound in the wrist is a dangerous one also."
               "I had to give him that to get his sword from him. He fought like a devil, as he
                  is. Why, sir, he did not make one thrust at me, except the last, that was not
                  addressed to my jugular. I have been within half an inch of death twenty times
                  this morning."
               "You are not to blame, Burton," said Dr. Markham, after musing a little, "but here
                  we are. The room is on the ground floor you say?"
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               BARNARD HARWOOD.
               WE followed the negroes with their unconscious burden, and they entered a room
                  from the verandah. It is built in an angle of the side wall of the house, and
                  communicates with the main building through a side passage which separates the
                  library from the breakfast room. The doctor directed the arrangement of the door,
                  so that he could operate on both sides of it, and dismissing the negroes, who very
                  willingly vanished when Markham opened his surgical case, he asked Herbert if he
                  would like to assist him, while he looked for the ball. I know the boy is brave as
                  a lion, but with white lips he begged to be excused. The doctor laughed and let
                  him go.
               "Now, Burton," he said, taking off his coat, and preparing coolly for his work of
                  butchery. "I know you are not afraid to help me a littleâ€”hey?"
               "If you want me, doctor," I answeredâ€”"my stomach feels a little weak, thoughâ€”what
                  shall I have to do?"
               "Take this saw and saw one of his legs off," and he handed me the murderous little
                  instrument. "Come, don't be an ass now! Reflect, that we are trying to save this
                  man's life, and that he will not suffer much, as he is nearly
                  unconscious. I shall only require a few minutes. Take off your coat, and then cut
                  his sleeve open without moving his arm. I want to get his shirt off." I took one
                  of the knives from his case. "Not with that, you whelp! You are a beautiful
                  operator to ruin the edge of your knives by cutting cloth with them! Take your
                  penknife."
               While I was cutting away the shirt from Denham's arm and breast the doctor went on
                  talking. He seemed to enjoy the prospect very much.
               "I have been quite lucky to-day, Burton. I was called up at two o'clock this
                  morning to pick half a dozen buckshot out of Becket's body. He was carrying his
                  gun carelessly, like a fool as he is, and it went off and sprinkled his legs
                  beautifully. One shot was within a hair's breadth of the femoral artery. He'll be
                  laid up for a month. By-the-bye, I promised to ask Herbert to send his traps to
                  him to the hotel. Please to remind me of it."
               "Yes, sir. When did the accident happen to Becket?"
               "About one o'clock, I believe. Delaney came after me. They were preparing to go on
                  a pan hunt, as they call it. Have you got the shirt off? Now, help me to turn him
                  gently on his left side."
               Delaney groaned a little as we moved him.
               "Now, Burton," said the doctor, "just hold him steady. I am going to find the
                  bullet somewhere under the arm. You may shut your eyes if you don't like to see a
                  little cutting done; but hold him still! I shan't be long."
               He felt along the back with his fingers, then taking a keen little knife, he cut
                  away as coolly as if he were whittling a stick. In a minute he had the ball in his
                  hand.
               "I thought I felt it," he said. "So! that part is done. Now we have to secure the
                  brachial artery, and then we can put him to bed." He took the bandage off his
                  shoulder, and in a few minutes more he had tied the artery. My sword had cut it in
                  two.
               "I tied this round stone up in my handkerchief, and made a sort of tourniquet out
                  at the creek," observed the doctor. "He would have been dead in a few minutes. I
                  have been uneasy ever since, fearing it
                  would begin to spout again; but he is safe enough now. All we want is a stitch or
                  two."
               He revived a little as we laid him on the bed, and asked for water. I handed him a
                  drink, giving it to him with a spoon. I began to feel as anxious to save him now
                  as I had been to kill him a little while ago.
               "Where am I?" he said.
               "Never mind," answered the doctor. "You are as well off as you can be. Keep quiet
                  and we'll try to get you well."
               He closed his eyes again, then opened them suddenly and looked at me earnestly and
                  intently.
               "Is that Allen?" he asked. "I thought I killed him as well as John!"
               "Will you please to be quiet?" said the doctor. "Nobody wants to hear about your
                  killing people, Captain Delaney."
               "I'm not Captain Delaney; I am Barnard Harwood," said the wounded man.
               "He's out of his head," said the doctor, feeling his pulse. "It looks bad to find
                  his mind wandering in this way."
               "Don't be a fool, doctor," said Delaney, quietly. "I am not out of my head. Let
                  that youngster stay here with me and I'll be quiet."
               The doctor looked at me, and I nodded my head in acquiescence. I understood
                  everything now. Markham got some medicines from his saddle bags and left me,
                  directing me what to do if the patient became restless.
               "I am going to Manahio. Judge Carr is ill, the boy said. I was on my way there
                  when you met me at the ford. Delaney need not die from his wounds, with careful
                  nursing, but I think he will die, not withstanding. It looks
                  unpromising for him to be talking nonsense so early. He has no fever. I suppose he
                  knew he was at Harwood, and has got to wandering in his mind."
               "I don't think he is wandering, doctor. His real name is Barnard Harwood, no
                  doubt."
               All this was spoken in whispers on the verandah. Markham stared at me, as though
                  he suspected me of some slight tendency to insanity.
               "I'll tell you about it when I have opportunity, doctor. I think you ought to know
                  that he is in his senses. I am perfectly certain that his name is Barnard Harwood.
                  There are some family secrets that I have recently learned, and this is one of
                  them."
               "Do you know what he meant by 'killing John,' then? And do you know what he meant
                  by calling you 'Allen?'" The doctor thought this was what he calls "a
                  stumper."
               "Yes. My father's name was Allen, and I am said to resemble him in his young
                  days."
               "And this man knew him? Oh, well, I'll ride over to Carr's now, and will return
                  this way," and the doctor rode off.
               When I went back into the room the wounded man had his eyes open, regarding me
                  intently.
               "Come nearer," he said in a low tone. "You belong to my race, young gentleman. You
                  are Allen's son?"
               "I am. But don't talk now, cousin. I will tell you all you wish to know when you
                  are better. I thought you were Mark Denham. Try to go to sleep, and I will nurse
                  you as carefully as I can. I won't talk to you now," I added, as he tried to
                  speak. The doctor says you must be quiet. I will not leave you
                  without your permission, and while you are weak and helpless you shall have all
                  the kindness I can show to my nearest kinsman."
               "I don't want to die until I can tell you some things that you ought to know," he
                  murmured.
               "You won't die, the doctor says, if you will only keep quiet and calm," and I
                  pressed his hand. "Shall I read to you?"
               "Yes, Allen. Let me call you Allen. I know your name is Herbert."
               "Very well, cousin. Now, what shall I read?"
               "Anything you please," and he closed his eyes again.
               There was only one book in the room, and that was the best of books. I read from
                  the Psalms, then from the Gospels, concluding with the wonderful story of the
                  Prodigal Son. He was breathing quietly, and I thought he was asleep. I looked at
                  the strong man, lying there in pain and weakness, and all my hatred for his person
                  and character gave place to compassion and strong interest. He is my kinsman, and
                  he may live to amend his life!
               I stole quietly from the room, and walking round to the front verandah I found Ret
                  and Herbert there. I put my arm through Herbert's, and walked with him near enough
                  to his sister for her to hear our conversation.
               "Herbert, my cousin, I am going to tell you a secret, which you must keep a little
                  while. My name is the same as yours."
               "Are you my real cousin?" said he, astounded.
               "Yes, I am Herbert Harwood, the son of your father's own cousin Allen!"
               
               "Does Ret know? Oh, sister, ain't that jolly? But I'm not going to love you any
                  better, because I can't, you know."
               "Your sister will tell you how my name was changed. I am able to see now that it
                  was a kind Providence that so ordered it. Do you so regard it, cousin Ret?"
               "Yes, it is a case in which one is allowed to see that one's steps
                  are directed by a higher Power. Many things have occurred which, perhaps, would
                  not have happened if you had borne your true name at first. It is not probable
                  that we should have known each other to-day."
               "I have undertaken to nurse this wounded man, and the doctor says he may recover,
                  if he is carefully watched."
               "I have sent word to Mrs. Maltby that Captain Delaney is here, ill," she answered,
                  "and I think she will probably come here this afternoon."
               "He is not related to Mrs. Maltbyâ€”"
               "I know; but he has always been intimate with the Maltbys, and he has no other
                  friends in this parish. I thought I ought to send her word."
               "You were right, cousin." Herbert had gone into the house. I fancy that he half
                  expected Miss Lucy Maltby to drive over here with her mamma, and he went to change
                  his dress.
               "It is Barnard Harwood, cousin," I said, when we were alone. "He recognized me
                  since the doctor extracted the ball. He calls me Allen." She was looking at me
                  with astonishment. "He has done both of us much evil. I have forgiven him. Can you
                  forgive him also?"
               "I had forgiven him," she answered, "before you brought him here this morning. I
                  had my struggle. Perhaps I have more to forgive than you think I have."
               "What do you mean? Did you hear anythingâ€”"
               "No. I won't tell you what I mean now. It is a mere suspicion. I have read those
                  letters over and over again, until the various writers have become like people
                  with whom I have daily intercourse; and I have unconsciously filled up the
                  vacancies in the story with motives and actions, which may, after all, be the mere
                  product of my own imagination. I think Barnard has been a wicked man all his life,
                  but, for some reason that I do not fully comprehend, I have come to think that he
                  is, perhaps, not so much to blame as would appear from the letters."
               "Allen!" The voice came from Barnard's room. I hastened back to him. He was
                  awake.
               "I thought you said you would not leave me," he said crossly.
               "I have only been on the gallery. What will you have?"
               "Water. More, more!" he said, impatiently, as I gave him a drink. "Can't you
                  devise some better way than that? I cannot abide a spoon!"
               "The doctor says I must not lift your head up. He will be back presently."
               "Will you tell me where I am? The atmosphere of this house stifles me!" I did not
                  answer him. I thought he would be more excited if he knew he was at Harwood. "How
                  did you escape me?" he resumed. "I thought I cat your throat."
               "Some one shot you just in time to save me."
               "Ha! do you know who shot me? It is here in the breast. Is the ball out?"
               "The ball is out. I don't know who shot you. Never mind now. I'll read to you
                  again, shall I?"
               "Not at present. What did you read that old fable to me for? Do you think I am
                  fool enough to believe in forgiving fathers or in returning prodigals? Fathers
                  don't forgive, boy, nor do prodigals return!"
               "Yes they do, cousin. I know they do!" replied I, gently.
               "That is, priests have told you so. You should not say 'you know.' One of Allen
                  Harwood's most prominent weaknesses was his strict adherence to the truth. When he
                  said 'I know,' you might safely swear to the truth of his assertion."
               "You are not strong enough to argue now," I answered; "when you get better I will
                  have it out with you. I hear the doctor's voice."
               The doctor came in, felt his pulse, glanced at the bandages, examined his eyes,
                  and said he was "getting along."
               "How long am I going to live, doctor?" asked Barnard, quietly.
               "Who said you were going to die?" answered the doctor, roughly.
               "I say so; I am not a girl; you need not be afraid of alarming me. I
                  want to see Maltby."
               "You are not going to see anybody for a few days, except one person to nurse you.
                  Maltby may do that if you will keep quiet."
               "I am going to nurse him, doctor. Please stop at the postoffice and tell Mr.
                  White."
               "Why the devil can't you answer me," interrupted Barnard. "You know I shall have
                  fever presently, and will probably die. I want to see Mr. Maltby half an hour
                  while I keep my senses."
               
               "He is coming," answered Markham. "I passed his carriage on the road. If you will
                  not get excited you may see him a little while."
               "Can't you prop me up a little? I don't want to drink out of that damned spoon any
                  longer. You might put two or three pillows under my shoulders and head."
               "Very well; wait till Maltby comes. Do you feel any pain in your breast?"
               "Not a bit. I have no pain anywhere." He listened a moment and then added, "I hear
                  wheels. Maltby is coming. Go get some paper and ink, Allen, and do you and the
                  doctor take yourselves off when Maltby comes."
               We got his head and shoulders a little elevated with Maltby's assistance, and then
                  left them together. Dr. Markham and I walked out on the lawn.
               "He is going to die, Burton!" said the doctor. "I thought this morning he might
                  get over it. I wonder how old he is?"
               "Over fifty."
               "He looks much younger. You might as well let him talk if he wants to talk. It
                  won't make much difference."
               "Is it the rifle shot that kills him, doctor?" I asked, anxiously.
               "Certainly. The wounds in his arm are nothing. They would get well in time. But
                  his lung is torn to rags. He will die tonight or to-morrow. There are two or three
                  fatal symptoms about him."
               When we went into the house Ret said to me, "I have given orders to have Midnight
                  ready for you whenever you wish to ride. Order her when you want her."
               I thanked her with a look. Mrs. Maltby and Miss Latour were discussing the
                  propriety of the latter lady's taking the vacant seat in her carriage and spending
                  some days at Highlands. Lucille wished to go, but was doubtful about the propriety
                  of leaving Miss Harwood. Ret settled the point by saying, in her decided manner,
                  that "Lucille could drive over to Harwood daily to see her." The current
                  impression seems to be that I found Delaney wounded on the Baton Rouge road and
                  got the doctor to bind up his wounds, while I came here after the negroes to carry
                  him. No one but Ret and the doctor knows anything about my fight. There is no
                  reason why I should tell any one else.
               "Mr. Maltby says," remarked his wife, "that Delaney has had a quarrel with
                  somebody at the gambling room in town, and that they had a fight when they met on
                  the road. All the men carry pistols, you know."
               "I don't!" said Herbert, "and I never will, I think."
               "Charley don't," said Ret.
               "I don't, either," said I.
               "Neither do I," said the doctor; "if I get maltreated I have no weapons but
                  pills."
               "If you carry those knives I saw on Captain Delaney's bed just now," said Herbert,
                  "I think you are pretty well armed. They are a great deal worse than pistols.
                  You've got a saw, too," he added, with a shudder. "I saw it!"
               "You saw the saw!" said the doctor, laughing.
               "Yes, sir!" answered Herbert, "and I don't want to saw
                  it any more."
               I went round to Barnard's room and found Maltby busy writing. I asked the sick man
                  if I might ride to town and return in an hour.
               "No!" he answered, decidedly; "to-morrow you can ride where you please;
                     I want you to-day."
               "Can you sign, Delaney?" asked Maltby; "your hand is so bundled upâ€”"
               "I've got two hands," rejoined Barnard, "and I can write equally well with either.
                  Let me see what you have written. Tell the doctor to come in again before he goes,
                  boy. In five minutes."
               In less time than he had specified Mr. Maltby came into the drawing room and sent
                  the doctor and me to the patient. Markham felt his wrist and looked grave.
               "Pooh, doctor!" said Barnard, coolly, "I don't want you to give me hope of
                  recovery. You and I both know better. How long shall I be able to talk? Give me a
                  candid answer."
               "From six to twelve hours," answered Markham. "I wish I could cure you."
               "But you can't. Here, doctor," and he handed him a bank note, "please attend to
                  that poor devil, Becket, and tell him I have paid his bill. It was my fault that
                  he was hurt. Good-bye, doctor;" there was a momentary gleam of emotion on his
                  smooth face as he spoke; "you have been kind, and I thank you."
               "Would you like to seeâ€”any one? I have aâ€”friend in townâ€”Mr. Hamiltonâ€”who will be
                  too happy to come if you wishâ€”"
               
               "I thank you again, doctor, but my time is limited. I don't wish to see any one
                  to-day, except my nurse here." The doctor pressed his hand and went out of the
                  sick room. "Go after him, Allen; I shall sleep a little, I think. Keep within
                  reach of my voice."
               An hour later they had all gone. Lucille went with Mrs. Maltby, after we had had
                  luncheon in the breakfast room. Mrs. Maltby did not propose seeing the dying man
                  after her arrival. There was a gloom upon us all, and I think it was a relief to
                  Miss Latour and the Maltbys to get out of the neighbourhood. I was sitting in the
                  library conversing in a low tone with my cousins when Barnard called me.
               "Come, sit close to me," he said; "I want to talk to you while I can." His voice
                  was slightly tremulous and his face haggard.
               "Oh, cousin," and I knelt by his bedside and took his hand, "let me talk to you
                  about the dread realities upon which you are entering!"
               "Presently. Listen to me now. How much of my history do you know?"
               "All of itâ€”up to the time of your marriage and departure for America."
               "I have but little to tell you, then. My wife and I embarked for Baltimore, but
                  the vessel was driven out of her course by a long storm, and put into Pensacola.
                  We were the only passengers. My Alice died in a few weeks after we landed, and she
                  is buried in the cemetery at Pensacola. Lay me beside herâ€”will you?"
               "I will. Don't talk, if it distresses you."
               "It does me good. Mark Denham and his son found me at Mobile five or six years
                  ago. They were hunting your box which contains the Lacy diamonds. Denham had some
                  information and I had more. Let me say here that my wife died in happy ignorance
                  of everything but my idolatrous love for her. She thought my uncle gave me the
                  money I had, and although she gave me much information about the lead covered box,
                  she never suspected me of any ulterior designs. My uncle and his wife were
                  accustomed to converse with perfect freedom in her presence, and it was from their
                  conversation that she learned that the box was buried in a grove of three
                  remarkable trees on the edge of John Harwood's estate. My visit to Baltimore was
                  to find out the exact spot. If your father's papers revealed that, you baffled me,
                  and I came back no wiser. It was then that Becket gave me the exact locality,
                  though, he did not know it. He had opened a drawer in this house and found a
                  bundle of letters, and, stumbling on the right one, he read and remembered a
                  memorandum referring to the box."
               "On the hypothenuse of the angle, nine feet from its junction with the base," I
                  said.
               "Precisely. Go there to-morrow and get it. To resume: I did not rely entirely upon
                  Becket, and determined to see the papers myself. It was only to get a bunch of
                  keys and open a door. I have done more difficult things. But you thwarted me
                  again. This morning I provided myself with the needful implements, and would have
                  found the box, but you interfered the third and last time. You are a brave boy,
                  Herbert! I have never been met as you met me to-day, except by your father and
                  John Harwood. You have the rash courage of one and the calm self-reliance of the
                  other.
               "I must go back again now. Denham had got entangled in some visionary conspiracy,
                  and, in spite of my cautions, he was caught and hangedâ€”he and his sonâ€”"
               "The Densons!" I said.
               "Yes. He changed his name when he started on his insane crusade. There is some
                  legend current about his threatening to haunt the grove. You will think I am
                  unsettled in my intellect when I tell you that I saw somethingâ€”Pshaw!
                  it was some infernal delusionâ€”"
               "I was at The Laurels the other night, cousin, and the Indian, Misty.
                  We saw you and Becket."
               "You relieve me very much. I believe I was frightened, though the sensation was
                  new to me. I have faced real dangers more than once in my life and have ever borne
                  me as became a man of our race. But no matter. Go ask the girl if she will come
                  now and hear how her father died!"
               "I dare not!" I answered, shuddering.
               "Repeat what I have said. If she shows the slightest sign of repugnance I shall
                  not press it. But I have watched her in vain for three or four years if she does
                  not come."
               I found her alone in the library. When I delivered my message she rose at once,
                  pale and calm, and followed me. I resumed my old position, kneeling by the side of
                  his bed, and she stood near his pillow.
               
               "Have you divined that I killed your father?" he said, looking into her calm and
                  pitying eyes. She bowed her head without speaking.
               "Hear how it was done. I am not a murderer. I think John suspected me from our
                  first interviewâ€”or perhaps he had a hint from the Scotchman yonderâ€”Gowrieâ€”who knew
                  me. He was cold and distant always when we met. Twenty years had changed us both
                  in appearance, and he had not seen me since I was a mere boy. I had ridden from
                  Baton Rouge one night, late, and was going to Maltby's. I went out of my way to
                  look at those Laurels, and to see if they were haunted by anything worse than
                  myself. There had been some foolish stories afloatâ€”I think Carr was the authorâ€”and
                  something had been seen thereâ€”I never could learn whatâ€”but everybody avoided the
                  road after nightfall. I rode in among those trees and met John there. He had
                  doubtless come on the same errand. In my surprise I called him by name,
                  'John!'â€”and he answered, 'Barnard!' I cannot remember all that passed. We had
                  always quarrelled when we were young, and now he struck the last blow by referring
                  to my dead wife as the partner in my infamy. I answered so as to exasperate him
                  more and more, and when he was nearly beside himself with rage, I suddenly drew my
                  pistol, and said, 'You are armed, so am I. Count ten aloud and fire!' Our pistols
                  exploded together. The scar from his bullet is still on my neck. As he fell from
                  his horse he said, 'God protect my children!' and all was over. Now girl, curse me
                  before I die!"
               "May God forgive you, cousin, as freely as I forgive you," she answered, as she
                  knelt by me.
               "So!" he paused a moment, then went onâ€”"I rode directly back to Baton Rouge. I
                  have heard John's dying words every night since that night; and I think if I had
                  had a human heart I might have been softened a little. I did set myself to get
                  from Carr the mortgage he holds on the Harwood estate, and I would have cheated
                  him to gain it. I thought if I could burn that mortgage I should hear those words
                  no more! If I had won it I should have given back to Carr all my other winnings
                  from him. I tried to buy it from him, but he would never sell; and to-day I have
                  directed Maltby to pay itâ€”and to pay Carr everything else he has lost to me. I
                  never cheated, and I was probably clumsy in my first attempt. He quit playing
                  before I accomplished my design. And, children, I did not try to kill John. Even
                  while he was counting, I changed my mind, and when he called out 'TEN!' my hand
                  acted without my will. God knowsâ€”if there is a Godâ€”that I am innocent
                  of the intention!"
               A change, rapid and appalling, was stealing over his features.
               "Oh, cousin," I said, eagerly, "do not doubt that there is a Godâ€”infinite, eternal
                  and unchangeable in mercy. Oh, if you could feel as the poor sinner felt, of whom
                  I read to you to-dayâ€”the man who went to the temple to prayâ€”"
               "Is that you, my Alice?" he said, looking at Ret, "with sad and tearful eyes!
                  Look, love, at this beautiful land! We will live here in peace, and I will try to
                  find the religion you speak of. If it is made for sinners, surely I can meet the
                  conditions! And you, Allen! fie, fie! what have men of our name to do with tears!
                  Are you weeping for me, boy? The Indian shot me! I saw him! It was just, for I
                  shot him long ago. I was sorry when it was too late. Let him go free!" He closed
                  his eyes a few minutes, and when he looked at me again the terrible expression had
                  passed from his face, and he looked more like himself. "Say it again, boy," he
                  murmured,â€”and the sweet voice of Ret answered:
               "It is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came
                  into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief!"
               "It is Alice! No, it is my young cousin. Your tears are a comfort to me, children!
                  What did you read, Herbert? 'He saw him afar off!' God be merciful to meâ€”THE
                  sinner!"
               He was dead!
               Mr. Maltby came this afternoon, and has undertaken everything. I am going to start
                  for Pensacola with the body to-morrow. Since I have been here in my room writing
                  the shadows have grown longer, and now the sun has gone. I have been the more
                  sorrowful because I wounded him to-dayâ€”though my reason tells me that I could not
                  do otherwise. But when I think of his arm, and the bandages upon it, my heart
                  sinks and my eyes overflow. I could bear all the rest! I have avoided the society
                  of every one. Herbert was here an hour ago with a message from her. I sent him
                  away, saying I would see her to-morrow. It has occupied me, and perhaps comforted
                  me, to write all the afternoon. And now the sad story is all told.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               A YEAR LATER.
               
                  HARWOOD, Sunday, August 8, 1836.
               
               
                  IN an hour I am to begin my journey to Pensacola. All will be prepared, and I
                     have only to hail the first boat for New Orleans, and get the coffin on board.
                     Maltby has given me a well filled pocketbook, acting, as he says, under
                     Barnard's instructions. I hope to be back in two or three weeks. Charley was
                     here for a few minutes this morning; he did not dismount. His father is ill,
                     and he hastened back to him. I have hardly exchanged words with my cousins
                     to-day. They are going to Carrville, and there are other carriages gathering
                     about the grounds to swell the funeral procession. I cannot get up the least
                     excitement, in view of the trip to Florida, but am longing for the melancholy
                     duty to be finished. Mr. Hamilton is here, and there will be religious services
                     in the house. It is nearly time to begin them, and I must go down stairs. I
                     leave my portfolio here until I return.
               
               
                  
                     HARWOOD, Monday, August 30, 1836.
                  
                  Since I got back from Florida I have been occupied with various matters, and
                     this is the first night I have had access to my diary. To-morrow I once more
                     start for my home, and probably shall go to Europe before I return to
                     Carrvilleâ€”if I ever return. I found a letter from Mr. Callahan here, on my
                     arrival from Pensacola, in which he invited me to join him at once in New York.
                     And I received a second letter to-day enclosing a note from Mr. Alfred
                     Parchment of London, recommending me to go to that city without delay. There
                     has been so great a change in my circumstances since I wrote the last record
                     here that my whole life seems to be beginning anew. I will try to recount
                     events in order.
                  In the cemetery at Pensacola I found Barnard's vault without difficulty. There
                     was a single word carved on the marble frontâ€”"Alice." I caused his name
                     "Barnard" to be addedâ€”and saw his body placed beside his wife's. One day was
                     afterwards occupied in attending to some instructions of Maltby's regarding the
                     sale of Barnard's property in the beautiful little city. It was at last given
                     into the hands of Captain Delaney's lawyerâ€”who has since remitted the proceeds
                     to Maltby. He has paid the mortgage on Harwood, and has also paid Judge Carr's
                     estate (the Judge died during my absence) a large sum of money, which my cousin
                     said he owed Judge Carr. Herbert has received for himself and his sister fifty
                     thousand dollars in stocks, bonds, and moneyâ€”and I have inherited the remainder
                     of Barnard's estate. Already Maltby has paid me one hundred thousand dollars in
                     money, and he says there is valuable property still unsold in New Orleans and
                     Mobile. Barnard's instructions were full and explicit, and, with the exceptions
                     I have mentioned, all of my poor cousin's wealth is left to "his beloved
                     cousin, Herbert Harwood, son of Allen Harwood, formerly of Harwood House,
                     Essex." There has been no dispute about the will. Maltby is a lawyer, and has
                     observed all requisite forms, and no one has appeared to contest it.
                  Three weeks ago to-dayâ€”that is, the day after I left hereâ€”Ret and Herbert drove
                     down to The Laurels and dug up the box. It is now in the iron closet, and we
                     are going to open it to-night. Barnard directed Maltby to give me his
                     pocketbook after his death, and I found a memorandum in it which I will copy
                     here and then destroy. It is as follows:
                  "FACTS ABOUT THE â€”.
                  "Sir H. had determined to purchase for A. the plantation adjoining J. It is
                     undoubtedly the one now owned by C., and separated from the other by the
                     stream. A. declined, reason not known. Sir H. had brought the â€” to this country
                     to surprise A. with the gift, when he took possession of his plantation. There
                     was some danger of robbery, as Sir H. had incautiously revealed the value of
                     the â€” to one or two suspicious characters. He therefore decided to bury it,
                     instead of taking it back by way of the city. It is in a grove of remarkable
                     trees. All these are facts, and no other facts are known."
                  Herbert says they took none of the servants with them, because they did not
                     wish it known that anything so valuable was in the house. Herbert found the
                     spade in the bushes, and the box was near the surface. When they reached the
                     house, on their return, he carried it unobserved into the drawing room, and
                     locked it in the closet. We three know its history, and no one besides.
                  I met in New Orleans an old acquaintance from Baltimore, who was in search of
                     employment. He and Mr. Bayard are now in Carrville, unpacking the goods which
                     have arrived. I have been aiding
                     them for several days, though I have no longer any business connection with the
                     establishment. The people received the intelligence of my good fortune and of
                     my changed name with a great deal of interest. The belief is current that my
                     name, Harwood, has been assumed under instructions in the will. My intimates
                     know the truth, but they do not talk much about it, I suppose. Mr. Hamilton,
                     who has been always kind and friendly, is more kind than ever. He has always
                     some new question to ask me about my Mother and sisters. I think he listens
                     most intently when I talk of Alice.
                  I must go down now and open the box. Oh, shall I ever spend another night at
                     this house? I forgot to say that Carr's marriage is postponed on account of his
                     father's death. He was here today, but went home shortly after dark. He looks
                     melancholy, poor fellow. He and Ret had a long talk on the verandah, while I
                     beat Herbert two games of chess. Miss Latour has gone home. Not one word has
                     been spoken about the marriage by any of us. Mr. Hamilton told me of the
                     postponement.
                  MIDNIGHT.
                  We have opened the box and examined the contents. The certificate of the Wheal
                     Pentland stock is now in my pocketbook. It is transferable only on the books of
                     the corporation, by Allen Harwood, gentleman, his heirs, administrators,
                     executors or assigns. The probable amount of money it may represent does not
                     appear so enormous to me now as it did a month ago. The coins, about two
                     hundred, are mostly gold and silver, and none of us have ever seen any like
                     them. There is a sort of pedigree of several of themâ€”fully fifty, I supposeâ€”in
                     a little manuscript volume we found in the box. I hardly know what to say about
                     the diamonds. There are several other brilliant jewels, emeralds, rubies, and
                     amethysts, but the diamonds are in a separate box, and the name "Lacy" is on
                     the cover, both inside and out. There are finger rings, earrings and bracelets,
                     and one brooch and one necklace. It is the last mentioned that is the most
                     magnificent. I have not the slightest idea of the value of these jewels, and
                     Ret, who is a better judge, said her estimate would sound fabulous, and that
                     she would not name it. There is an inventory of jewels and coins, but no value
                     set down. Most of the coins are marked "unique" on the schedule. By-the-bye,
                     the inventory professes to be a "list of the Lacy coins;" and then a "list of
                     the Lacy minor jewels," and finally, a "list of the Lacy diamonds." As we sat
                     there, looking at the blazing gems, I thought how poor and contemptible they
                     were in comparison with one kind glance from her calm eyes. I am glad that I am
                     going away. I cannot endure her presence any longer. When she looks at me I
                     feel my heart bound, and the blood rushing to my face. She seems to know all
                     that I think; and once or twice to-night I caught her looking composedly at me,
                     while I was allowing my foolish imagination to picture a future, in which she
                     reigned queen of my life; and each time the conviction flashed upon me that she
                     knew my thoughts.
                  Who were the Lacys, I wonder?
                  On the night that Barnard died the Indian was here. He left the panther skin
                     with Herbert, who saw him, saying it belonged to "young chief Hubbard." Since
                     that night he has never been seen. His wigwam is empty, and the Indian has
                     goneâ€”somewhere. Mr. Maltby says he is a Seminole, and no doubt has returned to
                     Florida, to join the tribes now in arms against the whites. If I could feel
                     that it was an entirely just warfare waged against these savages, I think I
                     should volunteer; but there may be some fighting to be done in Texas, and I
                     have a longing for the wild, rough life of a frontier soldier, and very little
                     shrinking from the possible fate of such a warrior. If it were not for Mother
                     and my sisters, I mightâ€”
                  But I will not indulge these thoughts. I am going to walk into town early. They
                     made different arrangements down stairs; but I will have no leave-taking. I
                     have written on a card "good-bye, dear cousins;" and I shall leave it on my
                     portfolio, in which I once more lock up this melancholy diary. When shall I
                     open it again?
               
               
                  
                     HARWOOD, MONDAY, August 31, 1837.
                  
                  A whole year ago! I have returned in the nick of time. Charley is to be married
                     to-morrow! I thought it would have been all over, or I should have delayed my
                     arrival.
                  I have brought back with me a pair of magnificent whiskers. They were in embryo
                     when I left America last September; they have matured in Italy, and Greece, and
                     Egypt. Many days have I lingered in many a famous capital. I also imported an
                     entirely new manner. I have acquired from observation and long practice that
                     charming air of indifference, and indolence, and superiority which
                     distinguishes travelled men. Alas! I have not had the opportunity to display this last
                     acquirement. Old memories haunt me in this locality; and if I were boy enough
                     to turn back a leaf or two I should lose my manhood, as I recalled the events I
                     last recorded. Allons!
                  
                  When I reached Baltimore, a year ago, I learned that Mr. Callahan had been
                     there to see my Mother; and he had taken certain depositions from her and
                     others; got various certificates from the British Consul; and left a message
                     for me, instructing me to get my Mother's marriage certificate, and a certified
                     copy of the registers of my birth and the birth of Alice and Grace, and to
                     present myself with these documents at his office in New York as soon as
                     possible. I complied with all these instructions, and two days after my arrival
                     in New York I sailed for Liverpool. I might say a great deal about the
                     voyageâ€”the people I met on shipboard and in Englandâ€”but I don't feel in the
                     mood to-night. Hereafter, I may think it worth my while to recount some of my
                     adventures. I went to London; found Mr. Alfred Parchment, and was escorted by
                     that gentleman to Lavington, Lord Morton's residence in Devonshire. Here I
                     found my only surviving English kinsmen, namely, Lord Morton, and Sir Allen
                     Harwood, my father's first cousin. His brother, Sir Charles, had died before he
                     attained his majority. These gentlemen received me with cordial kindness, and
                     my entire European life was spent in their society. It was at the instance of
                     Allen, my beloved cousin, that Mr. Parchment had written for me. In a day we
                     were "Allen" and "Herbert," and while he lived, the intercourse between us two
                     was peculiarly close and intimate. I told him all my dearest secrets; and I
                     believe he opened his whole heart freely to me. His health was then very much
                     impaired, and his physicians had ordered him to the south of France for the
                     winter. Lord Morton was to accompany him, and it required very little
                     persuasion to induce me to join their party. Before we left England the formal
                     transfer of the Wheal Pentland stock was made to me, and as Lord Morton
                     vehemently opposed the sale of it, I still own it. I intend to pay my Mother
                     and sisters their proportion of its value, according to their inheritance under
                     American law; or I will transfer their proportion of the stock itself,
                     whichever they may prefer. I had no trouble whatever in the business. Mr.
                     Parchment had charge of Lord Morton's legal business, as well as Sir Allen's;
                     and as Mr. Callahan had obtained all the certificates that were requisite,
                     under Mr. Parchment's instructions, the matter was speedily settled.
                  On the banks of the beautiful Garonne, Lord Morton found a chateau, occupied
                     only by an old housekeeper, and we spent the winter there. Allen talked to me
                     about his boyish days; his college life; his early friends; his sickly brother,
                     who was so kind and loving always; and, finally, one glorious night, when the
                     moon was bright in a cloudless sky, he told me about his loveâ€”Mary Lacy. "You
                     seem like a dear brother, Herbert," he said, "and I am telling you what no
                     mortal has heard before." During his school-days, he spent his vacations at
                     Lavington, with his guardian, and he met her there while they were mere
                     children. Then in later years he encountered her in London society, when she
                     was in her first season. Then he learned that she was going to marry his friend
                     and her brother's friend, and the rest of his short life was spent in rooting
                     out the affection that had brightened that life from his boyhood. He told me
                     his story like a man, and spoke hopefully of a time to come when he might love
                     her without sin. She was a happy wife now, and never knew the throne she
                     occupied in his heart. Then I told him of Ret, and the brave gentleman, who had
                     laid bare his wounds to me with calm courage, was overcome by the recital of my
                     sorrows. "It is a luxury to sympathize with you, Herbert, because you are
                     healthy and strong, and will have to endure through life what I shall soon
                     escape. You don't know how thankful I felt when the doctor said the climate
                     here might do me good, as I understood him to mean that he had no
                     such expectation."
                  We went to Italy in the early spring; then to the Nile, and spent the summerâ€”or
                     the most of itâ€”in Greece. He came home a month ago, to die. "Che sarÃ¡, sarÃ¡."
                  I wrote to Mother from Paris, saying that I would go home by way of New
                     Orleans. I wanted to look once more into those dark eyes, so calm and quiet;
                     but I have seen them flashing with girlish merriment; I have seen
                     them kindle at the recital of some heroic deed, and I have seen them sparkling
                     in teardrops. And, now, that I have seen her, I am disappointed. She is not sad
                     any longer; she is not gay, but she is quietly happyâ€”brimfull, running over
                     with happiness. Oh, Ret! what a dog I would be if I could wish you
                     otherwise!
                  When I landed this morning, I got a horse and rode out here, like a crazy man.
                     I had only time to remember that I must be on my good behaviour, when I walked
                     into the house. I saw a white dress, then the wearer of it rushed upon me, with
                     an embrace and a little hysterical
                     scream, half laugh and half sob. It was Grace! then Alice, and then my Mother!
                     No ordinary man could maintain his gravity under such circumstances. My good
                     behaviour was forgotten in my bewilderment, while half a dozen were kissing me
                     and pulling me to pieces among them. Herbert's salutation was characteristic.
                     First he hugged me, then he stood off a yard surveying me, and then the
                     scoundrel saidâ€”
                  "Oh, golly! just look at his whiskers, Ret! Ain't they prime?"
                  He is a very trying young man to encounter, when one is endeavouring to
                     maintain one's self-possession. I gave up at once, and behaved naturally all
                     the evening.
                  Ret looks so superlatively happy. She and Lucille have had an overwhelming
                     quantity of private business to transact. I have seen her only by snatches all
                     day. Mother and the girls are also in full feather. They seem to have some
                     terrible secret among them, which they are keeping from me. They are here, in
                     answer to an invitation from Ret, which Mother says "she could not withstand."
                     I wrote to Herbert two or three months ago, telling him that I would come to
                     Louisiana first, and Ret wrote upon that text. Mother received my letter,
                     announcing the same intention, a day or two after Ret's invitation reached her,
                     and she answered the letter in person. I evaded her twice to-day, when she had
                     nearly cornered me for a talk; but she followed me into my room to-night, and
                     putting her arms round my neck, she whisperedâ€”
                  "Do you still love Ret, Herbert?"
                  "Yes, Mother."
                  "She is a lovely woman, my son!" I did not answer, and she handed me a box,
                     marked "Lacy." "Here are your diamonds, Herbert."
                  "They are yours, Mother. I never dreamedâ€”"
                  "Well, I give them to you. They are yours now."
                  "I can't wear necklaces and bracelets, Mother, and you surely don't want me to
                     sell them?"
                  "Do what you like with them, Herbert. Good night, my dear boy," and so she left
                     me.
                  I thought I would give them to Alice and Grace, but I have changed my mind.
                     Wait until to-morrow.
               
               
                  
                     TUESDAY, September 1, 1837.
                  
                  How much gratitude is due to God for creating so beautiful a world! I have been
                     blind hitherto! I have looked with transient sient admiration upon lovely
                     scenes in both hemispheres, but never until to-day have I seen the marvellous
                     beauty of the earth. I have just come in from a ramble in the woods, all the
                     way to The Laurels, and have brought back with me a handful of wild flowers,
                     mostly inodorous, but surpassingly lovely. I must arrange them presently and
                     take them toâ€”.
                  I had come to a definite conclusion about the diamonds this morning, and, after
                     breakfast, I went into the library with them to wait for an opportunity. I read
                     a bookâ€”read like a man stuffing for an examinationâ€”but I don't know what book
                     it was. At last I saw her passing through the little hall, and I called
                     her.
                  "Ret, cousin, please come here a moment."
                  "Please don't keep me long," she answered, as she came in. "I have
                        so many things to do."
                  "I know you have. Here, sit down. I want to ask a great favour of you," and I
                     shut the door. She looked surprised, blushed, and then grew pale as I produced
                     the jewel case.
                  "I want you to accept these and to wear them to-day."
                  "I won't!" she answered, and she moved towards the door. I slipped round the
                     table, and backed up against the door.
                  "You don't get out, madam, until you explain yourself," I said, decidedly.
                     "Pray why won't you take the diamonds?"
                  "They belong to cousin Alice. What right have you to dispose of her
                     property?"
                  "She gave them to me last night. Find some other reason."
                  "It would be indecorous to receive a present of such value."
                  "Oh, Ret, I am going away soon. I am going back to England, and I want to leave
                     these with you. Don't talk about values. I do not consider them worth one kind
                     look from you."
                  "When are you going?" and again the blood was in her cheeks and forehead.
                  "Soon. To-morrow, maybe. Will you take them?" and I held the box out to her. "I
                     want you to wear them to-dayâ€”"
                  "I cannot. It would be highly indecorous. It would be insulting to Lucille! I'm
                     ashamed of you!" and her eyes were sparkling and her face burning.
                  "Will you please explain why?" I asked, in wonder.
                  "Yes, if you will let me out," she answered, desperately. I moved away from the
                     door, and she said with great composure:
                  "Because the bridesmaid should not wear diamonds when the bride has none to
                     wear. It would be in horrid taste, to say the least."
                  
                  "The bridesmaid! Oh, Ret! go now if you dare! Do you mean to tell me it is
                     Lucille who will be married to-day?"
                  "Yes, I believe she has some such intention."
                  "And you knew that I thoughtâ€”Come back here!" and I stamped my foot violently.
                     "I swear that I will set the house on fire if you leave me!"
                  She came back trembling, half laughing and half crying.
                  "Cousin Alice told me the other day that you had fallen into a mistake. You
                     never asked me. How could I know?" I had her in my arms then, and
                     her face was hidden on my breast.
                  "What must I say to you, Ret, my beloved? You know all I wish to say It will
                     take a lifetime to tell you how I love you."
                  "I know. You need not say anything. You have been telling me a
                     year and a half!" She extricated herself from my arms and sat down on the sofa,
                     motioning me to a seat beside her.
                  "Ah, Ret!" I answered, "I have spent all these dreary months in trying to hide
                     my love from you! How could I tell you?"
                  "Do you remember the day you saved Herbert? Do you remember how you held my
                     hand, and how you said with your eyes, with your hand, with every tone of your
                     voice, 'I love you! I love you! I love you!' Oh, my darling, I have been
                     happier since that day than ever before, since my father died! Do you remember
                     when I gave you the letters, in the drawing room yonder, and how you flamed
                     with rage when I said the Baltimore Harwoods were false? Then I knew you were
                     my cousin, and I thought you were Barnard's son, and I thought I must never
                     marry Barnard's son, because my father's letter, leaving me free in all else,
                     forbade all intercourse with that unhappy man and his family. And then"â€”and the
                     tears filled her gentle eyesâ€”"and then I tried to find excuses for Barnard, and
                     I thought I saw the possibility of some other explanation of his dark story;
                     and when I learned your true relationshipâ€”do you remember? it was on the 6th of
                     August last year!â€”oh, happy day!â€”" And once more she hid her eyes upon my
                     breast.
                  "Ret, have you been loving me all this time? And oh, cruel! keeping me in
                     ignorance when you knew I was dying for a word or a lookâ€”"
                  "You foolish boy, I have been telling you all the time! Be quiet, sir! or I'll
                     run away. Everybody else knew itâ€”Charley, Lucille, cousin Alice, your sisters.
                     Why, the first words your Mother said, when she kissed me, were, 'My
                     daughter!'â€”"
                  "Oh, I'll be in a towering rage presently," I said. "I am too happy now. How
                     could I be such a mole? I have avoided you! stayed in Europe, trying to kill my
                     love by absenceâ€”"
                  "I don't think you have avoided me much, sir!" said she, maliciously. "I don't
                     believe you stayed an hour longer in Europe than was necessary. I think you
                     came to New Orleans instead of New York, you undutiful boy! to see
                        me before you saw your Mother. I think you have been with me
                     every minute when you were not obliged to be elsewhere. Oh, such work as I have
                     had with Charley and your dear Mother, to keep them quiet!â€”"
                  "How could you torture me, Ret?â€”"
                  "Come, sir, you have only been here a day, and the torture did not last very
                     long. Did you wish me to run up to you and say, 'Please to marry me, sir!'"
                  "I have a great mind to vow that I'll never marry you until you ask me."
                  "Try it! How dare you! you great rude monster! Let me go! I'll tell your
                     Mother!" and she tore from me, pausing a moment at the door to throw me one
                     loving look, and then, covering her glowing face with white hands, sped
                     away.
               
               
                  
                     WEDNESDAY, September 2, 1837.
                  
                  It seems to me that I am nearly done with journal writing. Indeed, I do not
                     know any sort of writing that will express my present emotions. How can I write
                     coherently, while Ret sits there, only a few yards from me? She pretends to be
                     engrossed in a whispered dialogue with Mother. I wish I could make a picture of
                     those two! My Mother is seated in the great armchair, and my Ret is on a lower
                     seat at her knee, and Mother's slender fingers are tangling Ret's brown curls.
                     I am jealous of both of them by this light! They love each other more thanâ€”.
                     Ret shot a sly look at me and stopped that atrocious slander. My love! my
                     love!
                  The wedding was a great success last night. There were forty dashing beaux
                     here. Some from the neighbourhood, sons of planters, one or two from New
                     Orleans, quondam admirers of the bride, no doubt. Several from Baton Rouge,
                     army officers and embryo lawyers. Unfortunately, the first bridesmaid, Miss
                     Harwood, did not dance, but she was kind enough to play for the dancers, and I,
                     who was too bashful to dance, turned over the music for her. Probably some of
                     the beaux thought I was a regular
                     muff, and probably they were right in their judgment. It was midnight before
                     they were all gone. Charley and his bride went to his home in the state
                     carriageâ€”followed by a cavalcade of squires and dames, returning to their
                     domiciles. Mr. Maltby's carriage took his family and the city gentlemen; and my
                     Mother and sisters, Mr. Hamilton, the doctor and I, were the only guests who
                     remained at Harwood. We spent a quiet hour before we separated for the night in
                     the lovely moonlight, on the broad verandah. Somehow, we fell into
                     couplesâ€”Alice and Mr. Hamilton, Grace and the doctor, while Mother and Herbert
                     courted each other with unblushing effrontery. Ret and I had several small
                     dialoguesâ€”about five seconds long. She was intent on hospitable cares, and took
                     fiendish delight in tantalizing me by flying off to attend to some needful
                     household duty a dozen times in the hour. But to-day I have had a glorious
                     time. Mother wanted to see The Laurels, and, escorted by Herbert, she riding
                     Midnight, while he bestrode Dick, his rascally ponyâ€”they went. Ret and I
                     walked. It is only a mile or two, and the morning was charming. The girls had
                     letters to write to Baltimore friends, and we four formed the party. We stayed
                     an hour in the shade of the famous trees, Herbert recounting the story of the
                     bathing adventure, when he was "drownded," to eager listeners, and I was forced
                     to fight my terrible duel over again in detail. They would not relinquish a
                     solitary word, and kept me longer in telling the story than the time occupied
                     in the combat. They imperiously demanded each phase of my changing emotions
                     from slight anger to cool ferocity in the concluding passages.
                  On the return journey the equestrians soon distanced us, and we lingered a
                     little to admire the lovely glimpses of the bright stream as it came into view
                     through the glades of the forest. And the darling tyrant steadfastly persisted
                     in her inquisition until I had told her all my thoughts on that terrible
                     midnight, when I walked out to the haunted grove alone. She seemed to gloat
                     over the recital of my misery, though she clutched my arm, and looked at me
                     with tearful eyes, while her face was bright with smiles. In turn I propounded
                     sundry questions, and will now proceed to note down the substance of her
                     replies. Much that has been mysterious in the past record is cleared up by the
                     dialogue that enlivened that lovely walk.
                  The "engagement" betwixt Charley and Ret was a veritable engagement, in so far
                     as the tacit agreement of all parties interested terested was concerned. Both
                     of them had been taught from early childhood that they should be man and wife
                     when they were of age. There had not been much talk betwixt them on the
                     subject, as Ret instinctively avoided it, and Charley was not a very eager
                     wooer. After I appeared upon the scene, and especially after Herbert's rescue
                     and our subsequent intercourse (while Charley was in New Orleans), she
                     dismissed forever all idea of fulfilling this quasi engagement. When he returned I was on my way to Baltimore,
                     and the dear girl says I took her heart with me. She was certain that I was the
                     son of her father's life-long enemy, and many sorrowful days were spent in the
                     struggle between her old devotion to her father and her new affection for me.
                     But she quietly gave Carr to understand that there would be no marriage. He
                     expostulated a little and then yielded, confessing that he did not love her as
                     he ought to love his wife, but certainly, as a dear sister, whom he had known
                     familiarly from infancy. Curiously enough he did not ask her any questions
                     about her own affections, but readily promised to say nothing about the
                     sundering of the old compact. "Charley was very useful," she said, "in keeping
                     other young gentlemen away." But he had met Lucille while in New Orleans, and
                     as soon as it was settled that he was free from the old tie, he began to
                     discover that he did like Miss Latour amazingly. Accordingly another trip to
                     New Orleans soon after my departure brought matters to a crisis, and Ret moved
                     to Harwood to play hostess to Charley's fiancÃ©c. When I returned, and Carr announced his approaching
                     marriage, it was nothing but my repugnance to talk upon the subject prevented a
                     full explanation twenty times a day. The truth is, Charley was snubbed whenever
                     he approached the topic, and at last Ret discovered that I was in unblissful
                     ignorance of the true condition of affairs, and supposing the truth would
                     inevitably be revealed almost immediately, she rather enjoyed my discomfort.
                     Then events crowded rapidly upon us. The attempt to rob, and then the conflict
                     at The Laurels, then Barnard's death, and my departure to Pensacola. When I
                     returned I found many changes had occurred. Mr. Carr was dead, the marriage
                     postponed, Lucille gone, and I was summoned to New York and thence to Europe. I
                     wrote regularly to Herbert and sometimes to Carr, but never asked a question
                     about his marriage. Indeed, I could not. I received only two
                     letters from Charley, and he imitated me in avoiding that subject. Herbert's
                     letters were carefully examined by Miss Ret, and therefore I was not enlightened by him. "I could not
                     endure the thought," she says, "that any one else should tell you. I had not
                     decided how to tell you, when you called me yesterday into the library, but I
                     knew the time had come then!"
                  "If it had not been for the diamonds, Retâ€”"
                  "I knew all about the diamonds. Cousin Alice told me the night before. Indeed,
                     she made me promise to tell you at the first opportunity, saying she would not
                     allow her boy to be kept in misery any longer. She says I am a 'hardened
                     wretch!'"
                  "Mother always tells the truth, Ret."
                  "Does she? She has told me many things about you, sir! I know the larger part
                     of your history, up to your arrival in Carrville, and now I mean to know the
                     rest! I want that journal, sir!"
                  "You shall have it when you take me! Oh, Ret! consider how long I have waited
                     for you! I can't live another week without youâ€”"
                  "You are certainly stark crazy! I don't intend to think of matrimony for ever
                     so longâ€”"
                  "Let us make a bargain, Ret," I said, desperately. "Will you let Mother fix the
                     day? I promise to say nothing if you will promise to be guided by her. Is it a
                     compact?"
                  "I don't knowâ€”I'll see about itâ€”there's the house, so behave circumspectly,
                     sir."
                  "Ret," I said, stopping suddenly, "if you don't promise to settle this point
                     this very day I will burn the journal before I sleep!"
                  "What a cold-blooded tyrant! Come on, sir. I will promise to talk to her if she
                     asks me."
                  And they are talking about it this blessed minute. I can tell by Ret's shy
                     glances and by Mother's happy face.
                  Ret has suddenly demanded this book. She stands here by my side while I trace
                     these final lines. Shall I ever be allowed to see it again? I cannot refuse to
                     giveâ€”
               
               
                  
                     HARWOOD, Christmas, 1837.
                  
                  By special favour I have the privilege of writing a little more in this
                     journal. For one solid month I have been the merest slave. I no longer have
                     liberties, preferences, opinions or property. On Thursday, November 26th, I was
                     taken into legal custody by a remorseless female tyrant, who has never ceased
                     to domineer over and hector me since that day. She sits just opposite to me now
                     in this dear library. Everybody else has gone to Manahio, and we are to follow
                     presently. We are to dine with Carr to-day. Maltby, wife and daughter, Mr.
                     Hamilton and Doctor Markham are in the party. On this day week we are to have
                     them all hereâ€”Herbert doing the honours. Ret and I are guests of Mr. Herbert
                     Harwood, and we have an invitation to "stay here and live all over the house
                     for forty years." I have engaged to kill two wild turkeys, and Carr has
                     promised another deer. We killed one two days ago. I am now the ostensible
                     owner of Midnightâ€”with an encumbrance. Ret wore the diamonds a month ago, and
                     she has locked them up since, vowing that she will wear them no more. There are
                     other articles that once belonged to me which she wearsâ€”There! she says I must
                     stop "scribbling," give her back "her" book, and get ready to start. To hear is
                     to obey!
                  NEW YEAR'S DAY, 1838.
                  I shall have a quiet hour or two. Ret is superintending the cooking
                     arrangements and I got her keys and have stolen my diary. I am writing in her
                     room and am tolerably safe from interruption. My darling says I write such
                     "horrid nonsense" that she is not willing to trust "her book" in my hands. Oh,
                     how happy I am! But I have promised to write nothing "horrid" this time.
                  There was a rich scene in the library this morning. Dr. Markham called early,
                     pretending he had patients in the neighbourhood; but he came to see Grace. I
                     was in the breakfast room and Grace was in the library. The doors were open and
                     I heard what I now relate. I must say, by way of preface, that Markham has been
                     extremely attentive to my little sister, and that she evidently admires him. He
                     went into the library, hunting for her, and did not observe me as he passed the
                     door.
                  "Good morning, Miss Grace," said the medico.
                  "Good morning, doctor. Take a seat; I have just been reading about you."
                  "About me! I did not know my fame was so extended. Do you mean in that big
                     book?"
                  "Yes. Sit down and I'll read it to you."
                  "Hey? I don't know. Is it long?"
                  "I shan't read it now, sir!" and I heard the book slap as she closed it; "it is
                     a beautiful day."
                  "Yes; rather. But you've no business with those thin shoes on! Have you been
                     out?"
                  
                  "Certainly. Alice and I walked a mile at least this morning."
                  "In those shoes?"
                  "Not both of us. She had her own shoes," answered Grace.
                  "Humph! you have been taking lessons from Burton! Well, read the book."
                  "You will have to ask a little more politely, and also to manifest a little
                     more anxiety to hear it first."
                  "Hey?" and the doctor meditated. "Well," he said at length, "tell me what you
                     want me to say and I'll say it."
                  I heard Grace turning over the leaves and presently she began to read: "The
                     country people use kitchen physic, and common experience tells us they live
                     freest from all manner of infirmities that make least use of apothecaries'
                     physic. Many are overthrown by preposterous use of it, and thereby get their
                     bane, that might otherwise have escaped. Some think physicians kill as many as
                     they save, and who can tell ('Here's some Latin,' said Grace, in parenthesis,
                     'and I am afraid to try to read that; besides, I don't know what it means') how
                     many murders they make in a year (more Latin), that may freely kill folks and
                     have a reward for it? and according to the Dutch proverbâ€”a new physician must
                     have a new churchyard; and who observes it not?" Here Grace went off into a
                     violent fit of laughing.
                  "What the devâ€” I mean, what book are you reading, Miss Grace?"
                  "Wait, wait!" she answered, "there's more of it, and it gets better and
                     better." She resumed: "Many that did ill under physicians' hands have happily
                     escaped when they have been given over by themâ€”left to God, and nature, and
                     themselves. 'Twas Pliny's dilemma of old: every disease is either curable or
                     incurable. A man recovers of it or is killed by it; both ways, physic is to be
                     rejected." Another long laugh, in which the doctor joined. Then Grace went on:
                     "If it be deadly it cannot be cured; if it may be helped it requires no
                     physicianâ€”Nature will expel it of itself. Plato made it a great sign of an
                     intemperate and corrupt commonwealth where lawyers and physicians did abound;
                     and the Romans detested them so much that they were often banished out of their
                     city, as Pliny and Celsus relateâ€”for 600 years not admitted. It is no art at
                     all, as some hold, no, not worthy the name of a liberal science (nor law
                     neither), as Pet. And. Canonherius, a patrician of Rome and a great doctor
                     himself, proves by sixteen arguments, because it is mercenary as now usedâ€”base,
                     and, as fiddlers play, for a reward."
                  "Oh, doctor," said Grace, "it is prime! as cousin Herbert saysâ€”it is positively
                     jolly!"
                  "What book is that?" said the doctor. "Burton, by all the gods! I thought so!
                     Where did you get this book, Miss Grace?"
                  "It is my brother's," she answered.
                  "Did he select this delectable passage for you?"
                  "Oh, no; I stumbled on it by accident just before you came."
                  "Young ladies have a wonderful faculty for stumbling upon forbidden fruit.
                     However, there is a great deal of truth in it. Old Burton don't make many
                     mistakes. Do you like to read him?"
                  "Not much. There is so much Latin, and besides, he is so prosy."
                  "I suppose you prefer the stuff you call poetry?" said the doctor.
                  "Poetry is not 'stuff,' sirâ€”at least it is not so bad as 'doctor's stuff,'
                     according to Burton. He says a little lower down that theâ€”old gentleman was the
                     first inventor of physic."
                  "If I was not so old," said the doctor, deliberately, "I shouldâ€”"
                  "Old!" interrupted Grace.
                  "Well, I mean if you were not so youngâ€”"
                  "Young! I'm nineteen!"
                  "The dâ€”euce you are! Hey? I was going to say I should like to ask you if I
                     might fall in love with you? But it would be a horrid shame to ask so charming
                     a young lady to marry an old devil of a doctor. There! you need not run. I'm
                     not going to say another word. I am going to dine here to-day, ain't I? Well, I
                     must go see Carr's sick negro. Good bye, Miss Burton!"
                  "Don't call me Miss Burton, if you please."
                  "Hey? I should like to call you Mrs. Markham. There! I am going! Suppose I were
                     to brush my hair nice and smooth and let my whiskers grow?"
                  "Do go, doctor. Your patient will dieâ€”felo de
                        se instead of felo de
                     medico."
                  "I thought you did not know Latin? Grace, I am in earnest; would you think me
                     insane if Iâ€”"
                  "There, doctor, you have carried this joke far enough," said Grace.
                  "Joke! I tell you I love you, you little vixen!" and here I sneaked out of the breakfast room, as the
                     business appeared to be growing serious.
                  The mail has just arrived. My lady has brought me a letter with the London post
                     mark. It is addressed to "Sir Herbert Harwood, Bart," and is from Mr.
                     Parchment. It contains but a few lines, informing me of the removal of all
                     technical obstacles, and inviting me to "take possession of my estate in
                     Essex."
                  
               
               
                  
                     HARWOOD HOUSE, ESSEX, November 26, 1847.
                  
                  My lady gave me my old book to-day, which has but one blank leaf left. She must
                     know it by heart, as I have caught her reading it many times in the past ten
                     years. What can I say on this final page? My darling will have it back when I
                     complete the record, and she has forbidden me to write anything about her. But
                     I have nothing else to write about and I have no thoughts in which she has not
                     a placeâ€”my Ret!
                  I erred in the above statement. I have four things to write about, to wit: John
                     Harwood, aged eight, a young rascal of fiery impulses and tender heart.
                     Herbert, aged six, who promises to be gentle and good, exhibiting a certain
                     calm determination in surmounting difficulties. Allen, my baby boy, claiming
                     the allegiance of my household, although manifesting no "moral qualities" to
                     mention.
                  But the fourthâ€” I have kept the best for the last. She stands here at my knee,
                     tugging at my watch chain. Imperious and wilful, with three years' experience
                     of life, and thirty years of wisdom in her clear, calm eyes. Her mother's eyes!
