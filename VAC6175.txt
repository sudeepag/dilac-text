            PREFACE.
            In the course of a journey from the border of fair Devon to the northern counties, it
               happened that a traveller was detained at Gloucester. He had arrived too late to
               catch the London train. The hours of compulsory delay were employed in explorations
               of the quaint old city and its suburbs; in loitering in the Cathedral, and listening
               to the grand anthem sung by an invisible choir, while the organ peals resounded among
               the ancient arches. The scenes and incidents of that Summer day were brought to mind
               in later wanderings—mingling with fragments of real history, solid and touching—and
               with the attenuated substance of dreams and fancies; and the story grew out of these
               materials.
            It has been asserted somewhat emphatically, "that no Novel could attain popularity in
               these degenerate days, unless there were woven into the texture of it some form of
               assault upon morals or theology. Either indelicacy or unbelief, either a plot
               constructed upon some violation of established canons of virtue and purity, or the
               announcement of broad denials of commonly received dogmas of Christian faith. The
               attack upon morals, if not made in dramatic style, may consist only of allusions or
               hints, more or less suggestive; that upon theology may be only a sneer at the effete
               theories of a past age, and may be chiefly objectionable because of the flippant use
               of names and subjects that are held in reverence by the wise and virtuous. But to
               succeed, the novel must contain one of these objectionable features."
            Should THE ODD TRUMP win popular favor, it will disprove this assertion.

                  CHAPTER I.
                  THE RESCUE.
                  AFTER a rain of two days the water-courses were swollen and turbid. The little
                     rivulet tributary to the Severn, and known as Merton's Brook, was now a mighty
                     stream, spreading over the lowland meadows and roaring through the narrow
                     defiles of the high ground. The afternoon sun was shining brilliantly upon the
                     west leaves on the trees and upon the green hedgerows, and no striking token of
                     the long storm was visible except the sullen yellow flood, already subsiding,
                     and the gorgeous rainbow in the eastern sky.
                  Plodding along the highroad from Gloucester came a pedestrian. He was a youth
                     of twenty-two, perhaps, clad in such attire as to escape attention—not
                     remarkably fashionable, and not but of date. You would pass him almost without
                     notice, unless he happened to be looking at you, and then you would probably
                     nod civilly because you would detect his readiness to nod to you. Nothing at
                     all remarkable about the fellow except the long lashes over his thoughtful
                     eyes, and a certain prompt good-nature that you recognised somehow, even before
                     he showed his white teeth in answering your salutation; and it might occur to
                     you that there was a kind of contradiction between the thoughtfulness of his
                     brown eyes and the ready cheerfulness of his greeting. If you were a
                     philosopher you would rightly judge that the quick smile was inherited, and the
                     thoughtful expression acquired, perhaps through sad experiences.
                  
                  Merton's Brook was bridged in two places. The highroad led across the stream,
                     but between the youth and the bridge there was a foot or two of rushing water
                     thirty or forty yards broad. A horseman might cross it safely enough, but it
                     was over boot-tops. The footman paused at the brink of the flood and debated
                     with himself. Should he wait two hours for the torrent to subside? No. He, poor
                     fellow, had not yet learned to wait. Should he dash in and through to the
                     bridge? No. That involved a gallon of muddy water in each boot. Should he take
                     off his boots and wade across? No. He could not afford the damage to his
                     habiliments. What then? Why, there was the railway-bridge half-a-mile down
                     stream.
                  The railway crossed the brook at the low meadows, and the bridge was merely a
                     continuation of the trestlework that extended a hundred yards westwardly from
                     the margin of the stream. There was no law forbidding passage here, but there
                     was a grum old bridge-tender, whose duty it was to keep pedestrians away from
                     the trestlework; but the brook had banished the old curmudgeon from his post,
                     and the way was clear.
                  Arrived at the end of the trestlework, our traveller paused again. Before him
                     were four lines of cold iron a little above the surface of the swift water. He
                     could not see the cross-ties; they were submerged. If he crossed here, he must
                     keep his foothold upon any one of the four rails. A hundred and fifty yards of
                     this precarious travelling would bring him to the high eastern bank of Merton's
                     Brook, and a mile from his home.
                  The pensive expression faded out of his eyes while he surveyed the scene, and
                     gave place to a look of quiet determination. The obstacles he had encountered
                     had awakened a dormant dare-devil in his bosom.
                  "It is a mere matter of pluck," he muttered, as he drew off his boots: and
                     fixing his eyes upon a telegraph-pole beyond the stream, while the waters
                     eddied and gurgled beneath his feet, he boldly and rapidly strode out upon his
                     narrow bridge, and walked safely until he reached the margin of the brook
                     proper, where old Galt's sentry-box stood. Here there was a small platform; and
                     availing himself of the opportunity, he stepped upon it and sat down upon the
                     bench at the door of the box. Old Galt was not there; he knew what Merton's
                     Brook was after a long rain, and he had escaped to his cottage before the flood
                     had caught him.
                  The July sun was hot. The youth threw off his coat and neckcloth, inviting a
                     catarrh; and while he sat there fanning himself with his hat, he heard the
                     rattle of an approaching train and the shriek of the engine. It was coming from
                     the west, and he had time enough to reach the bank before it. Catching up his
                     boots and coat, he took the rail again, and stepping gingerly, neared the
                     eastern bank. There he made a discovery. The huge timbers upon which the rails
                     were laid were imbedded in solid masonry on the eastern end of the bridge, but
                     the muddy torrent that came down from the hills had worn away a passage behind
                     the abutment, around it, under it, and it had sunk away from the timbers,
                     leaving them vibrating upon the angry tide. They were kept in place by the ties
                     bolting them together, and by the rails connecting them with the track on solid
                     ground; but as they trembled under the tread of the adventurous youth, it
                     flashed upon his mind like lightning that the weight of the coming train would
                     tear the bridge from these frail fastenings. Rushing up the steep bank by the
                     side of the track, he turned, and waving his coat and hat frantically,
                     signalled the approaching train, already upon the trestlework. It was coming up
                     at moderate speed—too rapidly to be checked in time. Without a definite purpose
                     in his mind, he dropped his boots and coat, took off his waistcoat and braces,
                     and waited a few appalling, seconds for the catastrophe.
                  His quick eye took it all in. First the spreading of the track just over the
                     swirling brook, and the sullen plunge of the engine out of sight under the
                     hissing flood; then the crash of the passenger-carriages as they ran together
                     in a confused heap. Then the head and shoulders of the engine-driver, as he
                     battled bravely with the water and finally crawled out upon the bank. Then he
                     heard the wail of a hundred voices, and saw here and there men clambering out
                     from the mass of ruins, some slipping off into the boiling flood, some aiding
                     women with pale faces as they crept out into the sunlight from carriages lying
                     over on their sides. Then he saw a long tress of dark hair, a white face, an
                     arm tossed up from a bundle of female attire as it swept by him in the surging
                     torrent; and as he caught this last sight, he clasped his hands above his head
                     and plunged into the stream.
                  Oddly enough, when his head emerged again, he raised his eyes to the placid sky
                     and murmured a word or two of praise and thanksgiving that he had been led to
                     divest himself of so much of his clothing. He was a strong swimmer, and as he
                     rapidly gained upon the woman, floating now, and now sinking out of sight, he
                     noticed that she threw her arm up again before she sank.
                  "She will come up once more at least," he said, as he clove his way towards
                     her, or rather towards the spot where he had seen her hand disappear. It was gained, passed, and then
                     after two or three more strokes he ceased his efforts and waited. He knew he
                     must be within reach of her, but after a moment's delay, she not reappearing,
                     he dived and swam under water until he touched her cold face. With one strong
                     arm around her waist, he rose to the surface again, and by steady labor gained
                     the shallows a mile below the wrecked bridge, and drew her out upon the grassy
                     bank.
                  She was not dead evidently, though her eyes were closed. There was a tremulous
                     motion in her hands as he chafed them, and she moaned when he raised her head
                     upon his breast. What should he do? She would die for lack of assistance while
                     he sat stupidly gazing upon her pale face. Raising her tenderly from the
                     ground, he placed her limp arms over his shoulder, and taking her up bodily, he
                     strode sturdily away from Merton's Brook up the hillside and into the highroad.
                     She was a well-grown young woman, and not at all fairy-like in weight. Giving
                     himself a brief rest when he reached the stile leading into a shaded footpath,
                     he crossed it with his unconscious burden, and paused no more until he entered
                     his mother's cottage, and ascending the staircase to his own chamber, he laid
                     the moist, bedraggled body upon the spotless coverlid of his bed.
                  "I am safe to catch it now," he thought, his mind and body both relieved of a
                     weight. "When Mother sees this mess, what will she not say?
                     Mother! Mother! where are you, Mother dear?"
                  "Here, my son," answered a gentle voice below; "where are you?"
                  "Up here, Mother, in my room. Please come quickly;" and meeting her at the
                     staircase with a kiss, he continued, "Don't be alarmed, please ma'am, I have
                     fished up a young woman out of Merton's Brook, and she won't come to. She is
                     not drowned, for she moaned just now. But please come and see what is to be
                     done, and cut open her stays or something, and make her open her eyes."
                  A lovely, gentle face, surrounded and surmounted with hair of pure silver; long
                     lashes over kind eyes, placid and calm; a step of easy grace; a dignity that
                     was more noticeable because it was free from hauteur, and a direct honesty of
                     expression—some of these were the characteristics which this lady had
                     transmitted to the panting boy who stood aglow and dripping by her side as she
                     looked at the motionless form upon the bed, after snipping certain cords with
                     her scissors.
                  "A doctor the first thing. Run over to Galt's," she said, "Doctor Maguire is
                     there. Stay! where are your boots and coat?"
                  "A mile up the bank, Mother," he answered. "I will tell you when I return."
                  "Come back, sir!" said his mother. "I will go for the doctor help me raise her
                     head a little. There. Now get the brandy from my room, and see if you can get a
                     spoonful down her throat while I am gone." And glancing at the soiled
                     counterpane, the muddy footprints on the matting, and her son's rather unclean
                     appearance, she hurried away.
                  He got the brandy, and parting her white teeth with the spoon, he allowed the
                     liquid to trickle slowly into her mouth. Presently, with a convulsive effort,
                     she swallowed. She opened her violet eyes, and looking at his anxious face
                     bending over her, she threw up her hand, as she had done in the water, and
                     murmured:
                  "Save me! Oh, save me!" and then she closed her eyes again. It was a momentary
                     look, imploring and eager, but it carried her with electric rapidity into the
                     in most recesses of his heart.
                  "Please don't faint again!" he said, kneeling by the bedside and chafing her
                     hand vigorously: "Mother has gone for these doctor and will return in a moment.
                     She don't hear me! What shall I do?" and he put back the tangled hair from her
                     face. He thought he would like to have one soft tress, and with guilty haste
                     and trepidation he took the scissors his mother had left and severed a glossy
                     ringlet, which he kissed and then thrust into his bosom with a blush. In his
                     confusion he did not see the little strip of violet below her eyelids. Taking
                     her soft hand again he kissed it, while she lay quiet and apparently
                     lifeless.
                  "She is not dead," he whispered; "I can feel a feeble pulse, and she is
                     breathing evidently. Oh, if she would only show those blessed eyes again! I
                        did save her, Heaven be praised! And if she will only live! Oh,
                     how I could love her, if I dared!"
                  The brandy was gradually producing its effect, and a faint color spread over
                     her face. While he watched rapturously the signs of returning life, his mother,
                     followed by Dr. Maguire and two of Galt's stalwart daughters, entered the
                     chamber.
                  The doctor felt the pulses, listened a moment to her respirations, and nodded
                     his head.
                  "A warrum bath, ma'am!" he said. "She is not kilt entirely. A warrum bath and
                     dry clothing, plaze, and me and the youngster will go down stairs."
                  "I turned on the hot water, Mother," said the youngster, "the bath is all
                     ready. And while you are attending to the young lady, I will go to your room
                     and make myself presentable. I need a full outfit, you see. Doctor, will you
                     excuse me ten minutes?"
                  
                  "Surely! Let it be quite warm, ma'am. It will be all the betther if it is hot
                     enough to make her squale a trifle. All we want is the reaction."
                  When the doctor was summoned to the patient the second time, she was propped up
                     in the bed, pale and languid.
                  "Ah!" said the Doctor, "are you betther, Miss?"
                  "Yes, sir," she answered faintly, "only a little weak."
                  "Have ye iver a dhrop of brandy, ma'am? Yis, here is the stuff itself. Now,
                     miss, I put four ounces in this tumbler. So! And now I fill it up with wather.
                     Now swallow a tayspoonful ivery fifteen minits. Give her a cup of tay, ma'am,
                     an hour hence, with as much dhry toast as she will ate. Thin give her what's
                     left of the grog, and let her go to sleep. She will be well in the morning.
                     Kape her quite to-night, plaze."
                  Rose Cottage was on the verge of Merton, a little village five miles from
                     Gloucester. On the morning after the railway catastrophe, Sally Galt entered
                     the chamber, bringing the young lady's garments, dried and renovated. The
                     patient was awake.
                  "Here are your things, Miss," said Sally; "here is your purse. There pounds
                     six. We had to take the money out to clean the purse. A letter for the master;
                     the postman has just left it. How do you feel this morning, Miss?"
                  "Quite well, I thank you. I will dress and come down immediately. I do not need
                     any assistance, thank you."
                  She dressed with exemplary rapidity, looked with dismay at the soiled ribbons
                     on her hat, but put it on, and just as she was about to leave the room her eyes
                     caught the letter on the table. She read the address: 
                        "Radcliffe Merton, Esq., Rose Cottage, Merton, Gloucester."
                     
                  
                  She staggered back with a low cry of anguish and covered her eyes with her
                     hands, as if to shut out the sight.
                  "Oh!" she said, wringing her hands, "what shall I do? I dare not pause to ask.
                     I know I must fly."
                  She seized a pen and wrote a line or two upon a sheet of note-paper, wrapped a
                     sovereign and a shilling in another sheet and addressed it "For the doctor,"
                     then walked softly down-stairs. "Through a window at the right of the porch she
                     saw the silver hair of her hostess as she bent over a rose-bush which she was
                     tying to a frame. Without pausing, the weeping girl passed out of the house
                     into the lane, and then with rapid steps gained the Gloucester highway. The
                     morning was enchantingly beautiful. The birds were warbling in the trees; the
                     brook had returned to its ordinary channel, still discolored, but placid in the
                     sunlight, and nature appeared peaceful and happy, mocking with her smiling face
                     the pallid countenance of the young maiden fleeing like a fugitive toward the
                     ancient city. The note she left contained only these incoherent words:—"I am
                     grateful—oh, how grateful! and oh, how wretched! But I am compelled to fly from
                     friends who have been so kind to me, with no better explanation than this. Pity
                     and forgive me."
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  MISS MERTON.
                  The broad lands of Squire Merton lay upon both sides of Merton's Brook,
                     including the village and a dozen fruitful farms. The estate had belonged to
                     the Merton two or three centuries, and they were one of the oldest families in
                     the country. They present Squire was the elder of two brothers, taking the
                     entire estate by the entail; while his younger brother, Captain Merton of the
                     Royal Navy, had inherited his mother's fortune. He married Miss Radcliffe, and
                     dying, left his widow with one son, Radcliffe Merton, who was just attaining
                     his majority at the date of this story.
                  Mathew Merton, or "Squire Mat," as he was more commonly called, was a hale old
                     gentleman of sixty. He was a widower with two daughters, and "Nevy Radcliffe"
                     was heir-at-law to all his broad acres. "Rose Cottage," which stood on the
                     border of the estate, had been set aside for the future Squire, who spent the
                     greater part of his time upon the continent, Mrs. Merton having a triangular,
                     weakness for Naples, Geneva, and Paris. But Rose Cottage was still understood
                     to be Mr. Radcliffe Merton's house, and here he and his mother abode whenever
                     they were in England.
                  Squire Mat was extremely busy the day of the railway catastrophe. The wreck was
                     worse in appearance than reality. Nobody was killed, though the engine-driver
                     escaped almost miraculously. He saw the impending plunge of his engine a moment
                     before it occurred, and he took a "header" into the muddy stream and got safely
                     ashore. Three of the carriages had been thrown over on the opposite track,
                        bruising the passengers, but
                     breaking no bones. One carriage had fallen bodily into the water at the edge of
                     the brook, but the depth was less than a yard, and the inmates, all second and
                     third-class passengers, had crawled out, not seriously hurt. There was a report
                     current that a young girl had been swept away down the stream, but this was
                     traced to a half-demented youth, who could not give a coherent account of the
                     matter. He had travelled with her, he said, an hour; she was beautiful as an
                     angel; he had seen a man plunge in the water after her from the bank, and that
                     was all. A pair of boots, a coat, waistcoat and hat were found upon the bank,
                     and the railway officials took possession of them.
                  The good Squire rode down the bank of Merton's Brook, looking for traces, but
                     found none. When he returned late in the afternoon, there was more authentic
                     intelligence. A young gentleman had reclaimed the garments, describing them and
                     the contents of the pockets. He had also confirmed the report of the young
                     lady's accident, and brought the pleasing news of her rescue. She was doing
                     well, in a cottage down the stream somewhere. None of the railway hands knew
                     the gentleman. The engine-driver had also seen him dash into the stream, but
                     was too much demoralised by the "smash" to describe him. He had a vague idea
                     that some one was floating away, and that the youth attempted a rescue. "He
                     swimmed like a duck," he said.
                  "This is a poor scent!" said the fox-hunting Squire, as he rode slowly
                     homeward. "Maybe the girls can puzzle it out. If Lucy don't get thrown off by a
                     resemblance, she is safe to find some explanation. All those fellows said it
                     was a gentleman, a handsome one and young. We will scour the country to-morrow
                     on both sides of the brook. He must be a regular trump, though. Yoicks! I have
                     found it myself! It was Trumpley Wailes, as sure as a gun! and just like him
                     too."
                  Arrived at Merton Park, the first duty was to dress for dinner. The curate, Mr.
                     Thorne, was there. He was regular in his habits, and whist at the Park was a
                     regular appointment on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Punctuality was the cardinal
                     virtue at the Park, and at seven o'clock precisely dinner was announced.
                  "Take Lucy down, Thorne," said the Squire. "Come, Baby," and he gave his arm to
                     his younger daughter.
                  The curate had brought news. On his way from the village he had encountered Dr.
                     Maguire, and had a very full account of the young lady's mishap. She had been
                     rescued and carried to Rose Cottage by Mr. Trumpley Wailes, and was there now.
                     The doctor said she was a charming gurrill, and promised complete restoration
                     to health the next day. Mrs. Wailes had called him from Mrs. Galt's bedside,
                     and he had prescribed for the young lady and put her in bed. She was very
                     slightly drowned.
                  "Maguire says young Wailes had carried the lady from the brook to the cottage,"
                     said Mr. Thorne after the soup; "he must be tolerably athletic."
                  "The fellow is a regular Samson," said the Squire; "I remember seeing him put
                     that drunken rascal, Podd, through a gap in the hedge. Podd was at Rose
                     Cottage, where Radcliffe had sent him to fix up the flowers. He was full of
                     beer, and was disrespectful to Mrs. Wailes. Trumpley bundled him through the
                     hedge on the instant, and Podd was thoroughly astonished."
                  "Podd is a bad lot," observed the curate; "I should not like to offend
                     him."
                  "No," said Mr. Merton; "he would make mince-meat of you in short
                     order. But he did not seem to have any stomach for another tussle with Wailes,
                     but walked sulkily away."
                  "How came Wailes to occupy Mr. Radcliffe's cottage, Squire?" asked the curate,
                     not heeding the compliment to his prowess.
                  "Rad sent him down here from London a year ago with a letter to me. He said he
                     was under special obligations to this young gentleman, and begged me to put him
                     in possession of the cottage. Wailes has always insisted upon paying me the
                     rent every quarter. Podd was tinkering some flower-frames when Mrs. Wailes
                     moved in, and said something to the old lady that was rather rude. I overheard
                     him, and was about to blow him up when the youngster collared him. He went
                     through the hedge before he finished his speech. Trumplcy apologised to me very
                     politely for momentary inattention to some remark I was making, as if be had
                     just taken a pinch of snuff. What do you say, Lucy?"
                  Miss Merton sat at the head of the table by right. The hap-hazard manner in
                     which the story has proceeded thus far, is but a lame excuse for the delay in
                     presenting her formally to the reader. An English gentlewoman of thirty, at
                     least. No one asked her for the odd numbers. Not specially beautiful in person,
                     albeit not uncomely. Her dark hair arranged in plain braids. Placid gray eyes,
                     full of goodness and charity, yet erratic withal, at least one of them. The
                     right orb of vision had a habit of rolling in fine frenzy into the inner corner
                     whenever she was particularly interested in a subject. It was the only
                     obliquity about her, for she was true as steel; and it did not disfigure her
                     pleasant countenance, although it gave a comical tinge to serious sentiments sometimes. She had been
                     mistress of Merton Park for nearly twenty years, taking the keys, the symbols
                     of authority, at her mother's death, when Baby Sybil was born. Miss Merton had
                     two devoted lovers. Dr. Maguire proposed with furious earnestness about three
                     times a year, and was always rejected with gentle firmness. Mr. Thorne did not
                     propose, because Maguire always went to him for consolation after each rebuff,
                     and the curate felt that it would be a sort of breach of confidence to storm
                     the citadel after one of these Celtic assaults; and by the time he made up his
                     mind to declare his attachment, Dr. Maguire would happen to blunder into a new
                     proposal, get his dismissal, and go to Mr. Thorne with the story of his latest
                     discomfiture.
                  "I was about to say, Papa," said Miss Merton, "that Mr. Wailes always reminds
                     me of old Mr. Grippe."
                  "Well," responded the Squire, "that is an entirely new discovery, Lucy, at all
                     events. Perhaps you can designate the points of resemblance."
                  Miss Lucy's eye went into the corner.
                  "I am afraid I cannot, Papa," she answered, thoughtfully. "There must be
                     certain points of resemblance, of course, but I cannot tell just what they
                     are."
                  "I can assist you perhaps," replied the Squire. "Let me give you another slice
                     of beef; so. Well, old Grippe wears a red wig; Wailes has glossy brown hair.
                     Old Grippe weighs about eight stone light; Wailes is not far from ten. Grippe
                     is four feet ten; Wailes is a foot taller. Grippe is afraid of his shadow;
                     Wailes is not afraid of the devil. Grippe talks to you an hour without letting
                     you know what he thinks; Wailes reveals his whole soul to you in two minutes.
                     Grippe looks at you like a rat, with sharp eyes, peeping out of his hole;
                     Wailes looks at you like a lion, with frank eyes in which is no touch of
                     deceit."
                  "I don't think you have enumerated any of the real likenesses, Papa," objected
                     Miss Merton; "there is something in their voices or accent—"
                  "Exactly. Grippe has a chronic asthma, and when he doesn't whine he wheezes;
                     Wailes has a soft, gentle voice that doesn't lose its musical intonations even
                     when he is in a passion."
                  Miss Merton's eye came out of the corner. It was of no use to argue with so
                     obstinate a man as the Squire; so she led him off on a new scent adroitly, as
                     only a woman can.
                  "Mr. Wailes looks too amiable ever to get in a passion. Did you ever see him in
                     a regular rage?"
                  "Oh yes; that time he bundled old Podd through the hedge. I should like to see
                     Grippe touch Podd."
                  "Never mind Grippe, sir, please."
                  "Well, I saw Wailes in white heat on another occasion. Thorne, the port is with
                     you. Thanks!"
                  "We are waiting very patiently, sir," said Miss Merton, "for your story."
                  "It is not much of a story," rejoined her father, "and I can hardly make you
                     understand it. The whole thing occurred in a minute. It was at Euston Station
                     in London. Wailes—I did not know him then—was waiting for a train. So was I. As
                     we passed each other marching up and down the platform, I was attracted by the
                     fellow's amiable face. Suddenly a young kid came racing down the platform,
                     howling dismally. He was a mere mite of a boy, not over eight years old, I
                     fancy. Wailes caught his arm as he passed, and I thought at first he was going
                     to thrash the boy. But not he. He stopped his howling, and asked him why he
                     howled.
                  "'Cos a bobby beat me,' said the boy.
                  "'What were you doing?' said Wailes. 'Tell me the truth.'
                  "'I wasn't doing nothink. I axed a swell to let me hold his pockmantle.'
                  "'Well?'
                  "'Vell, then, the bobby cotch me by the collar and licked me.'
                  "'Can you show me the bobby?' said Wailes, sweetly.
                  "'No; there vas three on 'em. There they are at the end of the flatform. I
                     dunno vich von it was.'
                  "Wailes walked quietly down to the three policemen, and I followed to—to—to see
                     what would come of it.
                  "'There was a small boy here just now,' said Wailes, with great politeness,
                     addressing the three, 'and he tells me that one of you maltreated him. Who was
                     it?"
                  "The three looked at him silently.
                  "'I shall make no complaints,' continued Wailes; 'on the contrary, I will give
                     you an opportunity to complain of me.'
                  "Still there was no reply. Something in the young fellow's manner cowed the
                     three.
                  "'Because,' said Wailes, softly, 'I will trash the infamous hound that beat
                     that infant, within an inch of his life, if he will have the manhood to reveal
                     himself.'
                  "He waited a minute or two for a reply, but none came, and then walked away
                     with a gentle sigh.
                  
                  "'It seems to me, young gentleman,' I observed, when we were out of earshot,
                     'that you were looking for a fight just now.'
                  "'Yes, sir,' he answered, blushing like a girl. 'I had a little brother once,
                     and I lose control of myself when I see a boy treated with cruelty.'
                  "'Suppose the right bobby had acknowledged the assault just now?' I asked.
                  "'I suppose you would have been following me by this time, sir,' he answered,
                     laughing, to see me out of the scrape. I should have thrashed him, and the
                     others would have arrested me. If Rad Merton had been here, we two could have
                     polished off the three.
                  "'Rad Merton is my nephew,' said I; and that is the way I became acquainted
                     with Mr. Trumpley Wailes."
                  "That is a good story, Squire," said Mr. Thorne, slyly. "I have no doubt that
                     the uncle would have taken the nephew's place if a scrimmage had occurred."
                  "Fie, Thorne!" answered the Squire, "you forget that I am a Justice of the
                     Peace. Are you going, girls? Thorne, will you finish the bottle?"
                  "No, sir; I follow the ladies."
                  "Then I follow you. And now for a quiet rubber."
                  "As they took their places at the card-table, Miss Lucy's eye went into the
                     corner on an exploring expedition.
                  "I was thinking, Papa," she observed, as she cut the cards, "I was thinking
                     that you resemble Ludovic Leslie."
                  The Squire looked at her in mute admiration.
                  "Ludovic Leslie, you know," she continued, "Le
                        Balafr. You know when his nephew was called away, he was fighting
                     the Wild Boar of Ardennes, but he had to leave the combat unfinished; and the
                     Wild Boar thought he would take that opportunity to escape, but Ludovic stopped
                     him, and finished the fight on his nephew's account, and cut off the Boar's
                     head. Now if you had polished the policemen on account of Radcliffe's absence,
                     you see how similar the cases would be. I declare men seem to think of nothing
                     in the world but fighting; it is their meat and drink. Deal, Papa, please."
                  The Squire silently dealt fifty-two cards, while Miss Merton's gentle eye came
                     back to its normal position. He pondered her words, and tried to remember where
                     he had met Ludovic Leslie, and what he was like, and then as he turned the
                     trump-card he confirmed her last statement:
                  "Clubs!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  LUNATICS.
                  Be jabers!" said Dr. Maguire, as his old gig rattled away from Rose Cottage,
                     "there is something in the atmosphere of Merton that favors lunacy! Here is
                     that gurrill, drowned and kilt yesterday, and not fit to be out of bed, no
                     doubt—and she is aff like a shot out of a hot shovel, the divil knows where!
                     Laving me a guinea too! And she got no taste of medicine either, barrin' the
                     dhrop of brandy. She had to fly, she says—and she is a born lady, I'll been
                     sworn. I wonder if anybody was pershooing her?
                  "Thin there's ould Galt, as crazy as a loon. Niver a guinea out of that shanty,
                     and yet I have to attend his cranky ould wife, who has as many whims as a
                     duchess. Be jabers! she will have some rayson for crankiness when she takes
                     them pills I left her this morning. It is an interesting case, and has given me
                     many valuable changes to experiment. I ought to have a student to profit by my
                     researches. That young Wailes would do.
                  "But he is a regular lunatic also. No man in his sinses would have got ready to
                     swim yesterday, while the train was coming. And now he is aff, like another
                     shot out of another hot shovel! Whin I asked him where he was going he just
                     smiled, and said 'up the road, Doctor,' but he bolted out as soon as he read
                     the gurrill's note. He's after her, be jabers!
                  "And here comes the Squire's carriage. And I thought it would rain and have got
                     on this ould coat! Miss Lucy will be in the vehicle, av coorse. She's a
                     monstrous fine woman, and I shall land in lunacy meself if I don't prevail on
                     her to become Mrs. Maguire. Whoa! Jalap. The top of the morning to you, Miss
                     Lucy! And to you, Miss Sybil. Squire, I am surprised to find you going on
                     wheels."
                  "We are going to make a call, Doctor—that is, we are going to take the young
                     lady to the Park. You must come over and cure her there. How is she this
                     morning?"
                  "Is it the gurrill that was drowned?"
                  "Yes—or at least the girl that Wailes pulled out of the water. Is she
                     better?"
                  "She's aff," responded the doctor—"fled—laving a guinea for me and a short note
                     for Mrs. Wailes."
                  "Fled?" said the Squire and his daughters in a breath.
                  
                  "Bedad, it's her own word!" replied Maguire; "it's a nate little note, and just
                     says she is obliged to fly."
                  "Let us go on to the Cottage, Papa," said Miss Merton, "and see Mrs. Wailes.
                     Good morning, Doctor."
                  "Come over to dinner this evening, Doctor," said Squire Mat, as they parted.
                     "Rad is coming—expect him this afternoon. Lucky it was not yesterday. Thorne is
                     coming, and I will invite Wailes and his mother. We can make a double
                     rubber."
                  "More Lunacy," said the doctor; "get up, Jalap. Merton has made up his mind to
                     marry little Sybil to that ugly divil Radcliffe, and in order to make the
                     course of true love run rough, he encourages this good-looking young Wailes to
                     dangle about his daughter. I suppose his income is about five pounds ten per
                     annum; and he is about as indepindent as ould Grippe, who has lashins of money.
                     Then he has the curate there twice a week, and I shouldn't wonder if
                        he would be swate upon Miss Sybil too. His stipend is not very
                     extensive, I fancy.
                  "Spakin' of ould Grippe reminds me that I have to go there to-day. That guinea
                     is sure enough. Same ould trouble, av coorse—want of nourishing food and
                     dhrink. I could prescribe for him without seem' him. Half a pound of beefsteak
                     for breakfast; one of Merton's dinners about twice a week. But I must humor the
                     ould baste and give him some medicine. Sod Bi-carb, grains five—every four
                     hours. And that's two-and-six more. It goes again the grain to charge him such
                     prices, but he would have no confidence in the treatment if he didn't pay.
                     Another well-defined case of lunacy.
                  "When I persuade Miss Lucy to become Mrs. Maguire, I'll try a little experiment
                     on her—I'll operate for strabismus. If I can kape that eye of hers from running
                     into the corner, it will play the divil with her discovery of resemblances. Her
                     last exploit was to find a striking likeness between me and Podd. Lunacy again.
                     G'long! Jalap," and he gave his horse a vicious cut. "Speaking of the divil,
                     here he is. Hillo, Podd!"
                  A tall, raw-boned man of about forty, with red hair and whiskers, little red
                     eyes, keen and restless, rather repulsive in appearance, probably because of an
                     air of insolent presumption that was habitual with him. You would judge him to
                     be a free-thinker, a radical, a republican, a disorganiser. He carried a bundle
                     of plants, the roots wrapped in moss. This was Podd. He did not answer the
                     doctor, except with a surly nod.
                  "Where are you going, Podd?" said the doctor, pulling up.
                  "Grippe's."
                  "Hum!—three miles. Where are you from?"
                  "Glo'ster."
                  "That's three more. Come, get in the gig; I'm going to Grippe's."
                  "Rather walk," answered Podd.
                  "Why, you blockhead, you'll save an hour!"
                  "Lose it," said Podd; "he pays while I walk."
                  "That's sensible anyhow," quoth the doctor. "He pays by the day, does he?"
                  "I charges him by the day," responded Podd; "he gen'lly knocks off summut, but
                     I puts on enough to let him knock off."
                  "That's sensible also, though the morality is dubious. Do you treat all your
                     customers in the same way?"
                  "No; I gen'lly lets 'ristocrats make their own terms—they're too proud to
                     higgle over a shillin'. If I am dealin' with women I gen'lly makes a 'zact
                     bargain, and if I can I makes 'em pay in advance. Grippe is neither 'ristocrat
                     nor woman, though he'd like to pass for a 'ristocrat if he could. He orders the
                     plants as if he was a lord, and pays for 'em as if he was a cadger." This was a
                     long speech for Mr. Podd, and he paused exhausted.
                  "Bedad!" said the doctor, "you're a philosopher, Podd. Whom do you call
                     'ristocrats?"
                  "There's precious few on 'em about here," answered Podd. "I s'pose you might
                     put the Squire in."
                  "No others?"
                  "Well—I mean by 'ristocrats those people who think the world was made for them.
                     Sich a chap as young Wailes—"
                  "Wailes? Why, Podd, you're demented. Mr. Wailes is one of the most modest,
                     unassuming of young men. And he is no richer than you are."
                  "Riches don't make any difference," said Podd, with an air of disgust; "that's
                     the foolery of 'ristocracy. I don't know where Wailes gets it, but he is a
                     reg'lar 'ristocrat. He passed me on the road a mile back, and he didn't notice
                     me no more than dirt. If I was to do a job for him worth a shillin', he'd throw
                     'arf a crown at me, pretty much as you'd throw a bone at a dog. Hang him! I
                     cannot abide him," and Mr. Podd sat down on the roadside, plucked a twig from
                     his bundle of plants, which he chewed viciously. The doctor drove on, leaving
                     the floriculturist to his reflections.
                  "Clear lunacy," said Dr. Maguire. "It's odd how many ways men's minds can go
                     astray. Of all the young fellows I know, Wailes is least like the overbearing 'ristocrat, as
                     podd calls him. In fact he is easy and natural in his manners, always cheerful
                     and polite, and would not harm a fly. What can have put this ould rashkil agin
                     him?"
                  Jalap had a trick of working the head-stall over his ear. If he was tied up to
                     a post, he could extricate one ear in one rub; but by some muscular action he
                     managed to get it out of durance, even while trotting along the road. His
                     master always replaced the bridle when Jalap disarranged it, as the ear bent
                     down gave a quizzical appearance to the "turnout," and the doctor was careful
                     of appearances.
                  "You ould omadhann!" said he, as he adjusted the head-stall, "I wonder where
                     you learned that trick. I'll put a strip of vesicating epispastic on your ear,
                     me boy. You are as bad a lunatic as the rest of them."
                  He had stopped on the crest of a hill, which was in fact the highest point of
                     land within a circle of ten miles. Looking back over the road he had travelled,
                     he could see the chimneys of Merton and the church-spire; a little to the left
                     the trees of Merton Park, with an occasional gleam of the mansion among them.
                     Podd was afoot again half a mile off. Looking northward, the doctor saw the
                     smoke of Gloucester, though the town was hidden by intervening trees. As he was
                     stepping into his gig again, he was started by the sudden appearance of another
                     personage close by him.
                  On one side of the road there had been an excavation made years ago. It was
                     probably the beginning of a work of repairs, as the old road had originally
                     deflected at the brow of the hill. This little hollow was overgrown with
                     bushes, thick enough to conceal the young lady who emerged from their
                     shadow.
                  "It is the Doctor," she said, half in inquiry.
                  "It is," responded Maguire, "and bedad! you are my patient. My dear young lady,
                     you have demoralised an entire community by your abrupt departure—" He paused
                     as she clasped her hands with an air of great distress.
                  "Oh Doctor," she said, "please say no more. I was obliged to do what I have
                     done. I know how rude and ungreateful you must think me, but I could not do
                     otherwise."
                  All the quaintness disappeared, and the doctor presented the characteristics of
                     the polished gentleman he was, being confronted by beauty in distress.
                  "Will you allow me to serve you?" said he. "You have left a fee for me this
                     morning that I have hardly earned."
                  "I wish to reach Gloucester, Doctor," she answered. "I was tired and sat down
                     there to rest. And, and—now that I am rested I am afraid to go on."
                  "Pray, tell me what you fear. Or, if you do not wish to tell me, get into my
                     gig, and I will take you to Gloucester; I am going there." This was a
                     constructive fib, as the doctor had no intention of visiting Gloucester a
                     moment before. "It is quite lucky that I met you, as the encounter will save me
                     from two or three miles of a dull drive, and save you from a tiresome
                     walk."
                  "Is there any other road?—I mean, some road less direct than this? Oh Doctor,
                     you look so kind I will tell you all. While I was resting, I saw—the gentleman
                     who saved my life yesterday—alas! alas!—he was coming up the hill and I crept
                     into the bushes there until he passed. He did not see me, but I saw him—his
                     face as resolute as fate. And I think—I—fear—he is looking for me!"
                  "Divil a doubt of it!" said the doctor involuntarily.
                  "Well, sir—it is life and death—oh, I cannot tell you! But I must
                     escape him. And now, if you can take me to Gloucester—by some other road—how I
                     will thank you!"
                  "Get in the gig, my child," said the doctor. "I was lying just now, when I said
                     I was going to Gloucester. I am going to visit a patient who lives a mile from
                     the town. But it is entirely out of the way of ordinary travel, and I will take
                     you into Gloucester from the other side. Come, think of me as your father and
                     do not fear."
                  She took the seat by his side, and Jalap, put upon his mettle, spun along the
                     road at a good pace. She was silent, and the doctor was too considerate to talk
                     much, until they reached the lodge-gates of Halidon, the seat of the eminent
                     banker, Mr. Anthony Grippe.
                  "This is Halidon," said the Doctor.
                  "Who lives here?"
                  "Mr. Anthony Grippe."
                  "Oh, dear! oh, dear! Doctor, please tell me how I can reach Gloucester. I will
                     walk. I'd rather walk, please. And, Doctor, please don't say to any
                        one that you saw me to-day. Please promise!"
                  "Certainly, my child, I promise." She was getting out of the gig as he spoke.
                     "If you are determined to walk, keep straight on this road; it will take you
                     into the eastern side of the town, a mile off."
                  She had taken a step or two, paused, turned, ran back, and took the doctor's
                     hand and kissed it; and then she skimmed along the road at a rate that soon hid
                     her from the doctor's sight.
                  "This case is the best defined of all." said the doctor; "confirmed firmed lunacy! It must have come to
                     her through three or four generations of March hares. She runs like a startled
                     fawn from young Wailes—ah! what has that sly rashkill been up to?—and she runs
                     as vigorously from ould Grippe. How lovely she is! If angels iver went crazy, I
                     should think this was one—broke out of some celestial mad-house, and allowed to
                     flit about the earth to set ivery man mad that saw her. I did not even ask her
                     name. Bad cess to me! I was too much of a blockhead to ask her anything. She
                     sat up here just like a duchess, and somehow she kept me quite by her manner.
                     And thin she had a tear or two in her eyes ivery minnit!
                  "If I only knew who caused those tears," he continued, savagely, "I'd crack his
                     skull with all the pleasure in life; and if the crack happened to be fatal, I'd
                     dissect him after!"
                  Gloating over this diabolical picture, he passed through the gates of
                     Halidon.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  MR. ANTHONY GRIPPE.
                  Halidon is one of those diminutive counterfeits of Paradise which abound in
                     merry England. It had belonged to a family of gentlemen through twenty
                     generations, and the Trumpleys of Halidon, although without title, had occupied
                     a high place in the county records for six hundred years. They had been
                     prosperous generally, up to the majority of the last of the race. Harold
                     Trumpley had taken possession of the estate thirty years before the date of
                     this story, and after a few years of dissipation, had left England utterly
                     bankrupt. He was very little known in Gloucestershire, as he resided on the
                     Continent, generally at Baden when the gambling season came round, and at other
                     times at Paris, Brussels, Stockholm, or St. Petersburg. He avoided English
                     society, was rude and uncouth in his manners, and always quarrelsome in his
                     cups. At last the news of his death came. He had won largely in a gambling
                     encounter with the bank at Baden, and gathering up his gains had started for
                     Paris, and was murdered on the road. His remains were brought to England and
                     interred in Merton churchyard. His only surviving relative was a sister, whose
                     entire fortune was an annuity of five hundred pounds, and a year after his
                     death she left Halidon to marry Mr. Henry Wailes. The reader has already seen
                     her. The estate was sold under legal process, yielding barely enough to pay the
                     various mortgages and the numerous debts of the profligate owner. Mr. Anthony
                     Grippe was the purchaser.
                  The description of this gentleman given by Squire Mat was sufficiently accurate
                     so far as it went; and the contrast between the withered old banker and the
                     stalwart youth was certainly marked enough for identity. Mr. Grippe, in
                     addition to his other ailments, had a stiff leg, and hobbled over the ground in
                     ungainly fashion. Other points of dissimilarity may appear as the story
                     progresses.
                  As the new owner of Halidon he was received by the county gently with
                     considerable reserve. At the date of the purchase he was a junior partner in
                     the banking firm of Browler Brothers, Gloucester, and had been entirely unknown
                     until he became a landowner, and as possessor of Halidon, which was a show
                     place, one of the magnates of the neighborhood. Such attentions as he received
                     from the rector of the parish, Squire Merton, and a few others, were civilly
                     acknowledged, but he pleaded feeble health and the exacting cares of his
                     business as excuses for declining all social cntertainments. As years rolled on
                     he gradually rose from his subordinate position in the bank, and finally, only
                     a year or two before the date of this story, he had bought the interest of his
                     partners, and was now the sole proprietor of "Browler Brothers," which his
                     application and genius had raised into an "eminent" firm, with unlimited
                     credit. Mr. Grippe spent as much time as possible at his bank, and appeared to
                     have no enjoyment of life except in the prosecution of his business.
                  He had startled the curious among his clerks and acquaintances a few days
                     before the doctor's visit by bringing an invalid daughter from Paris, and
                     taking her directly from the railway-station to Halidon. Nobody had ever heard
                     of his marriage, and he had passed for an old bachelor for twenty-odd years.
                     There were few among his friends that ventured to ask him any personal
                     questions, and those that did, got no answer. He had a convenient deafness,
                     which, with violent attacks of asthma, seized him whenever he pleased. The
                     paroxysms always outlasted the patience of any anxious inquirer into his
                     personal affairs, unless the questioner happened to be one whom Mr. Grippe did
                     not care to treat politely, in which case the answer came promptly enough, but
                     it was the reverse of satisfactory.
                  The doctor was ushered into the library, where he found Mr. Grippe, his right
                     leg propped up on a cushioned stool, to which he pointed as an apology for not
                     rising. The banker was quite bald, but
                     wore a magnificent gray beard, something unusual among gentlemen of his age and
                     occupation, but which he asserted mitigated his fits of asthma. He was rather
                     below the medium size, and had that thoroughly seasoned appearance which you
                     have noticed in a smoked herring. When his ugly red wig was off he was not
                     positively ill looking, as there was a twinkle of humor in his small eyes
                     occasionally, and his flowing beard gave an air of dignity to his tout ensemble. Just now he was looking his best, as
                     his wig was hanging on the back of his chair, and he was frugally regaling upon
                     biscuits and cheese, which he moistened with occasional draughts from a mug of
                     bitter beer.
                  "Good-morning, Doctor," he said, "take that chair. Jem, draw the cork from the
                     other bottle. Bitter beer, Doctor. You will have to praise it, for you ordered
                     it for me. The Stilton is good though."
                  "Upon my word," replied the doctor, seating himself as directed, "this is a
                     double pleasure! Stilton and Bass! Bedad, that's double too! But I mane the
                     pleasure of partaking of the faste, and of finding yourself well enough to
                     partake also."
                  "Well enough!" said Mr. Grippe, "of course I'm well enough: never was better in
                     my life."
                  "Well, thin," responded the doctor, with his mouth full of biscuit, "I'm bate
                     entirely. I thought you sent for me professionally."
                  "So I did."
                  "But I cannot see how my professional skill can be of any use, if you are in
                     your usual health."
                  "Ah!" said Mr. Grippe, "my usual health is nothing to boast of. I have had a
                     fine attack of asthma this week. Very probabl I shall have another to-day; I
                     feel the symptoms now."
                  "And you wished me to be at hand, to treat the symptoms as they appeared?" said
                     Dr. Maguire.
                  "Not a bit of it!" answered the banker. "I have another doctor to whom I always
                     apply for relief from asthma."
                  "And who may he be?"
                  "Dr. Experience I have been fighting asthma forty years, and I know all about
                     it. It would be inhuman to choke a man on the verge of suffocation with your
                     confounded drugs. No, Sir! I sent for you to see another patient. Do you know
                     French, Doctor?"
                  "Wee, Munseer," replied the doctor; "that is, I know that much of the lingo,
                     and that's all. Bedad, thin, it isn't a Frenchman you want me to physic?"
                  "No," said Mr. Grippe, meditating. "Ah! here comes asthma! Excuse me, Doctor,"
                     and he took a cigar-case from his pocket, extracted a small cigarette, which he
                     lighted and puffed vigorously.
                  "Piff!" said Maguire. "What stooff is that?"
                  "Stramonium."
                  "Deadly, be jabers! I knew a celebrated professor oncet, who said the man who
                     treated himself had a fool for a patient; and he intinded the observation for
                     professional men, too. Piff! You might alternate that pison with a whiff or two
                     of sulphuretted hydrogen by way of relafe. Piff! Of all the quackeries I have
                     iver encountered this is the worst!"
                  "Quackery!" replied Mr. Grippe, disdainfully. "Pray, what is asthma,
                     Doctor?"
                  "A disease of the pneumo-gastric nerves," answered the doctor promptly.
                  "What is the specific effect of stramonium?"
                  "To kill."
                  "Pooh! I have been smoking it forty years."
                  "Well, you have the constitution of a horse. Forty minits of that stooff would
                     put me in the grave."
                  "I suppose I must have considerable powers of resistance," said the banker,
                     slyly, "as I have been swallowing your mixtures for a dozen years. Never mind
                     the stramonium, Doctor; you can make up for it when you drug me next time."
                  "I've been trating you with mild remedies hitherto," said the doctor; "let me
                     get another chance at you, that's all! Where is the patient? my time is
                     limited."
                  "Let your other patients wait a little," said Mr. Grippe; "it will be all the
                     better for them, no doubt. I don't see how we can get along though. Does that
                     homœpathic fellow know French?"
                  "If he does," quoth Dr. Maguire with dignity, "it is the only thing he knows.
                     What the divil—excuse me!—do you want with that barbarous lingo? You said the
                     patient was not a Frenchman."
                  "No; but she happens to be a French woman."
                  "Murder! and where did you get a French woman?"
                  Mr. Grippe had another sudden paroxysm of asthma. He coughed and
                     spluttered—strangled—kicked his stool over, and lighted another cigarette.
                  "The indications are quite plain," said the doctor impressively. "Constriction
                     of the eighth pair; nausea, and consequent relaxation. One grain of tartarised
                     antimony in six subdivisions; a dose ivery fifteen minits. Relief within an
                     hour."
                  
                  "And death within a year," said Mr. Grippe, choking and gasping. "Antimony!
                     Metallic poison! Get out with your drugs, and set up my stool again, please.
                     Thanks!"
                  "If you would lave off that confounded ould wig," said the doctor, "I believe
                     your health would be better."
                  "Do you? Well, I am going to leave it off. She don't like it."
                  "Ah," said Maguire, "we have got back to the patient again. Have you been
                     making an importation? What is she? A cook?"
                  "No; I must explain, I see. Doctor, suppose a man had got married in France
                     twenty years ago. Suppose his wife had died, leaving an infant daughter.
                     Suppose he left the child in safe hands there until now, and then concluded to
                     bring her home? And suppose she, being the worse for the Channel passage,
                     should need treatment, and the blockhead of a doctor could not understand her
                     description of symptoms—"
                  "Hould on!" said the doctor; "a ray of light dawns upon me."
                  "That is something to be thankful for," said Mr. Grippe.
                  "Hould on! If you married a French woman, you must have coorted her. If you
                     coorted her, you must have known her lingo. Be jabers! how much French do
                        you know?"
                  The asthma gave Mr. Grippe another turn. He meditated amid his gasps.
                  "She knew a little English," he answered.
                  "Oh! Ah! Well, no doubt the child knows a word or two. Come on; I shall have no
                     trouble to mention. Come on!"
                  Mr. Grippe threw away the remnant of his cigarette and led the way through the
                     long hall. Ascending the staircase, he knocked at the door of the chamber over
                     the drawing-room. It had been the domain of the ladies of Halidon for many
                     generations.
                  "Entrez!" said a soft voice from within; and followed by Dr. Maguire, the
                     banker passed through the door and into the presence of a new character, whose
                     importance in the story demands a new chapter.
               
               
                  CHAPTER V.
                  HELOSE.
                  The spacious chamber into which the gentlemen entered was one of a suite running along the south side of the house.
                     The windows looked out upon a well-kept lawn, adorned with diminutive
                     flowerbeds, floriculture being the banker's most amiable weakness. Over the
                     belt of shrubbery at the foot of the lawn the spire of Merton church was
                     visible, and here and there glimpses of Merton's Brook are seen through
                     openings in the trees. The view on that bright summer noon was enchanting.
                  The young lady who was seated at the window arose at their entrance, looking
                     with some curiosity at the doctor, whose countenance presented a queer compound
                     of confidence and trepidation. He had a general idea that he could make himself
                     understood by speaking very broken English, but had forgotten to provide for
                     the relative necessity of understanding what the lady might say to him. He was
                     still perplexed with this problem, and looking with some dismay at the black
                     eyes of his prospective patient, when Mr. Grippe opened the ball.
                  "Mossu le Docture, Mam'selle."
                  "Bonjour, Monsieur," replied the lady; "asseyez-vous, Messieurs."
                  As she spoke with her hands and eyes as well as her voice, they understood her
                     and took the seats indicated, and she resumed her own. There was an awkward
                     pause, the lady alone retaining perfect composure. Mr. Grippe began to have
                     symptoms of asthma again, and Dr. Maguire secretly wished he had some similar
                     ailment to fall back upon.
                  "Monsieur parle-t-il francais?" said Mademoiselle, smiling at the doctor.
                  "Well, no," responded Maguire, "that is—on poo—but not enough for a prolonged
                     conversation. But we shall get along. How do you feel to-day? That is: commy
                     vous portay vous?"
                  "Je suis bien fatigue, Monsieur, c'est tout."
                  "Ah!" said the doctor, "that's well. Though what the blazes 'say too' may mane,
                     bates me entirely." This last sentence was intended to be an "aside." The
                     doctor proceeded: "Mam'selle, parlez I'anglay on poo?"
                  "Not a leetle word," replied the lady.
                  
                  "That's a misfortune. I say, Mr. Grippe, why in the world have you allowed your
                     daughter to reach this age without taching her some few sentences of the
                     vernacular? Permitty moy, Mam'selle," and he took her wrist in his fingers.
                     "So! good pulse anyhow. Be jabers, I remember some more of the lingo that just
                     suits. Vouly vous avay some bear anglay, Mam'selle?"
                  "Plait-il?"
                  "No; bear anglay. Mr. Grippe, plaze ring for a bottle of that bitter beer. She
                     will understand the bottle, I'll be bound."
                  The banker rang the bell and gave the necessary orders. When the bottle
                     appeared, the doctor went through various contortions in dumb show, to make
                     Helose acquainted with it. She looked at the bottle and nodded her head. Then,
                     drawing the cork, he poured the beer into a glass and presented it with a
                     polite bow. She took the tumbler and swallowed the contents without a
                     struggle.
                  "Now thin," said Dr. Maguire, "we may venture to lave the case. My prescription
                     is easily understood, Mr. Grippe. The young lady must have a bottle of beer
                     twice a day, until she is well. As for diet, a beefsteak for breakfast—dejuney,
                     Mam'selle—and whatever she will ate for dinner. Ye'll have to get some other
                     interpreter, however. I can't come over here every day, merely to translate for
                     you."
                  "I shall have an interpreter this afternoon," said Mr. Grippe. "I hope Miss
                     Helose will learn English very rapidly, as I long to converse with her
                     myself."
                  "Oh, well," said the doctor, complacently, "you can pick up enough of the lingo
                     to get along, if you only have courage to try. Mam'selle, you understood me
                     pretty well?"
                  "Je ne sais pas," replied Mam'selle.
                  "It's of very little use to say it to your Pa," said the doctor; "but he will
                     improve with practice. Kape him at it. Mam'selle. Adoo, Mam'selle. An
                     revore!"
                  When the gentleman departed, Mademoiselle took an English lesson in this wise:
                     She drew a letter from her pocket, and reseating herself at the window, began a
                     laborious study of its contents. It was in English. She could not read it, but
                     the reader can:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "PARIS, July 10.
                                 "Most Beautiful:
                              
                              "I offer no apology for thus addressing you. I cannot do otherwise.
                                 I love you; and this fact will excuse any action that may seem
                                 improper. I do not know what obstacles may be in my way, but I will
                                 surmount them all, unless you forbid the effort. I do not know what
                                 risks. I encounter in communicating with you in this way, but I
                                 have no other dread than that of incurring your displeasure. Six
                                 times have I seen you, and the last time, I saw you disappear
                                 within the convent gates. If I could so win your favor, and win
                                 you, I would tear down its walls with naked hands. But I dare do
                                 nothing until I gain a word—a look of encouragement from you.
                                 To-morrow I shall see you again, at the Madeleine, and shall find
                                 or make an opportunity to place this note in your hands. And then I
                                 will have to wait a week—seven long ages—until the next Sunday,
                                 when I may read my fate in your eyes. I offer you the home of an
                                 English gentleman, who has no desire in life equal to that of
                                 calling you his wife. If my mad passion has not blinded me, I could
                                 almost hope, I hardly know why. But if it be possible for you to
                                 regard me with favor, one line from you addressed to 'R., Hotel
                                 Mecurice,' would fill me with inexpressible joy."
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  The penmanship was defective, and this, perhaps, increased the difficulties of
                     the translation. But Helose pored over the mysterious characters with manifest
                     impatience, consulting a French and English dictionary, and making little
                     progress.
                  "Helas!" she said at last, in her own tongue. "It is impossible! I can make out
                     only one charming word—'Je vous aime!' Ah! when shall I know the rest?"
                  She walked the length of the large room up and down with the superb grace of a
                     tigress in her native jungle. There was no trace of fatigue or of any more
                     serious ailment, and she was evidently in robust health. Probably Mr. Grippe,
                     who had suffered untold agonies between Calais and Dover, thought the trifling
                     sea-sickness, and the subsequent headache of which she complained, were more
                     serious maladies than they really were. Her pale face, looking paler by
                     contrast with her black eyes and hair, and also by contrast with the ruddy
                     complexion of English girls, had awakened his anxiety, and her manner was
                        distrait and cold. The little French that
                     the banker knew was larger in volume than her knowledge of English, and the few
                     days she had spent at Halidon had been specially dreary to her, and appeared to
                     confirm her in the French idea that the sun never shone upon that desolated
                     island. It was dull and cloudy when she landed, and there had been forty-eight
                     hours of solid down-pour since her arrival. Altogether, she had spent nearly a
                     week in compulsory silence, and this was so totally abnormal to a young woman
                     of twenty or thereabouts, that the true marvel was that she survived the
                     ordeal.
                  
                  Looking from the window she saw the doctor's gig depart; then the carriage came
                     up the drive, and Mr. Grippe entered the vehicle and was driven off. Without
                     knowing accurately how much liberty she had, she suddenly concluded to explore
                     the grounds of Halidon, and putting on her hat and mantilla, she descended the
                     staircase and passed out upon the lawn.
                  She was in the midst of sylvan scenery of enchanting beauty. The park
                     surrounding the mansion contains about a hundred acres, and every part of it
                     kept in excellent order. It was a perpetual mystery to all the inhabitants of
                     the district that Mr. Grippe, who was stringently economical in his ordinary
                     outlays, should spend money so lavishly in keeping up Halidon. It was the more
                     remarkable, as he entertained very few visitors, giving one solemn dinner-party
                     in the year, and invariably escaping all return civilities upon the plea of
                     ill-health. His dinners were faultless and well-served, as he imported and army
                     of cooks and waiters for each occasion. All the sights in the park and upon the
                     wide lawn were novel to Helose. She watched the nimble-footed deer with delight
                     as they glided in and out of the thicker coverts. She made the circuit of the
                     park, pausing a moment to admire the graceful water-fowl on a lakelet at the
                     southern boundary, and promising herself many days of enjoyments in more minute
                     explorations hereafter, she came out upon the lawn again, her face aglow with
                     exercise and her eyes sparkling with pleasure. The carriage was grating over
                     the gravel as she reached the entrance. Mr. Grippe descended, and immediately
                     assisted a lady to alight. Approaching Helose, who stood watching them with
                     great eagerness, the banker presented his companion.
                  "Miss Mabel Grahame, Mam'selle Helose.'
                  The new-comer extended her hand, addressing the French girl a few words in her
                     own musical language. By way of response, and with happy tear-drops glittering
                     in her black eyes, Helose clasped her round the waist, imprinted two impetuous
                     kisses, one on each cheek, and then drawing her to the house, exclaimed:
                  "Come, come! I shall love you as long as I live!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  MAREL.
                  The Reverend Edward Grahame lived in London. He had one child, a daughter,
                     "little Mabel." She got this name when her mother died, and when the gentle
                     little fairy was the solitary light left in her father's desolate household.
                     Mr. Grahame had a missionary chapel in Blackfriars, with an assured revenue of
                     about a hundred pounds, which he supplemented by literary work that yielded him
                     as much more. He was a "younger son," a dozen lives between him and the family
                     inheritance, with one brother in the navy, one in the army, and the elder the
                     perpetual member of the Lower House from his native borough.
                  As a matter of course the church was the natural field for the fourth son. The
                     other vocations for men of gentle breeding being bespoken for his brothers, the
                     Reverend Edward quietly fell into his predestined groove. The missionary post
                     was the first that offered, and after a few years of conscientious labor, of
                     frequent contact with poverty and vice in distress, and especially after his
                     own dire calamity in the loss of his wife, he became so engrossed in his work,
                     so heartily interested in his humble flock, that no preferment would have
                     tempted him away if the opportunity had been presented. An eccentric old rector
                     tool a fancy to the young clergyman, and left him his library at his death, and
                     this was the most valuable of his earthly possessions. He was a lover of books,
                     and this gift was a mine of wealth to him. As his daughter grew up to
                     womanhood, manifesting no ordinary powers of mind, he found delight in the task
                     of instructing her in various branches of love usually unexplored by the
                     gentler sex. She was an accomplished Greek and Latin scholar, and as her father
                     was master of two or three modern languages, he had transferred this knowledge
                     to her also. The maid-of-all-work, who had been the solitary servant of Mr.
                     Grahame since his beginning of housekeeping, had instructed Mabel in various
                     feminine arts in rude fashion, but at the date of this story she was probably
                     the most crudite young gentlewoman in England in classical learning, and the
                     most ignorant in all those accomplishments, necessary and otherwise, in which
                     young ladies are expected to excel.
                  The literary work in which Mr. Grahame engaged was double. He was making a
                     book, and his whole soul was in it. He had spent years upon it, and he loved it. In addition to
                     this grand work, he did a great deal of fitful writing at odd times, for which
                     he received some small remuneration. The idea of getting money for the book
                     never entered his mind, and it was all the better for the book that it did not.
                     But the "money writing" was a far different occupation, and he enjoyed that
                     also, as it brought a different set of mental muscles into play. Had he been a
                     little more worldly-wise he would have gained better pay than he did, but he
                     was content with such remuneration as was offered, and did not dream of hawking
                     his wares from place to place.
                  Mabel had an annual invitation at Christmas to Grahame Manor, in Sussex, and
                     for two weeks in each year she saw society. The other fifty weeks were spent
                     with the poor and needy in Blackfriars, in such missionary work as a
                     clergyman's daughter would naturally find in such a locality. Out of their
                     scanty income these gentle people gave munificent donations to the just and the
                     unjust; and Mabel's education, mental and moral, progressed in the midst of
                     poverty, toil and vice, which were less hideous in their manifestations because
                     of the light shed upon them from her angelic face. How much less evil in the
                     concrete there was within the range of her ministrations, by reason of her
                     patient kindness; how much less in the abstract, by reason of her valorous
                     conflicts with the devil in his stronghold, no mortal may know. Doubtless there
                     is a record elsewhere, where the story of dauntless courage that resisted, and
                     the no less dauntless courage that endured, is preserved.
                  She was not much of a favorite with her cousins at Grahame Manor. She had no
                     "accomplishments." She could not play for their dancing parties, and could not
                     dance while another played. She had a lamentable habit of speaking the truth,
                     in an absurdly simple fashion, which sometimes disconcerted her interlocutors.
                     She saw so many actual woes in Blackfriars that she could not get up a polite
                     sympathy for imaginary woes in Sussex. She had no fine dresses, and she
                     steadfastly refused to borrow from her cousins, no matter what company was
                     coming. But the younger children—and their name was legion—fairly worshipped
                     her, and no doubt the regularly recurring invitation was due to their clamors.
                     Christmas would be shorn of half its jollity were Cousin Mabel absent, and her
                     two weeks were mainly spent in the society of these young vagabonds, and in the
                     midst of profusion the more noticeable by contrast with her economical
                     home.
                  There came a time when the literary work would not sell. Mr. Grahame was
                     dismayed to find himself in positive straits. They did not owe any debts; it
                     was part of their religion to "owe on man anything." And they knew how to
                     dispense with accustomed comforts too. But they had some pensioners who relied
                     upon the parson for certain luxuries, needed because of age and infirmity, and
                     he had counted upon the proceeds of his writings to supply these needs. Their
                     wealthy relations in Sussex would have died of excessive hilarity had they
                     overheard the grave discussions between father and daughter as to the possible
                     modes of egress from their difficulties.
                  Their barker was tolerably prosperous and slightly pious. Some local matter had
                     stirred him up to the point of writing a letter to the Times. It
                     was printed, and the happy breadmaker hastened to the parson with a copy of the
                     paper. Mr. Grahame was out, so he left the paper with Mabel. She did not see
                     the Times very frequently, and she devoured it with good
                     appetite. She read the baker's letter first, and then she read all the rest of
                     the paper. When her father came she showed him the letter, and afterwards an
                     advertisement. The reader does not care about the letter, but the advertisement
                     is interesting. It ran thus:
                  "WANTED.—An English gentlewoman about twenty, who speaks French,
                     as companion to a young French lady, and to give her instruction in English.
                     Address, for two days, with references, A. G., Charing Cross
                     Hotel. Salary, fifty guineas."
                  "Now, father," said Mabel, "if you can spare me a little while, maybe I can get
                     this fifty guineas."
                  "Spare you, Mabel!"
                  "Perhaps I will not be far from you, father. You know we have to get some money
                     for poor old Kirby and his wife."
                  "What do you think of doing, little Mabel?"
                  "I thought I would answer this advertisement. I speak French.
                        I am a gentlewoman. I can refer to the Reverend
                     Edward Grahame, A. M. Sharp street, Blackfriars, and to Sir Philip Grahame, M.
                     P., Grahame Manor, Castleton, Sussex."
                  "Run down to Kirby's daughter," said Mr. Grahame; "I cannot answer you
                     immediately; I must think a little. Take some jely with you."
                  "It is all gone, sir. I took the last to them on Saturday."
                  "Indeed! that is a misfortune. Well, go down anyhow and see what they need; I
                     promised to send you. Return in an hour."
                  With resolute courage the parson faced the appalling proposition. To be
                     separated from little Mabel! It was a long hour to both of them, but it passed. When she returned it was
                     dinner-time. The parson had an inflexible rule, which was to "dress for
                     dinner," no matter what the dinner was. To-day it was chops. She put a ribbon
                     in her hair, put on a lace collar, a gift from Uncle Philip last Christmas, and
                     took her father's arm as he came out of his chamber. The chops were too much
                     for their appetites, poor things!
                  "Do you think you ought to apply for this place, Mabel?" said her father.
                  "Yes, sir. That is, if you think so. It is large pay for very little work.
                     Indeed, it would be altogether pleasant but for leaving you."
                  "I have thought it might be good for you, child, to have so much change from
                     your monotonous life. And it is not so dreadful as it appears. Suppose you were
                     going to Grahame Manor for six months instead of two weeks?"
                  "I very much prefer Mr. A. G., even without counting his guineas. Really,
                     father, as you have so often told me, the sound is more frightful than the
                     substance. Nothing can prevent my coming to you any day; and poor old
                     Kirby—"
                  "There, there," said her father, "you may write the note. There will be forty
                     applicants ahead of you, and no doubt you will never hear of A. G. again. Time
                     enough to be distressed when the substance takes the place of the sound. Write
                     your note, child."
                  The postman left a letter addressed to Miss Mabel Grahame at the parson's house
                     the next day. Father and daughter read it together:
                  "Mr. Anthony Grippe begs to present his compliments to Miss Grahame, and is
                     very happy to accept her proposal. He goes to Paris to-night, and will return
                     early in next week with the young lady referred to in his advertisement. If
                     agreeable to Miss Grahame, Mr. Grippe would be glad to meet her at the railway
                     station at Gloucester, on Tuesday or Wednesday next. His carriage will be in
                     attendance on both days. His residence is Halidon, between Gloucester and
                     Merton. He encloses a check upon Messrs. Smith, Payne & Smith for five
                     pounds, to defray Miss Grahame's expenses, and begs to refer her to these
                     gentlemen for any information she may desire concerning Halidon and its
                     owner."
                  These two sat quietly looking at each other, after reading the polite note two
                     or three times. It was a more prompt response than they expected, and they were
                     rather stunned than otherwise.
                  "Gloucester, Merton, Halidon!" said Mr. Grahame, breaking the silence at last.
                     "Come into the study, Mabel; I must tell you a little story."
               
               
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  RADCLIFFE MERTON.
                  If Dr. Maguire had not turned into the drive at Halidon, just after he parted
                     from the young lady, he would have seen a dog-cart spinning down the road from
                     Gloucester, driven by a gay youth in fashionable attire, while his groom sat
                     with folded arms by his side. As the doctor did not approve of rapid driving,
                     and abominated that arrangement of motive-power known as "tandem," which was
                     employed in this instance, he would probably have included this gentleman
                     bowling along the road in his catalogue of lunatics. And if he had seen him
                     check his spirited horses suddenly at the lodge-gates, and overhead the
                     colloquy between him and his servant, he would have been confirmed in this
                     judgment.
                  "Did you notice that lady we just passed, Tim?" said the gentleman.
                  "Yes, sir," replied the groom, "brown merino dress, plain straw hat and brown
                     veil."
                  "No doubt; I did not observe her dress. Get down and follow her; find out
                     everything and bring me word. Have you any money?"
                  "Yes, sir. Three bob."
                  "Here is half a sovereign. Don't show yourself to anybody."
                  "No, sir. What will you do with the hosses?"
                  "I will drive to Merton Park, and go to Rose Cottage to-morrow. Be cautious,
                     Tim."
                  "All right, sir. This check-rein is too tight, sir; may I let it out a
                     bit?"
                  "No; the mare is making a regular brute of herself, sticking her nose up in the
                     air."
                  "Mouth bleeding a little, sir."
                  "All the better; she will get tired of tossing her head up, if it hurts. Go
                     along with you! She may turn into some by-road while you are loitering
                     here."
                  "I'm off, sir," answered Tim, touching his hat, and the dog-cart once more sped
                     down the road.
                  "What lovely eyes!" said the driver. "I only got a glimpse of them as her veil
                     blew aside. I would marry that girl to-morrow, if she would take me, without
                     asking a question."
                  
                  As he drove up the hill where the doctor had taken up the lady in question, he
                     slackened his pace a little. And if the reader were in the little fringe of
                     bushes on the roadside whence she emerged, he would be able to study the
                     character of this youth, now in the first blush of manhood, in so far as this
                     was manifested in his face.
                  He—that is, the courteous reader—would first notice a peculiarity in the growth
                     of the yellow moustache that covered his mouth. It appeared to grow out from
                     his upper lip as if each separate hair had been stuck in its place like pins in
                     a cushion, bending over and concealing his mouth. Whether this was a natural or
                     cultivated peculiarity, the effect was to give a truculent expression to a
                     countenance that was passably good-natured in appearance. The next point of
                     attraction was his eyebrows. These started from his nose at a sharp angle,
                     flaring away to the right and left, giving a feline expression to his eyes,
                     which were of a dull lead color. So the reader would somehow feel that here was
                     a face suggesting ferocity under excitement, treachery, possibly—variableness
                     certainly, habitual petulance perhaps—yet all of these more or less masked by a
                     certain thoroughbred expression of easy indifference. This was Mr. Radcliffe
                     Merton.
                  It may be that a little care bestowed upon these externals would have modified
                     their teachings. He might have combed his beard, which was a fair crop for one
                     of his age, into normal shape, and thus have gotten rid of the animal look and
                     the suggestion of bristles. He might have coaxed his eyebrows into the form of
                     an arch, and thus made his eyes less cat-like. But Nature, curiously enough,
                     always makes an ill-looking man satisfied with his own appearance, and in fact
                     leads him to aggravate rather than amend such peculiarities as are described
                     above. For example, Mr. Merton was rather vain of the unique hirsute growth
                     that hid his thin lips; and while everybody else instinctively thought of
                     bristles when they saw him, his mirror made no such suggestions to him.
                  Yet the reader should not be misled into thinking these unpleasant indications
                     very prominent. While they would be instinctively impressed upon the
                     consciousness at sight, it is likely that most of the impression would be
                     dissipated by subsequent intercourse. Mr. Merton had a pleasant voice. He had
                     spent the most of his life on the continent, and in good society; had been well
                     instructed in German schools; was a good musician, a ready talker, and quick at
                     repartee; usually good-tempered, but a terrible fighter when roused,
                     cold-blooded and remorseless. On the whole, he was rather a favorite with young
                     people, and only those who were old enough to heed their instincts would retain
                     the memory of the distrust born at the first encounter with him. Trumpley
                     Wailes, who had spent half-a-dozen years with him in Germany, part of the time
                     in a little, dull town where they were the only Englishmen, entertained a
                     brother's affection for him. The two boys were as essentially different as
                     possible, in character, habits of thought, aspirations and purposes, yet they
                     endured each other's contradictions with wonderful forbearance, each feeling a
                     sort of compassion for the other's weakness. It is worthy of note that this
                     forbearance terminated here, as these young rascals were always prompt for a
                     fray when any others incurred their displeasure. And also, that a wrong, real
                     or fancied, done to "Trump" ensured "Rad's" vengeance, and vice versa.
                  
                  As this young gentleman will figure more or less prominently in the story, the
                     brief outline sketch here given may suffice for the present. It is quite likely
                     that he will demonstrate himself far more accurately, in the anatomical sense
                     of the word, than could be done by pen-and-ink dissection.
                  Below the crest of the hill Mr. Merton met Mr. Podd. It is necessary to explain
                     here that the gardener, in coming from Gloucester, had gone over many miles
                     more than were requisite. His own house was half-way between Halidon and
                     Merton, and he had seen fit to get his own dinner at home, not thinking it
                     politic to depend upon the hospitality of the banker's stately mansion. The
                     young squire stopped his team again when he recognised the floriculturist.
                  "How are you, Podd?" he said. "What grounds are you about to adorn now?"
                  "Grippe's."
                  "Indeed? Some one told me that the old gentleman was fond of flowers. I have
                     never been to Halidon. Has he many?"
                  "Thousands!" responded Podd.
                  "Is the collection a fine one, Podd?"
                  "Best in this country, or any other," replied Podd, warming up a little. "It's
                     a burnin' shame for such an old hunks to have the best flowers in the land, all
                     shut up to hisself! If this wasn't the despotickest gov'ment in the world, it
                     couldn't be done. He's got flowers there that I never seed nowheres, not even
                     in books, and I don't know the names on 'em, though I know everything from a
                     daisy to a crown imperial. He's got a lot of Japanese lilies that bang the
                     world! If I could get one of them bulbs I could sell it for two guineas before
                     night."
                  "That sounds like covetousness, Podd," remarked Radcliffe, "but I will get you some—or stay, Mr. Wailes can do it
                     better. Ask him to write—"
                  "Don't want 'em," said Podd, rudely.
                  "What the devil do you mean?" said the fiery young squire; "you said just now
                     you could get two guineas a bulb."
                  "I've changed my mind," replied the gardener, doggedly; "I don't want no favors
                     from Master Wailes."
                  "Ah!" said Radcliffe, his eyes getting more cat-like, "you don't admire Mr.
                     Wailes, it seems."
                  "Can't abide him."
                  "What is the cause? Out with it, man! And take care how you speak of this
                     gentleman! He is my friend."
                  "Well, he's not mine, 'cause I never spoke to him. But he collared me and druv
                     me through the hedge at Rose Cottage, before I had time to wink."
                  "What had vou done, Podd?"
                  "Nothin'; not one mortal thing. The missus came up to teach me how
                     to plant a rose-bush, and I on'y said I knew my own business, and that the
                     grounds was your grounds anyhow, when the boy lit on me."
                  "Served you right too, you old rascal," said Merton, laughing. "How came you to
                     let a mere boy handle you so roughly?"
                  "He took me by surprise, like," answered Podd; "how could I know he was a goin'
                     to light on me for nothin'? Then the Squire was there too, and he would have
                     clapped me in the lock-up if I hadn't cleared out. He's a reg'lar
                     'ristocrat."
                  "Well, Podd," said Mr. Merton, as he moved away, "you got off cheaply. Mrs.
                     Wailes is a Trumpley of Halidon. Where the deuce did you get enough impudence
                     to address her rudely? Get up, Maggie."
                  "Trumpley of Halidon!" said Podd savagely, watching the retreating vehicle.
                     "Ay, ay! that's the whole story. When will, these blessed English people learn
                     that 'ristocrats are all made up of sound and impudence? How does Grippe of
                     Halidon go? How would Podd of Halidon go? If we was both rolled into one, and
                     had ten times as such money as Gripped has, and these Trumpleys was a layin' in
                     rags under the hedge, they would cock up their noses at us as if we was pigs.
                     Blast the Trumpleys of Halidon! I can't abide 'em."
                  Mr. Merton drove on at a brisk pace, leaving the democrat to his reflections.
                     He passed the lodge-gates of Merton Park and pulled up in the lane at the
                     entrance to Rose Cottage. Mrs. Wailes came out to the gate to welcome him.
                  "How are you, Radcliffe?" she said. "You are welcome to England. Come in. But
                     what will you do with your horses?"
                  "How d'ye do, Mrs. Wailes? Glad to see you looking so blooming, ma'am. Where is
                     Trump? Not here? I am going on to the Park, ma'am, thank you. Is Trump
                     there?"
                  "No, He went to Gloucester this morning. I think he intended to drive back with
                     you."
                  "Ah! I just missed him. I came away from Gloucester by a different road.
                     Suppose I drive back for him?"
                  "Oh no; he may return by lanes and by-ways. He is walking, you know. We will
                     see you this evening at the park; your uncle has invited us to dine there in
                     honor of your arrival."
                  "That's jolly! Well, then I will bid you good-morning, ma'am. All well at the
                     Park, I suppose?"
                  "Yes, Stop; I have a letter for you. It came this morning. Wait, and I'll bring
                     it out to you."
                  As he passed out of the lane into the highroad Mr. Merton opened his letter. It
                     was quite laconic.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "PARIS, Thursday.
                              
                              "Gone. Some old buffer, English, took her off yesterday. Got
                                 tickets for London. Haven't found out any names yet. Better luck
                                 next time. Yours,
                              
                                 LANNEY."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  "Gone!" said Radcliffe, as he tore up the note and scattered the fragments in
                     the road. "Gone! Well, if I can find out that lovely angel I passed to-day, it
                     will be all the better. Tim generally succeeds. He will bring some news anyhow.
                     And now for the Park people. Get along, Maggie!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER VIII.
                  ON THE WATCH.
                  Mr. Trumpley Wailes was an early riser. On the morning succeeding the day of
                     his swimming party he went to the village to procure certain delicacies which
                     his mother thought would be acceptable to the lady who came "down the brook"
                     with him. When he returned with his purchases he found Mrs. Wailes perplexed
                     over the note she had hastily written
                     before her abrupt departure. Breakfast, a trifle more elaborate than usual, was
                     waiting, and mother and son discussed the event over tea and toast.
                  "What do you think, of this matter, Mother?" said her son, after the fourth
                     analysis of the note letter by letter.
                  "I cannot reach a satisfactory conclusion, Trump," she replied. "Sometimes I
                     fancy she is demented."
                  "That is very unsatisfactory, certainly. I reject that theory promptly."
                  "Then, I fancy there is some urgent necessity for flight and concealment. She
                     may have run away from her home, and dreading pursuit, hurried away. She may
                     have gone to Gloucester, to take the train—"
                  "That is just it!" said Trumpley, starting up. "I have finished breakfast,
                     Mother; will you excuse me if I leave you to finish yours?"
                  "Where are you going, Trump?"
                  "To Gloucester, of course. She must go there; the luggage will be there, you
                     know. I can easily catch her before she reaches Gloucester."
                  "And then?"
                  "And then! Ah, I don't know, Mother. It will depend upon what she says, or upon
                     what her eyes say. Oh those heavenly eyes! Did you ever see such eyes,
                     Mother?"
                  "Very pretty eyes, Trump," was the quiet reply. "But you have other things to
                     consider. I am not sure it is decorous to intrude upon this young lady, or to
                     seek an explanation."
                  The impetuous boy drew back and resumed his seat. He took the note from his
                     pocket and read it again, and as he replaced it there came over his handsome
                     face an expression of settled resolve.
                  "Mother," he said, with irresistible pathos, "if I had a secret from you it
                     would burn itself out of my heart to yours. I am sure, dead sure, that I can
                     never love any woman but this one, if she is not separated from me by some
                     insurmountable barrier. I have saved her life. Heaven has sent her, I verily
                     believe, to make my life complete. Can you not trust me to search for her, and
                     learn why she was driven to write this unhappy note? Read it again: every word
                     has a tear in it. If she is not a gentlewoman, and a fit associate for my
                     gentle mother, do you not know that she could never attract your son? And if
                     there should be any reason why you would not take her to your heart as a
                     new-found daughter, do you not know that she could have no place
                     in mine?"
                  "Poor boy!" said his mother, "you have been indulging in romantic dreams so
                     long—"
                  "Pardon me, Mother, this is a sober reality. Do you think she is a lady?"
                  "Yes, certainly."
                  "When you left her last night did you say nothing?"
                  "She looked so languid and so grateful—" and Mrs. Wailes blushed—"that I think
                     I kissed her."
                  "Kiss me, Mother!" shouted Trumpley, catching up his hat, "and tell me that I
                     may go. Had is coming to-day; I'll return with him."
                  "Go then, Trump. I will not tell you to be prudent and watchful. Trump,
                     remember that you are not so free as you would be if you had not a claim upon
                     her gratitude."
                  "I understand, Mother. What a darling you are! I will never love any woman as I
                     love you. Off I go!"
                  "What a tiger the boy is!" said Mrs. Wailes, as she watched him clearing the
                     hedge at a leap. "And what troubles is he seeking in this mad adventure! But he
                     is discreet and wise, and the soul of honor; I will wait. Will he tell
                     Radcliffe, I wonder? No I don't; he will not tell Radcliffe."
                  As Trumpley strode along the highway he first overhauled the gardener, who was
                     plodding towards Gloucester with the intention of making very slow time.
                  "There is Podd," thought Wailes—"now what will the old rascal do? If he were
                     not such a surly curmudgeon I would speak to him. I think I will anyhow. He was
                     insolent once, but he knew no better, probably. Ah! he has seen me and has
                     drawn off to the other side of the road. Well, he leaves me no choice. He
                     ignores me; I must needs ignore him," and he sailed past Mr. Podd with his
                     screne eyes contemplating the serene sky, while Podd, also true to his nature,
                     investigated the nature of the soil he traversed.
                  Then Trumpley passed the crest of the hill. While he was surveying the clouds,
                     in passing Podd, another pair of eyes were surveying him, and their owner
                     slipped into the shadow of the bushes on the roadside. She had to wait until a
                     turn in the road hid him, lest he should look backward. She did not know then
                     that he did not indulge in retrospects.
                  At last he reached Gloucester. He was surprised that he had not overtaken the
                     lady. "She must be a stunner to walk!" he thought.
                  The station of course. All quiet there; no train due for hours. But he could
                     ask a few questions, and he soon found the stationmaster.
                  
                  This was an important personage, and to-day he was specially important. Many
                     persons were curious about the catastrophe of the previous day and asked
                     distracting questions. The station-master had a red face; red whiskers, long
                     and bushy, likewise. Trumpley saw how important he was, and he humored him.
                  Accident yesterday? Yes; might have been hawful. Rain washed away the
                     'butments. Nobody drownded—leastways only one young woman. Second-class. She
                     was not dead. Somebody fished her out. Don't know her name. Knowed she was
                     second-class because her box was in the luggage-room. Came out of the
                     second-class carriage. Besides, that was the only one that got its passengers
                     into the water. Box marked? Yes, sir—M. G. Must be her box, because all the
                     rest of the luggage was claimed and delivered. Do with it? Keep it till she
                     comes for it, of course. Where from? Lunnon.
                  The road had been repaired well enough to allow the passage of trains; next
                     train due at one fifteen—would stop at Brummagem.
                  She would come for her luggage. The best place to wait was near the
                     luggage-room. Evidently she had not appeared yet. On the opposite platform was
                     a paper-stand. He would go there and keep his eyes open. There was a truck near
                     the stand. He sat down upon it, and recalled all the events of yesterday. She
                     must come in at the west entrance, coming from Merton. He would watch the west
                     entrance.
                  He called to mind the thrill of joy when he first brought her beautiful face
                     above the surface of the discolored flood, and the convulsive clutch she
                     fastened upon his neck. Then the tokens of life, when he got her out upon the
                     bank. Then her yielding form when he took her in his arms and carried her to
                     the cottage. Then the little strip of violet under her tremulous eyelids, and
                     then the full blaze of her eyes as she threw up her arm and said, "Save me!"
                     Then the closing of her eyes again and the outer darkness. Then his audacious
                     theft of the little curl. And turning his back upon the world, his face to the
                     wall, he drew forth the tress and kissed it.
                  What is that? A lady! But she comes down the platform from the east entrance, a
                     thick brown veil over her face. It could not be his lady. Steady,
                     majestic, composed, she passed him, two yards off, as he started up in doubt.
                     While he looked, anxious and confused, his heart audibly thumping his ribs, she
                     went out by the western door. Should he follow? Certainly not. Her servant was
                     following her—a groom in a livery; his lady had no groom.
                  What is that? The rattle of the coming train. One fifteen! How the time had
                     flown! Here it comes, gliding smoothly into the station. There she is again!—on
                     the other platform. He would cross.
                  "Not across the rails, sir, please," said an official. "You must cross by the
                     bridge."
                  Across the bridge in a minute, and down among the passengers. Two or three men
                     were assisting an invalid. He could not run over them. Wait until they pass.
                     There is the brown veil just beyond them, and the eyes behind it are looking at
                     him. Heart thumping again. What fiend invented veils! She is speaking to a
                     railway porter. He touches his hat and points at an old gentleman, who is
                     coughing and spluttering at a great rate. It is old Mr. Grippe. There is her
                     groom again. Why, no! It is Tim!
                  "Why, Tim," said Trumpley, catching his arm as he was passing, "where are you
                     from? Who is that lady you are following so closely? Where is Mr. Merton?"
                  So many questions were confusing. Tim did not know how to answer. While he
                     stammered and hunted for a satisfactory lie, Wailes got another glimpse of the
                     brown veil as its wearer took Mr. Grippe's arm and disappeared in the
                     crowd.
                  "Lady, sir, Mr. Trumpley? What lady, sir? I ain't followin' no lady. I'm
                     looking for Master Radcliffe, sir."
                  "Is he in this train?"
                  "Dunno, sir. I thought he was in Glo'ster, but couldn't find him. Sent me on
                     last night to get the hosses. I must go look for him, please, sir," and Tim
                     dived into the crowd again.
                  In six or eight minutes the train moved away, and the station was deserted.
                     Suppose he looked into the luggage-room?
                  "Box? M. G. Yessir. Mr. Grippe's servant got it. Mr. Grippe was here. Dunno,
                     sir. Must be his daughter. Didn't know he had a daughter, sir; but my brother
                     is a porter in his bank, and he says the old gent has a daughter. Has been in
                     Paris, I b'lieve, sir—getting heddicated, I s'pose. Thankee, sir."
                  Miss Grippe!
                  This was not the culmination he expected. He would review the case as he walked
                     homeward. What in the world could he tell Mrs. Wailes, ne Trumpley of Halidon?
                  Half-a-mile from Gloucester he overtook Tim.
                  "Did you find Mr. Radcliffe, Tim?" he said.
                  "No, sir. He got the hosses and druv to Merton Park."
                  "Ah! and you are going to walk down?"
                  
                  "Yessir. Can't keep up with you though, Master Trumpley. I've seed you walk
                     before now. Quare start, that. I mean that young lady you thought I was
                     follerin'. Did you happen to see which way she went, sir?"
                  "Now I am sure he was following her," thought Wailes. "What does the impudent
                     rascal mean by such a question?" This thought passed through his mind while Tim
                     was speaking. He answered promptly. "Young lady! There were a dozen on the
                     platform, Tim. Which one do you mean?"
                  "Brown merino dress, straw hat and brown veil, sir," said Tim eagerly.
                  "I did not notice the color of any lady's dress, Tim. I think I did see one
                     with a brown veil. She went out of the east door, I believe. What was queer
                     about her?" he asked suddenly.
                  "Oh nothin', sir; only she seemed to go out o' sight so suddent. I seed her
                     when you caught my arm, and the next minnit she was gone. She warn't in any
                     cab; I looked in 'em all. I was only curious about her, sir, because you ax'd
                     me why I was a-follerin' her. That's all, sir. Good morning, sir."
                  "I am afraid Tim is lying," said Trumpley to himself.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IX.
                  FENCING.
                  When Trumpley reached Rose Cottage it was three o'clock. He found a frugal
                     luncheon awaiting, and an invitation to dine at Merton Park with his mother. He
                     told her all his adventures step by step, and the identity of Miss Grippe was
                     settled in two minutes. Brown merino dresss, brown veil and straw hat—Mrs.
                     Wailes identified' the habiliments instanter. And while Trumpley accused
                     himself of arrant stupidity in allowing her to pass him unquestioned, he was
                     still rejoiced to remember how promptly his heart recognised her and
                     acknowledged her proximity by trying to jump through his ribs. He did not
                     mention that little circumstance to his mother.
                  "What do you think about Mr. Grippe's daughter, Mother?" he asked timidly.
                  "Grippe's daughter indeed! Grippe's fiddlesticks!" replied Mrs. Wailes.
                  "I don't think he has any fiddlesticks, Mother," answered Trump doubtfully; "he
                     don't look like a musical gentleman."
                  "Do try to talk sensibly, Trump," said Mrs. Wailes. "How could so sweet a girl
                     be Mr. Grippe's daughter? I'm ashamed of you!"
                  This was in Trump's line. The rascal continued his aggravating suggestions.
                  "The account I received was very straight, Mother; and it cost me a shilling.
                     The luggage-porter said his brother was in Mr. Grippe's bank—"
                  "Trumpley Wailes," said his mother, with crisp intonations, "you may rely upon
                     my judgment in this case. This young lady is the daughter of a gentleman. Mr.
                     Grippe is probably a very worthly man—"
                  "Mr. Grippe of Halidon, Mother," said Trump slyly.
                  "Yes. There were some other owners of Halidon once, before Mr. Grippe's money
                     bought it, and I belong to their race; and consequently I have inherited the
                     instinct by which I recognise one of my own class. I did not exchange a dozen
                     sentences with that girl, whoever she may be, but each sentence she uttered
                     contained a dozen proofs that she was not Miss Grippe."
                  "Suppose she should claim such paternity, Mother?"
                  "I should say she was deluded—had been stolen in infancy, adopted
                     perhaps—anything rather than credit so monstrous a theory. Do you think you
                     could fancy yourself in love with a Miss Grippe?" This was argumentum ad hominem.
                  
                  "Ah, Mother," answered Trumpley, "I am afraid I should not stop to inquire. I
                     cannot account for my prompt surrender, but I am sure as I can be that I have
                     given all the love I can ever feel to this young lady. I cannot think that she
                     is Mr. Grippe's daughter, and I intend to know all that is to be learned before
                     the week is out. I wish you would explain my infatuation. I am ashamed of it,
                     while I cling to it as if it were the very spring of my life."
                  Mrs. Wailes was somewhat given to philosophise.
                  "Well, Trump," she said, "you naturally feel a strong interest in a person
                     whose life you have saved—"
                  "That won't do, Mother. I saved another girl's life once, but I never fell in
                     love with her."
                  "What other girl, Trump?"
                  "There!" said Trumpley, blushing, "I have gone and let it out. Please don't ask
                     me just yet, Mother. I will try to get her permission to tell you. Don't look
                     so astonished. It was a small affair; but she was in far greater peril than
                     Miss—shall I say Miss Grippe?"
                  
                  "No, sir," replied his mother, with asperity. "Oblige me by calling her some
                     other name."
                  "Aphrodite?" answered Wailes promptly.
                  "Her initials will not correspond," said Mrs. Wailes—"M. G."
                  "'My Goddess,' Mother; will that do?"
                  "No. I don't like goddesses."
                  "Let me see," said Trumpley. "It was on Tuesday that I found her. I shall call
                     her Mardi Gras. So you have both initials, Mother. Besides that, Tuesday is the
                     most blessed day I have ever known. Mardi Gras!"
                  "Which reminds me of our dinner to-day. We will walk over at six. What shall we
                     tell the Mertons about Mardi Gras?"
                  "Nothing, Mother. Let us keep our own counsel for the present. Don't say one
                     word about my encounter to-day; it is likely that I shall be questioned.
                        Nous verrons."
                  They were a jovial party at Merton Park, and Radcliffe was the lion. He had not
                     been in England for many months, and he was consequently plied with innumerable
                     questions on all sides. The Squire did not get up the double rubber as he
                     proposed. Mrs. Wailes took Miss Lucy's place in the game, and Mr. Thorne and
                     Dr. Maguire completed the Squire's party. The young people straggled about the
                     spacious rooms, Trump playing the agreeable to Miss Merton, while Radcliffe
                     paired off with Sybil. They had music by fits and starts, but everybody wished
                     to talk, excepting quiet Sybil.
                  This young lady has been in the background hitherto. It is very difficult to
                     describe her, as she was undemonstrative, and perhaps unattractive. Pretty,
                     certainly; good beyond a doubt; able to talk when she pleased, but not a
                     talker; perfectly polished, always proper in speech and behavior, yet rarely
                     making any lasting impression upon her interlocutors. She did not debate or
                     propound questions. She was utterly without the power to discover coincidences
                     and resemblances, as her sister had monopolished this faculty; and Miss Lucy
                     was more frequently at a loss to find a counterpart for Sybil than she was to
                     match any other mortal she encountered in the world. The Squire thought her the
                     most faultless of beings, and it is probable that these two understood each
                     other very accurately. The Squire would have sooner headed a rebellion against
                     the government than thwart Baby Sybil in the least of her whims and fancies.
                     She was the reigning authority at Merton Park, but nobody knew it, as her sway
                     was so gentle and quiet. Will the kind reader be content with this much
                     introduction, and allow Miss Sybil to develop herself?
                  In the course of the evening Radcliffe wandered to the whist-table, Miss Merton
                     disappeared to attend to some household cares, and Sybil and Trumpley were left
                     seated out of sight in the deep bay-window opening upon the lawn.
                  "Miss Sybil," said Trumpley, "if you will allow me to tell Mother, in strict
                     confidence, that little adventure of yours and mine, you will confer a great
                     favor upon me."
                  "Undoubtedly," she answered. "I was not aware that you were pledged to
                     secrecy—certainly not from Mrs. Wailes."
                  "I should not have mentioned it, however, without your permission; but I have
                     always told Mother everything, and it hurts me to have any concealment from
                     her."
                  "There is nothing to conceal from anybody," she said quietly. "I did not tell
                     Papa because I thought it would distress him, and perhaps for fear he might
                     jump at some rash conclusion."
                  "What do you mean?" said Trump, promptly and imperatively.
                  "I mean he might have suspected an innocent person of evil intent—"
                  "Do you suspect any innocent person?"
                  "I don't know. There is no proof. I would have no suspicion but for you."
                  "I have no suspicion," said Trump. "Let us keep quiet about the affair. I will
                     tell Mother, and no one else. Some day it may happen that another will speak of
                     it, and then you will be freed from suspicion also."
                  "I should like to tell your part of the adventure," said Sybil, softly.
                  "Pshaw! Excuse me. Here comes Rad; I must relinquish my seat to him. Here, Rad
                     come look at the moon."
                  "Are you making poetry, Trump? By-the-bye, I want a full account of your
                     adventure yesterday. Out with it!"
                  "There is nothing more than Mother told you at dinner," replied Wailes. "A
                     young lady fell into the water, and I pulled her out."
                  "Yes, but what was she like?"
                  "Ah! that is a difficult question. She was quite wet; her eyes were closed, and
                     she looked pale and languid. I left her in Mother's charge, and when I got home
                     this morning she was gone."
                  "Leaving a note?"
                  "Yes. There were a few lines on a sheet of paper, saying she was obliged to
                     leave without ceremony."
                  The few lines were wrapped about a little brown curl and reposing upon
                     Trumpley's breast at that moment, but he forgot to mention that fact.
                  
                  Radcliffe was not satisfied. He longed to ask a lot of questions, but hardly
                     knew where to begin. Trump seemed to be fencing with him, and as he had fenced
                     with him before, he was cautious.
                  "What were you doing at Gloucester to-day, Trump?" he began. This was a
                     preliminary flourish of his foil in the way of a salute.
                  "I thought I might meet you, and ride back with you. But you must have driven
                     over the east road." This was the return salute.
                  "Precisely," replied Radcliffe. "You saw Tim in Gloucester though? At least he
                     says he walked with you on the return journey until your long limbs left
                     him."
                  "Yes; he said he could not keep step. Anyhow, I came across the fields, through
                     private grounds, and stopped once."
                  "Sybil," said Radcliffe, "don't trust this fellow's pretty speeches, if he has
                     been making any. He was watching a young damsel at Gloucester to-day. Tim says
                     he was greatly interested in her." This was thrust number one, en carte. Trump did not take the trouble to parry
                     it.
                  "Mr. Wailes never makes pretty speeches," replied Sybil.
                  "How do you know that?" said Radcliffe. "Trump, did you make any pretty
                     speeches in Gloucester?"
                  "Not to a damsel, certainly," answered Wailes. "I thought Tim was very intently
                     watching a lady, and I asked him who she was. Did he tell you?" This was a
                     straight thrust, en tierce, and was a
                     palpable hit.
                  "No—yes—that is, he said he was attracted by the walk of a lady, and while he
                     was looking at her, you caught his arm and asked her name. I thought you
                     probably followed her up afterwards, as you are such a persevering fellow."
                  "Not I," said Trumpley with charming indifference; "I left the station a few
                     minutes after Tim. You were not on the train, so I walked soberly home." Then
                     he twisted Radcliffe's weapon completely out of his grasp with the next
                     sentence. "Once for all, I dissipate your insinuations. I make no pretty
                     speeches to any damsel until I am owner of something equivalent to Halidon. I
                     am not going to marry any woman who is richer than I am, and I am not going to
                     ask any woman to share poverty with me. To-morrow I am going to make my first
                     effort towards—"
                  "What?" said Sybil and Radcliffe in a breath."
                  "Victory, or death!" said Trump, rising. "Miss Sybil, Mother is about to break
                     up the whist party. Ten o'clock! Mrs. Wailes heard the hall-clock, certainly.
                     We shall have a lovely walk in the moonlight. Envy us!"
                  "We will do better," answered Sybil. "Radcliffe, let us walk as far as the
                     stile. Lucy will take Mrs. Wailes' seat, no doubt, as Papa will not quit whist
                     before eleven."
               
               
                  CHAPTER X.
                  SYBIL.
                  When Mrs. Wailes, and her son had made their adieux, Radcliffe and Sybil
                     followed them out into the moonlight. Sybil slipped her arm through the older
                     lady's, and directing the gentlemen to precede them, these two were soon
                     interested.
                  "I have not asked you any questions, Mrs. Wailes," said Sybil; "but there are
                     some things I have been curious to know about the lady your son rescued. May I
                     ask you while we walk?"
                  "Certainly, my dear. You may ask any questions you please."
                  "Well, ma'am, I have wondered what were the circumstances of this lady—she was
                     a lady?"
                  "Undoubtedly."
                  "You did not learn her name?"
                  "No. The doctor ordered quiet, and I expected to have my curiosity gratified
                     this morning. I cannot be certain as to her circumstances. She had a few pounds
                     in her purse. Her dress was plain, but of good material. Her departure is a
                     mystery that I cannot fathom. She left a guinea for the doctor. Had she been
                     very poor she would not have done that—unless—"
                  "Unless what?"
                  "Unless she is so throughbred that an obligation is more intolerable than
                     privation. Trumpley has such a weakness."
                  "I have walked with you to-night to tell you something about him. He asked my
                     permission to tell you, but I will forestall him."
                  Mrs. Wailes started. She admired Sybil greatly, and had indulged in sundry sly
                     dreams in which Sybil and her son figured. They were only dreams. Trump had
                     nothing, save a very thorough education, and hitherto this had not been
                     remunerative. His father's estate, settled during Trumpley's minority, had
                     dwindled away until it now afforded him something under two hundred pounds a
                     year. This would not justify matrimony. Her annuity of five hundred pounds would cease with her life. But she had
                     sometimes allowed her imagination to picture a rural home in Australia, where a
                     little money would purchase many acres, and where Sybil and Trump would build a
                     happy home and reclaim the prosperity of the old Trumpleys. There were two
                     obstacles marring this pleasant picture; first, the tacit agreement that
                     Radcliffe should marry Sybil, of which Mrs. Wailes had had many hints from Miss
                     Merton; and second, the vision that Trump had found in the rushing waters of
                     Merton's Brook on the previous day. She knew perfectly well that nothing would
                     efface that vision from his mind and memory.
                  "You need not start," said Sybil, laughing; "there is nothing very dreadful to
                     tell you. It was only a few weeks ago, on the fourth of July. There was an
                     American gentleman at the Park that day, visiting Papa, and something he said
                     fixed the date in my mind. I believe the Fourth of July in America is like
                     Christmas in England. You know Christmas comes in summer in Australia."
                  "Yes," answered Mrs. Wailes, "but not in America."
                  "Well, I always get the two countries mixed up somehow. They speak English, you
                     know; at least Mr. Clinton speaks very good English. He is the American
                     gentleman I mentioned—such a lovely beard!"
                  "Indeed! But what is the story you have to tell?"
                  "Oh! Well, ma'am, I walked over to the mill. Mr. Thorne had told us about Mrs.
                     Jennings' illness, and I took her some custards. Mr. Wailes was there."
                  "I remember," said Mrs. Wailes; "I sent him over. He did not tell me he had met
                     you."
                  "The miller had a horrid dog, a great brute chained to his kennel. I noticed
                     him when I went in, as he growled at me. When I came out I crossed the stile to
                     walk home across the meadow, and found your son fishing in the brook. Just
                     before I got to him I heard the rattling of a chain, and looking back, I saw
                     the great yellow dog come tearing across the stile. I believe I screamed;
                     anyhow, Mr. Wailes dropped his rod and ran past me to meet the mastiff.
                  "I can hardly tell you how it occurred, but when the dog reared up your son
                     darted upon him and caught the brass collar, and in a minute they were rolling
                     over the grass together. Mr. Wailes stuck to him, roaring out to me to go back
                     to the mill and send some man down to help. I looked at them as I ran, and saw
                     him with both hands in the collar holding the brute down on the ground. The
                     chain was wrapped round the dog's body, and your son was kneeling on the end of
                     it. This helped no doubt to keep him down, though he was struggling violently.
                     When I got to the mill I found old Podd the gardener there. I told him to come
                     quickly to help Mr. Wailes, and he refused. There was no one else there; Mr.
                     Jennings was in the village. Podd was sitting on a bench outside the mill,
                     eating bread and cheese. He was cutting his bread with a great pruning-knife,
                     as coolly as if nothing were the matter; and when he laid the knife down on the
                     bench beside him, I snatched it up and ran back. Mr. Wailes was waiting
                     patiently.
                  "'Is anybody coming?' he said.
                  "'No; there is no one there but Podd, and he says he is afraid.'
                  "'The old rascal!' said your son.' I don't know how long I can hold this mad
                     brute. If I quit his throat he will fly at mine.'
                  "'I have brought you Podd's knife,' I said; 'is it of any use to you?'
                  "'The very thing! Just wait until I get my foot on the chain. Now! Is the knife
                     open?'
                  "'Yes,' I answered. 'What are you going to do?'
                  "'Cut his throat, of course. Throw the knife over here.'
                  "'But I cannot look at you,' I said, shuddering.
                  "'You may close your eyes then. Hillo! here's Podd.'
                  "Podd came slowly down the bank, just as Mr. Wailes seized the knife. The dog
                     was writing like a great yellow snake, held down by the chain and by your son's
                     grip of his collar. As soon as Podd saw the situation of affairs he quickened
                     his pace, and caught Mr. Wailes' arm.
                  "'Don't stick the dog,' he said; 'I'll take him off. Give me hold of his
                     collar. Quiet. Tiger! Be quiet, sir!'
                  "'Now, Mr. Podd,' said your son, 'let us understand matters. Take the brute off
                     if you like; but if he should get away from you—'
                  "'Well?' said Podd.
                  "'Well,' continued Mr. Wailes gently, 'I'll kill him as soon as he is loose,
                     and I'll cut off your ears before he breathes his last, as sure as my name is
                     Trumpley Wailes. Now take him or be gone, whichever you like.'
                  "Podd took the chain in his hand, and your son arose. The dog shook himself
                     clear of the links of the chain, and suffered Podd to lead him away. He was
                     either completely subdued by his fright, or else he was entirely under the
                     gardener's control. Mr. Wailes regained his rod, and throwing Podd's knife
                     after him, he joined me in the meadow and walked nearly to Merton Park. Then he
                        went back to the mill for his
                     basket. He said he had four fine trout in it, and you expected some.
                  "'Are you not afraid of that mad beast?' I asked, as he bade me good-bye.
                  "'Which?' he answered;. 'Podd or the dog?'
                  "'The dog, of course.'
                  "'Not in the least. Podd will chain him up, no doubt. I am afraid the scoundrel
                     let him loose.'
                  "'Oh, Mr. Wailes!' said I, shocked.
                  "'Well, let us keep quiet about the adventure, and see what is said about it.
                     If Podd is innocent I shall find it out.' And so we parted. Here is the stile.
                     Good night."
                  "Good-night, my dear. Radcliffe, take good care of Sybil. Trump, give me your
                     arm."
                  When Sybil and her escort were hidden under the trees, Mrs. Wailes asked her
                     son if he had received any injuries in the "dogfight"?
                  "Not a scratch, Mother. Sybil has told you about it, I see. He was a tolerably
                     good handful, but I caught his collar at the first jump; the chain that he was
                     dragging after him caught in a bush and held him an instant, and I had him down
                     the next. The other brute is little less than a murderer! The staple that held
                     the chain, fastening it to the kennel, was still hanging to it; came out when I
                     knelt upon it. He saw me fishing below the mill, and, no doubt, forced the
                     staple out and so let the dog loose. Sybil came out of the mill on the other
                     side, and when the dog saw her, he naturally ran after her. I heard the chain
                     rasping over the stile, and got between them in time. The villain evidently
                     intended the dog to throttle me."
                  "Of whom are you speaking, Trump?"
                  "Podd."
                  "Are you sure?"
                  "Dead sure, Mother. Though I could not swear to it, I saw him creeping away
                     from the mill—that is, I thought I recognised him before I saw the dog. Then I
                     saw Sybil, and I had no time to watch Podd. The case was urgent. But he was
                     certainly at the mill when Sybil went back, and I can hardly imagine that he
                     could get there so soon. But he had such a hang-dog expression of countenance
                     that he confirmed my suspicion."
                  "What motive, Trump—"
                  "Hate! The poor old wretch hates me mortally. I know no reason, except that I
                     turned him out of the grounds at Rose Cottage that day when he was insolent to
                     you."
                  "What do you intend to do about the matter?"
                  "Nothing. I thought if Miss Merton and I both kept silent, we might hear from
                     some one else how the dog got loose; but I have not heard a word."
                  "Don't be too positive, Trump. You may be mistaken, and it is better to incur
                     the risk of sparing the guilty than that of condemning the guiltless."
                  "That is true, Mother. I will not charge him with this trick until I have
                     proof; and I will tell Miss Sybil that I recall my 'suspicions,' as she terms
                     them."
                  "That is the correct term, Mr. Trump. Sybil is a sensible woman."
                  "True again, Mother. I admire her greatly."
                  "Will Radcliffe get her, Trump?"
                  "By Jupiter! that is a sudden proposition. Let me consider a little."
                  They walked on in the moonlight, each looking with great enjoyment upon the
                     beautiful sylvan scenery. Merton's Brook was in sight as they approached the
                     lane leading to Rose Cottage, and it seemed so innocent and placid that no one
                     would suspect it of such misconduct as that recorded in the opening chapter of
                     this history. As Trumpley held the gate open for his mother to pass in, he
                     answered her last question.
                  "I don't think Rad can get Sybil, Mother. I have been all over the case since
                     you suggested it. Rad is not the man for her, and she is not the sort of woman
                     for Rad. Such a marriage would appear to me to be monstrous."
                  "I have sometimes thought she was the sort of woman for you Trump," said Mrs.
                     Wailes.
                  "Ah, Mother! that is still more monstrous. Mardi Gras or celibacy!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER XI.
                  TRADE.
                  The late Mr. Wailes was an aristocrat of the first water. Mr. Podd would have
                     declared relentless war against him if he had known him. His inheritance was
                     sorely encumbered when he received it, and, like a wise man, he sold his landed
                     property, got rid of all debts, kept
                     his wife's annuity intact, and making provision in his will for the thorough
                     education of his son, departed this life. He was the more exclusive when he
                     gave up his landed estate than before, an additional supply of pride coming
                     with acknowledged poverty. This is very frequently the case, and the reader
                     will probably find plenty of examples among his own acquaintances.
                  Mrs. Wailes took her son to Germany, and during most of his nonage he was under
                     the tutelage of German and French instructors. The last three years of his
                     Continental life were spent at the University of Gottingen. Master Trumpley had
                     Radcliffe with him there, and these two Britishers had each three duels, of
                     course—one with sabres and two with small-swords. They learned early in their
                     first year that these little amusements were nearly inevitable, and they both
                     prepared sedulously for, the coming ordeal by taking daily lessons from the
                     most expert masters, and spending all spare hours in sword-play in their own
                     apartment. In the sabre-fights Trump sliced a lobe from the right ear of his
                     antagonist, and Radcliffe improved the shape of his opponent's nose. In both
                     his rapier-duels Wailes made a neat little hole in the sword arm of his enemy.
                     Rad imitated his for bearance in his first encounter, with a French student;
                     but in the second he was angry, and he inflicted a more, serious would upon a
                     harmless youth from America, who had been driven into the duel by his German
                     friends. He was abed six weeks after the encounter. The first blood drawn
                     always ended the combat, by inflexible law.
                  These boys—for they were only boys—did not tell the story of their fights at
                     home. Mrs. Merton would probably have bewailed her hard fate in being worried
                     with a boy and his tricks; Mrs. Wailes would have been horror-stricken, very
                     properly. But in reality the contests were rarely serious, as the combatants
                     were padded three or four inches thick, and their hurts were usually only
                     cracked crowns or scratched faces. The English boys were expert boxers, and
                     they pummelled each other amicably with the gloves at all opportunities. The
                     German students could not be induced to join in these exercises.
                  Mrs. Wailes and Mrs. Merton seldom met; they did not assimilate. The Captain's
                     widow was rich, frivolous and fond of display, and in all of these particulars
                     Mrs. Wailes afforded a fine contrast. Besides, the latter perpetually
                     remembered her long ancestral line, which Mrs. Merton, having no such
                     encumbranches, did not appreciate. The Merton blood was good enough, but
                     whatever benefit there was in that, Radcliffe monopolished. Two generations
                     back the Radcliffes had been prosperous mill-owners, without any ancestry to
                     speak of.
                  Mr. Wailes, senior, had kept his views on record touching many points. He had
                     anticipated his death many years before it occurred, and his will was a small
                     part of the manuscripts he left behind him. There was a tolerably bulky volume,
                     which he had entitled "Meditations," containing odd bits of philosophy,
                     fragments of personal history, and some short arguments upon various questions
                     of morals and manners. This book both Mrs. Wailes and her son regarded with
                     profound veneration, and each secretly resolved to get it into type "some day"
                     when money should be more plenty.
                  When they reached Rose Cottage, after their moonlight walk, Trumpley produced
                     the volume of Meditations, and asked his mother's permission to read a passage
                     to her. It was a short essay upon "Trade."
                  "I will only give you a short extract, Mother," said he; "you can read the
                     whole essay any time."
                  "'I have never been able to see any wisdom in the popular judgment regarding
                     Trade. The theory that a gentleman loses caste by engaging in commercial
                     pursuits is born of ignorance, and is essentially upstart and underbred. I have
                     never done anything by which money was earned, lacking ability or opportunity,
                     or both. But in so far, I have contradicted and opposed the beneficent law
                     which connects wage with labor, and so has every gentleman in England who fears
                     to stain his name with trade and his hands with work.'"
                  "That is very sensible, Trump," said his mother, seeing he paused for her
                     comment, "but the gentlemen of England work in a thousand ways—in political
                     life, in the Church—"
                  "Yes, ma'am, that is what he proceeds to say; but he adds: 'Trade proper;
                     buying and selling commodities and getting gain therefrom; regulating exchange,
                     and by wise foresight earning profit in the complicated systems of banking,
                     corresponding with commercial capitals all over the civilised world—surely
                     these employments demand the exercise of faculties of higher grade than we
                     usually find in subordinate political office. A polished attach, who accomplishes his apprenticeship at St.
                     Petersburg or Madrid, blossoms into the full-blown Minister at last; but he
                     would be hopelessly wrecked if required to write a sensible letter, treating of
                     finance or trade. It is a grand mistake to relegate these occupations to meaner
                     hands. Finance and trade, even in their manipulations and minor details, should
                     be managed by English gentlemen.'"
                  
                  "This is a new proposition, Trump," said Mrs. Wailes thoughtfully. "I am
                     inclined to think your, father was right, but the doctrine is rather startling.
                     I must meditate a little before I can give a sound opinion."
                  "There is a word or two more, Mother," said Trumpley. "If my son should see an
                     opportunity to improve his fortunes, if he should have any desire to recover
                     the status which his ancestors on both sides inherited—and lost, I know of no
                     methods more certain or more honorable than those that offer in the various
                     avenues of commerce. Labor is ennobling, not degrading; subordination under the
                     tutelage of experienced masters of trade or finance is no more humiliating than
                     subordination to college professors: and, as the culminating argument, I may
                     add, all the advantages that are gained by liberal education, or are inherited
                     from gentle ancestors, are helps, not hindrances, to the attainment
                     suggested."
                  When Trumpley closed the volume and replaced it on its accustomed shelf, they
                     sat in silence for some time, each busy with secret meditations. Mrs. Wailes
                     was recalling a hundred tokens of wisdom in her husband's philosophy, and the
                     extract just read brought to her mind many kindred propositions which had
                     become part of her creed. Trumpley was thinking of the violets hidden by long
                     lashes, and of the most direct way to get a sight of them again. He lighted her
                     candle for her as they were parting for the night, and as he placed it in her
                     hand, he said simply:
                  "Mother, I want Halidon. I have an income of one hundred and ninety-two pounds
                     a year; I want to multiply that by fifty. Mr. Grippe got Halidon by business
                     pursuits. If you approve, I will offer my services to Mr. Grippe to-morrow. If
                     he won Halidon, why may not I? Answer me to-morrow, Mother dear."
                  "Trump," said his mother, slyly, "is it Halidon you want, or Mardi Gras?"
                  "Both, Mother. I don't want Halidon without her; and I am not certain that I
                     want her without Halidon or its equivalent—that is, I desire such revenue as
                     will enable me to give her what any English lady would covet."
                  "And what do you think of the comments of Radcliffe and the Squire, and all the
                     magnates you know, about your entrance into trade?"
                  "That!" answered Mr. Trumpley Wailes, snapping his fingers so vigorously that
                     they made a report like a pistol-shot.
                  His mother laughed at his energetic response, patted him on the back, and
                     kissed him.
                  "My son," she said, looking at him with kindling eyes, "I do not need any
                     deliberation. You shall do as you please in this matter. Nothing but vice, or
                     crime, or sin can degrade Trumpley Wailes. I have saved a little money—not
                     much, but enough probably to put you into Mr. Grippe's bank in some position.
                     Poor boy, you have a secret suspicion that Mardi Gras is Miss Grippe, after
                     all."
                  "Not I, Mother," answered Trump, stoutly; "but I have a strong suspicion that
                     she went to Halidon with him; and I have another strong suspicion that I shall
                     follow her there, sooner or later. Goodnight, Mother. I will put you in your
                     old room over the south terrace—or—"
                  "Or what, Trump?"
                  "I'll strangle old Grippe!"
                  While Trumpley was divesting himself of his habiliments, he soliloquised:
                  "I am not going to take a penny of Mother's money," he thought; "I don't need
                     any money. I shall offer my body and brains to Mr. Grippe for whatever
                     remuneration he pleases; or, if he must have money, I shall sell my Consols.
                     Suppose the old gentleman won't take me at any price? What then?
                  "Why, I will take my capital and open a bank next door to him. And I can get
                     depositors perhaps.
                  "But how could I pay them interest? I don't know how Mr. Grippe makes interest.
                     I shall have to go through an apprenticeship somewhere.
                  "If the terrible jackass who controls that stunning periodical, The
                        London Demonstrator, monthly, had not returned my manuscript 'with
                     thanks,' I might have done something in literary work.
                  "I must get some sleep. Another tramp to Gloucester to-morrow. Oh heavenly
                     eyes! when shall I see you again?"
                  And the youth fell asleep. And then he saw the twin violets a hundred times;
                     once, flashing out of rushing waters—earnest, pleading, full of agony and
                     terror; then, languidly gazing at him, in semi-consciousness, upon the verdant
                     bank of the brook; then shyly glancing at him from under drooping lids, and the
                     last vision he got before his dreams faded away, was a look that seemed to suit
                     the eyes exactly—trusting and loving.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XII.
                  BROWLER BROTHERS.
                  It was after ten o'clock when Mr. Wailes entered the bank of Browler Brothers.
                     He and his mother were both clients of this institution, and he was received
                     politely. He asked for Mr. Grippe, and after some little delay he was ushered
                     into the private office.
                  Mr. Grippe had cast his wig, and he looked much more respectable in
                     consequence. He was seated at his desk, which was full of letters received by
                     the morning mail. The balances at the credit of Trumpley and his mother were
                     not very large, but they never overdrew, and they never asked any favors, so
                     they were popular customers. Besides, it was an aristocratic name, and Mr.
                     Grippe had due respect for station. He shook hands with Trumpley, drew a chair
                     nearer the desk, and requested him to be seated. And while Wailes was
                     meditating his plan of attack, Mr. Grippe was wondering what the deuce the
                     youth wanted.
                  "Mr. Grippe," said Trumpley at last, "you are aware that my income is not very
                     large?"
                  "Wants a loan," said Grippe to himself, as he bowed in the equivocal manner
                     peculiar to bankers when you ask them for money upon doubtful security.
                  "Well, sir," continued Trump, "I have determined to add to it by some sort of
                     useful occupation. And I have come to you first, hoping I could find the
                     opportunity here and in your service."
                  This was decidedly a plunge in medias res.
                  
                  "I am not sure that I understand you," said Mr. Grippe, pushing his chair back
                     from the desk and looking through his spectacles at the embryo banker.
                  "It is very plain, sir," replied Trumpley. "I wish to engage in some employment
                     that will add to my revenue. I do not know what I can do, but you can measure
                     my capabilities, no doubt. I know two or three languages—"
                  "French and German?" said Grippe.
                  "Both, sir, quite as well as English. Also the ancient tongues. But I am
                     totally ignorant of the details of business, and feel very doubtful—"
                  "If you can read and write French and German," said Mr. Grippe, "you can be of
                     some slight use to me at once. My corresponding clerk is ill; probably will
                     never be better. I have a note from him this morning offering his resignation.
                     Poor fellow, he has a wife and child."
                  "Will you allow me," said Trump eagerly, "to act as his substitute—not for pay,
                     but to keep his place until he gets better? Let his salary go on, and I will
                     work like a Trojan to a master the duties of the position. Only a little
                     patience, a little allowance for the blunders of ignorance, and I shall satisfy
                     you within a week."
                  "Humph!" said Mr. Grippe; "if I understand you, I don't see how your revenue
                     will be increased by such an arrangement."
                  "My revenue? My dear sir, I have abundance for my present need, and I have no
                     wife nor child. Besides, I shall be learning all the time, and so accumulating
                     capital. I do hope you will allow me to try."
                  "Please to write your name and address in full. Here, sit at my desk; there is
                     a pen. So. 'H. Trumpley Wailes, Rose Cottage, Merton, Gloucester.' That is not
                     in full. What does H. stand for?"
                  "Harold."
                  "And you are named after Harold Trumpley?"
                  "Yes, sir—my uncle."
                  Mr. Grippe fell to sneezing and coughing. He trotted around the office, lighted
                     a cigarette and poisoned the air. When he coughed and spluttered, Trump felt
                     like pounding him on the back, but he thought he had better not.
                  "You did not happen to know the original Harold Trumpley of Halidon?" said Mr.
                     Grippe, between the paroxysms.
                  "No, sir; he died a few years before I was born."
                  "Ah, yes; certainly," another fit of choking and spluttering. "Well, you write
                     a very fair hand; but you have not considered all the obstacles. Ignorance?
                     Yes. But that may be surmounted in time. There are worse obstacles. Did you
                     ever hear of a young gentleman, with a name like yours, with access to the best
                     society in the country, going into trade?"
                  "I believe not, Mr. Grippe," replied Wailes, "but I am eager to set the
                     example. I have not the slightest idea what duties I can perform in an
                     establishment like this, but I am sure there is nothing that will damage my
                     honor. As for the opinions of my friends, or enemies if I have any, I am
                     utterly indifferent about them. The best society in the county would cease to
                     be attractive to me if access to it could be lost by my engaging in any honest
                     work. There is only one person in the world whose opinion would sway mine, and
                     I have already consulted her."
                  
                  "Her?" said Mr. Grippe, his eyes twinkling.
                  "Yes, sir—my mother."
                  "Ah! Then you have met no other woman whose opinion you would consult?"
                  "No, sir—that is—I don't know, sir," and Trumpley blushed beautifully, while
                     Mr. Grippe watched him with rat-like eyes. "There is another woman
                     in the world, with whom I have scarcely spoken, who might exert some influence
                     over me and my actions if I knew her. I don't even know her name, sir. I have
                     seen her but once or twice, and she has suddenly disappeared."
                  "Have you no idea where she is?" said the banker, still watching.
                  "Yes, sir; I think she is near Gloucester. I hope to ask your aid when I search
                     for her—"
                  "Ah, well," said Mr. Grippe suddenly, "time enough for that. What salary will
                     you expect?"
                  "Whatever you please, sir."
                  "Pooh! That is a poor beginning. Always make your contracts accurately at the
                     beginning, and then stick to your engagements. How much do you want?"
                  "Really, Mr. Grippe, it is not possible for me to answer you. Suppose you take
                     me for a time on trial, or let me take your ailing clerk's place, while you
                     continue his salary."
                  "Tom Brand, you mean. I give him two hundred a year. Do not distress yourself
                     about him; his salary will be continued while he lives, and when he dies his
                     wife will be provided for. I gave him an additional fifty two years ago upon
                     condition that he invested it in life insurance. The policy is in my safe. When
                     do you wish to begin?"
                  "This morning, if you please."
                  "Very well. One preliminary word. There is a law in trade founded in good
                     morals: all the secrets of a house are sacred, and all the transactions of a
                     house are secrets. That is to say, that it is immoral to speak of the affairs
                     of your house beyond its walls. Do you understand?"
                  "Perfectly. And allow me one preliminary word. I shall speak to you always with
                     entire frankness. If you do not desire me to speak upon any topic that I may
                     think you ought to hear of, you will only have to say so."
                  "Agreed," said Mr. Grippe promptly. "I will give you two hundred pounds a year
                     at present, payable quarterly. Is it enough?"
                  "Munificent, sir."
                  "I wish you to take charge of my foreign correspondence. Take those letters and
                     give me a synopsis of their contents as soon as you can." He touched a bell.
                     "Mr. Choppy, show Mr. Wailes to Brand's desk; he takes his place for the
                     present."
                  Mr. Choppy was head man, cashier—the autocrat of Browler Brothers—and had been
                     for thirty years. The clerks thought him a far greater man than Mr. Grippe, and
                     dreaded him far more. He was a large man, with a base voice and a bald head,
                     his face closely shaven, a shirt collar white and sharp, always threatening to
                     cut off his ears. A little strip of whisker would have been an enormous relief
                     to the head, which was always polished and shining. He had mild, sleepy-looking
                     blue eyes, which nothing escaped; and the first thing he saw in Trumpley was
                     the soft brown moustache that adorned his visage. Mr. Choppy did not approve of
                     beards.
                  "This way, sir, if you please," said Mr. Choppy, his voice pitched on the lower
                     leger line of the bass clef. He led the way into a comfortable little anteroom
                     furnished with one desk only. "Shall you be here long, Mr. Wailes?" asked the
                     cashier, inviting the newcomer to be seated at the desk.
                  "Ah, Mr. Choppy," replied Wailes, with a frank smile, "that is precisely the
                     question I was just asking myself. If I succeed in pleasing you and Mr. Grippe,
                     I may finish my career here."
                  "Indeed!" said Mr. Choppy, speaking an octave higher. The smile and the adroit
                     coupling of his name with that of the banker, his own in the lead, fairly
                     vanquished him. "Well, Mr. Wailes," he continued, "you have charge of very
                     important duties. This desk is a very important desk—very! Any hints you may
                     need I shall be happy to give you, I'm sure. By-the-bye you are the only
                     gentleman in the house who wears a beard."
                  "Are beards objectionable?" answered Trumpley, startled. "If so, off it
                     goes."
                  "Nay," said Mr. Choppy, "do not be rash. You see you will not come in contact
                     with customers. If Mr. Grippe did not object, I'm sure I shall not."
                  This was a tremendous victory for Trumpley; but the remorseless rascal hit the
                     cashier once more, just between the eyes.
                  "I see among these letters, sir, one from Corfu. The writing is bad, but I can
                     make it out. What a horrid hand the fellow writes! Perhaps you can
                     explain—"
                  "Not now, my dear sir. In fact I should be at a great loss to decipher that
                     abominable writing. The figgers are plain enough— drachmas, you know. Brand always had a time over
                     those letters. Kiantokos and Company—I know them of old; a good house, though.
                     You will not be under the usual rules, sir. Four o'clock was Mr. Brand's hour;
                     but he always had his letters finished. Must go now. If you need anything,
                     touch that bell and a messenger will come; Chunk will be yours.
                        Good morning, sir!" and Mr. Choppy disappeared.
                  Chunk was a fat boy about twelve. He knew everything and was communicative. The
                     only confusion about him was in the use of the aspirate. In half-an-hour
                     Trumpley had learned from him all the routine of Browler Brothers' bank. In two
                     hours he had mastered the letters, made a synopsis of their contents in
                     English, and had sent them by Chunk's fat hands to the inner office, where Mr.
                     Grippe sat in solitary state.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XIII.
                  D. W. C. STRATTON.
                  The author hopes the announcement of a new name at the head of this chapter
                     will not appal the reader. Although now formally presented for the first time,
                     Mr. De Witt Clinton Stratton has been mentioned once or twice already in the
                     preceding pages. That he had to come prominently into view has been well known
                     to the author from the beginning; and he has been kept in the background about
                     as long as he would stay. The truth is that the author has been profoundly
                     conscious of the unmanageableness of this new character, and desired to get the
                     foundations of the story fairly laid before he allowed this restive gentleman
                     to disport himself among the orderly people already introduced.
                  Mr. Stratton was an American, born in New York and reared in Virginia. He thus
                     "hailed" from two Empire States, and was a queer mixture of New Yorker and
                     Southerner. He had spent several years in Germany, the last three at the same
                     University with Merton and Wailes, and, as has already been related, was rather
                     seriously wounded in a small-sword duel with the former. When the English lads
                     left the University, Stratton was still abed with his wound. Radcliffe did not
                     concern himself about his late antagonist, but Wailes paid him a final visit at
                     his lodgings on the eve of their departure, and offered his services to the
                     pale-faced invalid with hearty good-will.
                  "Are you going to-morrow, Wailes?" asked Stratton.
                  "Yes."
                  "Is Merton going with you?"
                  "Yes; that is, as far as Paris. I am going to England."
                  "Well," drawled the American, "I'm glad you will be parted. That fellow
                     Merton—"
                  "Is my friend, Stratton."
                  "Yes. I know you hang to him. I don't want to separated you, and I'll say
                     nothing against him; only—"
                  "Only what?" said Wailes, as he paused.
                  "Only that he would steal a sick nigger's soup if the chance offered. There,
                     there! I'll say no more. You will find him out in due time."
                  "You are soured now, Stratton, because he gave you that ugly poke in the side.
                     But this foolish duel was forced upon you both by these Dutchmen. You will
                     forget all about it when you get well, which I hope will be soon."
                  "Did the Dutchmen select those miserable frog-skewers instead of broadswords?
                     Ah, no! Mr. Merton knew that I had no acquaintance with the weapon."
                  "I assure you, Stratton," said Trump, eagerly, "that Merton and I agreed six
                     months ago that we would stick to the foils if we had any more fights. You know
                     I took the small-sword in my last encounter."
                  "Yes. And you encountered that Austrian fellow, who was considered the best
                     small-sword in the University; and you ended the fight by bleeding him in the
                     arm instead of boring a hole in his lungs. Well, well! let it pass; I will wait
                     awhile."
                  There was a grim expression on his pale face that was ominous. Trumpley left
                     Germany on the following morning.
                  While Wailes was waiting for the return of the foreign letters, with
                     instructions as to the answers, Chunk ushered a stranger into his room.
                  "Furrin gent, sir," said Chunk, and vanished.
                  A tall man walked up to the desk. His face was covered with beard, and he was
                     fragrant with fumes of tobacco. He quietly took the seat Wailes offered, looked
                     steadily at him a few minutes, and then put out his hand.
                  "I did not expect to light on you here, Wailes," said the "furringent," in very
                     good English.
                  "Stratton!" answered Wailes, grasping his offered hand. "I should never have known you but for your voice;
                     you are as unlike yourself as possible. Where in the world did you get all that
                     beard?"
                  "It just grew, Wailes. But I have lost my identity otherwise since we parted.
                     My name is Clinton. Will you oblige me by forgetting the Stratton?"
                  "What do you mean?" said Trump.
                  "Oh, it's all legal. There was a man in my country called De Witt Clinton. My
                     uncle, my mother's brother, was named Clinton, and he was an admirer of the
                     other, who has been dead a century of two, I believe. Anyhow, my uncle claimed
                     kindred, and I got my name—I mean my pronomina—by his influence. He died a year ago and left me some
                     money, requiring me to drop my patronymic. I am now duly authorised by the
                     Legislature of Virginia to call myself De Witt Clinton."
                  He produced some papers as he spoke, which he laid upon the desk.
                  "Look over these papers at your leisure, Wailes," he continued; "they will
                     verify my statements. I have a special reason for adhering to my new name. It
                     cost me, one way and another, a thousand dollars to get it."
                  "Mr. Clinton, I am happy to make your acquaintance," answered Wailes; "I don't
                     require the papers. Your word is sufficient."
                  "Nay. Read the papers, please. I may need you as a reference. My present
                     business is to open a credit with Browler Brothers, and the fellows in the
                     front office told me to present my credentials to you. Here they are. Mr. D. W.
                     Clinton, you see. From Kiantokos and Company, Corfu. I will come again
                     to-morrow. Meantime, examine my credentials. When do you quit your desk?"
                  "At four o'clock, I believe. This is my first day."
                  "Well, I have rooms in Queen street. Number five. Will you look in after
                     four?"
                  "Yes. For a few minutes. How the deuce did you ever get to Corfu?"
                  "My uncle was a merchant, and left some valuable interest unsettled in the
                     East. He had a correspondent in Corfu, and I was obliged to go there for
                     settlement. It is all finished now."
                  "Fifty thousand drachmas—and some odd," answered Wailes.
                  "How did you know that?" said Clinton, surprised.
                  "Oh, we have a way of finding things out, here," answered Wailes, laughing.
                     "Leave your signature in the outer office, and draw for any money you need, up
                     to two thousand pounds."
                  "You are a prince of bankers, Wailes. Would you mind burying the Stratton so
                     completely as to avoid the mention of the name, and—except when we are
                     alone—forgetting that Mr. Clinton ever had any other name?"
                  "If you wish it, Witt;—you remember we used to call you 'Witt,' in
                     Germany?"
                  "Ah! I must ask you to forget that too."
                  "Very well. I understand that you desire the entire past buried—"
                  "Except between ourselves. In private, I would like to recall many things; but
                     to all the rest of the world—"
                  "Skuse me, sir!" said Chunk, putting his head in at the door—"but Guv'ner says
                     will you please step in 'is hoffis."
                  "Mr. Grippe?"
                  "Yes, sir."
                  "Good-bye, then, Clinton. I will do as you desire," said Trumpley; "I will not
                     speak of Mr. Stratton to anybody."
                  "Where is Merton?" said the American, carelessly, as he passed out.
                  "At Merton Park, just arrived. Have you seen him?"
                  "No. I shall meet him, perhaps. I am curious to see if he remembers me. You
                     will not let him know—"
                  "Of course not. But your American accent—"
                  "Nous verrons!" said the American, with a
                     sudden change of voice. "I speak English wiz an accent, and nevare git my natif
                     tong back, except ven we meet—alone. Au
                        revoir!"
                  Mr. Grippe only wanted to give some verbal instructions touching the replies to
                     the foreign letters. With copies of former letters upon the same general
                     subjects before him, Wailes had no difficulty in writing the replies, which
                     were in English. Messrs. Kiantokos and Co. had merely written to announce Mr.
                     Clinton's credit, and to enclose his signature. The other letters were routine
                     documents, and soon disposed of, though Mr. Wailes had some little trouble in
                     restraining his appetite for rhetorical adornments, which did not accord with
                     the dry details of financial correspondence. This was a fault in his literary
                     work, and the discipline was good for him.
                  At four o'clock Wailes locked his desk and sallied out. He called at No. 5
                     Queen street, and found Mr. Clinton established on the first floor. He had
                     three rooms, besides a dressing-closet and bath-room. The back-room was not
                     much encumbered with furniture. A library table was in the centre. The walls
                     were adorned with three or four good pictures, and several varieties of arms,
                     scimitars, dirks, broadswords, and two or three pairs of foils and masks.
                  
                  "You have a regular armory, Clinton," said Trump, as he glanced at the warlike
                     array.
                  "Yes. I have gathered them up at odd times and places. Let us try a pass with
                     the foils."
                  "I hardly have time," replied Wailes. "I must walk to Merton to dinner, and my
                     mother will expect me to dress for that meal."
                  "Only a passage or two," said Clinton, taking down the foils as he spoke; "we
                     will not bother with the masks. I am anxious to see if I am as clumsy as I used
                     to be. En garde!"
                  There was the usual rasping of steel against steel at the preliminary parades,
                     then a sharper click as the two men got interested. Wailes was out of the
                     practice, but he was an expert swordsman, and warming with the work, there was
                     a very brilliant exhibition of sword-play, if there had been any on lookers to
                     appreciate it. Trumpley was surprised to find that his sure thrusts failed.
                     After a sharp interchange, they separated and lowered their points. Neither had
                     been touched.
                  "I did not know I was so rusty," observed Wailes; "I have not had a foil in my
                     hand for six or eight months. And you have improved vastly."
                  "I have had some practice in Naples. I found an old sworder there who taught me
                     a few new tricks. To-morrow we will put on the masks. I did not do myself
                     justice in this encounter, as I was afraid of hurting your face."
                  "Had you no fears for your own?" said Wailes.
                  "Oh, no! I think I am invulnerable." This was said with an air of sublime
                     confidence that thoroughly nettled Wailes. He looked at his watch, and then
                     took off his coat.
                  "I can spare fifteen minutes more," he said quietly; "let us try the
                     masks."
                  Clinton promptly imitated his example, and taking down the masks, tucked his
                     flowing beard in the wire-screen. He pushed the table to one side of the
                     apartment, giving a space of fifteen feet square in the middle of the room. The
                     sun streamed in at the western windows as they confronted each other once more.
                     After the salute, their blades crossed, and they stood a moment motionless,
                     each gazing intently into the kindling eyes of the other.
                  "Fendez-vous!" said Wailes, at last.
                  "A l' outrance!" replied Clinton, laughing,
                     as their foils rasped together.
                  The two athletes marched and retreated, crossing the room again and again,
                     their weapons glancing around them like flashes of light. As the combat
                     progressed, their muscles seemed to be transformed into steel. The fifteen
                     minutes grew into thirty, and then they parted, panting.
                  "I have met my match," said Wailes, as he drew on his coat; "I believe the
                     victory is still undecided. Did you touch me?"
                  "No."
                  "Did I touch you?"
                  "Certainly not," answered Clinton, composedly.
                  "You tempt me to try again, with that air of abominable conceit. But I will
                     wait until to-morrow. Good afternoon."
                  "My dear Wailes, you will have to wait until 'to morrow come never,' as we say
                     in America. Good-bye!"
               
            
            
            
               
               BOOK II.
               THE GAME AT BEECHWOOD.
               
                  CHAPTER XIV.
                  HAUNTED.
                  "Mother," said Trumpley, as they sat on the open porch at Rose Cottage,
                     watching the rising moon, "now that my income is doubled, I begin to feel
                     stingy."
                  "Have you decided upon any plans of retrenchment, Trump?" replied Mrs.
                     Wailes.
                  "No, ma'am, of course not. I only venture to offer suggestions. First: Rent!
                     Now I know of a pretty house, within half-a-mile of Gloucester, that would be
                     cheaper than Rose Cottage."
                  "Where is it, Trump?"
                  "On this side of Gloucester," said Trump, who was safely blushing in the
                     shadow. But his mother detected the blush in his voice.
                  "Is it near Halidon?" she asked, quietly.
                  "Yes. In sight of the lodge-gates. Oh, Mother, maybe I might get a sight of her
                     some time!"
                  "That would make the rent cheaper, Trump, no doubt," said his mother.
                  "But it is cheaper, Mother. There is a bill on the window. It is
                     ten pounds a year less than you pay here. Besides, there would be economy in
                     shoe-leather, and I could run over to luncheon every day. That would save ten
                     or twelve pounds more."
                  "It would be still better to dispense with luncheon altogether. And you might
                     take off your boots and carry them on the road. Some economical people I have
                     read of, do it. What will you do with all the money you accumulate?"
                  "Buy Halidon!" answered Trump, decidedly.
                  "I remember the sale of Halidon," said Mrs. Wailes. "It was twenty-five years
                     ago—no, twenty-two. Mr. Grippe paid twenty thousand pounds for it, which Mr.
                     Merton said was frightfully low. Now if you dispense with luncheon, carry your
                     boots, and practise other methods of economy, so as to save three-fourths of
                     your income, you can perhaps buy Halidon in sixty years."
                  "That would make me eighty-odd!" said Trumpley, discontentedly; "can you think
                     of no process more rapid than that, Mother?"
                  "Oh, yes; you might marry Mr. Grippe's daughter."
                  "Jewhilliken!" said Trump, starting up. "Excuse me, ma'am, please—that is Mr.
                     Clinton's expletive. By-the-bye, I encountered an American gentleman to-day at
                     the bank, a Mr. Clinton. I intended to ask your permission to bring him
                     here."
                  "Certainly, my son. Any friend of yours will always be welcomed at your
                     mother's house."
                  "He speaks French and German, Mother. I should be very glad if you would
                     investigate him a little. He is a queer compound, and he bothers me."
                  "Bring him to-morrow, then, Trump. I can give him a very passable dinner
                     to-morrow. I am promised a turbot. It is a present from the Squire."
                  "I wish the Squire would quite giving us turbots and things," said Trump,
                     discontentedly.
                  "Why, Trump?"
                  "Because we do nothing in requital. Why don't he send his extra turbots to
                     Podd, or old Galt?"
                  "I fancy they could offer very little in requital, either. And it is doubtful
                     whether they would appreciate turbots."
                  "Well, Mother," answered Trump, "it would be more charitable anyhow. We can buy
                     our own turbots, if we want them—"
                  "There goes your new economy, Trump."
                  "Only we don't want them, and would not be likely to waste money in that way.
                     Why can't he send turbots to Mr. Grippe?"
                  "Yes! He is an object of charity, no doubt," answered Mrs. Wailes. "Come in,
                     Trump; I have been reading the 'Meditations' this afternoon, and marked a place
                     for you."
                  The bulky manuscript was produced, the marked passage found, and Trumpley was
                     requested to read it.
                  
                  "English gentlemen and gentlewomen have an instinctive horror of incurring
                     obligations," it ran; "and being instinctive, there must be a law accounting
                     for the feeling, that should be discoverable. I imagine one part of this law of
                     race corresponds with the intense individuality belonging to Anglo-Saxondom.
                     Your Saxon is distinguished from men of other nationalities by his sturdy
                     independence, which he never wholly loses, even in positions of subordination.
                     Ethnology is too young a science to speak positively, but it seems to reveal
                     this much. Another element of this underlying law is the natural connexion
                     between wage and labor. The announcement that the laborer is worthy of his
                     hire, is not so much the announcement of a doctrine or principle of morals, as
                     of a fact. A third element relates to the grand truth that there is one Giver,
                     whose bounties do not humiliate the receiver; and probably this royalty is an
                     incommunicable attribute. In giving to the children of poverty, the human giver
                     is only a steward, disposing property that belongs to Another. And one steward
                     has no right to give to or receive from another steward. Hence, I conclude that
                     more rational enjoyment can be purchased with a shilling earned or inherited,
                     than with a guinea given. If your friend offers a present of value, do not
                     affront him by rejection, but take an opportunity to reciprocate, and so get
                     from under the obligation. Both your friend and yourself will be the better for
                     it."
                  "I have always had that sort of shrinking from gifts," observed Mrs. Wailes
                     when Trumpley closed the book; "and to-day, when Mr. Merton promised the
                     turbot, I sent that antique brooch with the Trumpley arms engraved upon it to a
                     Sybil, with my love. She admired it greatly, and its intrinsic value will pay
                     for many turbots. Then I looked for the passage you have just read."
                  "You are a regular trump, Mother!" quoth Trumpley.
                  "By-the-bye," replied his mother, "I told the Squire this morning that you had
                     decided to 'go into trade.' and he said you were "An Odd Trump."
                  "Did he?"
                  "Yes; and he says the name will stick to you. He intends to spread the news
                     throughout the neighborhood, and you may as well accept the title."
                  "It might be worse, Mother," said Trump. "I think I shall survive the
                     infliction. Will you go look at the cottage?"
                  "What will become of my flowers, Trump?"
                  "Flowers! Why, flowers are the special attractions at t'other place; there is
                     the greatest profusion of flowers. And there is a conservatory—"
                  "A conservatory!"
                  "Yes, ma'am. Indeed, the superiority of the place and the insignificant rental
                     make me think there must be something wrong about it."
                  "Where is it, Trump?" said Mrs. Wailes, with sudden interest. "where,
                     exactly?"
                  "It is just at the bend of the road above the lodge-gates at Halidon. There
                     must be six or eight acres in the grounds, and they are highly adorned. The
                     house has two gables."
                  "Ah!" said Mrs. Wailes. "It is Bcechwood."
                  "Yes, that is the name. What is there about it, Mother? I see by your eyes that
                     you know."
                  "That I know what, Trump?"
                  "Whatever there is about the place. Why should it be so cheap? Is it dump?"
                  "No."
                  "Have people had any diseases there that are worse than common ailments?"
                  "No."
                  "Did you ever know any one who lived there?"
                  "Yes."
                  "Can you tell me anything about them, Mother?" said Trumpley: "that is, is it
                     proper for me to ask?"
                  "It is not a pleasant subject, Trump," said Mrs. Wailes, thoughtfully; "but I
                     think it is time you should know the story. Did you like the appearance of the
                     place?"
                  "I was charmed, Mother. I came that way," and he blushed while his outspoken
                     honesty revealed the whole truth, "because I thought Mardi Gras was at Halidon,
                     and that fortune might favor me—"
                  "There is no such thing as fortune, Trump."
                  "I beg pardon, ma'am, I mean Providence. I thought I might get a glimpse of the
                        eyes—my eyes!—"
                  "That is a vulgar expression, Trump. 'My eyes' and 'my stars' and like
                     exclamations are indecorous."
                  "Yes, ma'am; but I saw no eyes. There was a bill on the gate at Beechwood,
                     discolored by the weather; it must have been there a long time. I met a plowboy
                     near the gate, and he said it had not been occupied since he 'coomd' to this
                     locality."
                  "Did he assign no reason?"
                  "No. What reason could he assign, Mother?"
                  "Only that the ignorant people in the vicinity say—"
                  "Say what, Mother?" said Trump, as she paused.
                  "That Beechwood is haunted!"
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XV.
                  RETROSPECTIVE.
                  The reader will understand that Mr. Harold Trumpley Wailes did not go quietly
                     to bed like a good little boy after the rather startling words that close the
                     preceding chapter. His mother could not resist the torrent of questions that
                     poured forth at her announcement of the uncanny reputation of Beechwood; and as
                     the explanation she gives really forms a part of the story, there is nothing to
                     be done but give the substance of her account in this place.
                  Twenty-five years before the occurrence of the events thus far recorded,
                     Beechwood was occupied by Captain Lennox and his two daughters, Dora and Daisy.
                     The elder was a gay young lady of twenty-odd, robust, matter-of-fact, and
                     pretty. The other, Daisy, was also twenty-odd, but the odds were in her favor.
                     She was shy and romantic, sensitive and sickly. She liked books and solitude,
                     and freely relinquished to Dora all the attentions of their masculine visitors.
                     The reader need not dread the introduction of the other two more
                     lady-characters upon the scene. They had both disappeared a score of years
                     before the story began, and the present chapter will include the most of their
                     history, at least so much of it was ante-mortem.
                  
                  Captain Lennox had been stationed in Canada a dozen years, had married there,
                     and buried his wife there. He retired upon half-pay soon after his return to
                     England, and had lived at Beechwood until brandy and tobacco lost their
                     sustaining power, and his system, not accustomed to other aliments,
                     succumbed.
                  Dora had numerous admirers, but there were two who seemed to run neck-and-neck,
                     and they distanced the others. First, there was Captain Merton of the Royal
                     Navy, a dashing young sailor, who spent his "shore leaves" at Merton Park, and
                     who courted Miss Lennox vigorously at odd times, but laboring under some
                     disadvantage, as the other, Mr. Harold Trumpley, lived only half-a-mile off,
                     and was the owner of a fine estate, somewhat encumbered. This suitor was,
                     however, rude and ill-tempered, frightfully jealous and exacting, while the
                     sailor was polite and affable. And two or three years wore on while the queer
                     courtship progressed, the Captain making fitful assults, but flying off to his
                     ship before he could "bring on an engagement;" and Mr. Trumpley, who was not a
                     favorite in the country, pursuing Miss Lennox with grim determination, except
                     at intervals, when he would be off to St. Petersburg or Palermo, or some other
                     out-of-the-way locality across the Channel.
                  He left a representative, however, who did him good service in his absence.
                     This was Miss. Trumpley, his sister, who was idolised by both the ladies at
                     Beechwood. For her brother's sake she cultivated the elder assiduously; but for
                     Daisy she entertained a warm affection. In the absence of Mr. Trumpley the two
                     sisters spent many days at Halidon, where they had very few visitors, and Daisy
                     revelled amid the wealth of the well-stocked library day after day, while her
                     more frivolous sister sought less irksome employments. Captain Merton came one
                     day, and finding the coast clear, made formal proposals to Miss Lennox, and
                     received his cong. Miss Trumpley learned the
                     fact from the discomfited Captain, and wrote at once to her brother, than at
                     Madrid. He came to Halidon within a week, arriving in the time to attend the
                     funeral of Captain Lennox, who died quite suddenly one night, when Mr. Trumpley
                     was tossing on the Channel.
                  The half-pay ceased, and Beechwood got into Chancery. The orphan girls were
                     supposed to be joint inheritors of the property, but other claimants appearing,
                     litigation was inevitable. The Misses Lennox had no money to squander in law
                     expenses, and a month after the death of their father they accepted the
                     invitation of an uncle in London, an eccentric old bachelor, who was the rector
                     of a suburban parish, and who asked his nieces to come and keep house for
                     him.
                  Within a years or so two or three things happened. First, Daisy was married to
                     a young clergyman, a proteg of her uncle's, and went with her husband to a
                     humble quarter of the great city, where he had a charge. Next, her uncle died,
                     and Dora disappeared. No one could give Miss Trumpley any satisfactory
                     information about either of her friends, though she spent several weary days in
                     the search of traces. Looking for Daisy as "the wife of a clergyman" whose name
                     she did not know, was an unpromising task, and all her efforts were vain. Next,
                     she received a letter from Paris, from Mr. Wailes, to whom she was then
                     affianced, in which he told her he had met Dora, who was married. And finally,
                     rumors, mingled with scraps of authentic information, reached Miss Trumpley,
                     announcing the death of Daisy, who had left an infant half-orphaned, and the
                     death of Dora at a little village on the south coast of France. And while she
                     was still stunned under these dismal tidings, the body of Harold Trumpley was
                     brought across the water and interred in Merton churchyard.
                  
                  It was fully ten years later when Mrs. Wailes heard of Beechwood again and the
                     rival claimants. The litigation had revealed an important fact, to wit: that
                     the title of Captain Lennox was absolute, and his daughters were co-heiresses
                     of this property. But they had disappeared, and all that was positively known
                     was that one of them had left an infant. By an arrangement between the other
                     claimants, under authority of the court, the property was given in charge of a
                     trustee, with instructions to rent it, the revenue to be held until title could
                     be established to the satisfaction of the court, which by a grim sort of joke
                     was the "guardian to these unknown wards in chancery." If the non-existence of
                     these wards could be proven, the question of ownership would be narrowed down
                     to two claimants, unless a third should arise in the person of the father of
                     Daisy Lennox's child. It was a beautiful case in its complications, and would
                     furnish material for a first-class romance in competent hands. In this true
                     history, however, it is merely an episode.
                  The tenants would not remain long at Beechwood. They told queer stories about
                     noises and visions. The house was very comfortable, the rent moderate, but
                     those tenants that paid rent objected to the joint occupation of others who did
                     not.
                  The stories were various. The sight-seers saw different sorts of visions, and
                     none of them were definite or satisfactory. A female figure clad in the long
                     dark garments, with silver hair, more noticeable by reason of the contrast with
                     her sombre habiliments, was seen once and again by several persons.
                     Strong-minded men pronounced these visions delusions, and two or three of them
                     in turns moved into the cottage. But they always moved out again, without
                     solving the mystery, and generally with a theory of rat exploits that was
                     complimentary to the powers of the rodents, who were supposed to walk the
                     floors with human footfalls, open and shut doors, and sometimes to sigh
                     dismally, and even to make some rude attempt at vocalisation. Because one of
                     the sounds most commonly heard was a sort of laugh in cadence, like the refrain
                     of a song, the strongminded men credited this part of the performances to
                     Boreas the blustering railer; but they all preferred his symphonies by
                     daylight, and in the open fields.
                  There was one wing of the house in which was stored the furniture that had
                     belonged to Captain Lennox. As there was no claimant who professed ownership of
                     this property, it had been packed away in these chambers. It was very restive
                     furniture, moving about at unreasonable hours, creaking viciously. The doors
                     communicating with these apartments were all locked and barred on the outside;
                     but some tenants had heard these doors close with a suppressed bang during the
                     night, though the cobwebs that hung over the door-frames showed no signs of
                     disturbance in the morning. Then the strong-minded gentlemen would turn the
                     creak into rat-squeaks and the banging into freaks of the Boreas with the
                     shutters; but none of them had time to spare to investigate the phenomena when
                     they were in progress.
                  "It is my opinion, Trump," said Mrs. Wailes, in conclusion, "that a little
                     common-sense and pluck would unravel a great part of the mystery. I have not
                     heard much of Beechwood since we came from Germany, and the stories I have told
                     you are rather old. I think the house has been vacant all the time. I thought
                     once, when you were writing your story, that I would tell you of Beechwood, and
                     let you weave it into your imaginary creations; but I found the subject
                     unpleasant, recalling memories that are more painful than profitable. I cannot
                     say that I would like to live at Beechwood. I must think about it."
                  "And I will see about it," replied Trumpley. "If there are uncanny things
                     there, I should like to hunt them up."
                  "Don't be foolish, Trump," responded Mrs. Wailes, with a little shiver. "Of
                     course there are no uncanny things; but it would be very disagreeable to hear
                     rats laughing and singing all night!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER XVI.
                  BALKED.
                  "It is my opinion," quoted Mr. Trumpley Wailes, as he approached Gloucester the
                     following morning, "that Mother intended her valiant remark about common-sense
                     and pluck to apply to some disinterested individual not of her blood. She did
                     not mention Beechwood this morning at breakfast. I must not forget to invite
                     Mr. Clinton to dinner to-day."
                  Mr. Clinton presented himself at the Bank during the morning and promptly
                     accepted the invitation to Rose Cottage. It was arranged that he should call
                     for Trumpley at four o'clock. The latter suggested a cab, which Mr. Clinton
                     scouted. He could walk twenty miles without out fatigue, and would have moonlight for his
                     return walk. Trump very cordially invited him to spend the night with him, but
                     the other had a "special engagement" which would compel his return.
                  At four o'clock the American appeared punctually. Mr. Wailes noticed that he
                     wore his ordinary attire, and wondered if he would call at Queen Street for a
                     black coat. But Clinton turned down the street, saying that he desired to go by
                     Halidon. Trump was a little surprised, but assented. In fact he was thinking of
                     making the same proposition, as he desired to take another look at Beechwood.
                     He also did not object to a cursory inspection of the lodge-gates at
                     Halidon.
                  There were certain changes noticeable at Beechwood. The weatherstained bill
                     that was on the gate-post yesterday was gone. The gates were open, and Trumpley
                     silently followed his companion as he coolly entered the grounds.
                  "I am trying an experiment, Wailes," he said. "I happened to hear that this
                     charming spot was haunted, and having a penchant for that sort of thing, I have rented Beechwood. My
                     traps are already here, and if you will come in five minutes, I will make the
                     needful changes in my habiliments."
                  Trumpley was slightly stunned; the whole thing was so unexpected and sudden.
                     But he thought he noticed a conscious intonation in Clinton's voice, and he
                     watched him with increasing interest and vigilance.
                  "It certainly looks uncanny enough," observed Clinton, as their feet crunched
                     over the gravel. "The hedges have not been trimmed for some years, I fancy. But
                     we will mend all that. The painters are coming to-morrow. Nobody here now
                     excepting Mrs. Hamet."
                  "Mrs. Hamet?"
                  "Yes. She lives here—occupies the south wing yonder. The agent stipulated that
                     she should remain, and I had no objection. There she is on the step."
                  A tall, gaunt old woman in a black poke-bonnet; weak-eyed, as she wore green
                     goggles; deaf as a post. The hobgoblins of Beechwood could not frighten her, as
                     she could not hear their racket. She had a bunch of keys in her hand.
                  "Are you Mr. Clinton?" she said in an attenuated treble, addressing the
                     American as the gentlemen approached.
                  "Yes, ma'am."
                  "A little louder, please," said Mrs. Hamet. "Here are the keys. Your boxes are
                     in the Blue Room, where they have put up a bed. Shall you sleep here
                     to-night?"
                  "Yes, ma'am."
                  "And this gentleman?" she continued, turning the goggles upon Trumpley.
                  "He will not be here to-night; but I hope to have him many nights when my
                     housekeeping arrangements are perfected. Give me a week, Wailes," he added in a
                     lower tone, "and I promise to work great changes, and probably do some
                     exorcising. And now amuse yourself a few minutes while I get a respectable
                     coat."
                  Trumpley recalled his mother's story as he examined the exterior of the house.
                     It was substantially built of gray stone with pointed gables. On one side there
                     was a fine growth of ivy extending all over the south wing. There was an
                     entrance porch here. The door was open, and Trump saw tokens of habitation
                     about this portion of the building, while all the rest looked gloomy and
                     forbidding, with closed shutters and grass-grown walks. The conservatory ran
                     along one side, connecting the south wing with the main building, and the
                     flowers that were visible through the open sashes were the most cheerful sight
                     at Beechwood. Several stately trees, probably a dozen or more, all beeches,
                     gave an air of solidity to the surroundings, while they concealed the house
                     from the road. As Wailes retraced his steps, approaching the main entrance, he
                     found the goggles regarding him intently.
                  It was a time when hoops were in high fashion, and Mrs. Hamet wore none. The
                     effect of the green goggles was heightened by the lank figure draped in some
                     dark stuff, looking like a bundle of old skirts suspended on a bean-pole
                     surmounted by an outlandish bonnet. Trump walked directly up to her, feeling a
                     sudden compassion for her, perhaps because of her outr and isolated appearance.
                  "You must be lonely here, dame," he said, sympathy in his eyes and accents.
                     "Have you been here long?"
                  "Twenty years."
                  "That is almost the length of my life," answered Trump. "Have you never grown
                     tired?"
                  "Tired? No. What is he? Not English?"
                  "Of whom do you speak, dame? Mr. Clinton?"
                  "Ay; of him who has taken the house. Is he English?"
                  "No, He is an American."
                  "He called you Wailes. Is that your name?"
                  "Yes; Trumpley Wailes, at your service, dame."
                  "Is he a friend of yours? I mean the Yankee."
                  "Yes; but he says he is not a Yankee. Here he is," and Mr. Clinton emerged in evening-dress. Mrs. Hamet
                     took the keys from his hand as he passed out.
                  "I have taken two keys off, Mrs. Hamet; one of my sleeping-room, the other of
                     this door. Shall I lock it now? It will be late when I return."
                  "As you please; but I shall be awake. The gates will be closed."
                  "I can easily leap the gates," replied Clinton coolly. "I beg you will not sit
                     up. To-morrow I shall have a servant or two."
                  "There are not many in this neighborhood that would leap these gates after
                     dark," muttered the old woman.
                  "No; probably not. That is one reason why I propose to do it. Good night, ma'am
                        Allons, Wailes."
                  Passing down the road, the young men paused at the lodge-gates of Halidon.
                     There was a wall on the roadside, and nothing was visible but the upper
                     branches of the trees within. Trumpley's heart beat more rapidly, while Clinton
                     looked curiously at the antique architecture of the lodge.
                  "What a beautiful old place this must be!" said he at last, as they moved on.
                     "When I exorcise Beechwood, maybe I'll rent this. Who lives here, Wailes?"
                  "Mr. Grippe."
                  "Indeed. Then this is Halidon? The advertisement of Beechwood mentions it as
                     one of the attractions. Will you please consider yourself engaged to spend next
                     week with me? I want you for special reasons."
                  "It will give me pleasure if my mother does not object. But I should tell you
                     that I intended to take Beechwood, and am balked in a complicated scheme by
                     your American rashness. What possessed you to make you take Beechwood?"
                  "My dear Wailes, a secret. I came to Gloucester expressly to take Beechwood. If
                     you had engaged it, I should have pleaded very earnestly with you for it. But
                     you could not engage it, as I made the arrangement in London a week ago. I
                     would buy the property, but it cannot be sold."
                  They walked on in silence a mile or more, Wailes wondering what attractions
                     Gloucester and its environs had for his companion. Was it possible that he knew
                     Mardi Gras? While he was still cogitating this problem, Clinton stopped
                     suddenly and faced him.
                  "What doth hinder, Wailes?" he said impetuously. "Why cannot we be friends? Oh,
                     if I could tell you how I long for a friend! If money could buy one, I would
                     cheerfully give a hundred thousand dollars for him!"
                  "My dear Clinton," said Trumpley, touched by the plaintive appeal, "you have my
                     poor friendship without money."
                  "What must I do?" continued the other, "to win your confidence? What sort of
                     man do you admire? What sort of weapons must he wield who shall break down the
                     barriers of British reserve and distrust? I have lived twenty-five years in the
                     world unloving and unloved; and now that I have a great lot of money I seem
                     more isolated than ever. What shall I do? Where can I find solace?"
                  "Come on, Clinton," said Wailes, slipping his hand through his arm. "We can
                     talk as we walk. I am not troubled with British reserve and
                     distrust. Come! I like you. Are you not going with me to my mother's house?
                     Friendship is a plant of slow growth, but it grows. Wherein am I
                     unfriendly?"
                  "Why the devil don't you ask me something about the house—Beechwood!" said
                     Clinton, fiercely.
                  "Ah! that would be indecorous. How can I know what you would like to tell?"
                  "I should like to tell you everything. To begin—"
                  "But don't begin, please," said Trump. "Listen. In the first place I am
                     devoured by curiosity upon this very topic."
                  "Really?"
                  "Really! But there may be some things you should not tell. So I prefer waiting
                     a little, until you get quite cool and collected—"
                  "Like a blue-bottle fly in a glue-pot," put in the American, quaintly.
                  "Precisely, though the simile is novel. May I ask you if you have kindred?"
                  "No. None that I know, at least. Yonder are the chimneys of Merton. I have been
                     there, and the Squire invited me to come again. I saw his daughters. Would you
                     mind telling me if Miss Lucy is engaged?"
                  "I think not," answered Trump, surprised.
                  "And Miss Sybil?"
                  "I don't know," answered Trump, shortly.
                  "You don't know? Well, that means she is not. Do you remember that gambling Von
                     Lafburg at Gttingen? Well, he spoke of you once, when a lot of us were dicing
                     in his room, as the 'Odd Trump,' because you would not lie even by a look."
                  "Did he?" said Trump, starting—"and did you tell any one about it?"
                  "Yes; I told a countryman of mine, in New York."
                  "Did you tell any countryman of mine?"
                  
                  "Never. You are the only Britisher to whom I have spoken of my German
                     life."
                  "Well, that is queer. Squire Merton gave me the same title yesterday. Is it so
                     very odd, to abstain from lying?"
                  "Very!" answered Clinton, dryly.
                  "I do not like to be odd," said Wailes, after a pause; "but I have never told
                     lies, and am too old to learn. And now I am going to speak plain truth to you.
                     May I?"
                  "Now and always!" replied Clinton, "and with Heaven's help I will deal so with
                     you. Plain truth between us, evermore."
                  "Well. You want an object—"
                  "Object! I have several. Two or three of them I am pursuing with the tenacity
                     of a bloodhound."
                  "One step further, friend. Are these objects of yours all worthy? Do you look
                     for Heaven's help in all?"
                  "Ha!" said the other, reddening. "I'll answer you anon. I must think."
                  "That's jolly!" said Trump, slapping him on the back, heartily. "Do you see
                     that beautiful lady at the gate? That is my blessed mother. Welcome to Rose
                     Cottage, my friend!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER XVII.
                  M. G.
                  "Mother!" said Mr. Wailes, as the trio sat among the vines of the woodbine
                     after dinner, "Mr. Clinton has spoiled all my plans. He has taken
                     Beechwood."
                  "Indeed!" replied Mrs. Wailes. "Well, Trump, Mr. Clinton will have a very
                     pretty residence. I am not sorry that your plan is spoiled, however. I did not
                     like the idea of exchanging Rose Cottage for Beechwood."
                  "I can easily understand your reluctance to quit Rose Cottage, madam," said
                     Clinton.
                  "But there was also some—repugnance, shall I say? to Beechwood," answered Mrs.
                     Wailes, with direct honesty.
                  "You surprise me, madam," said Clinton.
                  "It is easily explained," said Mrs. Wailes. "Many years ago I had friends
                     living there, who are now dead. The associations are melancholy, as there were
                     circumstances—"
                  "Pardon me, madam," said Clinton, interrupting her; "do you refer to the
                     daughters of Captain Lennox?"
                  "Yes."
                  "Then I ought to tell you that I have heard of those ladies. Capt. Lennox
                     married in America."
                  "And you have taken Beechwood on that account?" said Mrs. Wailes.
                  "Yes—that is partly. I had other motives. Perhaps you know the house has an
                     evil reputation?"
                  "There are some foolish stories current," replied Mrs. Wailes, "that are
                     believed by credulous people. Something about apparitions and unaccountable
                     noises."
                  "I hunted up two of the later occupants," said Clinton, "before I engaged the
                     house. They tell very coherent stories, too, about sights and sounds, though
                     they both ridicule the idea of anything supernatural. But they both declined my
                     invitation to spend a few nights with me, very politely and very decidedly.
                     They are stalwart men, too."
                  "And how do you feel about it?" asked Trumpley, curiously. "You
                     have said so much that I venture to ask."
                  "I feel no trepidation," answered Clinton, laughing, "I am going to spend
                     to-night there alone. It is not so comfortable as it will be in a few days, but
                     I was not willing to wait."
                  "The house will be damp," said Mrs. Wailes, "as it has been unoccupied so long.
                     Be wise, and accept the hospitalities of Rose Cottage to-night."
                  "I thank you heartily, madam," said the American, rising; "but I have lived,
                     without restraint so long that I have grown obstinate. My mind is set upon this
                     adventure, and I cannot endure the thought of delay. Good-night, madam. May I
                     tell you that I feel very strongly drawn to you?"
                  "I am quite ready to reciprocate the feeling," said Mrs. Wailes, warmly. "Let
                     us know you better. Come see me as often as you will; the more frequently the
                     better."
                  "You are more than kind, madam," replied the American, "and I cannot express my
                     gratitude in words. But if the opportunity ever offers I shall be glad to serve
                     you with a son's devotion. Where are you going, Wailes?"
                  "Only a little way up the road with you," answered Trumpley. "I will return
                     directly, Mother."
                  
                  As they descended the steps Clinton broke off a twig of woodbine, kissed it,
                     and thrust it into his bosom.
                  "A memento, Wailes," he said, apologetically. "I hope to get humanised some
                     day, and I have made a good stride in that direction to-night. When I look at
                     this twig hereafter, I will remember the kind accents of this lovely lady. Well
                     may you call her your blessed mother! Ah! I never knew my mother."
                  "You may have a part of mine, Clinton," said Wailes; "she has evidently 'taken
                     to you,' And now, you old heathen, what is your purpose? Are you going to bed
                     when you get back to Beechwood?"
                  "Bed? No! I slept all this morning, purposely. I am going to stay awake till
                     the sun returns. Then I shall take a beauty sleep."
                  "And if you have unexpected visitors to-night?"
                  "Well; if they come in the flesh it is not likely that they will be numerous."
                     He put his hand in his bosom as he spoke, and drew out a pistol. "If there are
                     not more than six, I will be responsible for every one that is within forty
                     yards of me. If there are more than six—"
                  "Well?"
                  "I have the other in my right breast. And I have a sword in my room that I
                     bought in Madrid. It has the edge of a razor and the point of a needle."
                  "And suppose they are not incarnate?"
                  "Then they will be ghosts, and harmless. I do not recoil from them."
                  "Do you believe in them?" said Trump, struck by the other's manner.
                  "Certainly I do—profoundly. Laugh if you like, I shall not mind it in the
                     least. And now go back. You have left your mother alone. Good-night."
                  "Are you going to carry that pistol in your hand all the way back?" said
                     Trumpley, noticing the barrel flashing in the moonlight.
                  "Oh no. I am going to discharge it when I get in some remote part of the road;
                     I intend to reload."
                  "Discharge it here," said Wailes. "There is a hill between us and the Cottage,
                     and the sound will not be heard."
                  Clinton looked around for a mark. A tree stood on the roadside twenty or thirty
                     paces off, the moonlight silvering the smooth bark.
                  "Now count ten if you can," said he, cocking the weapon and firing the six
                     shots rapidly. "If you want to find those six bullets you can look by daylight
                     in yon tree; they should be all together, about breast-high. If you cannot
                     cover the six with your hand, I have bungled. Good-night!"
                  Trumpley watched him striding up the road until he was hidden by a curve in the
                     highway, he then walked up to the tree and found the six bullet-holes as
                     Clinton predicted. Returning, he met his mother at the stile waiting for
                     him.
                  "The night is too beautiful for sleep, Trump," she said, taking his arm,
                     "besides, it is absurdly early. Let us walk."
                  "With pleasure, Mother. What do you think of my new friend?"
                  "I was just thinking you might lose your title if he stays here; he is an odd
                     trump. Has he given you any hint of what troubles him?"
                  "Troubles him! Why, Mother, he has all that man could ask for—health, sound
                     mind, education, accomplishments, and 'lashins' of money!"
                  "What sort of accomplishments?"
                  "He fences like—like the Count De Bussy, shoots like Leather stocking, and I
                     think he sings."
                  "Quite satisfactory, Trump, only the first two would not be appropriate in a
                     drawing-room. As for singing, it is quite probable that you would hear it
                     better done at the opera. Mr. Clinton impresses me with the idea that he wants
                     a friend."
                  "What a witch you are, Mother!" said Trumpley. "That is precisely what he said
                     to me as we walked down from Gloucester."
                  "I have discovered more than that, Trump. He has done something wrong, or he
                     meditates something wrong—probably the latter. If you win his friendship you
                     may be able to deliver him from present remorse or prospective repentance."
                  "I have had just such a feeling about him, Mother," answered Trumpley, "but it
                     was not so clearly defined in my mind. He has made a very decided bid for my
                     friendship, and I like him already. Perhaps some distrust of him lingers upon
                     me because he is nourishing some evil purpose. Shall I ask him?"
                  "Not to-night," said his mother. "I know where to find a passage that suits
                     this emergency. Come in and read it."
                  They went in, and trimming the lamp, Mrs. Wailes brought the inevitable
                     Meditations to the table. While she was looking for the passage, Trumpley was
                     fumbling in his breast.
                  "Mother," he said, hesitating and stammering, "I have something to tell
                     you."
                  She looked up at him surprised.
                  
                  "You remember the morning that Mardi Gras ran away?
                  "Yes."
                  "Well, ma'am, I found something out there in the garden, near the stile."
                  "What was it, Trump?" said Mrs. Wailes, interested.
                  "A handkerchief," answered her son, producing it. "I hardly know why I did not
                     tell you at once. I thought I would overtake here on the road and restore it. I
                     did not look at it carefully until I was walking back from Gloucester. It is
                     marked in the corner 'M. G.' I have kept it in my bosom ever since, like a
                     goose; and now when you look at it, I'll put it back there, please. It comforts
                     me to have it."
                  Mrs. Wailes took the handkerchief, and holding it near the lamp, glanced at it,
                     examined the initials in the corner, and then quietly laid it on a
                     side-table.
                  "Yes,"—Mrs. Wailes made this little oration with crisp composure—"yes, she told
                     me she had lost it. Never mind, Trumpley, my son. We are exposed to these
                     little disappointments all through life. The handkerchief is rather coarse, and
                     the marking is not artistic. It belongs to the excellent young woman who
                     brought the lamp just now, Milly Galt."
                  Trumpley thought it was bedtime. He kissed his mother's placid face, took his
                     candle and went up-stairs. Mrs. Wailes heard his chamberdoor shut; then she
                     heard the concussion of sundry small articles of furniture, which Trumpley was
                     kicking around the room; then she sat down and laughed fifteen minutes; then
                     she rang for Milly, restored the kerchief, locked the door and retired.
                  And when the household at Rose Cottage was quietly passing through the portals
                     of dreamland, the young American was just beginning his solitary vigil at
                     Beechwood.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XVIII.
                  GHOSTLY.
                  When Mr. Clinton reached Beechwood the moon was riding in mid heaven, flooding
                     the landscape with mellow radiance. The gates were closed and locked, but the
                     American, seizing the mimic spearheads heads in his hands, leaped into the
                     enclosure. All was quiet and peaceful in the shadow of the great trees, and the
                     young man, although full of pluck, was impressed by the solemn stillness and
                     loneliness of his surroundings. He was conscious of a secret satisfaction in
                     the reflection that Mrs. Hamet occupied a portion of the house; and even while
                     he smiled at his folly he knew that his pulses were accelerated when he
                     unlocked the door and entered the mansion. His senses all alert, he heard a
                     long-drawn sigh as he crossed the threshold.
                  "Wind!" said Mr. Clinton.
                  No doubt. He lighted a match, and finding a candle on the table, soon dispelled
                     the gloom of the interior.
                  This room was merely the entrance-hall, containing only an antique oaken table,
                     and two settles of the same material and fashion. His first business was to
                     investigate the acoustic phenomenon he had noticed; or, on second thought, he
                     must first reload the pistol he had discharged on leaving Rose Cottage.
                  He took a small box of cartridges from his pocket and refilled the six
                     chambers, carefully examining each cartridges as it slipped into place. They
                     were all perfect.
                  "I can't shoot at a puff of wind," he muttered.
                  Leaving the candle on the table he returned to the door-sill, and opening and
                     closing the door, listened for a repetition of the sound. In vain. The door
                     creaked slightly on its hinges, and after several efforts he concluded to
                     accept this as the explanation of, or substitute for, the sigh. So he locked
                     the outer door, and taking his candle, ascended the broad stairs.
                  Another hall, corresponding with the one below, except that there were more
                     doors in this. He had been through them all in daylight, and now they were all
                     locked, excepting that which led into his sleeping apartment. A corridor at the
                     end of the second hall ran the length of the house, but the door leading into
                     this passage was also closed. A tall, old-fashioned clock stood at the head of
                     the stairs, and as Clinton passed it uttered a preliminary growl and struck
                     eleven. He heard the rumbling echoes of the strokes drearily repeated down the
                     stairs, through the closed corridor, and in the deserted rooms beyond his own.
                     He opened the door of his chamber and entered.
                  It was a spacious room, with two large windows looking out upon the grounds in
                     front of the house, two or three trunks in one corner, a bedstead in another, a
                     table holding a portable writing-desk, a portmanteau, and a long sword. He
                     placed his candle on the table and took up the weapon, drawing the bright blade
                     out of the steel scabbard bard. He
                     examined hilt and point and edge with great care, and, as if satisfied with the
                     scrutiny, laid the sword on the table within reach of his hand. Opening the
                     portmanteau, he took out a dressing-gown, a pair of moccasins, a bottle of
                     bitter beer, a bag of tobacco, and a pipe with a long tube of American cane.
                     The only article of furniture that merited special attention was a large
                     invalid's chair with reclining back, adjustable at pleasure, softly cushioned,
                     and covered with black haircloth.
                  His arrangements for the night were speedily made. Throwing off his coat and
                     waistcoat, he donned the dressing-gown. He placed the candle behind the largest
                     trunk, after filling and lighting his pipe, and then drawing the great chair to
                     the window, he opened the sashes and threw back the blinds. There was a little
                     iron balcony, semicircular, with a light railing, projecting from each window,
                     which opened to the floor of the chamber. His boots were replaced by the soft
                     moccasins, and when he took his seat at the open window, the table drawn to his
                     side and the smoke from his pipe floating out in the moonlight, he seemed to be
                     a very fair embodiment of otium cum
                        dignitate.
                  
                  While he sat thus in meditation, sipping occasionally at the beer, and
                     refilling his pipe once and again, the hall-clock rewakened the echoes as it
                     thumped out the midnight hour.
                  "I am fairly into this business," he thought, "and I must see the end of it. I
                     should like to have Wailes here to talk to me, only I resolved to go through
                     this investigation alone. There is no mistake about the conviction upon the
                     minds of my predecessors. That soldier, Neville, who was a good fighter in
                     actual warfare, was entirely demoralished. His teeth chattered when he told me
                     of his experiences at Beechwood. Yet all of his mysterious sights and sounds
                     are explicable—what's that!"
                  The leaves on the trees near the house were rustling slightly as they were
                     moved by the gentle wind. Some insect was sailing to and fro near the window,
                     his wings buzzing not unmusically, and the distant murmur of Merton's Brook was
                     audible in the quiet night. Over all these sounds he heard a laugh in a strange
                     sort of cadence, that seemed to be near and yet afar, suggesting to his mind
                     the effort of a ventriloquist. He could not decide whether the sound came from
                     the lodge-gates at Halidon, visible from his window, or were uttered in his
                     chamber. The laughter was plain.
                  "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"
                  Mr. Clinton laid his pipe on the table and walked noiselessly round the
                     apartment. There were two doors, that by which he had entered opening upon the
                     hall. He listened a moment at this, but heard nothing. The other door gave
                     access to a small dressing-room, which he entered and examined. Nothing there
                     but bare and solid walls. He had locked the hall-door when he came in. Thinking
                     he would look through the hall, he returned to this door and laid his hand upon
                     the lock, when over by the windows, he heard the sound again—
                  "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"
                  In a moment he was upon the little balcony, eagerly scanning the grounds on
                     that side of the house. Nothing. Streaks of moonlight on the grass, and the
                     shadows between. The scene was enchantingly beautiful, and in the midst of his
                     perplexity the American could not repress the feeling of admiration of its
                     loveliness. He took up his pipe, still alight, and pushing his chair out upon
                     the balcony, resumed his seat and his fumigations.
                  "Whoever this hilarious individual may be," he thought, "it is tolerably
                     certain that I can endure the laughter all night, if need be. My warlike
                     preparations are all in vain; I cannot shoot at a sound. If it is a trick,
                     which is probable, I should not like to kill the trickster, anyhow."
                  He puffed away at his pipe with perfect composure, hearing the tick of the
                     great clock on the staircase. The sound was the more distinct by reason of the
                     quietness of all beside. He could still hear the leaves rustling, the constant
                     murmur of the stream, and occasionally the buzzing of the insect careering by
                     on expanded wings. Everything around him invited repose, but Mr. Clinton was
                     not sleepy. His mind was very busy, as his visit to Rose Cottage had awakened
                     old memories; and as he recalled the conversations with Mrs. Wailes and her
                     son, he forgot the mysterious laughter and all his present surroundings. Then
                     he heard the premonitory growl of the clock once more, and the single stroke
                     reverberating through the house.
                  "I believe this is the 'witching hour,'" he thought, "and if these ghosts
                     understand their business, they should be making some sort of a demonstration
                     now. Jewhilliken!"
                  This exclamation was brought out by a sight that surprised him considerably.
                     Under the beeches thirty or forty yards from him, something was moving. It was
                     in the shadow, but certainly there. A stout cord lay on one of the trunks,
                     having been wound around it on the journey from Gloucester. He caught up this,
                     buckled the swordbelt belt round his
                     waist, and fastening one end of the rope to the iron railing of the balcony, he
                     slid down to the ground in a moment. Just as he clambered over the rail he
                     glanced toward the trees, and the moving figure flitted momently into the
                     moonlight. A tall figure, with flowing white hair and dark robes. His scabbard
                     struck against the rail with a clash as he began his decent. He wrapped his
                     gown about the weapon, leaving the hilt free, and ran swiftly to the grove, and
                     through it, around it, down to the high wall on the roadside, and back to the
                     house. Nothing!
                  He examined all that side of the mansion, listening intently. No way of ingress
                     there. The windows were all closed and there was no door. A large part of the
                     wall was covered with ivy, growing luxuriantly where there were no windows, and
                     climbing to the gable. This side was in shadow, and he returned to his chamber,
                     ascending by the rope hand over hand.
                  "I don't think I was asleep," he said to himself as he resumed his seat, "and
                     if not, that was a very queer affair. I thought I saw a woman plainly, and my
                     back was turned less than a minute while I went down the rope. The only
                     possible way of escape for her was through the wall of the house! I will
                     examine every inch of the wall to-morrow. The game is over for to-night, I
                     fancy. I will smoke one more pipe and go to bed."
                  His judgment was correct. There were no more disturbances. He secured the
                     shutters, tried the locks of his doors, and for greater security drew up his
                     trunks against them. And then without undressing, he threw himself upon the
                     bed, and before the hall-clock struck again he was sleeping soundly.
                  The events of this first night at Beechwood, thus imperfectly described, were
                     sufficiently startling. The equanimity with which Mr. Clinton encountered the
                     sights and sounds could hardly he explained, unless he had a theory to account
                     for the mysteries, or was thoroughly skeptical concerning all supernatural
                     things. He was certainly perplexed, and conscious that he had been baffled, as
                     he had entered upon the adventure with entire confidence in his ability to
                     unravel all that was mysterious, and to lay the unquiet spirits that haunted
                     the house and grounds. So far he had failed. But there was no thought of
                     retreat in his mind, and he fell asleep even while concocting plans for the
                     next vigil. Besides his walk to Rose Cottage and back, he had been much
                     occupied during the day attending to the removal of his furniture, and the
                     repose he spoke of to Wailes as an "all morning" nap, was really only a
                     prolongation of his usual slumber. He was therefore fatigued enough to sleep
                     far into the morning, and the bright sunlight was streaming in through the
                     Venetian shutters when he awoke.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XIX.
                  GOING TO GLOUCESTER.
                  An hour or two before noon, two young ladies, followed by a servant in livery,
                     walked through the lodge-gates of Halidon. Ah! Mr. Wailes, why were you not
                     passing?
                  They were going to Gloucester. Probably they wanted a yard of ribbon or a skein
                     of silk. Certainly they wanted the exercise, and therefore declined the
                     carriage.
                  They were madly in love, each with the other. Of course, they had been
                     acquainted only two or three days. Each was perfection in the eyes of the
                     other. Each was ready to declare that no circumstances could occur to mar this
                     burning attachment. They had talked so constantly that each thought she knew
                     all the incidents in the life of her friend. But, in fact, both had forgotten
                     some little incidents, such as the reception of a letter on the steps of the
                     Madeleine, or an aquatic adventure in which a travelling bonnet had been
                     hopelessly ruined.
                  As they walked, they talked. The footman overhead every word, but he was too
                     discreet to repeat their conversation, especially as they talked in French and
                     he had not acquired that tongue.
                  "Ma belle!" said the taller girl, "this is
                     delicious! To escape from those dreary walls at last! Can you divine why
                     Monsieur my father gave his consent so reluctantly?"
                  "Yes," responsed the other gaily; "you are so vivacious, and I am so young. If
                     you had some staid old lady governess—"
                  "Ah! but I have had them! Sister Clementine, at the convent. She is ninety, my
                     dear. But she was a court lady seventy years ago, and she has told me more old
                     scandals in an hour than you could tell in a life-time."
                  "But you should have an English governess, Helose," said Mabel. "I am not at
                     all certain that I can do you justice. I have had no experience with pupils so
                     well grown as yourself."
                  
                  "You can teach me this dreadful English. See! I have learned a whole sentence:
                     'I do not know what obstacles may be in my way, but I will surmount them.' That
                     is good, is it not? And I know the meaning of every word."
                  "You must learn other things," said Mabel. "Mr. Grippe desires to have you
                     transformed into an English lady. You must be taught all manner of customs and
                     proprieties—"
                  "Bah! my little one!" replied Helose; "rest tranquil. One does these things
                     without teaching. When we have visitors you shall see that I behave perfectly.
                     What a pretty house is this! Who lives here, my dear?"
                  "I don't know. I will ask. James!" and the footman drew near, touching his
                     hat.
                  "Do you know this place, James?"
                  "Yes, Miss. Beechwood," replied James.
                  "Who lives here?"
                  "Only an old woman, Miss, and—"
                  "And what?"
                  "Ghoses!"
                  "Ghoses! Do you mean spirits?"
                  "Yes, Miss;" and seeing her incredulous look, he continued: "Plenty of people
                     have seen 'em. Nobody can live there but the old woman. And she is deef, and
                     pretty nigh dumb too."
                  "Helose," said Mabel, "here is an adventure! James says this is a haunted
                     place."
                  "Charming!" replied the French lady. "Can one go in and look at the
                     grounds?"
                  As she spoke the gate swung open, and a gentleman stepped out and stood before
                     them, hat in hand. He was a handsome fellow, with keen black eyes, a profusion
                     of beard, with white teeth gleaming through it as he smiled and bowed.
                  "I inadvertently overheard a sentence or two," he said, politely, in French.
                     "Will the ladies walk in and look at a fine old place in ruins?"
                  While Mabel drew back, doubtfully, Helose passed her with prompt decision.
                  "Monsieur is very good," she said. "Come, Mabel, we will look at the beautiful
                     ivy. One minute only."
                  All this was shockingly improper. James looked on with astonishment, wondering
                     if the newcomer was a French ghost appearing by daylight. Mabel put a veil
                     between the black eyes of the stranger and her own visage, while Helose coolly
                     passed through the gate.
                  "I regret that I overslept this morning," said the gentleman, in English;
                     "otherwise I should have been in Gloucester, and you would have seen Beechwood
                     without this awkward introduction. As the best atonement I can make, allow me
                     to say that I am Mr. Clinton. I have taken this place, which I hope to renovate
                     shortly. I stayed here last night, ghost-hunting. There is no one here
                     excepting Mrs. Hamet, and I beg that you will explore the house and grounds,
                     and excuse my departure. There will be painters and carpenters here later in
                     the day, and this is your last opportunity to see the place in its dismal
                     aspects." He bowed again as he finished his speech, put on his hat and was
                     speedily lost to view.
                  Mabel was greatly relieved by his departure. She had a general apprehension
                     that it was unbecoming in young ladies to make early morning, impromptu visits
                     to young gentlemen without some previous acquaintance. She was also conscious
                     that he had done the best possible thing, to extricate them from their dilemma,
                     by taking himself off as he did. In happy unconsciousness Helose was flying
                     along the ivy-covered gable, chattering to herself volubly, while the "deef and
                     dumb" old woman was following her with wondering eyes.
                  "Charming! is it not?" said Helose, glancing at the poke-bonnet. "Ah, madame,
                     one must be happy here. This is more beautiful than Halidon."
                  "Halidon?" repeated Mrs. Hamet, catching the English word.
                  "Yes. Ah, madame speaks not French. Mabel, my little one, come here." This was
                     said in very good English. Mrs. Hamet, horror-stricken, doubtless, at this
                     invasion of her territory, sank into a garden-seat and grazed wildly at the
                     gate, where Mabel stood irresolute. It is probable that the old woman had never
                     looked upon a lovelier picture—framed in by the gate-posts, the grass-grown
                     gravel at her feet, and the waving branches of the beeches above her head. But
                     Mrs. Hamet seemed to have contracted Mr. Grippe's asthmatic ailments as she
                     glared at Mabel.
                  "On the contrary," said Mabel, in French, "come thou, Helose; thou art
                     distressing the old lady. Come. We should not intrude thus. Come!"
                  Helose plucked a spray of ivy, dropped a little curtsey to Mrs. Hamet, and
                     tripped out to her companion. James closed the gate and followed the ladies up
                     the road. The "deef and dumb" old woman wrung her hands as she watched their
                     retreating forms through the iron grating at the roadside.
                  "Again!" she muttered. "There only needs one more; and he will come next. Is
                     there no death in the world?"
                  
                  While she stood at the gate peering through, she heard the rattle of wheels.
                     Then she saw the vehicle, and the face of the driver, adorned with a yellow
                     moustache sprouting out straight from his lip. He was "gotten up" in superb
                     style, and controlled his fiery horses, driven tandem, with consummate skill.
                     There was an air of content about the man that had more or less of conceit in
                     it; a cat-like expression in his eyes—partly due to the shape of his eye-brows,
                     and flaring away to the right and left, and partly to a latent ferocity
                     probably, in his character. Over all there was the smooth veil acquired from
                     constant intercourse with well-bred people. He would pass muster in any good
                     society.
                  Apparently Mrs. Hamet did not admire him. She crouched down behind the gate and
                     watched him as he approached and passed. His groom sat by him, and was talking
                     eagerly as they arrived opposite the gate.
                  "That's her, sir!" he said, pointing ahead.
                  "You mean 'that's she,' Tim. But which?"
                  "The shortest of the two, sir."
                  "How do you know?" asked his master.
                  "By her step, sir. Never seed such a step."
                  "Very well; we shall see in a moment," replied the gentleman, as the dog-cart
                     glided by, carrying them out of earshot.
                  Mrs. Hamet peered through the gate until the vehicle was out of sight, and then
                     slowly returned to the house.
                  "What devil's work is he after?" she said. "No good, certainly; nothing good in
                     that cruel mouth and those treacherous eyes. This is my quarter-day. I will go
                     into town and watch, maybe I shall be able to thwart this young gentleman."
                  An irruption of Goths and Vandals, carrying ladders and paintcans, came filing
                     through the gate; then a cart laden with lime and sand; then half-a-dozen
                     masons and carpenters, carrying the implements of their craft. Mrs. Hamet had
                     received her instructions, and opened the house to these newcomers. All the
                     rooms were given up to them, excepting Mr. Clinton's bedroom, the housekeeper's
                     room, and the south wing, in which was stored the Lennox Property. The sounds
                     of saw and hammer speedily broke the silence that had so long reigned, there,
                     the sunlight was let into chambers that had long been darkened, and the odor of
                     the paint poisoned the pure atmosphere of Beechwood before the sun reached the
                     meridian. The "deef and dumb" old woman watched the workmen until they had fair
                     possession of the house, looking in silent bewilderment through her green
                     goggles at the rapid changes they wrought in her surroundings, and then locking
                     her own apartment, she sallied out from under the shadow of the lordly trees,
                     and took the high-road to Gloucester.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XX.
                  GLOUCESTER CATHEDRAL.
                  When the dog-cart came into sight, the ladies dropped their veils over their
                     handsome faces. Mr. Radcliffe Merton looked eagerly at the blank walls of
                     grenadine, but his cat-eyes were not sharp enough to penetrate them. He was too
                     well-bred to stare at two gentlewomen attended by a servant in livery; so he
                     touched his mare with the whip, and spun on towards the city, now in view.
                  But the brilliant orbs behind the veils could see very distinctly, and each
                     lady started and uttered a slight exclamation as the vehicle passed.
                  "Ah!" said Helose.
                  "Ugh!" said Mabel.
                  "Do you know that gentleman, ma belle?" said
                     the French girl.
                  "No."
                  "Have you never seen him before?"
                  "Yes. The day I came here I met him in the road."
                  "How do you know he is the same?" persisted Helose.
                  "By his bold eyes, his tout ensemble. Ugh!"
                     There was no mistaking the emphasis. Helose looked curiously at her companion,
                     but made no remark.
                  "Ask James if he knows him," said she, after a pause.
                  "Fi donc!" No!" said Mabel, positively.
                  "You English are a queer race!" said Helose; "you have a thousand properties
                     that one must not transgress. Why should one not gratify one's innocent
                     curiosity?"
                  "Do you not see?" replied Mabel. "It would be highly indecorous to ask a
                     servant, such a question. "It would indicate an interest in a strange
                     gentleman, and your servant might repeat your question to his
                     servant."
                  "True!" said Helose. "I did not think of that. Here is the city. Bid James lead
                     the way to the shop."
                  
                  And when Mabel was inspecting a box of ribbons, bewildered by their variety,
                     and resolving some intricate problem relating to the exact fractions of yards
                     she required, Helose passed quietly to the door, where James stood
                     cogitating.
                  "James," she said, slowly and painfully, "the gentleman in the road. Wiz two
                     horse?"
                  "Yes, Miss," said James, touching his hat.
                  "Ah! His name? You know?"
                  "Yes, Miss. Mr. Radcliffe Merton."
                  They walked down to the old Cathedral about noon. There was a service in
                     progress. The choir was hidden, but their sweet voices filled the building,
                     contending with the deep-toned organ for the echoes. Gloucester was not
                     demonstrative in its piety. One old woman in an outlandish bonnet sat in a
                     distant corner. A gentleman half-concealed behind a pillar, against which he
                     was leaning, appeared to be absorbed—listening to the anthem. James—near the
                     door, taking in the sights and sounds, blinking like an aggravated owl. He was
                     a Dissenter. The two ladies, demure and quiet, were meditating. Helose was
                     making injurious comparisons—contrasting the old Cathedral with the new
                     Madeleine. Mabel was thinking of the dingy little chapel in Blackfriars, and
                     thought she was much more devoutly inclined there. Helose recalled the gay
                     appearance of the Parisian temple, the little knots of men on the stone steps,
                     and the Englishman always watching her with cat's eyes. Mabel thought of the
                     patient gentleman at Blackfriars, toiling day after day in the midst of his
                     vagrant flock, and writing her cheerful letters every night, and as her eyes
                     became moist, she pulled down her veil to enjoy a quiet little cry. And the
                     gentleman came from behind the pillar and walked down the aisle. He glanced at
                     the black eyes of the French girl, then at the drooping figure by her side. As
                     Mabel looked up at his approach, aroused by his step, he halted like a trained
                     soldier at the word of command. For while she recognised her rescuer, and
                     shrunk back from his eager scrutiny, he also knew in his heart that the violets
                     were behind the veil.
                  Mademoiselle looked composedly at the motionless youth, whose countenance
                     expressed a variety of emotions. The certainty that this shrinking girl was she
                     of whom he had been dreaming by daylight and in the night-watches, grew upon
                     him, even while he turned his graze away, repelled by her manifest repugnance.
                     A hundred thoughts chased each other through his mind. The instinct of the
                     gentleman forced him to forbear intrusion, when the case was so clearly one of
                     unwarranted intrusion. His mother's warning flashed upon his memory, in which
                     she reminded him that his service rendered, so far from giving him a claim,
                     really interposed a barrier to intercourse without invitation. He recoiled from
                     the thought of claiming gratitude, and yet there was nothing else upon which he
                     could base a plea for recognition. He shrank from the shadow pretext the
                     accident afforded to inquire about her health, while he saw her there,
                     evidently free from all ailments, and evidently shunning him with desperate
                     determination.
                  He was stunned and bewildered, poor fellow! So loyal was he in his devotion to
                     the girl, and so unquestioning in his belief in her goodness, that he felt
                     certain she had weighty reasons for her behavior. He knew that ordinary
                     civility would prompt her to acknowledge the service he had rendered; and as
                     she thus plainly retreated from him, and denied him permission to address her,
                     some terrible obstacle was between them. He had asked himself a hundred times
                     if she had recognised him in the railway station the other day. And now he knew
                     she had.
                  What could be in the way? He looked into the tranquil eyes of Helose for an
                     answer, and then he began to unravel a part of the mystery. He saw James
                     blinking in stolid patience near the main entrance, recognised him as Mr.
                     Grippe's servant whom he had seen once or twice at the bank, remembered the
                     story he had heard of the banker's daughter "from furrin parts," and instantly
                     invested mademoiselle with this relation. Somehow it was an enormous relief to
                     him to reach this conclusion: Mardi Gras was not Miss Grippe.
                  What then? Had he been misled in tracing her to Halidon when he lost her at the
                     station? Was this black-eyed vixen who looked at his perplexed countenance with
                     such calm confidence another M. G.? Should he ask James?
                  Decidedly not. By some magnetic revelation he knew that the veiled goddess
                     forbade the inquiry. But he could go out and wait until the ladies came, and
                     then watch.
                  So he passed down the aisle and drew near the door. The organ, which had been
                     adding to his bewilderment by its sonorous thunders, died away into a soft
                     accompaniment, and a solo voice filled the arches of the venerable temple. It
                     was a boy's voice, in clear soprano singing the anthem "Cast thy burden on the
                     Lord," and as the other voices joined in this final service he paused to hear
                     the beautiful harmony. When it ceased, the ladies arose and came down the
                     aisle, Helose first, Mabel a step behind her. He drew back to give them passage. The French lady had run the
                     gauntlet of bold Parisian eyes too many times to be disturbed by the modest
                     glance of this blushing Englishman, so she marched by him unconscious, while he
                     politely lowered his eyes. Then he stole a wistful look at the other, now
                     actually within reach of his arm, and at the instant she threw aside her veil
                     and shot one appealing look into his soul through fast-flowing tears. A motion
                     of her hand, scarcely perceptible, repelled him as he started impetuously
                     forward, and she passed out into the sunlight. The heavy gloom that settled
                     upon the Cathedral as she departed chilled him, and while he stood stupidly
                     wondering if the massive roof would not fall and bury him, a hand was laid upon
                     his arm.
                  "Do you know her?"
                  It was the old woman in the outlandish bonnet who spoke. He tried to remember
                     where he had seen her. Was it in Germany or at Merton? He could not tell.
                  "Do you know her?" she repeated eagerly.
                  "Do I know whom?" answered he dreamily.
                  "Do you know her? Her with the angel's eyes! Are you blind? Do you know
                     her?"
                  "Alas! No," he answered. "Do you know her?"
                  "No. I knew her when she was young, twenty-five years ago. Why don't you find
                     out?" she continued fiercely. "Are you not man enough?"
                  Wailes looked at her with dull surprise. He longed to get back to his office,
                     where he could reflect without distraction upon his late encounter. The old
                     woman continued with harsh intonations:
                  "I thought you called yourself Trumpley," she said. "Do you belong to that
                     race?"
                  And while he looked doubtfully at his interlocutor, wondering what astounding
                     remark would follow, she pointed her skinny finger at him contemptuously— 
                        "'Some villain spot is in thy blood to mar its gentle strain!'
                      "Listen! That cat-eyed hound does not stand droning and dreaming. Awake!
                     Are you going to let so shallow a knave circumvent you?"
                  So saying, she passed him and stalked out of the Cathedral, her fierce accents
                     still lingering in his ears. He glanced at his watch and followed her. The
                     bright light of the noonday sun seemed to mock and confuse him as he
                     mechanically walked towards the bank. When he entered, he saw the woman at the
                     cashier's counter receiving money. He went into his own room and began to
                     assort the letters on his desk. There was a note for him from Mr. Grippe. It
                     ran thus:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Dear Mr. Wailes:—Please send proper answers to the
                                 letters. My old clerk died this morning, and I am called away
                                 suddenly. If any private letters arrived, send them to Halidon by
                                 Chunk. I shall not return to-day.
                              
                                 Very truly yours,
                                 "Thursday.
                                 ANTHONY GRIPPE."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  Compelling his attention to the duties before him, Wailes got through the
                     correspondence in an hour or two. Chunk brought the afternoon mail to him,
                     having been instructed by Mr. Grippe to do so. There were three or four
                     unimportant business letters, and one for Halidon bearing the London post-mark.
                     It was addressed to "Messrs. Browler Brothers, Gloucester. For Mr. Anthony
                     Grippe. Miss Mabel Grahame."
                  Beyond a doubt this was she! Not Miss Grippe. Mabel! Mabel! He kissed the
                     letter which she would open. It was sealed with red wax, a crest
                     on the seal. Who was the writer? A man's hand certainly. And a jealous dread
                     possessed him on the instant. Perhaps those tears he had seen were—
                  "Any letters for the 'ouse, sir?" said Chunk, putting head in at the door.
                     "James is here, just goin' to 'Alidon."
                  Trumpley started up and went to the outer office, the letter in his hand. James
                     was there, contemplating a row of green boxes on a high shelf, with cabalistic
                     figures in white paint upon their sides. The numbers ran from 1860 to 1869, and
                     James supposing these boxes were filled with sovereigns, was endeavoring to
                     cast up the sum contained in the ten boxes. It was something less than twenty
                     thousand pounds, and was, he thought, kept there handy in case of a run on the
                     bank.
                  "A letter for Miss Grahame, James," said Wailes.
                  "All right, sir. Thank'ee, sir."
                  "She was at the Cathedral?"
                  "Yes, sir. S'pose Miss Hell Weese wanted to go."
                  Wailes was slightly shocked at this improper language, but conscious of the
                     impropriety of further questions, was about to retire.
                  "'Scuse me, sir," said James, "but is gold in all them boxes?"
                  Wailes looked at the boxes carelessly and relieved the servant's tortured
                     mind.
                  
                  "Oh no. There is nothing but papers, I presume."
                  "I thought them figgers meant pounds," said James, disappointed.
                  "The figures? Oh no. Those are the dates."
                  One more look. He had nearly decided it should be the last. Taking his hat, he
                     walked rapidly through Queen Street, and then by short by-ways into the road to
                     Halidon. There was a common on the outskirt of the town, and he turned into it,
                     and lay down on the grass under a tree. The road was visible.
                  The two girls first. One walking like a duchess; the other tripping like a
                     fairy.
                  Then James, a few yards behind them.
                  Then Tim, Radcliffe's groom.
                  Then the old woman in the poke-bonnet.
                  Wailes watched them until the last flutter of their veils disappeared, and then
                     went back to the cool shades of Browler Brothers. He had seen a copy of Burke
                     in Mr. Grippe's room. He would study a little heraldry.
                  Grahame. Plenty of them. Grahames of Sussex. Crest, a falcon with a chain in
                     its bill. That was it! The letter was from her father, brother, uncle, and the
                     jealousy departed. And now he was at liberty to muse upon that encounter in the
                     ancient Cathedral.
                  How had he recognised her at first?
                  Ah! He would have been conscious of her proximity if he had been stone-blind.
                     She was half hidden behind Helose. Her veil covered her face. Her dress was
                     different. But he remembered that he had no shadow of doubt as to her identity.
                     The droop of her shapely shoulders was enough. Surely there were none like them
                     in England.
                  Mabel Grahame. He seemed to know her a great deal better, now that he had
                     learned her name. Mabel. This was a thousand times better than Mardi Gras.
                     Mabel, Mabel, darling Mabel, with tearful eyes! Was he never to see that lovely
                     face lit up with smiles? Why did she fly from him? Why should she repulse him
                     so resolutely? Who could help him?
                  Then came another reflection. The old woman in the poke-bonnet had stung him
                     deeply, though he had not noticed her assault at the time. She had questioned
                     his manhood; and as he understood her as warning him against some rival with
                     "cat-eyes," she of course had referred to Mabel. But who was the rival?
                  He remembered now where he had seen the woman. It was at Beechwood. And the
                     rival could be none other than Clinton! "Cat-eyes!" Certainly. Had he not seen
                     him putting six bullets together in a tree twenty yards distant by moonlight?
                     And Clinton's sudden interest when he pointed out Halidon to him! He would
                     think it over as he walked home. It would not do to jump at rash conclusions.
                     And he would talk again with the fierce beldam.
                  As he locked his desk, at four o'clock, Mr. Clinton came in.
                  "Come, Wailes," he said, "I have been waiting for you. You will walk with me as
                     far as Beechwood, will you not? In two or three days the place will be
                     habitable, and then you will stay with me a week or so."
                  "I shall be a dull companion."
                  "All the better. I can enliven you. I will tell you some things. Come on!"
                  As they passed the common, Clinton startled his companion, who was thinking of
                     the flutter of the veils he had seen a few hours ago, by referring to them.
                  "These ladies' veils are a nuisance," said he. "This very day one of them hid
                     from me the loveliest face in England. And by way of equation I have, twice
                     to-day, seen the countenance of the ugliest, cat-eyed whelp in Christendom
                     totally unveiled!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXI.
                  MRS. HAMET.
                  "Ma belle!" said Helose, when the two girls
                     were passing the common, "did you ever hear of Mr. Radcliffe Merton?"
                  Mabel had been waiting since noon for some question from Helose touching the
                     encounter in the Cathedral. How much the French girl had seen or suspected she
                     could not tell, but she was on her guard when the sudden question was
                     propounded.
                  "Yes," she answered promptly, "I have heard of him."
                  "Where does he live?"
                  "I am not sure that I know. I believe he owns or will inherit some estates in
                     this country."
                  "Have you seen him?" said Helose softly.
                  "I cannot answer that question either, positively," said Mabel composedly, "but
                     I think I have."
                  
                  "To-day?" This was said with sublime indifference.
                  "Perhaps; I may say yes, that is if I have ever seen him. Why do you ask? Do
                     you know this gentleman?"
                  "Ah!" said Helose, "one never knows. Why are you doubtful?"
                  "Because I had heard of Mr. Merton before I came to Gloucester. I did not know
                     what he was like, but I heard that he resided near the town. I saw a gentleman
                     to-day that I thought might be he."
                  "And I also," replied Helose; "I saw a gentleman in Paris many times, but knew
                     not his name. I saw him again to-day, and when you were not near I asked James.
                     You are so exact in your proprieties! James replied to me that it was Mr.
                     Radcliffe Merton. That is all."
                  They walked on in silence, each conscious that she was hiding something from
                     the other, and each suspecting the other of reticence. If they had been more
                     frank, or if they had continued the conversation, they would have discovered
                     and corrected mistakes which, unexplained, colored their future lives.
                  Behind them came James and Tim. The latter had overtaken the footman, and
                     entered into conversation with easy grace.
                  "Fine evening for walking," said Tim.
                  "Warm!" responded James. "You're Mr. Merton's groom?"
                  "Exactly!" said Tim, not having a lie at hand to meet the emergency; "you're at
                     Grippe's?"
                  "Yes. Man and boy. Been there fifteen year."
                  "Oh, then you must have knowed the ladies yonder when they was children? Mr.
                     Grippe's daughters?"
                  "No; leastways not both. Miss Hell Weese is his daughter, p'raps. Don't
                     know."
                  "Which one is her?" asked Tim, innocently.
                  James nodded his head at the ladies and answered:
                  "That one."
                  "Indeed! The short one? Thought I seed a likeness."
                  "I didn't say the short one, but quite contrairy. And I don't see no likeness
                     neither." James interposed this disclaimer with stolid dignity. "The short one
                     is Miss Gram."
                  "Miss Gram!" said Tim, making a mental note. "And she is Grippe's niece or
                     something?"
                  "Mebbe so," replied James gravely; "I never heard that Grippe had nieces. But
                     mebbe he has. Has Merton any nieces?"
                  Tim indulged in a subdued laugh, and seeing that his companion's grim visage
                     relaxed somewhat, he prolonged the laugh while he reflected flected. His
                     instructions required him to "find out everything," and his present stock of
                     information was meagre.
                  "I always heard that Grippe was an old bach," said Tim at length; "I was quite
                     took aback when I heard of his daughter. He will leave a good pot of money too,
                     some day."
                  James in turn reflected awhile before he answered. He had
                     heretofore considered his master in tolerably comfortable circumstances, but
                     the recent discovery that the green boxes did not contain sovereigns had shaken
                     his faith slightly. Mr. Grippe was about twenty thousand pounds poorer in his
                     estimation; still it would not do to damage the credit of Browler Brothers.
                  "Them kind never dies," he said solemnly. "How can he leave anythink when he
                     won't die? You'd think to hear him cough and sneeze with one o' his asmas, that
                     every breath would be his last. But them kind never dies. I knowed a man in
                     Glo'ster that had asma when I was a kid. He was well on to ninety then, and he
                     choked and sneezed hisself black in the face three times a week reg'ler. We
                     used to rush in and shake him up, and slap him on the back when the fits was
                     on."
                  "Did he die at last?" said Tim, interested.
                  "Not he!" replied James, with an air of disgust. "He moved away. He went to the
                     West Ingies for his health when he was about a hundred, and he got struck by
                     lightenin out there among the niggers."
                  "I s'pose that finished him?" said Tim.
                  "Don't know; it turned him black, I believe."
                  "Them ladies don't look a bit alike," observed Tim; "they don't walk alike. Old
                     friends, I s'pose?"
                  "Cawn't say, I'm sure. Miss Gram is a kind o' govern nurse, if you
                        must know. I seed her teachin' Miss Hell her letters."
                  "What did you call her?" said Tim, in horror.
                  "Miss Hell Weese," answered James. "It don't sound very nice, but it's French,
                     and mebbe it is no harm in that lingo. I s'pose Weese is the French for
                     Grippe."
                  "Do you know," said Tim cautiously, "that the old woman behind us can hear
                     every word we are saying?"
                  James indulged in a very broad grin.
                  "That old woman is Mrs. Hamet," he replied. "If you was to shoot a forty-two
                     pounder off right under her nose, she might p'raps smell the powder. She's deef
                     as a post."
                  "Is she?" said Tim, suspiciously. "You can tell sometimes when people
                        do hear, but you can't allers tell when they don't."
                  
                  "No mistake about Mrs. Hamet. She has lived at Beechwood iver since I was a
                     kid. And she has been deef all that time. How could she lives so long at
                     Beechwood if she had her hearing?"
                  "What's the matter with Beechwood?"
                  "Ghosts! Here we are. Them's the gates. Hullo! What's up now?" This exclamation
                     was caused by Mrs. Hamet's action. She passed the two servants swiftly, and
                     overtook the girls at the gates. They paused, seeing her approach.
                  "Will the ladies walk in and look at the grounds?" she said, throwing the gate
                     open. "There is no one here excepting the painters. Mr. Clinton is in
                     Gloucester, and will not return until evening."
                  Helose did not understand a word, but the gesture was a plain invitation, and
                     she squeezed her companion's arm.
                  "I think not, ma-am," answered Mabel, irresolutely.
                  "Pray do not refuse," said the old woman plaintively. "You do not know how
                     lonesome my life is here. I have not looked with pleasure on any human face for
                     twenty years until to-day. Pray come and sit under the beeches a little
                     time."
                  Something in her manner broke down all the feeble barriers which Mabel's ideas
                     of propriety had reared. She led the way into the grounds. The shade of the
                     trees was very pleasant after their walk in the sunny road. There were two
                     magnificent beeches, springing from the same root, standing near the south
                     wing, and a garden-seat encircled the two. Mrs. Hamet escorted the ladies to
                     this seat, and after a momentary hesitation sat down at Mabel's side.
                  "Long, long ago!" she murmured. She took off the queer bonnet, and the green
                     glasses that hid her eyes. Mabel noticed the tremulous hands, and her soul was
                     filled with tender pity.
                  "You are fatigued with your long walk. Will you have my fan?"
                  The deaf woman made no reply, but gently putting Mabel's veil aside, looked
                     anxiously into her eyes. The contact with the polished lady seemed to ennoble
                     the older woman, and there was a new dignity and grace in her manner.
                  "Pardon my rudeness," she said. "I could not help it. You look kind and good.
                     Do you engage in missionary work sometimes?"
                  "My father is a clergyman," answered Mabel, "and I have always been with him
                     until now. I have been allowed to help him in his ministrations among poor
                     people."
                  "And you have found other woes than those of poverty? You have met with cases
                     where soft words were more comforting than hard money?"
                  "Yes," said Mabel. "Mere poverty is a minor evil. I have never known a case
                     where want was not a consequence of folly or wrongdoing."
                  "And you have been careful to say so to your pensioners?" continued Mrs. Hamet,
                     who seemed to hear Mabel's low voice notwithstanding her infirmity. "Pardon me
                     again, but I have supposed this was an important part of missionary work."
                  "I am afraid I have rather neglected that duty," said Mabel. "I have usually
                     found so much to pity, that I have overlooked much that might be
                     condemned."
                  "Do you live at—at Halidon?"
                  "Yes, I am living there with this lady."
                  "Is she related to you, if I may ask?"
                  "No."
                  "Do you know Mr. Radcliffe Merton?" said Mrs. Hamet, in a whisper so sharp and
                     fierce that Mabel was startled. She looked curiously at the eager eyes of her
                     questioner without replying.
                  "Because he is pursuing you! Do you know that?"
                  "I cannot tell," answered Mabel. "Why should he pursue me? I never saw him
                     until this very week."
                  "Beware of him, child! Avoid him! Better you were dead than—Ah! you are pale
                     and red by turns. What ails you? Has this hound spoken to you?"
                  "I have had no conversation with this gentleman," replied Mabel, speaking with
                     quiet dignity. "He has done me a great service, and I have not even thanked
                     him. He cannot wish to pursue me long, as he must think me both underbred and
                     ungrateful. He has twice given me the opportunity to acknowledge my obligation,
                     and I have twice refused to do it. All within three days."
                  "Poor child!" said Mrs. Hamet, compassionately, as she resumed her goggles and
                     bonnet. "Listen to the warning I give you. This Merton is a devil incarnate!
                     Hear another word. I know a poor wretch to whom your ministrations would be
                     helpful: will you help her if I point her out to you?"
                  "Gladly. Where is she?"
                  "Not very distant from Halidon. I will tell you hereafter. If you are rested,
                     come look at the flowers. Bid your friend come also."
                  While James and Tim were waiting dubiously at the gate, the ladies disappeared
                     within the conservatory.
                  "They've gone in," observed Tim. "They must have known your deef woman."
                  
                  "Never seed her until this mornin'," answered James.
                  "Miss Gram and her a good talk under the trees yonder. She seemed to hear well
                     enough too."
                  "Miss Gram talked mostly by signs, I dessay," said James. "Deef people learn to
                     hear with their eyes anyway. Here comes your gov'ner."
                  Tim walked out in the road as Mr. Merton drew near, and after a brief colloquy,
                     climbed up to his perch, and the dog-cart bore the worthy couple on toward
                     Merton. Through the glass walls of the conservatory six eyes watched the
                     retreating vehicle. Two of them black and sparkling, looked kindly and eagerly
                     at the stylish turnout. Two of them blue and pitiful, seemed to foresee some
                     catastrophe at the end of the gay career of the driver. And two of them peering
                     through green goggles, seemed to anticipate the catastrophe with grim
                     satisfaction.
                  The conservatory at Beechwood contained many rare plants, and it was evident
                     that they had been carefully cultivated. Mrs. Hamet pointed out several
                     varieties of exotics, the like of which she said could not be found elsewhere
                     in England. Mabel listened with surprise to her enumeration of these botanical
                     treasures, and the old woman replied to her looks.
                  "The care of this conservatory has been my only occupation," she observed, "for
                     many long years. The tenants that have lived here rather avoided this part of
                     the house, and they were not allowed to disturb the plants. I suppose what
                     remains of sanity I still retain I owe to the gentle influence of these
                     flowers. They at least do not lie nor defraud."
                  "It pains me to hear you speak in this way," said Mabel, "and I wish could
                     comfort you by some means."
                  "No doubt you can, child. And perhaps I can be of service to you also. Nous verrons."
                  Helose started. "Ah, madame speaks French also," she said, in that tongue.
                  Mrs. Hamet was confused. But after a moment's hesitation she turned to Mabel
                     again.
                  "Say to her that I know a few French phrases. I am trying to devise a plan. I
                     cannot go to you, and you cannot come here to me; but you can bring your friend
                     out sometimes to walk, and I will meet you in the road. There are many lovely
                     lanes between this place and Merton, and I know them all. Will you come?"
                  "Yes," answered Mabel, with some hesitation. "We can bring James also. I think
                     Mr. Grippe would not consent otherwise."
                  "Let it be so then. To-morrow, an hour before noon, I will walk down the road.
                     If I meet you, well. If not, I can return to my flowers. And now it is time for
                     you to go, as the new tenant may arrive at any time."
                  "Come, Helose!" said Mabel, blushing; "we are transgressing terribly. If Mr.
                     Grippe knew all, he would lock us up within the walls of Halidon for the rest
                     of the summer. Come!"
                  "Bah!" said Helose, irreverently. "We will manage Monsieur Grippe. I am going
                     to have the house full of company before summer is ended. Au revoir, madame!"
                  Mrs. Hamet gathered a bouquet of her rarest flowers and gave it to Helose.
                  "You will tell Mr. Grippe you have been here, of course," she said to Mabel.
                     "Let mademoiselle show him the flowers and he will not scold."
                  When the girls passed through the gateway, Mrs. Hamet rentered the
                     conservatory, locking the door on the inside; and then proceeding to the south
                     end, she pushed aside a box containing a small lemon-tree which moved upon
                     rollers. At the same time a part of the south wall opened, being moved by some
                     machinery connected with the tree-box, and when she went through the opening,
                     which was really a secret sliding door, she closed it behind her, and the lemon
                     tree rolled back to its place. If any onlooker had seen this queer movement
                     without knowing Mrs. Hamet's part of the performance, he would certainly have
                     concluded that Beechwood had a right to its uncanny reputation.
                  Mrs. Hamet, however, very coolly walked round the south wing and entered her
                     own apartment.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXII.
                  THE BLACK GHOSTS.
                  Mr. Podd had been engaged during the day adorning the grounds of sundry
                     'ristocrats at Gloucester. At nightfall, receiving his wages, he fortified his
                     inner man with a mutton-pie and two or three pots of beer. The "pipe or two"
                     that he smoked afterwards settled his stomach and soothed his feelings, and he
                     went from the chop-house to the
                     rooms of a "liberal club," of which he was an honored member. At this cheerful
                     gathering of kindred spirits he found more beer and more pipes, the soothing
                     influence being the more needful because the speeches were rather inflammatory.
                     The club demonstrated by several deliverances that all forms of government were
                     essentially tyrannical, that religious restraints were of the nature of a
                     swindle, that property was robbery (this was an accepted postulate), which was
                     the more readily accepted as a corner stone doctrine because the club,
                     individually and collectively, did not hold property. The halls of this
                     association were composed of a little back-room behind a pot-house, and the top
                     of a water-butt which stood outside, near the solitary window of the apartment.
                     The president occupied a stool on top of this butt, and the night being hot,
                     his official position was to be envied. Mr. Podd sat on the window-sill, and
                     the supplies of beer were brought in at irregular intervals by a pot-boy from
                     the front room, this Ganymede being summoned by pounding the table with
                     pewter-mugs. The discussions were rather desultory, and in the main were more
                     or less personal. The frightful wrongs imposed on workingmen in withholding
                     property from them, and requiring labor for wages, were only stated for the
                     sake of bringing the wrong-doers prominently forward, and ventilating their
                     individual atrocities. Mr. Grippe was discussed with amazing liberality in so
                     far as the quantity of discussion was concerned, and very illiberally with
                     respect to the quality. The ownership of Halidon was a more grievous offence
                     than common, because it had been in the hands of the Trumpleys through
                     successive generations. The money that paid for the estate had been writing
                     from numberless widows and orphans who had kept imaginary bank accounts with
                     Browler Brothers, and there were not wanting dark hints that some of the
                     speakers were among the aforesaid orphans. This piece of contemporaneous
                     history was peculiarly startling, as there was nothing in the appearance of the
                     orators to indicate their previous affluence. Although Mr. Clinton was quite a
                     newcomer, he came in for a share of the compliments. Some of the speakers had
                     been bricklaying at Beechwood that day, and had seen such indications of wealth
                     about the place as to put Mr. Clinton in the category of 'ristocrats. How a
                     Yankee coming from a country where every man was better than every other in
                     political and social status, could be a 'ristocrat, was the pons asinorum that broke up the meeting for the
                     night.
                  Before this catastrophe occurred Mr. Podd had enlightened the meeting by giving
                     a succinct history of Mr. Trumpley Wailes. There was such a strange combination
                     of evils about this youth that Mr. Podd was hardly equal to the task of
                     enumerating them. It is to be feared that some noxious ingredient in the beer
                     had somewhat muddled the orator's mind, but he made up in vehemence of
                     denunciation what he lacked in coherence of statement. The first count in his
                     indictment related to the 'ristocracy of a man who was "naught better than a
                     cadger" in the matter of worldly goods, and who yet persisted in going through
                     life with his nose in the air. His connexion with the Trumpleys of Halidon was
                     derided in forcible terms, inasmuch as Mr. Grippe really held the estates, and
                     Wailes was hopelessly debarred from that inheritance even if he had any natural
                     right to it. In a discursive vein Mr. Podd then assaulted the right of
                     primogeniture and the law of entail; and as neither of these enormities availed
                     Wailes, the fact of his entering "trade" to better his condition was a crowning
                     proof of the inherent meanness of 'ristocracy. Because wage, as the fruit of
                     labor, was the inalienable right of the working man, as contradistinguished
                     from the gentleman; and this right, like certain other inalienable rights, was
                     constantly impaired in all priest ridden and law-making countries.
                  By way of peroration Mr. Podd broke his pipe into minute fragments, and
                     crunching the ill-flavored remains under his boots, he stalked out of the
                     meeting. He had to walk to Merton, and feeling a cheerful complacency in the
                     retrospect of a well-spent day, he began his walk under the quiet heavens, not
                     far from midnight. The route was rather longer by Halidon, so he took that
                     road. The moon was in the last quarter, and was just appearing above the
                     eastern horizon.
                  Arrived at Beechwood, Mr. Podd sat down on the roadside to rest. The night was
                     still, excepting the slight rustling of the beeches, and Mr. Podd distinctly
                     heard the hall-clock announcing the midnight hour. Like everything else in the
                     neighborhood, the gardener had heard some vague stories concerning supernatural
                     appearances about the old mansion, and although he was thoroughly skeptical on
                     this and all kindred topics, he crawled down to the gates with some
                     trepidation, and peered curiously into the shaded enclosure. The south wing and
                     the eastern and of the conservatory were visible, flecked with stray beams of
                     moonlight; and while Mr. Podd was blinking drowsily through the gate, he
                     clearly saw a dark figure pass from the clump of trees before him and disappear
                     against the conservatory wall. It just seemed to, melt away like mist before
                     the sun!
                  Pondering this strange event, he looked again intently at the clump of beeches,
                     and sure enough there was a movement of some sort discernible cernible against the gray bark. A figure came up
                     noiselessly to the trees, then passed apparently through them in the uncertain
                     light, and approached the gate. Podd crouched lower and watched. The figure
                     approached nearer, now hidden by the bushes, and suddenly reappearing, it
                     placed a foot on the lower cross-bar of the gate, a hand on the spear-head
                     above. Both foot and hand were jet black, distinctly seen in the moonlight.
                     Then a black face with shining eyeballs looked over the gate, and Mr. Podd
                     scrambling to his feet, fled down the road with a prolonged snort of terror.
                     Throwing one appalled glance back, he saw a second black countenance appear
                     over the gate top facing the rising moon. Two black heads, two rows of
                     glistening teeth met his eyes, and as he spurned the dust of the highway, he
                     heard a discordant yell that was a fiendish caricature of laughter in
                     duetto.
                  A mile below the gate he paused, thoroughly blown, and again squatting on the
                     roadside, set himself resolutely to the task of unravelling the mystery.
                  "Black as the hinges!" he muttered. "I s'pose there must be a devil, and that
                     was him! What did he come naggin' at me for? I didn't do nothink. There was two
                     on 'em! I swear I saw two, their eyeballs shining like fire! There couldn't be
                     no foolin' about that! I have to go there to-morrow to take some plants. It
                     will be daylight then, anyway."
                  The ghosts descended from their perch on the gate as the gardener kicked up a
                     dense cloud of dust in his flight, and as they walked back to the house they
                     indulged in sundry fits of chunckling. They entered the kitchen, and while the
                     pearly teeth glistened in the light of the lamp, they still shook and grunted
                     in their uncouth merriment.
                  "Tell you what it is, Phillis," observed the male apparition, "dat fellow is
                     gwine to run till mornin'! What de debble do you s'pose he was doin' der?"
                  "Don't know, Memnon," answered the female ghost. "I spect we better tell Mars
                     Clint."
                  "Not to-night, Phillis woman," said Memnon. "I spect he done gone to
                     sleep."
                  "He say he gwine to sot up. He fuffin' at his pipe up yonder. Smelt de smoke
                     when we was comin' in. I'll go out and see."
                  She went out under the balcony. There was a light in the room above. She waited
                     and listened for some movement, and while she stood irresolute, she heard,
                     floating around her, above her, the echo of strange laughter:
                  "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"
                  On the instant Mr. Clinton appeared on the balcony.
                  "Hi! Mars Clint!" said Phillis, "was dat you a laffin'? You purty nigh skeart
                     me out ob my shoes!"
                  "Is that you, Phillis?" answered Clinton. "What are you doing up and out at
                     this unwholesome hour? Where is Agamemnon?"
                  "In de kitchen, sar. We was goin' to bed, but when we seed your light Memnon
                     said we better wait awhile. We bin sottin' out dar under de trees."
                  "Well?"
                  "Dat's all, sar—only—"
                  "Only what, Phillis?"
                  "Here you, Memnon! Mars Clint callin' fur you!" The Greek warrior came out upon
                     the dewy grass.
                  "Mars Clint want to know what you done saw?" said Phillis.
                  "He, he!" said Memnon, chuckling, "you mean de fellow gallopin' down de road?
                     Well, sar, me and Phillis was out dar half asleep, and Phillis she seed at tall
                     lady sottin' on de bench round de trees."
                  "Tall lady!"
                  "Yes, sar," said Phillis, taking up the thread. "She got up and sailed along
                     over de grass till she come to de end ob de house. Memnon follered her—he was
                     barfooted."
                  "And then?" said Clinton, as she paused.
                  "Den sar," said Memnon, "she jist went out like a candle. She went up to de
                     clouds or into de ground, dunno which."
                  "What stuff are you talking, Memnon?"
                  "All true, Mars Clint. She was a rale ghos'."
                  "Pshaw! You were asleep."
                  "Werry well den—what's dat?"
                  "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"
                  It came from the room above where Mr. Clinton stood at the open window.
                  "Any body up der wid you, Mars Clint?" said Phillis in a subdued whisper.
                  "I don't see anybody, Phillis."
                  "Mebbe you done gone to sleep, Mars Clint!" said Agamemnon spitefully.
                  "What did you see after your ghost disappeared?"
                  "Oh!" answered the African, "den I seed a fellow skrooched up at de gate. He
                     was peepin' in through de bars. I walked down and dumb up on de gate, and he
                     run like de debble was arter him."
                  
                  "What was he like?" said Clinton.
                  "Po' white trash, sar. Phillis seed him. What you think him like, Phillis?"
                  "Po' white trash," answered Phillis promptly.
                  "Some drunken fellow from Gloucester, I suppose," said Mr. Clinton. "There is
                     the clock. One. Better go to bed, Phillis. Take your husband in and let him
                     finish his dream."
                  "I s'pose you gwine to dream 'bout dat laffin," muttered Agamemnon, as he moved
                     away. "Come in, Phillis. Ghosses don't carry on foolishness arter one
                     o'clock."
                  When the negroes reached the kitchen, Memnon trimmed the lamp, and seating
                     himself, with a lordly air demanded of his better half some rational
                     explanation of the unearthly laughter they had heard.
                  "No use to ax me," said Phillis. "I done hear it twice. Mebbe it is one of Mars
                     Clint's tricks."
                  "Don't believe it," said Memnon dogmatically; "Mars Clint was flustered
                     hisself. Hi! who dat at de door?"
                  "It is I," said Mr. Clinton. "Go to bed. I am going, to walk about here and
                     smoke. I know that the laughter was—"
                  "What, Mars Clint?" said the two breathlessly.
                  "Some acoustic phenomenon, at present inexplicable. Go to bed, I say!"
                  As the obedient negroes ascended to their dormitory, awe-stricken, Memnon
                     whispered:
                  "Goose-sticks flommery! O Vaginny! No sich varmints in ole Vaginny!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXIII.
                  MORNING CALLS.
                  A week after the events last recorded, Mr. Clinton appeared at Rose Cottage. He
                     had driven down in a handsome pony-phaeton, glistening in newness. The week had
                     been a busy one with him, and Beechwood showed the power of money well expended
                     in its rapid transformations. All the habitable part of the house had been
                     renovated and furnished, the stables were brought into use and occupation, and
                     Mr. Clinton's turnout was thoroughly discussed in Gloucester and on all the
                     roads between Gloucester and Merton. Cards had been left at Beechwood by sundry
                     county dignitaries. Squire Merton had ridden over, making a formal call, and
                     engaging the American to a dinner in the next week. Mr. Grippe had stopped, and
                     expressed the hope of seeing Mr. Clinton at his annual dinner, now nearly due.
                     In addition to the credit from Corfu, Mr. Clinton had transferred a
                     considerable sum from London to Browler Brothers' bank, and somehow the county
                     magnates had found this out. The servants flitting about the house and grounds
                     were visible from the road, and the ghosts had no chance to disport themselves
                     in so thickly populated a locality. Mr. Podd had trimmed and transplanted,
                     occupying several days, looking askance at Agamemnon (who seemed to be
                     major-domo of the establishment), and cursing his own stupidity, not loudly but
                     deeply, for running himself out of breath from so poor a counterfeit of Satan
                     as the harmless African.
                  Mrs. Wailes received her visitor very cordially.
                  "I come to ask a great favor of you, Madam," he said. "Will you honor me by
                     dining at Beechwood to-morrow?"
                  "I must ask my son," she answered, with a little hesitation, "or, as it is
                     always best to tell the exact truth, I must say that I shrink from revisiting
                     Beechwood."
                  "Yes, Madam," replied Clinton, "I expected some such answer, and therefore I
                     came to prefer my request in person instead of sending a note. I have invited
                     your son, who refers me to you. Ah, Madam! how happy are you both; you in your
                     son, he in his mother. I venture to press this invitation, however, hoping you
                     will hear my reasons."
                  "Certainly, Mr. Clinton. It may be that my reluctance is not wise. I should be
                     proof against painful souvenirs at my age."
                  "It is because of your former acquaintance with Beechwood that I am the more
                     urgent, Madam."
                  "Well," said Mrs. Wailes, "if Trump does not object."
                  "He bade me say it would give him pleasure, Madam, if the visit would be
                     pleasant to you."
                  "It is only for a few hours," replied Mrs. Wailes, smiling, "and I think I may
                     accept—"
                  "Pardon me, Mrs. Wailes," said Clinton earnestly, "but it is more than a few
                     hours. I hope you will pass the night there. Forgive me if I am transgressing,
                     and hear me out. I have seen sights and heard sounds at Beechwood that I cannot
                     account for. I have weighty reasons impelling me to unravel the mystery."
                  
                  "What have you seen?"
                  "I have seen the form of a woman moving through the grounds, and—disappearing
                     unaccountably."
                  "What have you heard?"
                  "I have heard laughter, distinctly, positively! It was in the chamber where I
                     sat, in the air outside, apparently floating around me—everywhere!"
                  "And were you frightened or awed?"
                  "Neither," answered Clinton, slowly. "I can hardly tell you my emotions. I am
                     perplexed—that is all."
                  "And what do you wish me to do?"
                  "Dine at Beechwood to-morrow—say at seven o'clock. Then I will dismiss the
                     servants—say at eleven—and you and Wailes shall retire. But before midnight you
                     will rejoin me in my room, and we three will watch."
                  "It is a pleasant prospect!" said Mrs. Wailes, shivering."
                  "I am ashamed of myself for proposing it, and withdraw the request," said
                     Clinton. "Let us say no more about it. I think I can ferret it out in time.
                     And, Mrs. Wailes," he continued cheerfully, "I will not press the dinner
                     invitation either. It was only a sentiment after all."
                  "A sentiment?"
                  "Yes, Ma'am. You have been so kind to me that I said to myself, Mrs. Wailes
                     shall have the first entertainment that Beechwood offers. I had some foolish
                     idea or notion that it would be lucky to have you first." There was a little
                     tremor in his voice as he said this. "You see, I have led so independent a
                     life, that I have made me no friendships; and I thought in my selfishness that
                     you and Wailes might somehow come to take the places of those who died before I
                     knew them. It is horribly ill-bred to annoy you thus, for I see you
                        are annoyed. I am truly sorry."
                  "I will come," said Mrs. Wailes, composedly; "and I will take breakfast with
                     you, the next morning. There."
                  "And you will allow me to send for you, will you not?"
                  "Yes. I have no carriage. My visits are usually made within walking
                     distances."
                  "Good people like you get to heaven by acts of this sort, Madam. Pure charity,
                     pure beneficence, with self-denial."
                  "Poor boy!" said Mrs. Wailes. "Heaven is not obtained in that way. I shall
                     preach to you while we wait to-morrow night."
                  "And I shall listen devoutly, and I promise to believe all your preaching. This
                     is more than I have ever done before."
                  "Where are you going?" said Mrs. Wailes, as Clinton rose.
                  "To Merton Park. I owe a visit to the good Squire."
                  "You are unfortunate. Mr. Radcliffe, the young squire, went to London this
                     morning. You will miss him."
                  "Indeed!" replied Clinton, as he descended the steps of the porch. "That is a
                     misfortune! But your candor is contagious, Mrs. Wailes; and I will tell you the
                     exact truth. I saw the young squire depart by the train, and I decided to take
                     advantage of his absence and make my visit."
                  "Then you do not wish to meet him?"
                  "Not at present. Hereafter I hope to have that pleasure. I am not quite ready.
                     Good morning, Madam."
                  As the ponies trotted briskly up the lane. Mr. Clinton soliloquised.
                  "Yonder cottage is the Castle of Truth. I did not need tell Mrs. Wailes that I
                     avoided this Merton. She will fancy that I am courting Miss Sybil! Why not!
                  "How promptly Mrs. Wailes detected my antipathy! If she does not repel my
                     confidence, I shall tell her about it. And she will tell Trump; and Trump will
                     put me through a catechism! He remembers our German life.
                  "No matter. I shall tell her anyhow. She is a dear old lady. I can tell her the
                     story without mentioning names. Perhaps she will not suspect the true
                     actors.
                  "Time enough to meet the exigency when it comes."
                  And with this juvenile conclusion he entered the grounds of Merton Park.
                  The Squire and Miss Merton had driven into the village. Miss Sybil was at home.
                     She appeared immediately. Thought the ponies were lovely. Were they quite
                     manageable? Would be delighted to get her hat and drive into the village to
                     meet her father and sister, if Mr. Clinton would return with them to luncheon.
                     Papa was speaking of him this morning, and would be glad to see him. Might she
                     driver? Radcliffe had gone to London. Would be absent two weeks. How unlucky!
                     Aunt Merton had sent for him. What a beautiful phaeton!
                  While all this monologue progressed, Clinton was making up his mind. He had
                     seen Miss Sybil once or twice, and found that he admired her more and more. He
                     had heard that she was destined for Radcliffe, and he longed to disappoint him.
                     He was horror-stricken at the thought of wasting such sweetness upon the arid
                     desert of his selfishness. Decidedly, he would use all his efforts to supplant
                        young Merton, and he would allow
                     himself to fall in love with this gentle lady on the spot.
                  "You drive so well, Miss Merton," he said, "that I am tempted to ask a great
                     favor of you. I am training the ponies. May I come down here occasionally and
                     get your aid?"
                  "Oh, you are making fun of me!"
                  "Far from it! I am entirely serious. You handle the ribbons so much better than
                     I do, that I am gaining knowledge of the art while I watch you. I am a
                     horseman, tolerably expert, but I have not driven a dozen times in all my
                     life."
                  This was said so simply that his companion was satisfied that he was
                     sincere.
                  "I must ask Papa," she answered, blushing slightly.
                  "I will ask him this very day, unless you forbid me. You do not answer. Allow
                     me, once for all, to explain matters. You know I am an American, and it is
                     quite probable that I continually transgress some. English rules of propriety.
                     But believe me, I am most eager to avoid offence, and you will do me a genuine
                     kindness if you will give me a hint when I blunder into wrong expressions or
                     actions."
                  "I am sure you are making fun now, Mr. Clinton," replied Sybil. "I have never
                     known you to transgress any rules. You have some peculiarities of speech—"
                  "Pray criticise them, now and always," he said eagerly. "You don't mean that I
                     have a nasal twang?"
                  "No. What is the name of your native State?"
                  "New York."
                  "Ah, that is a city. I mean the province or State, or whatever you call
                     it."
                  "New York State is about as large as England. New York city is not so large as
                     London."
                  "Indeed! I thought you were from another State."
                  "You mean Virginia?"
                  "Yes. Well, you call it 'Phaginny.'"
                  "Do I?" said Clinton, astonished.
                  "Certainly you do. Phaginny! Now take that for your first lesson, and learn to
                     say 'Virginia.' I will give you some other words hereafter. There is the
                     carriage coming. Papa does not see anything but your horses."
                  When the vehicles met in the road, the Squire descended from his carriage, and
                     with a nod to Clinton, proceeded to investigate the ponies. He opened their
                     mouths and scrutinised their teeth with great care. Their dental endowments
                     being found in order, he took up their feet, where he found cause of
                     complaint.
                  "That brute of a smith has pared down their hoofs," he said. "You must go down
                     to the village and have them shod next time, Clinton. They had beautiful colts'
                     feet—beautiful—both babies. How do they drive?"
                  "You must ask Miss Sybil, sir," answered Clinton; "she is instructing me in the
                     art."
                  "Don't you know how to drive? Here, Baby, change places with me. I will give,
                     Mr. Clinton a lesson."
                  It is certain that Mr. Clinton very strongly objected to this change of
                     instructors, but the Squire's tones were imperative. While he tried to think of
                     the best form of expostulation, Mr. Merton whisked his daughter out of the
                     phaeton and escorted her politely to his vacated seat in the family coach. She
                     saw her pupil's disconcerted expression, and out of pure charity she threw him
                     a smile and a consolatory word.
                  "Never mind, Mr. Clinton, we will 'resume our studies,' as Madame Finish used
                     to say, some other time."
                  "Many thanks. I shall not heed the Squire's instructions, unless they accord
                     with yours. Will you get in, sir?"
                  "Yes, Move over, please. I must have your seat. What do you call the off
                     filly?"
                  "Phaginny," said Clinton. Sybil held up a warning finger.
                  "And the other?"
                  "Baby." He glanced furtively at Sybil, and added, "She is a pet, sir."
                  "All right. She should be on the off side, though. We will change them when we
                     get home. Now drive on, John. We will just drive to the brook, girls, and
                     overtake you before you get home. G'long!"
                  When Mr. Clinton drove back to Beechwood that glowing afternoon, he had the
                     enjoyment of recalling several odd bits of pleasant chat with Sybil, at
                     luncheon, alternating this mental exercise with perplexed cogitations upon a
                     parting remark of Miss Merton, who startled him by saying that he "strongly
                     resembled the Patriarch Jacob"—and contrary to her usual habit, she refused to
                     enumerate the points of resemblance.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XXIV.
                  DORA'S GHOST.
                  The dinner at Beechwood was positively charming. This was the judgment of Mrs.
                     Wailes. There was not much attempt at display, and not a confusing succession
                     of dishes, but the cooking was superb. The waiter, clad in spotless linen, with
                     ebon visage, was prompt to anticipate each want of the guests, moving about the
                     dining hall with the tread of a fairy. It was unanimously decided that tea
                     should be served under the double beeches; and while Memnon deftly served them,
                     Mrs. Wailes watched him with great curiosity.
                  "This entertainment reminds me of some of the Arabian Nights' stories," she
                     said, when Memnon had made his final bow. "Where did you get your African, Mrs.
                     Clinton?"
                  "By inheritance, Madam."
                  Mrs. Wailes started. Trumpley explained. "Agamemnon was a slave,
                     mother. But he is free now, of course."
                  "Have you any others, Mr. Clinton?" said Mrs. Wailes.
                  "Only my cook, Ma'am. She is Memnon's wife. As for the slavery, I have belonged
                     to them from infancy. They call me 'Master Clint,' but it is a hollow
                     mockery."
                  "Will you pardon my curiosity if I ask for an explanation of your words? You
                     know we are accustomed to regard slavery as the last relic of barbarism."
                  "Yes, It is abolished now in my country also. I shall not discuss the question
                     of its evils or advantages. I believe you only desire to hear my individual
                     experience?"
                  "That is all. But do not tell us if the subject is at all disagreeable, to
                     yourself."
                  "On the contrary," said Clinton, "I am very glad to find you interested enough
                     to listen. I lost my mother so soon after my birth that I don't remember her.
                     My first recollection of motherly care and protection is connected with
                     Phillis. But you have not seen Phillis?"
                  "No."
                  Clinton took a whistle from his pocket and sounded two notes. Phillis appeared
                     in a minute. She quietly approached them and waited.
                  "Phillis," said Clinton, "Mrs. Wailes says your bread was inimitable."
                  "Yes, Mars Clint. Dat is because de yeast ain't like Vaginny yeast. Can't make
                     good bread wid dis yeast."
                  "But she says it was good."
                  "Does she?" answered Phillis, delighted. "Come agin next week, Missus. I done
                     got some hops now, and will hab ra'al yeast next week."
                  "I confirm the invitation very cordially," said Clinton. "Phillis, how old was
                     I when you took charge of me?"
                  "Why, you was just borned, Mars Clint. I nussed you when your mammy died. Don't
                     you remember?"
                  "Well, I cannot say that I do, Phillis. But I do remember that you have taken
                     care of me all my life."
                  "'Cept when you was over yonder, larnin' Dutch," said Phillis, viciously.
                     "Don't see no good in it, nohow. Next time you go, I'm gwine wid you."
                  "Very well, Phillis."
                  "What you whistle for, Mars Clint?"
                  "Oh nothing! I wished Mrs. Wailes to see my cook. I told her you and Memnon
                     used to belong to me, but that you were free now."
                  "Me and Memnon belonged to old missus, and she done gone to heaben. Don't see
                     how you gwine to sot us free widout axing her."
                  "The law, Phillis, the law."
                  "Got nuffin to do wid de law. You can't sot us free if we don't want to be
                     free."
                  "What will you do when I die, Phillis?" said Clinton.
                  "You is younger dan us. We'll die fust," and Phillis waddled back to the house
                     in disgust.
                  "I told Agamemnon that he was free," said Mr. Clinton, "when I went back to
                     America, a year or two ago. I also announced my intention of returning to
                     England, and gave him a week to decide what he would do. He answered on the
                     instant, 'Done decided, sar! Whar you go, I'se agwine.' So I brought him and
                     his wife with me. He knows, of course, that he is entirely free, but the rascal
                     also knows that I am not. He is a most valuable servant, but I should be
                     obliged to keep him if he were worthless. It is certain that both of these
                     ex-slaves resent any allusion to their new freedom as a personal affront. It is
                     probable that this feeling is partly due to the fact that very few free negroes
                     were in our neighborhood in the old time, and they were shiftless and
                     improvident. And they doubtless have some vague idea that they inherited
                        me and my protection. I am sure that I have no friends on earth who love me
                     so tenderly as these."
                  "It seems that your servants are an exception to the rule. Uncle Tom's
                        Cabin, which I read with great interest, presents a different
                     picture."
                  Clinton laughed. "If you have no more trustworthy historian, you will never
                     learn the truth about the abolished institution from Mrs. Stowe. Baron
                     Munchausen is veracious in comparison with her."
                  "You are prejudiced, of course."
                  "Perhaps. It will avail nothing to discuss the question. I am very glad,
                     personally, to be delivered from the responsibility of ownership. The pecuniary
                     loss to me is imaginary. I should never have sold Memnon or his wife, if I had
                     been starving, and the expense of keeping them is not changed. I allow them
                     liberal wages, and pay them regularly, but they are improvident and reckless,
                     and accumulate nothing. Memnon has two watches, which get wound about once a
                     month, and also an expensive violincello."
                  "Does he play?" said Trumpley.
                  "Not a note. I gave him a banjo many years ago, and tried diligently to teach
                     him to play. All in vain; he has no music in his soul. Wailes, will your kind
                     mother allow you to smoke? I have some Lynchburg tobacco and hald-a-bushel of
                     pipes."
                  "Certainly," answered Mrs. Wailes. "You can bring your pipes out here and talk
                     while you smoke. Trump used to smoke in Germany, but has relinquished the
                     habit, I believe."
                  "What induced you to give up smoking?" asked Clinton, as they approached the
                     house.
                  "Economy was the principal motive," replied Wailes, promptly. "My income has
                     never been very extensive, and I concluded to cut off unnecessary expenditure a
                     year or so ago."
                  "But you can smoke so cheaply."
                  "Not very. Are you going upstairs?"
                  "Yes. I want you to see my room. Here are the pipes, and here is the tobacco.
                     Now listen. This tobacco cost me one dollar a pound—say four shillings. These
                     pipes—unglazed clay, with common cane-stems that cost nothing, cost two
                     shillings a dozen. If you like the tobacco upon trial, I will sell you a pound
                     and a dozen pipes, and you will have six months' moderate smoking at a shilling
                     a month."
                  "You are a thorough good fellow, Clinton, and I will accept your offer, with
                     thanks. But when this pound is gone—"
                  "My dear fellow, I have twenty pounds in this box, and a supply besides among
                     my stores. And I can get any quantity you want at any time. But let us go out
                     and try it. We must get to leeward of your mother. You will understand, of
                     course, that you have to pay me the six shillings! I would like to present you
                     with a few pounds, only I fear the burden of obligation would break your
                     back."
                  "Do you like obligations?" said Wailes, quietly.
                  "Ha! I have not thought of it. Among friends the interchange of gifts should be
                     easy enough. If I knew you better, or rather if you knew me better, I think I
                     could accept favors from you. I know I could take any gift from
                     your mother. How good she is to let us smoke!"
                  They met Mrs. Wailes at the door. The night was growing cooler, and she
                     proposed a sance in Mr. Clinton's
                     smoking-room. There had been some changes made since the reader saw this
                     apartment last. The bed was banished to an adjoining room, and the walls of the
                     smoking-room were ornamented with pictures, ancient weapons, foils and masks,
                     and some outlandish curiosities which Clinton had gathered up in vagrant
                     fashion in his wanderings. On the table, in the centre of the room, the long
                     Toledo reposed, between a pair of revolvers. There were two comfortable
                     lounges, and the great chair with reclining back. This was drawn to one of the
                     windows, and Mrs. Wailes, protesting that she enjoyed the fumigation, bade the
                     young men light their pipes.
                  "What does this warlike array mean, Mr. Clinton?" said Mrs. Wailes, when they
                     were all seated.
                  "I forgot the weapons, Madam, or I should have hidden them before you came.
                     When I took possession of Beechwood, I thought there might be some substantial
                     intruders, and therefore arranged my defences."
                  "And you have not needed them, of course?"
                  "No, Ma'am."
                  "But you have seen and heard some unsubstantial intruders, I suppose?"
                  Clinton silently smoked, while she waited for his reply.
                  "You do not answer me," she said at last.
                  "Excuse me, Madam," said he; "I was trying to think what answer would be
                     proper, and I cannot decide."
                  Trumpley and his mother looked at him with amazement.
                  "If you are as thoroughly skeptical as all other sensible people," said
                     Clinton, "perhaps you will not mind watching with me an hour or two. I think it quite probable that you will
                     be able to appreciate my inability to answer your question."
                  "What have you seen or heard?" asked Mrs. Wailes.
                  "Nothing very terrible. Let us wait. It is half-past eleven o'clock; a
                     half-hour will reveal either sights or sounds, perhaps. And I will be happy to
                     spend the time in listening to your promised sermon."
                  "Instead of my sermon, I have an extract from—a book—not yet published. I
                     thought of your Beechwood stories this morning, and I copied the passage. Shall
                     I read it?"
                  "If you please, Ma'am," said Clinton, placing the candles on a table near the
                     window. "Is the light sufficient?"
                  "Quite," answered Mrs. Wailes. She took a roll of paper from her pocket and
                     began to read:
                  "There is something in humanity that sympathises with the supernatural; and
                     probably this attribute, if I may so call it, is specially variable in
                     individual cases, and specially invariable in some of its manifestations. The
                     variation is in the degree of credulity. The similarity is in the total
                     disregard of probabilities, where the credence is once yielded. Thus, a ghost
                     with three heads is as readily believed in as a ghost with one. Some of the
                     most monstrous delusions I have met with have been in this direction. I know a
                     gentleman of undoubted scholarship, entirely sane upon all other topics, a man
                     of high scientific attainments, who subjects all natural phenomena to the most
                     rigid scrutiny, skeptical upon many matters of common belief, yet a firm
                     believer in the ghost of a calf with six legs. He has seen it repeatedly,
                     without the slightest trepidation, he avers; and he actually has some family
                     legend that accords with his monstrous experience. I have bestowed great labor
                     upon the examination of this case, and am compelled to yield entire credence to
                     his story, while I utterly disbelieve his facts. It may be that time will
                     reveal the secret of his delusion and dispel the hallucination. But at present
                     the matter is inscrutable.
                  "And it is just to notice another point. While the deniers of inexplicable
                     visitations complacently put the burden of proof upon the ghost-seers, and
                     boldly avow the doctrine that optical delusion, warped imaginations,
                     unsoundness in body or mind, may be safely predicated in all such supposed
                     visitations, it is certainly true that the testimony, in so far as
                        testimony has value, is all on the other side. You demonstrated
                     no proposition when you assert that you have never seen, or that a thousand
                     other men have never seen, the sights that have stricken terror into the hearts
                     of two or three witnesses."
                  "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"
                  Mrs. Wailes had laid a sheet of her manuscript on the table, and was smoothing
                     out a second sheet, when the laugh floated into the apartment. At the same
                     moment the hall-clock, after a premonitory growl, struck twelve.
                  "Proceed, Madam," said Clinton, coolly; "we are much interested."
                  "Did you hear that laugh?" said Mrs. Wailes.
                  "Yes, Ma'am."
                  "Have you heard it before?"
                  "Oh yes. Several times. You will hear it again, presently."
                  "If you have no objection, pray tell me your experience."
                  "There is but little to tell. On the first night—that is after I left Rose
                     Cottage ten days ago—I heard this same sound. I was sitting where you sit now,
                     and it seemed to come in at the window, and through the opposite hall at the
                     same time. I have heard it every night since."
                  "It comes from the conservatory," said Mrs. Wailes decidedly. "I remember this
                     room, and remember many pleasant hours spent in it; and like the whispering
                     galleries we read of, there is a distinct echo here of sounds made in the
                     conservatory. I have tested it many times. I think there are some leaden pipes
                     connecting the rooms."
                  Clinton listened with absorbed attention. "We will investigate this to-morrow,"
                     he said.
                  "I feel entirely satisfied," continued Mrs. Wailes, "that all mystery connected
                     with the transmission of the sounds will be dissipated—"
                  "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"
                  "Let us go to the conservatory now," said Trumpley. "How can you sit there so
                     coolly, waiting for to-morrow! Come, mother!"
                  "Not I! You young gentlemen can go if you please. What is that?"
                  She pointed eagerly out upon the darkened lawn, and the two youths sprang to
                     the balcony. A tall figure in dark attire moved from the double beeches, just
                     visible in the dim light of the stars.
                  "Not Phillis, certainly," whispered Mrs. Wailes. "Do you see the white
                     hair?"
                  The apparition glided over the ground, slowly. It reached the conservatory
                     wall, and while they looked, it disappeared. Clinton caught up a candle, and
                     followed by Trumpley, rushed rapidly through the corridor, down the staircase,
                     and into the conservatory. There was only one door leading from the house, and
                     that was in the great drawing-room. The conservatory was empty. No possible
                        hiding place was left unexplored.
                     A tall lemon-tree in a box near the south wall was swaying to and fro as if
                     moved by a gentle breeze. When they returned to Clinton's room, Mrs. Wailes
                     informed them that the figure reappeared just as they started away, and it
                     seemed to move round the south wing.
                  "Did you notice the cadence in the laughter?" said Mrs. Wailes.
                  "Yes. It is always the same."
                  "Well, it is the chorus of a song I have heard here a hundred times. I never
                     admired it particularly—but she sang it constantly."
                  "She? Who?" said her listeners, in a breath.
                  "Dora Lennox! And if that white hair had been golden, I should have said that
                     Dora Lennox moved out there on the lawn."
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXV.
                  MEMNON'S MEMORIES.
                  Mr. Podd was busy in the conservatory on the following morning, after Mr.
                     Clinton and his guests had left Beechwood. Trumpley walked to Gloucester, and
                     Clinton drove his ponies, dropping Mrs. Wailes at Rose Cottage, and proceeding
                     to Merton Park for another lesson. The gardener was very much interested in the
                     collection of plants, and his present business was merely to take as many
                     cuttings, as he could get away unseen, of such as were specially rare. Like a
                     wise man and philosopher, as he was, Mr. Podd walked quietly round the spacious
                     room, making his selections, intending to do the "conveying" just before he
                     left for his noon meal. His ostensible work was all outside of the walls, and
                     he had only slipped into the conservatory when Clinton drove away, because he
                     could not resist the opportunity and the open door. Mr. Clinton and Mrs. Wailes
                     came out through the conservatory, and entered the phaeton there, leaving the
                     door ajar.
                  The liberal politics of Mr. Podd had an expansive platform of principles; and
                     one cardinal doctrine of his creed pronounced all ownership of any valuable,
                     robbery of the worker. His efforts to carry this principle into practice were
                     somewhat obstructed by the operation of effete laws and customs which met him
                     at every turn, such as penalties attached to trespass, and the nefarious habit
                     of locking up places and things by the robbers who owned them. But having the
                     conservatory to himself, he was not disturbed by such contemptible
                     considerations, and was, for the nonce, monarch of all he surveyed.
                  This part of his rightful dominions Mr. Podd had secretly longed to explore
                     since he began his labors among the flower-beds on the lawn. But the door was
                     always locked; and with the modesty that ever accompanies greatness, Mr. Podd
                     had refrained from trying to get into the conservatory through the house, lest
                     he should stumble against some abominable 'ristocratic rule that excluded
                     gentlemen of his class from drawing-rooms. He could probably have overcome his
                     repugnance to break the abstract rule, but he was not at all certain that some
                     miserable slave of a footman would not encounter him in the passage, and
                     enforce the rule with violence and contumely.
                  Filled with these reflections, and calculating the probabilities of getting
                     slips to take root and grow, and fixing in his mind the prices he would demand,
                     the names he would give to the plants, and the very patrons who should buy
                     them, the liberal philosopher made a mental list of such plants as he would
                     appropriate on this occasion. A geranium on a high shelf attracted his
                     attention particularly, both by its wealth of bloom and odor, and stepping
                     lightly on the frame below, he plucked a twig of it for closer observation.
                  "Musn't tech nuffin!" said a husky voice behind him, and Mr. Podd, turning with
                     easy grace of manner, though with perturbed spirits, beheld Agamemnon,
                     squatting on an inverted flower-pot and half concealed behind a gigantic
                     cactus.
                  "Musn't tech nuffin in dis room!" said the African, rising and approaching the
                     gardener. "Mars Clint gib strick orders. He says dese flowers are not
                     his'n."
                  "Oh! Ah!" said the philosopher. "And who may you be?"
                  "Agamemnon Jehoshaphat Washington Blox!" answered the other, composedly.
                  "And do you belong to the house?" said Mr. Podd, somewhat awed by the pronomina of his interlocutor.
                  "No, sar! I belong to Mars Clint. Gib me de flower you done broke off. Mebbe it
                     will grow agin. Mebbe you'd better git out now; Mars Clint would play de debble
                     wid you if he cotch you in here."
                  So saying, Mr. Blox took the poor fragment of geranium, and spitting on the
                     fractured stem, he stuck it carefully in the earth by the root of a lemon-tree
                     that stood near in its box. Mr. Podd accepted the invitation to walk out, and Memnon following
                     him, pulled the door after him, which closed with a snap. There was no knob on
                     the outside.
                  The gardener returned to his recognised occupation, trimming a hedge of boxwood
                     surrounding a flower-bed on the lawn. Memnon stretched himself lazily in the
                     sun near him, and watched his proceedings. Mr. Podd felt an antagonistic spirit
                     reviving within his bosom, partly because the African had caught him in the act
                     of stealing, and partly because he assumed a delegated authority over him, as
                     the representative of the blarsted 'ristocrat who paid him his wages.
                  "If them flowers don't belong to Clinton, whose are they?" he asked,
                     sullenly.
                  "Who do you mean by Clinton? Gempleman like Mars Clint gen'ally hab handle to
                     his name."
                  "He calls me Podd," answered the gardener. "Why should I not call him
                     Clinton?"
                  "Podd werry good name for you. Him call me Memnon too. But when you wisits me,
                     you must ax for Mr. Blox. When I returns your wisit, I'll ax for Mr. Podd."
                  "And when I visit him I'll call him Mr. Clinton," said Podd, sarcastically.
                  "Better do it when you ax for your wages too," said Memnon. "I 'spec you
                     needn't mind wisitin' him. Mebbe he wouldn't be at home. But I'm home all de
                     time."
                  Podd gazed at the innocent black face, and wondered if his companion was making
                     game of him. Memnon bore the scrutiny with undisturbed gravity.
                  "Who owns the flowers in the glass-house?" said Podd, after a pause.
                  "De ghosses, I s'pose," replied Memnon.
                  The gardener snipped the leaves from the boxwood while he meditated. Analysing
                     his colloquy, he could not find any part of it that was satisfactory. While he
                     entertained a profound contempt for the negro, who lay blinking on the grass,
                     there was an uncomfortable conviction on his mind that Memnon had rather the
                     better of him. The reference to ghosts was peculiarly offensive, because the
                     philosopher had recently been frightened out of his philosophy by a couple of
                     black apparitions, one of whom, he concluded, was broiling himself in the sun
                     within reach, of his arm. There was an element of cruelty in the character of
                     the man that fell naturally into the grooves of his communistical theories, and
                     he cast furtive glances, full of malignity, upon the comfortable African, who
                     seemed more than half asleep.
                  "There's two of you niggers here?" said Mr. Podd.
                  "Two culled pussons. You nebber seen a nigger, 'cept you seen de debble!" This
                     was said with severe dignity.
                  "What?" said Podd, harshly.
                  "I say you nebber seen a nigger, 'cept you've bin in torment! 'Spec you're
                     gwine dar—den you'll see him, sho' nuff!"
                  This was satisfactory, and looked like progress. Memnon was evidently insulted,
                     and Podd felt better. Moreover, it opened the way for argumentation upon
                     radical topics, and this was always pleasant and profitable.
                  "I meant no offence," he said apologetically. "My notion is that all men are
                     equal. I don't know any difference between white and black, rich and poor,
                     lords and laborers. Some men own land and houses and hosses and cows, but they
                     haven't any right to 'em. No man has any right to anything he don't work
                     for."
                  "Den why don't you take dis house, and let Mars Clint trim your flowers?" said
                     Memnon, raising himself upon his elbow.
                  "Because the 'ristocrats that rule this country have made laws against the
                     workingman. I've as good a right to this house as Mr. Clinton."
                  "Mars Clint pay de rent. S'pose he pay de rent for one year? Is you got right
                     to turn him out befo' de year is done gone?"
                  "He had no right to pay the rent. He had the right to take the house if he
                     wanted it, without rent. Rent is robbery. There is no rent in heaven, if there
                     is such a place."
                  "I reckon not," answered Memnon. "Don't pay up dar! Is you gwine dar?"
                  "Don't believe in no such place," said Podd.
                  "I reckon not," said Memnon again. "Now I'll tell you how 'tis. Men ain't all
                     ekal. Dares three kinds. Fust, de gemplemans, like Mars Clint and Mr. Wailes.
                     Den de culled pussons dat behave demselves. Den de po' white trash. Sometimes
                     gemplemans git drunk and cut up all kinds o' tricks, but, mind you, dey still
                     gemplemans. Culled pussons git drunk sometimes, and dey jist play defool, and
                     if dey don't git licked—all de better. But when po' white trash git
                     drunk—den—"
                  "What?" said Podd, as the orator paused.
                  "Why den he jist same as a hog rootin' in de ground! Him tol'able good pison when he sober, but when he
                     drunk he's all de same as a hog! Only he ain't good to eat. Yah!"
                  The concluding interjection was so expressive, so full of disgust and contempt,
                     that Podd was stunned. The oration proceeded.
                  "It ain't de money, mind you. When Mars Clint was little infant, his mammy
                     died, and my wife nussed him and fotch him up. He didn't no money hardly. Some
                     was lef' to him to pay for him to go ober yonder to larn Dutch. But he was just
                     de same gempleman. Me and Phillis kep' de farm goin'. Mars Clint hab uncle in
                     New York, but he nebber disturb us. Befo' he done larnin' Dutch de war come,
                     an' we kep' on plantin' corn and sellin' a little, and raisin' hog meat. Wen
                     Mars Clint come'd home, war was done over, an' he tell me and Phillis dat we
                     was free feller-citizens. Plenty people done told us same thing. Den his uncle
                     died and leave all his money to Mars Clint. Den he tole me and Phillis he was
                     gwine to come to do dismis'able country, whar de corn won't grow; and he tole
                     us we was free, and he gib us do ole, farm, and de hog-meat and corn and mules.
                     Hosses all done stole in de war."
                  Another rhetorical pause. The gardener was greatly interested, but wisely
                     waited for Memnon to resume his discourse. The negro preserved his calm
                     exterior, but was evidently excited by the old memories he was recalling.
                  "Befo' uncle died, mind you, Mars Clint was done busted. Jist de same as a
                     punkin when mule kick it wid his fore-foot. De money dat paid for larnin' Dutch
                     was all gone, an' all de hands he hab on de farm all gone too. Only me and
                     Phillis wasn't gone. We hab hog meat and hominy—plenty of it. Mars Clint stayed
                     home purity nigh a year, and try to farm a little. He was jist de same
                     gempleman when he was straddlin' along behind de plow, mules goin' ebbery
                     way—plow jumpin' out ob de furrow, and Mars Clint sprawlin' along jist same as
                     a culled pusson dancin' a hoe-down. Rale gempleman, mind you! Den de uncle
                     died, and Mars Clint put crape on his hat, and he tole me and Phillis dat he
                     hab plenty of money now, and was comin' ober here, and we was free
                     feller-citizens, and mought hab de farm."
                  Here Memnon raised himself up on his haunches, and squatting opposite the
                     Radical, looked intently at him as he concluded his narrative.
                  "Den we up and told him dat we raised him from de time he was borned. Dat we
                     didn't want no farm, dat we didn't want no wotes. Ef he couldn't lib in Ole
                     Vaginny—no more we couldn't. Dat we belonged to his mammy, and she was in
                     heaben, and hadn't made nary 'mancipation papers, and we jist wanted to know
                     whar de debble he could go dat we couldn't go too. An' my ole woman—dat's
                     Phillis—tole me if I didn't git Mars Clint to take us, she would scaled me de
                     fust time she got hold of a gourd full of bilin' water! She'd a' done it too,
                     mind you!
                  "Den de rale gempleman showed out! Mars Clint jist cried like a baby, and
                     Phillis cried, and Mars Clint shook hands wid us, and said 'Werry well,' and we
                     knowed it was all settled. And I 'spect I'd a cried too, only I was busy
                     tellin' Phillis if she didn't shet up her howlin' I'd git a cowhide and gib her
                     somethin' to cry about.
                  "Now if Mars. Clint had bin po' white trash, you, s'pose he goin' to be
                     bothered wid us? No, sar! He'd jist a sneaked off by hisself, and tole us to go
                     to de debble."
                  "I s'pose you are worth all you cost him," said Podd with a sneer. "It would
                     cost him a pound or two a month to get others to wait on him, if you were not
                     here."
                  "Dere's de po' white trash agin!" said Memnon. "Here is my wages! My mont' up
                     to-day, and Mars Clint pay me dis mornin' befo' he go."
                  He held out his black hand with four shining sovereigns in the palm, glittering
                     in the sunlight, and they seemed to Mr. Podd to be about the size of half-crown
                     pieces. To this day he is not certain of the denomination of the coins, and as
                     he watched Memnon's retreating form until he disappeared within the house he
                     muttered: "Who would have thought that a blarsterd nigger could be a
                     'ristocrat! I'm blest if he hasn't got the same swagger that his master has!
                     And he calls hisself a 'culled pusson,' and me 'white trash'—cuss his black
                     hide!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXVI.
                  LAYING THE GHOST.
                  When Mr. Clinton's phaeton re-entered the gates at Beechwood, the sun was
                     sinking behind the western horizon. Agamemnon met him at the door, and invited
                     him into the conservatory, where he had, a discovery to relate.
                  "You see, Mars Clint," he began, impressively, "when you done druv off this mornin', I squatted down dar on
                     dat flower-pot. I seed dat ole Podd poking about de winders afore to-day. So I
                     conclude to watch him a lilly bit. Sho' nuff he come slinkin' in. You lef' de
                     do' open. Den he walk round, gapin' at de flowers, and sniffen, fust one, den
                     another. I keep my eye skun, and purty soon he climb up on de frame yonder, an'
                     broken off a piece of geraniment. Den I riz up, and tuck it away from him, and
                     tole him he better walk out, and I stuck de geraniment down here in dis
                     box.
                  "Well, sar, I went out dar, and laid down on de grass while he worked at de
                     flower-beds. He kep' on talkin' purity nigh all de mornin.' Talked a whole heap
                     of Fourth o' July talk. He says you don't own nuffin, widout you work for it;
                     and if you do work for it, and any oder po' white trash want it, den you don't
                     own it nohow."
                  "What is all this rubbish about, Memnon?" said Mr. Clinton, impatiently.
                  "Hole on! You'll see bime-by, Mars Clint. When he done talk about two hours, it
                     make me sick at de stomach, so I went in to Phillis and got a lilly bit fat
                     bacon. Den I come in here, and tho't I'd see how dis geraniment was gittin'
                     along. So I kneeled down here, and leant up agin de box—dis way—and—jist look
                     for yourself!"
                  As he spoke, the tree-box glided along the floor, and the wall opened behind
                     it. Clinton saw the clump of beeches out upon the lawn, and the waving ivy
                     around the secret door-frame. Then the African pulled the box back to its
                     original position, and the wall closed, shutting out the view. Bidding Memnon
                     stand aside, Clinton repeated the operation himself. The box slipped
                     noiselessly and easily. All the machinery was hidden under the floor, and when
                     the door was shut there was nothing to indicate such an opening. Broad battens
                     on either side concealed the joints, and no one would have suspected the
                     existence of this passage-way.
                  "Have you mentioned this to any one, Memnon?" asked his master, as they left
                     the conservatory by way of the drawing-room.
                  "No, sar. Keep my mouf shet tight!"
                  "Have you told Phillis?"
                  "Phillis! Law, Mars Clint! ef Phillis know'd about dis do,' and couldn't find
                     somebody to told about it—she would a bust by dis time. No, sar! I jist wait
                     till you come, and tole nobody."
                  "Very well, Memnon. Here! this is half-a-crown. If it is not big enough to keep
                     your mouth shut, I'll find another."
                  "Sho! Mars Clint!" replied Memnon, taking the coin and pocketing it. "I don't
                     want no money to keep my mouf shut. Must I nail up de do'?"
                  "Certainly not. Is the outer door closed?"
                  "Yes, sar."
                  "Well, I'll just lock this one, and take the key. And I will be ready to dine
                     in half an hour."
                  Later in the evening Mr. Clinton drew his chair to the balcony, and smoked and
                     meditated. He had spent several hours after dinner in reading old letters, of
                     which he had a huge package. The reader need not apprehend their reproduction
                     in this narrative, as the story they suggested, in fragments and hints, will be
                     told in more coherent fashion in due time. But as readers have the power of
                     divining the very thoughts of the shadowy people flitting across these pages,
                     some of Mr. Clinton's musings may as well be recounted.
                  "It is odd that I should have been drawn so suddenly to Mrs. Wailes," he
                     thought. "Those German dreamers would have a psychological explanation, no
                     doubt. It was odd, by the way, that I never saw her in Germany. She was always
                     within reach of her boy, and I might have known her easily. And now it has
                     happened, just in the crisis, that she has cleared away all my doubts, and
                     unravelled all my mysteries. The whole business is plain now. I did not tell
                     her, lest I should be mistaken after all. But I cannot be mistaken. The
                     letters, the stories I heard at Baden, and the hints from Mrs. Wailes filling
                     all the gaps, all converge to the certain conclusion.
                  "How still the night is! There is not even the whirr of that elephant-bug that
                     has been sailing in and out here for a week or more. I wonder how he employs
                     himself by daylight?
                  "I must put on my moccasins. Hi! there goes the old clock."
                  With noiseless tread he passed through the hall, down the stairs, through the
                     long corridor and into the drawing-room. Producing the key, he cautiously
                     opened the conservatory door, and after listening a moment, stepped lightly
                     down among the flowers. Some faint gleam of light came in through the roof,
                     from the starry heavens; and when he reached the opposite wall, the lawn was
                     dimly visible through the closely-woven network of wire that covered the
                     windows.
                  A narrow space between a great cactus and the wall, and an inverted flower-pot
                     that he found with his foot as he crept along. This was the spot he had
                     selected by daylight, and seating himself where Memnon sat when he watched
                     Podd, he waited.
                  The lemon-tree nods gently as it glides away from him. A tall figure passes
                     near him, with black skirts trailing over the floor. Long white hair, floating over her shoulders, and no
                     audible footfall. Through the screen of leaves he sees her eyes, open and
                     devoid of expression. "Thou hast no speculation in those eyes!" thought the
                     watcher.
                  Then the apparition, with low tones, gradually increasing in volume as the song
                     progressed, began to sing: 
                        
                           "Sing, oh sing!
                           To her who weareth the golden wing,
                           Sing, sing, sing!
                           And who may this fair maiden be?
                           Joy! Joy!
                           The mother of mirth and glee!
                           And time shall be
                           Like an evergreen tree,
                           While we both sing so merrily.
                           Then laugh, oh laugh and sing,
                           Then laugh, ha! ha!
                           Then laugh, ha! ha!
                           Then laugh, oh laugh and sing,
                           Sing tira la, la, la, la, la,
                           Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"
                        
                     
                  
                  The last line was given with considerable vigor, and the ghost abruptly
                     retraced its steps and disappeared behind the lemon-tree. Looking through the
                     window, Clinton saw it approaching the rustic seat under the beeches.
                  It was not strictly according to ghostly etiquette, yet the figure sat down
                     under the trees, still murmuring the chorus of the song, while she combed her
                     long tresses with slender fingers. As Clinton decided to go out upon the lawn,
                     the figure suddenly rose, and flitted away to more remote coverts of the broad
                     enclosure, visible only now and again, as her white hair appeared through
                     openings in the bushes.
                  "I must wait here," he thought. "If I go out now I may lose her. She will
                     return without doubt."
                  And gliding along the hedge, then to the double-trees, and then to the
                     conservatory, the ghost came. He slunk back against the wall as she passed him
                     again, going to the farther end of the conservatory. She stood here, and again
                     began her song. She had a marvellously sweet voice for a ghost, who by rights
                     should indulge only in sepulchral accents. As she concluded with the refrain,
                     she waved her hand, as if dismissing her attendants or visitors, and came
                     sailing down towards the lemon-tree. But Mr. Clinton, pressing the box back
                     with his foot, stood suddenly before the apparition, holding out his hands.
                  She moved nearer, looking at him with vacant eyes, and would have passed, but
                     he threw his arms around her waist and held her back.
                  "Awake!" he said, sharply.
                  She shuddered, and endeavored to extricate herself.
                  "Awake!" he repeated.
                  "What is it? Where am I? How dare you!"
                  "Ah! You are awake! Do not be alarmed. You have been sleep-walking—that is all.
                     You are in the conservatory. See! here is the lemon-tree. Now I open the
                     door—now I close it. Do you see?"
                  "Yes! Allow me to go out;" she spoke with cold composure.
                  "Out! Go out! Nevermore!" he answered, tenderly.
                  "What do you mean, Sir?"
                  "I mean you to come with me, here through the drawing-room."
                  "Who are you?" said the ghost tremulously.
                  "I? Do you not know? I was sure you would know me when I wakened you."
                  "I do not know you!"
                  "I am De Witt Stratton. Come away!"
               
            
            
               
               BOOK III.
               THE BANK'S GAME.
               
                  CHAPTER XXVII.
                  GOSSIP.
                  Browler Brothers had been a respectable firm a century or more. The Browlers
                     were Gloucester people, living in the city, and always preserving an air of
                     comfortable solidity. Fifty years ago, Mr. Adam Browler, a bachelor of sixty,
                     and his nephew, Mr. Adam Browler, Jr. (a married man with half-a-dozen
                     daughters), composed the firm. Anthony Grippe was errand-boy, the type of
                     Chunk; and by regular, gradations worked his way first to the counter and then
                     to a desk. Adam Senior had fits of asthma. So had Grippe. Adam Senior was
                     methodical and exact. So was Grippe. Adam Junior liked to take a sly risk on
                     the Derby. Grippe had a spasm whenever any sort of risk was suggested. Adam
                     Junior played a good game of ecart, and won twenty pounds one night from
                     Captain Twizzle of the Gloucester Fencibles. Grippe paid Captain Twizzle's
                     cheque for the amount the next morning, and while Adam Junior chuckled and
                     rattled the sovereigns in his pocket, Grippe rolled up his eyes in horror.
                  And so it came to pass that Grippe got a higher step in the bank, and a lowest
                     desk. That is, he was promoted from the stool to the armchair. Adam Senior
                     gradually put weighty interests in his charge, and after signing "Browler
                     Brothers" by procuration a year or two, Mr. Grippe became a regular junior in
                     the firm.
                  Twenty years of steady application had made the young partner master of all the
                     details of his business. And while he was on the best terms with Adam Junior,
                     in spite of the latter's 'erratic habits, he was the mainstay of the bank in
                     the estimation of Browler Senior.
                  Some complications in accounts between the bank and their correspondent in
                     Marseilles made a trip to the continent necessary. Adam Junior thought he would
                     take a daughter or two, run over to Paris, then down to Marseilles, and "fix
                     matters." The girls wanted the jaunt, poor things. So he went, with the
                     understanding that he would remain in Paris until the accounts were forwarded
                     from Gloucester. A day later, Adam Senior despatched Mr. Grippe with the
                     accounts in his pocket, and with instructions to find the Marseilles people and
                     settle.
                  This was the turning-point in Mr. Grippe's fortunes. He was absent a month, but
                     when he returned he had the full settlement of the Marseilles account. He had
                     followed his debtor to Baden, and after various vexatious delays, obtained the
                     money. A year later, he bought Adam Junior's interest in the bank. Everything
                     seemed to prosper with him. And before Adam Senior departed this life, Mr.
                     Grippe had also brought his interest, although the old gentleman was retained
                     as a sort of Professor Emeritus of Banking, and actually went off finally in
                     the bank parlor, in a fit of a apoplexy. Mr. Grippe went into mourning; the
                     bank shutters were put upon the day of the funeral, and Mr. Grippe was chief
                     mourner, as Adam Junior was on the continent.
                  Halidon had passed into Mr. Grippe's possession very soon after his return from
                     Baden. His partners supposed he had made the purchase in behalf of some client,
                     as no one thought him possessed of such substantial wealth as the ownership of
                     Halidon would presuppose. Mr. Grippe rather encouraged this view of matters, as
                     he habitually referred to his proprietorship as temporary. But the years rolled
                     on, and there was no transfer of title, and the surrounding world gradually
                     accepted the banker as one of the lords of the soil. Once in each year he gave
                     a dinner, and each recurrence of this event showed an improvement upon former
                     entertainments. The guests were selected with great skill, and everybody met
                     precisely the most congenial company in the neighborhood. No expense was spared
                     at these annual feasts; and as Mr. Grippe lived very frugally three hundred and
                     sixty-four days after each entertainment, it is very probable that his yearly
                     income was not materially impaired. There was more or less solemnity about
                     these parties, which was due to their rare recurrence, and the want of real
                     intimacy betwixt host and guests.
                  
                  It would not be possible for any single gentleman in England or any other
                     civilised country to live as Mr. Grippe lived, without exciting the compassion
                     of some unmarried ladies. His solitary life weighted down the spirits of twenty
                     maidens and widows within five miles of Halidon. He needed constant nursing
                     with his perpetual asthma; he required female society to cheer him in his
                     stately home; artful minxes might catch him in some unguarded moment and marry
                     him out of hand; the servants at Halidon were making ducks and drakes of his
                     money, with no watchful mistress to keep them in check; having no youthful
                     forms at play in the wide grounds, he was squandering a fortune in flowers and
                     other adornments, which nobody saw; his life was altogether abnormal, and
                     society was bound to regulate it. Uncles and brothers-in-law and mammas
                     presented these and similar arguments, again and again, and Mr. Grippe coughed
                     and choked, but made no satisfactory response. He kept steadyfastly on, making
                     money, growing richer and more asthmatic, until the date of this history, when
                     a vague rumor spread over the neighborhood, to the effect that the Old Brute
                     had been receiving wasted sympathy through twenty years, as he had, without
                     warning, brought a grown-up daughter from foreign parts, to inherit all the
                     wealth of the eminent firm of Browler Brothers.
                  The most aggravating part of the business was the total ignorance of the entire
                     community as to the marriage of Mr. Grippe, and his present condition. Nobody
                     knew whether Mrs. Grippe were still alive or not. Nobody had spoken to Helose,
                     and very few had, seen her. She had been at church once only, and that was on
                     the first Sunday after her arrival, and before the news of her advent had
                     reached everybody. On the second Sunday Mr. Grippe was in his pew with a young
                     lady, but she was veiled so closely that nobody could give a satisfactory
                     description of her. She was not the "other one" however. Perhaps the wheezing
                     old trunk had two daughters.
                  Then another rumor got out. Mr. Grippe had not been married at all. Indeed,
                     Mrs. Flamingo, who had a brother in London and two single daughters in
                     Gloucester, and whose pew was just behind Mr. Grippe's, had a letter from her
                     brother, in which he informed her that he had met the banker at Charing Cross
                     Hotel, and had learned from him in a lucid interval that the lady in question
                     was his "adopted daughter." The bankers was still open therefore to honorable
                     competition. The adopted daughter—poor, motherless girl!—ought to have a
                     woman's tender care. How would Grippe know the wiles of the wicked world? Who
                     was then other young lady? Grippe kept her so close and was so silent that he
                     was probably thinking of "adopting" a wife. It would be a pretty business for
                     the old hunks to marry a slip of a girl like that! Nothing more likely. The
                     slip of a girl sailed down the aisle with so majestic an air that she probably
                     already considered herself the mistress of Halidon. She looked very quiet and
                     demure, but as sly as a cat. Her name was Miss. Cram. Nobody knew whence Grippe
                     had picked her up. James, who knew more of Halidon than any one else, was
                     stolid and stupid, and could or would give no information except that Miss Cram
                     was a lady "hevery hinch of her." She had only been at Halidon a few weeks, yet
                     she had managed to get the good-will of Mr. Grippe's confidential servant.
                  And there was young Wailes! Gone into trade; or at least into banking, which
                     was the same thing. Why didn't he go into the army or something? He walked all
                     the way from Rose Cottage to Gloucester, and back again in the afternoon, every
                     day. He knew no end of languages, and did the foreign correspondence. But he
                     was after something, of course. Probably Grippe's daughter. Bless you, the
                     Waileses had next to nothing! They lived in a very plain way indeed. Oh, he had
                     a good place in the bank, and said he got a great deal more salary than he was
                     worth. He was an odd creature, anyhow. Grippe told somebody that he was a
                     regular treasure. But the grand mystery was, how a young gentleman with no
                     business training whatever could take charge of the complicated affairs of so
                     immense a concern as Browler Brothers'. Wailes was a good fellow, though, if he
                     was odd. If his uncle had not been such a wretch, Wailes would have had
                     Halidon. Grippe bought it for a song—ten or twelve thousand. It was worth
                     twenty. After all, it would be a sort of poetical justice if Wailes got the
                     daughter, and through her the inheritance. Nobody knew what Grippe was worth,
                     but he spent nothing, and was accumulating all the time. He must have a big lot
                     of money—immense!
                  This Mr. Clinton, who had taken Beechwood, was another mystery. Talking of
                     money, he had enough! He tried to buy Blonde! Farm, but there was
                     some trouble about the entail; Mrs. Flamingo's brother was negotiating now. It
                     was sixteen thousand pounds, and Clinton had the money in Grippe's bank. He and
                     Wailes were great friends. Clinton was an American—not a Yankee; he came from
                     South America, where they had that dreadful war. He brought two of his slaves
                     with him—Africans; black as a coal. He was giving a dinner at Beechwood. The
                     Mertons were invited. They said he had laid the ghosts at the old place, and had renovated it completely. Grippe
                     was invited, and was going. Clinton drove down to Merton Park every day.
                     Shouldn't wonder if he supplanted Radcliffe Merton. Family? He was altogether
                     eligible. Sir Henry Walton had been attach or something at Washington, and knew
                     all about him; most respectable young man, and highly educated. Lady Walton
                     vouched for him. He had lived abroad nearly all his life, somewhere on the
                     Continent.
                  Really it was impossible to find out whether Radcliffe Merton was paying
                     serious attentions to his cousin or not. The estate would go to him when the
                     Squire died. It was not probable that he had much besides, as he led a gay
                     life, and was altogether dependent upon his mother. Oh yes, he had his dog-cart
                     and team, and he owned Rose Cottage; but the revenue from the last did not pay
                     his groom's wages. Mrs. Merton kept him strictly to his allowance, it was said,
                     and some ill-natured persons hinted that the young gentleman was considerably
                     in debt. The girls would have moderate fortunes, but the Squire did not live
                     economically, and was probably spending all his revenue; and when Mr. Radcliffe
                     took possession, he would, not doubt, cover the broad acres with mortgages. He
                     was very polite and agreeable, played croquet charmingly, but was thoroughly
                     selfish. He and Wailes were fast friends formerly, but they did not appear to
                     be so cordial of late. Wailes was a handsome fellow, and Radcliffe might
                     perhaps be slightly jealous. The Squire was very fond of Wailes, and called
                     him, "The Odd Trump."
                  The foregoing is a fair sample of Gloucester gossip so far as it related to the
                     actors in this story. Like all gossip, it had running through its warp and woof
                     certain fine threads of truth, and this delicate network served to give
                     vitality and coherence to the rest. It is one of the beneficent provisions of
                     nature that makes an unadorned falsehood fall to the ground by its own gravity.
                     It tends downward. But give a little coloring of verity, a spot here and there,
                     and fables float upon the surface of society like the winged seeds of certain
                     plants, finding lodgment and talking root in odd corners, and bringing forth
                     fruit after their kind. It is another beneficent provision that lays upon
                     humanity the task of separating between fact and fable; and certainly, the
                     worthiest of the race, in their efforts in behalf of the race, employ their
                     best powers precisely in this direction.
                  With this small fragment of philosophy, more valuable because of the rare
                     appearance of philosophy upon these pages, the gentle reader will enter once
                     more upon the action of the story.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXVIII.
                  THE DORADO MINE.
                  There was a letter enclosing a prospectus of a certain silver mine in Nevada,
                     that was placed upon Mr. Wailes' desk, among the foreign letters, one morning.
                     It did not belong to his department, but Mr. Grippe had written "H. T. W." in
                     pencil on the margin as an indication of his desire that wailes should write
                     the reply. It was from the chairman of the board of directors, dated in London.
                     After disposing of the foreign mail, Wailes took up this document, and read it
                     carefully. The letter was merely an invitation to Browler Brothers to invest in
                     this "desirable property," calling attention to the date of allotment of
                     shares. A stamped envelope, bearing the address of the chairman, was pinned to
                     the letter. The prospectus described the property, its exact location, the
                     extent of operations already going on, and the estimated yield of ore, with
                     some analyses of samples. The report of a mining engineer was appended, which
                     was confusing rather by reason of the magnitude of the figures than from any
                     other cause. Wailes took the lowest possible yield as set forth in the paper,
                     and found that it promised fully ten per centum per annum upon the total cost
                     of shares. After two or three perusals of these documents, Trump was slightly
                     bewildered. Clearly, the only safe course was to get Mr. Grippe's ideas upon
                     the subject before he ventured to answer this glowing epistle.
                  Taking his portfolio in his hand, he went into the banker's office. Mr. Grippe
                     glanced at the foreign letters rapidly, and affixed his signature. At the
                     bottom Trump had placed the mining prospectus, which Mr. Grippe took up, turned
                     over and replaced, handing the portfolio back.
                  "You have not answered Mr. Tyrrell's letter, I see," said he.
                  "No, sir," said Wailes; "I thought I would ask you—"
                  "Oh, don't ask me anything about it. Find out all you can, write a proper
                     reply, and I will sign it. No hurry. Take your time, and get what information
                     you need. Any time to-day will do."
                  This was refreshing. Here was an entirely new case. The information he required
                     was not, within reach. He sat down at his desk, and methodically wrote out a
                     list of the points upon which he needed enlightenment.
                  First: The honesty of the promoters of the scheme.
                  
                  Second: The trustworthiness of the statements recorded.
                  Third: The possibility of failure.
                  Fourth:—Who is that? Chunk, ushering in a gentleman. Mr. Clinton. Wailes closed
                     his portfolio, and welcomed his visitor.
                  "Come out for a walk, Wailes," said the American. "You must be pretty well
                     stewed in this hot room."
                  "It is luncheon time," answered Wailes; "come with me and get a chop."
                  "Agreed! Do you go at this hour usually? Well, to-morrow I will call for you,
                     and we will lunch at Beechwood. I can drive my ponies, there in nine minutes. I
                     timed them yesterday."
                  "This is according to my doctrine—"
                  "What do you mean?" said Clinton.
                  "Why, you take my chop to-day, and return me a chop to-morrow."
                  "Exactly! And I will make a mental memorandum of the dimensions of your chop,
                     so as to give you the same quantity. Where do you go?"
                  "In Queen street. It is not the most popular place, but they cook them
                     delightfully, and they let you select your meat. I found, the place by accident
                     a week or two ago."
                  They were shown into a little stall with a red curtain over the entrance. The
                     mutton was produced, inspected and approved; and while it was broiling Clinton
                     took some letters from his pocket, which he looked over, apologising to Wailes
                     as he did it.
                  "Hum!" said he, handing one across the table, "here is a chance to make a
                     fortune. Just look at these flattering figures."
                  It was a duplicate of the mining circular. The letter was also an exact copy of
                     the one that Wailes had left in his portfolio, the only difference being in the
                     address. Trumpley read the letter, and returned it without comment.
                  "Now this Mr. Tyrrell will 'place' the whole of the stock within a week,"
                     observed Mr. Clinton; "you Englishmen are made to be sold."
                  "Sold?"
                  "Certainly! Do you know where Nevada is?"
                  "Of course," answered Wailes, slightly confused—"that is, I have a vague
                     knowledge on the subject."
                  "Well, how nearly can you locate Nevada? Bring your vague idea to definite
                     proportions, and tell me what it is."
                  "Nevada," said Wailes, "is a country somewhere near Mexico. I do not remember
                     latitude and longitude, if I ever knew. But it is somewhere out West, in
                     America—nearer the Pacific than the Atlantic."
                  "Very good. The description is accurate enough. What is peculiar about
                     Nevada?"
                  "It is said to be rich in metals—"
                  "Who says so?"
                  "I don't remember the authorities. That circular you showed me refers to it as
                     a well-known fact."
                  "Of course," said Mr. Clinton; "what else could the circular say? If you want a
                     mine you must go to a metalliferous country. Now I never heard of the 'Dorado
                     Mine' until this moment, and it is possible that the description here given is
                     true."
                  "How much of it do you believe?" said Wailes, much interested.
                  "Not a solitary word," replied Clinton, coolly.
                  Wailes was shocked. There was something diabolical in the American's prompt and
                     wholesale rejection of the Dorado Mine. While he mused the chops came, done to
                     a turn. There were two roasted potatoes, two small slices of bread, two little
                     pats of butter, and two mugs of beer.
                  "Waes hael!" said Wailes, taking his mug in
                     hand.
                  "Drinc hael!" responded Clinton, imitating
                     him.
                  "I am not certain as to the exact meaning of the words," said Trumpley; "but I
                     have a profound veneration for everything Saxon, and I suppose this is a
                     courteous salutation and response."
                  "I also venerate the Saxon," replied Clinton. "We have a common ancestry, and
                     mine has been very largely in the Saxon line."
                  "On my father's side, my strain is pure Saxon," said Wailes.
                  "Then you would not be fooled by so shallow a fraud as the 'Dorado,'" replied
                     the other. "Your Saxon, if of gentle blood, lacks greed, which is the first
                     element in the character of a victim. You prefer earning to winning."
                  "That is true," said Wailes, thoughtfully; "yet I am eager enough to gain money
                     to incur some risk."
                  "Very well. Buy a hundred shares or so of Dorado; I will land you the money. If
                     you have pluck enough to sell out at a moderate profit, you will be tolerably
                     certain to get it. The difficulty is in the increase of greed. When you have a
                     few hundreds assured profit, you want a few thousands; the devilish appetite
                     grows by that it feeds upon."
                  "I am perplexed about this matter," said Trumpley. "Somehow I recoil from the
                     adventure, yet I am anxious to make the gain if lawful. Of course I do not think of accepting
                     your generous offer. I have some small capital."
                  "Heed your instinct, my friend," said Clinton, with impressive earnestness. "I
                     will analyse it for you. If there is such a thing in existence as the Dorado
                     mine—"
                  "Do you really doubt it?" interrupted Wailes.
                  "Indeed I do. But there may be such a mine, and it may be a silver mine, and it
                     may be productive. Now, if so, do you not think there is capital enough in New
                     York to take it up?"
                  "Certainly."
                  "Then there would be no need to seek English capital. That is the first point.
                     And if it should prove bogus at last, after you had comfortably disposed of
                     your shares, somebody would be sorely bitten. How would your few hundreds burn
                     your pockets if you knew some window or orphan had invested in the identical
                     shares that you sold!"
                  "I would not touch the stock," said Wailes, with a shudder.
                  "This Tyrrell has been promoter of sundry questionable schemes," observed
                     Clinton. "I should not have doubted this one so promptly but for his connection
                     with it. He manages to get some respectable names on his prospectus, and is
                     never caught with unprofitable shares on hand. In American he is called a
                     shyster."
                  "A what?"
                  "A shyster. The word means a slippery fellow, a rogue, a false pretender, a
                     sucker, a whelp."
                  "You have a redundant vocabulary," said Trumpley, laughing, "but all your terms
                     are expressive. As for Dorado, I'll none of it! Will you have more chops?"
                  "I thank you, no."
                  "More beer?"
                  "No more; I am going to dine at Merton Park. I wish you were going also."
                  "Perhaps I may be there. The Squire has given me a standing invitation,
                     courteous and hearty. I feel authorised to go at any time, and am sure of a
                     cordial welcome. My friend," he continued, suddenly seizing Clinton's hand,
                     "you have done me great good, and I am grateful. You have infused into my mind
                     a horror of all speculation. Henceforth I am invulnerable, and you have
                     furnished my armor of proof."
                  Clinton was touched by the other's earnestness. As they left the chop-house he
                     took Trumpley's arm and walked to the corner.
                  "This is my theory, Wailes," he said, as they parted: "stealing is a mean
                     business, begging is meaner, and gambling is meanest. When you steal you incur
                     a certain risk; when you beg, your almsgiver knows what you are doing; but when
                     you gamble, if you win, it must be by inflicting certain loss somewhere. Most
                     men will reverse the order of offences, but I have adopted the gradation after
                     careful study of the subject. I am truly glad if I have made you think with me.
                     Good-bye!"
                  An hour later Mr. Wailes laid his answer to Mr. Tyrrell upon the banker's desk.
                     Mr. Grippe read it, his sharp eyes twinkled a little, and he affixed his
                     signature without comment. The letter was very short, running as follows:—
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Dear Sir:—We have your favor of yesterday, with
                                 enclosure, and beg to, say that we decline the investment
                                 proposed.
                              
                                 "Very truly yours,
                                 "BROWLER BROTHERS."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXIX.
                  THE HALIDON DINNER.
                  The guests gathered at Halidon on Mr. Grippe's annual day early in September.
                     The house was formally handed over to a certain major-domo from London, who had
                     arrived the day before with a large following of cooks and waiters. The
                     banker's system was wise. He furnished this dignity with a list of the company
                     as soon as his invitations were accepted, and a statement of the condition of
                     larder and cellar. He was expected to provide a feast, and was not limited in
                     his outlays. Mr. Dipperly felt his responsibility. His character was at stake,
                     and he was equal to the emergency. There were occasions upon which the honor of
                     England was committed to his hands, when some noble lord in official position
                     dined a foreign Excellency at his club and gave Dipperly no word of instruction
                     except to "provide becomingly." But the caterer really dreaded the Halidon
                     dinner far more than any London entertainment, because Mr. Grippe was emphatic
                     in his anteprandial orders to spare no expense, and extremely irritating in his
                     postprandial examination of "hitems," as Mr. Dipperly called his list of
                     outlays. And each year as Dipperly returned to London (in a smoking-carriage,
                        where he tried various brands of
                     cigars that Mr. Grippe had provided for his guests), he assured himself that
                     the ten-pound note he received from the banker hardly paid for the worry of
                     settlements for his vicarious expenditures. "Hitems" were his abomination, and
                     they were Mr. Grippe's delight.
                  Helose was presented to each guest as "Mademoiselle, my adopted daughter," and
                     a brief apology offered for her lack of English; and then in the same sentence
                     Mabel was introduced as "her friend, Miss Grahame." The girls were dressed
                     alike, Mr. Grippe having, astounded Mabel on the same morning by presenting her
                     dress with a rapid enumeration of his reasons for wishing them similarly
                     attired, and beating back a torrent of objections by falling suddenly into a
                     fit of asthma that threatened his life. Mabel fluttered around him, horrified
                     at his evident agony, and strangled with the fumes of stramonium, until he
                     gasped out, "My dear, if you don't wish me to die, run away to your room! We
                     can discuss this matter to-morrow." And as soon as the gentle girl left him,
                     the banker recovered sufficiently to drive to Gloucester, where he remained
                     until it was time to dress for dinner. Mabel spent the intervening time in
                     writing to her father about the gift, and in meditating upon the kindness and
                     effrontery of the donor. It may as well be noted here that the return mail
                     brought an answer from the Reverend Edward, in which he derided her scruples
                     and called her a goose. It is also as well to note that this was a pious fraud,
                     as Mr. Grahame really objected as much as his daughter to this gift, which was
                     fully equal to a year's salary.
                  Mr. Grippe offered his arm to Lady Walton, who outranked the rest, being an
                     earl's daughter as well as the wife of a baronet. Sir Henry took Helose down,
                     speaking French like a practised diplomat. Next, by Mr. Grippe's arrangement,
                     Mr. Algernon Walton, aged nineteen, with a stunning necktie, recognising
                     "Cousin Mabel" as a former playmate at Grahame Manor, and as niece of Sir
                     Philip Grahame, M. P., Castleton, Sussex, took that lovely maiden down, turning
                     the gentle dove into a regular lioness for the nonce, and causing sundry young
                     gentlemen to regret that "puppies were not drowned when they were littered"—Mr.
                     Trumpley Wailes, for example, who escorted Miss Merton, the Squire preceding
                     him with Mrs. Wailes. And Mr. Clinton, who followed with Sybil, passed his hand
                     over his great beard and noticed the lack of hirsute adornments on the amiable
                     countenance of the future baronet; and Mr. Radcliffe Merton, arriving a minute
                     late, of course scowled malignantly at the voluble youngster opposite, as he
                     slipped into the vacant seat beside Mr. Thorne.
                  "Ah, Mr. Merton," said Mr. Grippe, "you know the inflexible law of punctuality
                     at Halidon, yet you have transgressed."
                  "Train half-an-hour late, sir," answered Radcliffe. "I came from; London. Glad
                     to see you looking so well, sir. Sir Henry, I bring you a message from Sir
                     Philip Grahame. How d'ye do, my lady? Mrs. Wailes, I promised myself the
                     pleasure of handing you down to dinner. Uncle, did not take my place?"
                  "Yes, Rad. By-the-bye, the lady opposite you is the niece of Sir Philip. Miss
                     Grahame, my nephew, Mr. Radcliffe Merton; and Mr. Clinton next to her."
                  "And my adopted daughter, Mademoiselle Helose," said Mr. Grippe, pointing to
                     Sir Henry's lady. "Grace, Mr. Thorne."
                  There were six or seven devout people at the table, who did not hear a word of
                     Mr. Thorne's grace.
                  First—Mabel.
                  Circumstances conspired to make her very uncomfortable. She felt out of place
                     in her magnificent dress. She had prepared her simple, while muslin that had
                     done service once or twice at Grahame Manor, and did not know how gorgeous she
                     appeared until she looked at Helose in the drawing-room five minutes before
                     dinner. Then she was confused and bewildered when Mr. Trumpley Wailes was
                     presented by the banker, as she had given him another name. Then she was
                     astounded by a remark of Mr. Clinton, who said he was rejoiced to meet her "at
                     last!" with so significant an emphasis. Then she resented the evident
                     attentions bestowed upon the "niece of Sir Philip," which plain Mabel would not
                     have received. Then she was conscious that Algernon, who was an uncouth young
                     cub when she knew him in Sussex, was now quite a man in his own esteem, and
                     that he had fallen over head and ears in love with her, as his admiring looks
                     plainly showed. And the bluff Squire's introduction of his nephew, and the
                     identity of the latter with the "ugly man on the road," were the culminating
                     causes of distraction. Over all her emotions, however, there swept a wave of
                     joyful thankfulness, as the mistake she had made became clearer to her
                     apprehension, and she unconsciously darted an eloquent glance at
                     Wailes—remorseful, deprecating, distressed, and grateful, all at once.
                  Second—Wailes. For he caught the glance and analysed it rapidly. Instead of
                     hearing Mr. Thorne's monotone, he heard the music of the spheres. He closed his
                     eyes piously and revelled in
                     dazzling sunlight shot into his soul out of violet orbs, now hidden under
                     drooping lids.
                  Third—Helose. For she only heard the harsh accents of the curate without
                     understanding the words. And she also caught the swift look of recognition
                     passing from Radcliffe's feline eyes, once when he saw Mabel, and again when he
                     saw her; and the first pangs of jealousy entered her bosom, while she mentally
                     deplored her stupidity in making Mabel so attractive. For the dress was ordered
                     by Helose, who had resorted to various pretexts to get possession of an old
                     dress of Mabel's to send to Paris, ensuring the fit of the new one. It was not
                     the dress, though, that attracted Radcliffe.
                  Fourth—Radcliffe. Here was a nice business: a three-cornered war, with a
                     charming damsel at each point of the triangle—Helose, Sybil, Mabel. Was ever
                     man so unlucky? Sybil had been set apart for him from infancy, though there had
                     never been any love-passages between them. Helose—ah! he had written some
                     infernal nonsense to her in Paris. But she would have a lot of tin when Grippe
                     died. But Mabel, with the heavenly eyes and the look of thinly-disguised
                     repugnance that shot from them! So far from repelling him, that glance made him
                     more determined, and there floated through his vacillating mind half-a-dozen
                     crude schemes by which he hoped to win her.
                  Fifth—the Squire. Opposite to him was a mirror, and in it he saw reflected Mr.
                     Dipperly, who was tasting the soup which a waiter held up in the hall behind
                     him. The door was ajar, and the Squire could see Mr. Dipperly, who was adding a
                     little salt, with his head very much on one side. Mr. Merton thrust his napkin
                     into his mouth to repress a guffaw.
                  Sixth—Mrs. Wailes. She knew Mabel. The darling! She saw the cold aversion in
                     her eyes as she returned Radcliffe's courteous bow. She saw Clinton's steadfast
                     scrutiny of the late-comer, sedate and hostile. Mischief Brewing!
                  Seventh—Miss Merton. Her eye was in the corner, and she also saw Mr. Dipperly,
                     and detected an astounding resemblance in him to a cock-sparrow with its head
                     on one side inspecting a doubtful worm.
                  As the dinner progressed everybody became more comfortable. Algernon, in spite
                     of his manhood, retained his boyish appetite, and was speedily engrossed in the
                     discussion of dainties. Clinton seemed intent upon French, lugging in French
                     phrases so constantly that his English appeared to get broken. He sat between
                     Sybil and Mabel, and addressed an occasional remark to the latter touching the
                     rarity of the Beechwood flowers, the convenient walking distance from Halidon,
                     and at last with an innocent manner, though he had been artfully leading up to
                     the point, hoped that she and Mademoiselle would renew their visit, "now that
                     they were conventionally on speaking terms." And before Mabel could answers, he
                     suddenly asked her if there was not a "South Terrace" at Halidon.
                  "I will ask you to show me the terrace, Miss Grahame," he said; "I have heard
                     of it, and have a strong curiosity to see it."
                  "The library opens upon it," she answered.
                  "Ah! Well, you will have to show me the library. But the chambers above—are
                     they occupied?"
                  "No. They are furnished and ready for occupation, but I believe they have not
                     been used for many years."
                  "There is certainly some peculiarity about Gloucestershire," observed Mr.
                     Clinton, turning to Sybil, "and it affects the houses. When I took Beechwood,
                     there were certain chambers and corridors, that were like Blue Beard's halls. I
                     was quite bewildered for a week, trying to remember what doors to avoid."
                  "Have you learned your limitations yet?" said Sybil.
                  "Ma foi! yes. I have cut the Gordian knot by
                     exploring every nook and corner of the house; and when you ladies visit me,
                     which I have hope will be shortly, I intend to take you all over the
                     mansion."
                  "And your ghosts?" said Mrs. Wailes, who overheard his last remark.
                  "They are laid, Madam. But I intend you to hear the story first, and therefore
                     will say nothing about them now."
                  "This is extraordinary claret, Mr. Grippe," said the Squire. "I retain the
                     memory of it from, one September to another. I hope you have a good supply of
                     it."
                  "Yes. I got it the year I bought Halidon. But it does not see the light except
                     on the rare occasions when you dine with me. Maguire restricts my potations to
                     bitter beer."
                  "When you retire," said Clinton to Mabel, in a low tone, "these men will stay
                     here imbibing. May I come to you in the drawing-room?"
                  She looked at him, surprised at the question.
                  "Do not looked so shocked," he said, laughing. "I am not a drinker; like Mr.
                     Grippe, my potations are confined to beer. But when you depart, they will bring
                     on some Burgundy, and while they are stunned by its exquisite aroma, I can
                     easily slip out. I have a word to say to you—important to you and to—another,
                     and you will have to listen. Miss
                     Sybil, what is the rule when the Burgundy comes?"
                  "One glass to each lady; then you are expected to open the door for our
                     departure, and to express great regret—"
                  "It is only au revoir, however. How shall I
                     know when it comes?"
                  "Oh, Mr. Grippe will call for it—'Maison Rouge!'"
                  "Ha!" said Clinton, with a start, "Maison Rouge!"
                  "What is the latest sensation in London, Radcliffe?" said Lady Walton.
                  "Nothing, my lady; London is a Sahara. There was not a living soul left this
                     morning. Sir Phillip, who has been detained on Parliamentary business, went to
                     Sussex last night."
                  "And the town is totally deserted!" said Mr. Grippe. "Yet I had several letters
                     this morning from correspondents who expected replies to be sent there."
                  "Oh yes," said Radcliffe, unabashed; "I did not mean the city people.
                     By-the-bye, Mr. Grippe, London is agog with a new enterprise, in which
                     everybody is taking shares."
                  "Indeed! A new railway, I presume?"
                  "No; a mine—a Yankee mine—and for a wonder it seems to be an honest investment.
                     Sir Philip is a director, I think, or going to be."
                  "Dipperly, bring the Maison Rouge," said the banker. "Ladies, I have reserved
                     the toast for this wine. Mr. Merton assures me that I may violate the doctor's
                     orders with impunity, and I venture upon one glass to drink your health. 'The
                     Ladies,' gentleman, in a bumper of Red Burgundy!"
                  And amid the clatter of glasses Miss Merton, Mrs. Wailes and Lady Walton nodded
                     to one another and to Helose, and a rustle of silks announced the simultaneous
                     movement of the better half of the goodly company as they swept out of the
                     room; and while Clinton and Wailes stood at the door as the silks swept
                     through, they both overheard the question and answer:—
                  "What is the name of the mine, Rad?"
                  "Dorado, sir. And it's a stunner!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXX.
                  THE SOUTH TERRACE.
                  The gentleman resumed their seats after the departure of the ladies, and
                     renewed their devotions to Maison Rouge—that is, those of them who had merely
                     risen as the ladies retired. Clinton and Wailes were both meditating an escape
                     to the drawing-room, and the former eagerly inquired of Wailes as to the proper
                     mode of retreat.
                  "You know, Wailes," he said, "neither of us wants any wine, but I am not
                     certain about the proprieties. Would it do for a fellow just to slip out
                     without apology?"
                  "But there are two fellows who would like to slip. Suppose you wait here, and I
                     will go ask Mother about it."
                  "And how soon will you bring her reply, you old deceiver? No, sir; I shall go
                     and ask Miss Sybil. Would you mind saying, if they ask for me, that I have a
                     splitting headache, or something of the sort?"
                  "Yes; I think I must decline. But you may go; they are all talking about that
                     Dorado Mine, and will not miss you. I shall privately ask Mr. Grippe to let me
                     follow you. Now is your opportunity—away with you!"
                  As Clinton promptly obeyed, flitting through the door like a ghost, Trumpley
                     slipped into the vacant seat next the banker. At the same moment James
                     approached with a note for his master. As he tore open the envelope, Wailes saw
                     that it was a telegram. Mr. Grippe read it twice, and bidding James order the
                     carriage, arose from the table.
                  "Squire," he said, "please take my seat and maintain order until I return.
                     Gentleman, you will excuse me a few minutes; I have just received a telegram
                     that requires immediate attention. Squire, you are lord of Halidon in my
                     absence; see that your guests lack nothing. Mr. Wailes, please lend me your
                     arm." And supported by the stalwart youth, Mr. Grippe hobbled out—not through
                     the door that led to the drawing-room, alas! but by a side-passage into the
                     library.
                  A light suspended from the ceiling lighted the spacious apartment, aided
                     somewhat by the moonlight streaming in at the bay-window. Mr. Grippe fell into
                     his arm-chair, and reposing his lame leg upon the stool that stood within
                     reach, began to strangle in a paroxysm of asthma. Trump stood by not knowing what to do,
                     and wondering if the old gentleman would live through the spasm.
                  "Shall I ring, sir?" said he at last.
                  Mr. Grippe nodded his head; he was past speaking, apparently. James appeared in
                     a minute.
                  "James," gasped the banker, "put a shawl and rug in the carriage. When it is
                     ready, come tell me. Get a lot of cigars from Dipperly—a dozen at least. Bring
                     them at once."
                  When the cigars came Mr. Grippe pushed the salver over to Wailes.
                  "Light one, please," he said, "and put the rest in your pocket. Here is a
                     match. Now let me light a cigarette. You must smoke to drown the odor of my
                     stramonium."
                  While they blew two rival clouds, Mr. Grippe meditated profoundly, glancing at
                     Wailes with sharp eyes now and again, as if to assure himself that he was doing
                     his share of the smoking.
                  "Have you any money?" he asked, suddenly.
                  "Yes, sir—a pound or two."
                  "It is very rude in me, Mr. Wailes," said Grippe, "to take you away from the
                     table; you got no Maison Rouge either."
                  "Yes I did, sir; I drank the ladies' health. The wine is incomparable. But I
                     was just going to ask you to let me slip out to the ladies, when you received
                     your telegram. I hope it is nothing serious?"
                  "Very serious."
                  "Indeed! Can I be of any service?"
                  "Read it and judge for yourself," said Mr. Grippe, handing the despatch. Trump
                     unfolded it, and read:—
                  "From Harding, London, to Anthony Grippe, Esq., Gloucester. B and Z are the men
                     beyond a doubt. If you are in, get out."
                  "Do you know what it means?" said the banker.
                  "No, sir. Who is Harding?"
                  "A detective. Have you any idea who B and Z are?"
                  Wailes paused, while a multitude of thoughts rushed through his mind. Mr.
                     Grippe watched him, his eyes twinkling.
                  "Can it be Blauvelt and Zimmermann, the Berlin bankers?" said Wailes. Mr.
                     Grippe's eyes still twinkled, and Wailes went on rapidly, "I believe I see it
                     all. These men have been forging bills! And you remitted them fifteen thousand
                     pounds to-day! I wrote the letter in German. What must I do, sir?"
                  "Take the limited mail at eleven-thirty; go to Berlin and see what you can do.
                     They have the advantage of one mail, and the bills will be drawn no doubt; but
                     something may turn up. I will give you credentials to Von Kapf. Here are fifty
                     pounds in bank-notes. Now understand the case. I dare not telegraph Von Kapf,
                     lest these fellows should have sent genuine bills after all. I cannot tell
                     certainly until the day after to-morrow, when they will be paid or rejected. I
                     will telegraph you at Berlin on Thursday morning, care of Von Kapf. I am
                        sure it is a fraud, but cannot so treat it until Thursday. I
                     have no instructions to give you. Act as you would act if your own money were
                     at stake; be cool, cautions, watchful and prompt. If the money is lost, it is
                     lost; if it is saved, it will be by your pluck and energy. Stop in Paris and
                     see Delisle. Do you know his address?"
                  "Yes, sir—Sixty-four, Rue Scribe."
                  "Right. Tell him everything; he may help you. Anyhow, he is a correspondent of
                     Blauvelt and Zimmermann. Whatever rascality has been perpetrated, you may
                     safely attribute it to Blauvelt. Zimmermann is a stupid, honest German. I am
                     not sure about Blauvelt, but think he is a Belgain."
                  "Ha!" said Wailes. "Have you seen him, sir?"
                  "Many times."
                  "Is he a tall, sallow man, with a heavy moustache, black, hanging over his
                     mouth, and nearly covering his chin?"
                  "You describe him exactly."
                  "I know him. Ah, Mr. Blauvelt, you have taken to banking then! He is a Belgian,
                     sir. He was my French tutor in Germany."
                  Mr. Grippe took two cards from his pocket, and wrote on the backs: "Credit Mr.
                     Wailes, the bearer.—A. Grippe," and gave them to Trumpley.
                  "One for Von Kapf, the other for Delisle; they will answer your purpose better
                     than formal letters. And now what will you do about clothes? You can't go
                     flying over Europe in a dress suit, and my clothes will not fit you."
                  "I have a portmanteau at Beechwood; I dressed there this afternoon. I will stop
                     there, change my dress, and go on to Gloucester. It is ten o'clock. I will just
                     tell Mother—"
                  "Stop; I'll go for Mrs. Wailes. Those charming ladies would chatter like a
                     thousand magpies if they knew of your departure. I'll bring Mrs. Wailes here.
                     Wait for me."
                  And taking his cane, Mr. Grippe hobbled out. Wailes walked over to the
                     bay-window and looked out upon the South Terrace. The moonlight was deluging
                     the lawn and terrace, "and turning all nature into fairyland. The banker was absent five minutes; it seemed to
                     Wailes five years. When he returned, accompanied by Mrs. Wailes, Trumpley
                     looked at them in stupid bewilderment.
                  "Madam," said Mr. Grippe, "very urgent business calls your son away. He must go
                     to London, to Paris, and perhaps further. There is no one else whom I could
                     trust to manage the affair. He will go to-night. The mission is quite secret,
                     and I expect to get him quietly away without disturbing my guests."
                  "Very well, sir. Are you ready, Trump?"
                  "Yes," said Wailes, with dull indifference.
                  "What the devil has come over the man!" said Grippe, viciously. "I left him but
                     now full of fire and energy—"
                  "Carriage ready, sir," said James, poking his head in at the door.
                  "Drive round to the terrace. Are you unwell, Mr. Wailes?"
                  "No, sir," answered Trump. "Please excuse me; I have been dreaming, and was
                     wakened suddenly. I shall be all right when I get out in the air. Good-night,
                     Mother. I will do my best, sir. I am quite ready."
                  "Away with you then; I will make your excuses. Go out at this door. Here is the
                     carriage. James, go with him—to Beechwood first, and then to Gloucester. Mr.
                     Wailes wishes to catch the midnight train,—or rather the eleven-thirty. Do not
                     loiter."
                  Trump kissed his mother, shook hands with the banker, and went out on the
                     terrace. As he laid his hand on the door of the carriage, Clinton stood
                     suddenly at his side.
                  "Wailes," he said, "it is you then who are going. I saw James putting the rug
                     into the carriage, and that indicates a journey. May I ask where you are
                     going?"
                  "Certainly. To London."
                  "And beyond?"
                  "Perhaps. Why do you ask?"
                  "Because I feel a strong interest in you—stronger than ever before. Do not
                     repulse me, I beg of you. You are going to Beechwood first?"
                  "Yes,—to change my dress."
                  "Grant me one favor. Will you?"
                  "If I can," said Wailes, struggling to maintain his composure. "What is
                     it?"
                  "You will find a revolver on the dressing table in your room. Take it with
                     you."
                  "Pish!" said Trump, impatiently. "What can I want with weapons?"
                  "Take it, I tell you!" said Clinton, stamping on the gravel. "You
                     promised."
                  "Very well; good-night," and springing past him he entered the carriage,
                     pulling the door to after him.
                  Poor Trump! While he was gazing out of the bay-window he saw Clinton and Mabel
                     on the South Terrace. They were in earnest conversation; and while the door
                     that admitted his mother and Mr. Grippe was turning on its hinges he saw
                     Clinton seize Mabel's hand and hide it in his great beard, she not resisting.
                     He could see their faces; hers eager and excited, and his full of exultation,
                     while he covered her hand with kisses.
                  And while the carriage spend on towards Gloucester he tried to shut out the
                     scene by closing his eyes. The hedge-rows that were flying past
                        were shut out, but the terrace and the two agitated figures
                     upon it burned his eye-balls.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXXI.
                  ANOTHER DEPARTURE.
                  Mr. Radcliffe Merton was equal to most emergencies, but his powers were
                     certainly put to the proof at Mr. Grippe's entertainment. He was eager to be
                     present because he was certain to see Mabel; Tim had tracked her to Halidon
                     beyond doubt. He expected to make an easy conquest. She was a governess or
                     companion, and the attentions of the heir to Merton Park could not fail to
                     flatter her vanity and awaken her gratitude. When he was fairly confronted by
                     this governess, clad in rich silks, and evidently honored as the niece of Sir
                     Phillip Grahame, he felt rather less secure. And when her pleasant countenance,
                     beautified by smiles, settled into cold gravity at his introduction, while her
                     delicate nostrils assumed a more decided curve, he concluded to omit the
                        veni vidi vici form of assault and proceed
                     circumspectly.
                  What should he do with Helose? No doubt about her recognition. Why, court her
                     furiously, of course. This would give him constant access to Halidon, the cage
                     that contained these two pretty birds; and he would find or make opportunities
                     for his true courtship. As he stole furtive glances at Mabel during the
                     progress of the dinner, he found the desire to win her growing into a
                        determination, and when the
                     ladies retired from the dining-room he registered a vow that he would kill any
                     man who stood between him and Mabel.
                  And Sybil—what about Sybil? Well, she seemed to be very much entertained and
                     quite contented with the attentions of that Yankee fellow with the big beard.
                     The Yankee seemed to be spoony too. What at ugly devil he was!
                  The Squire was eager for whist, and moved adjournment to the drawing-room
                     pretty soon after Mr. Grippe left the table. Radcliffe had not quite finished
                     his cigar; he would take a turn on the lawn, and join the ladies in a few
                     minutes. That Maison Rouge was insidious, and a turn or two would dispel its
                     influence.
                  Rather cool in that Yankee fellow, with his lot of vulgar tin, and his loudly
                     airs at Beechwood, to be so impressive in his devotion to Sybil. Stole the tin,
                     no doubt. What did Sir Henry know about him? He did not seem to think Mr.
                     Radcliffe Merton worthy of any special attention either. Curse his impudence!
                     he looked as grave and sedate as a judge, and had not the ghost of a smile for
                     Radcliffe's best jokes. He had met him somewhere, certainly; must have been
                     long ago. Clinton? Never heard that name. But a Yankee could have a dozen
                     names. There was that Gttingen Yankee. Ah! Stratton. Of course! the very
                     same.
                  Oh oh! Mr. Trump, you knew Stratton, and you have not told me. You are very
                     thick; close friends, I hear. I begin to think you will bear watching, Mr.
                     Trump. And talking of watching, there is Mr. Trump on the terrace. Not alone—I
                     see the lavender silk. Can it be the French girl? Mabel!
                  He moved away from the house, threw his cigar in the grass, and passing behind
                     a clump of rose-bushes, he had a better view of the terrace. Mabel certainly;
                     and not Trump, but Stratton, kissing her hand as if he would eat it up!
                  Hist! here comes the carriage. What is up now? Mabel disappeared. Wailes at the
                     carriage, and Stratton beside him. Carriage off, and terrace deserted. He would
                     go in and see what it meant. Now, be cautious!
                  The whist-table; the Squire and Lady Walton against Mr. Grippe and Mr. Thorne.
                     Sir Henry seated by Sybil; Algernon playing backgammon with Miss Lucy. The
                     Beechwood magnate at the piano with Helose, actually playing a duetto with her.
                     That was another proof; Stratton was quite a famous pianist at Gttingen. Ah! if
                     he had only given that rapier another twist or two. Too late to regret that
                     now; he would find an opportunity to do it over. Meantime time he was devoted
                     to music, and took a seat near the pair of brilliant performers. How they
                     jabbered!
                  "Lentement, Monsieur," said Helose.
                  "Comme ca?"
                  "Oui, merci!" and the duo leaped out under their nimble fingers like a shower
                     of sparks. This required enormous philosophy. The French was easy enough, if
                     they would only talk slowly and distinctly; but they would not. They fairly
                     gallopped, gliding from one word to another as if their tongues were oiled. Oh,
                     if he had only emulated Trump's diligence and attended to Blauvelt's
                     instructions!
                  Blauvelt! By-the-bye, he would bear watching too. Mem.: attend to Blauvelt
                     to-morrow. Here comes Mrs. Wailes.
                  "Mr. Grippe," said that lady, "Miss Grahame has charged me with apologies and
                     regrets to you and your guests. She sprained her ankle in stepping from the
                     South Terrace. I happened to be in the library, and assisted her up-stairs, and
                     by virtue of my superior age I obliged her to go to bed. I have applied the
                     proper remedies, and she does not suffer."
                  "Oh! Ah! Indeed! Very sorry, I am sure. Excuse her?—certainly," said
                     everybody.
                  "Ma belle! In pain?" said Helose, starting up from the piano. "I will go to
                     her."
                  "She also charged me to forbid you, Mademoiselle. She will sleep presently.
                     Besides, I am going back to her to tell her how kindly you all excuse her, and
                     to bid her good-night."
                  "Tim!" said Mr. Radcliffe, leaning from the window. "Tim! are you there?"
                  "Yessir."
                  "Can you bring the cart in a minute?"
                  "Half a minute, sir."
                  "Mr. Grippe," said Radcliffe, "the rosy hours had glided away so swiftly that I
                     did not mark their flight. I am obliged to be in London to-morrow. May I call
                     on my return, and make the acquaintance of these charming ladies?"
                  "Halidon gates are always open to you, Mr. Merton," said the banker, with a
                     bow. "But you cannot get the train; it passes at eleven-thirty."
                  "Yes; and it is now fifteen minutes earlier, and my trap is at the door. I
                     shall have two minutes to spare. Ladies and gentlemen, the railway officials
                     allow no time for parting speeches—good-night!"
                  And as the dog-cart came up the drive he sprang into the seat, gathered up the reins, trotted gently through
                     the lodge-gates, and then sped along the highroad at the rate of twenty miles
                     to the hour.
                  At Beechwood Mr. Merton encountered a wreck. A hind-wheel was on the road side,
                     and Mr. Grippe's carriage drawn out of the roadway and squatted ungracefully in
                     the gutter. James was busy with the horses, and the coachman was prowling over
                     the road in earnest search.
                  "Hillo!" said Radcliffe, half-checking his horses, "what is amiss?"
                  "Wheel hoff," said the coachman; "linch-pin lost."
                  "Get a stake, fasten it to the front axle, and support the hind one. You can
                     get home that way. G'long, Maggie!"
                  Beyond the bend of the road a pedestrian, smoking a short pipe.
                  "Hillo, Podd!" said Radcliffe, "what are you about?"
                  "Looking for the linch-pin," answered Podd, with a grin. "Carriage broken down
                     just as he came out of the gate."
                  "He? Whom?"
                  "Wailes. He just rolled out, snatched up his pock-mantle, and tore up the road.
                     Two mile to Gloster—ho, ho!"
                  "G'long, Maggie! he'll miss the train."
                  "Miss the dickens!" said Podd, savagely, as the dog-cart spun away. "I s'pose
                     you'll pick him up. You're a nice pair of 'ristocrats! I'd like to take out one
                     of your linch-pins too!"
                  Mr. Podd turned back and found Memnon attaching a beam to the axle. The
                     carriage could be gotten home now; and because the urgency was over, the
                     gardener happened to stumble upon the lost linch-pin. The wheel was replaced,
                     and after a moment's consultation, James clambered up on the box, and the
                     carriage proceeded at a rapid rate towards Gloucester.
                  "The fools!" said Podd. "I hear the train now, crossing the bridge at Merton's
                     Brook. Do they s'pose that fiery young devil will wait for them? I'll sit down
                     here and wait for them to come back, and get a lift as far as old Grippe's. Ho!
                     darkey! are you there?"
                  "I'se here, Podd," answered Memnon, soberly.
                  "Lucky I found that pin."
                  "Werry lucky. I spec you knew whar to hunt."
                  "What?" said Podd, startled.
                  "I see some po' white trashed pulled out dat pin while gemplen in de house
                     gittin his trunk."
                  "How did you get that fool's notion into your head?"
                  "Werry easy. Part ob it come in froo my eyes. I seed you in de road when
                     carriage come fust."
                  "Well," said Podd, feeling slightly uneasy, "what of it?"
                  "Den I seed you lookin' for inch pin up de road. You not werry drunk, and you
                     knowed de carriage not bin up de road at all. Den you found de pin in gully on
                     dis side. De wheel come from de off side; how de debil did linch-pin git ober
                     heah? Did him crawl?"
                  "I've a good mind to knock your black head off!" said Podd, in a rage.
                  Spec you'd better not, Podd," replied Memnon.
                  "Why should I not?" said Podd, menacingly.
                  "Because I'll mash your mouf if you comes close enough for my first; and if you
                     was spy enough to handle me—only you aint—why den Mars Clint would hab you
                     hung. Spec you'll git hung soon enough, anyhow. Better go home now; you'se a
                     little drunk. Heah comes the carriage back. Spec you'd better walk. Driver
                     won't gib you ride, I reckon; you aint werry clean."
                  The carriage swept by at a good pace. The coachman had gotten near enough to
                     Gloucester to see the London train flying down the road. Memnon shouldered his
                     beam and retired within the gates, closing them inhospitably behind him. And
                     Mr. Podd, chewing the stump of his pipe, and the cud of sweet and better
                     fancies, crawled slowly down the road towards Merton, so glum and ugly that the
                     moonlight, which beautified everything else, only served to make his ugliness
                     more apparent.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXXII.
                  ASTHMATIC.
                  Mabel stood in the shadow when Trumpley passed across the Terrace, and Clinton
                     left her side to address a few words to him, as already recorded. The door
                     stood open, and thinking she would go to her room and compose her mind before
                     she encountered the drawing-room lights, she stepped upon the skill; her foot
                     turned, and she fell forward into the library. When she attempted to rise she
                     found herself unable to walk without assistance. As she sunk into a chair with
                     a moan, Mrs. Wailes re-entered the apartment, intending to say a parting word
                     to Trump about taking care of his precious health, avoiding draughts, damp beds
                     and the like. The sight of Mabel arrested her.
                  
                  "Miss Grahame!" she said, approaching her, "you are in pain. Are you ill?"
                  "I think I have sprained my ankle, madam. Pray, do not mind me; it will be
                     better presently, and I can get up stairs."
                  "Let me help you, my dear," said Mrs. Wailes; "lean on me. Is this the stair? I
                     am so glad I found you. Does it pain?"
                  "Yes, ma'am. But I do not heed that; I suffer more in the memory of my—"
                  "Hush! Is this your room? Ah! it is next my bed-chamber. My dear, for more than
                     twenty years that was my domain; it is the large room over the South Terrace.
                     Now lie down here and let me see how badly you are hurt."
                  "Oh, madam, I cannot bear this kindness! Only let me explain my conduct—"
                  Mrs. Wailes laid her hand upon the rosy lips, and when she took it away she
                     kissed them.
                  "My darling," she said tenderly, "you shall not tell me a word. Be satisfied; I
                     am perfectly sure that you can explain everything, but not now. I will listen
                     to your story, or as much of it as you please to tell me, at the proper time.
                     Now let me take off your shoe. Ah! swollen a little. Who will answer the bell
                     if I ring?"
                  "Lucy, our little maid. What do you require, madam?"
                  "Only a little ice," said Mrs. Wailes, ringing the bell. "You must be quiet now
                     and obey orders. Lucy, bring me a cup full of pounded ice. I must have this
                     stocking off; that is soon done. I am going to wrap your foot up in ice. If you
                     lie still it will be well in an hour or two. How did you do it?"
                  "My foot turned under me. I—I was looking over my shoulder at the carriage, and
                     missed the step. Oh! Mrs. Wailes—"
                  "Will you be quiet or not?" said Mrs. Wailes, with affected asperity. "Here is
                     the ice. Give me a towel, Lucy; Miss Grahame has hurt her ankle. You will be
                     more comfortable with your dress off, my dear. Lucy, assist Miss Grahame, while
                     I prepare the ice."
                  In five minutes Miss Grahame was propped up snugly on the bed, her foot
                     enveloped in ice, and the pain gone. Then Mrs. Wailes proposed going down to
                     explain her absence. Mabel objected.
                  "I will return, child," she said, laughing. "Do you think I am going to leave
                     you thus? Not I."
                  "You will not let me talk to you," said Mabel, clinging to her neck as she bent
                     over her, "but you cannot keep me from loving you."
                  "You darling!" was the response. "Don't you know that I love you dearly ever
                     since you clung to me so piteously that evening? Do you remember?"
                  "Ah! can I ever forget! My mother died when I was so young that I have only a
                     dim apprehension of her love and tenderness; but when you kissed me that night
                     it all came back again, and you seemed to take all the love and duty that I
                     owed to her."
                  "Wait until I come back and you shall tell me a little. The gay people down
                     stairs will miss you, but they will not miss me. Shall I bring
                     Mademoiselle?"
                  "No, ma'am. Please bid her stay; she has been pining for company so long. Mr.
                     Clinton will take my place as interpreter. Do you know Mr. Clinton?"
                  "Oh yes. He dined with me at Rose Cottage, and I have dined at" Beechwood with
                     him, Trump and I."
                  In the short absence of the elder lady Mabel reflected. How much could she
                     tell? She was so kind that she would be satisfied with a little explanation.
                     She must remember to mention no names. She had been cautioned. Was there ever
                     so lovely a lady—so wise and so good! Here she is again.
                  "Now sit by me, dear madam, and listen to a short explanation. My father told
                     me a long story of old times. He said I would meet in Gloucestershire certain
                     people, and among them he named two, mother and son. I had never been away from
                     him before, except for a few days at a time at my uncle's in Sussex, and he was
                     anxious about me naturally. 'If you encounter this lady and her son,' he said,
                     'either or both, avoid them at all risks. Have no intercourse with them, or
                     either of them.' Oh, madam! I thought the brave gentleman who rescued me from
                     the river was the son, and you the mother!"
                  "And therefore you fled?"
                  "Yes, with my heart bleeding; and I never knew until to-night that I was
                     mistaken. Now, can you forgive me for ingratitude and rudeness
                     unparalleled?"
                  "Poor child! I have never doubted for a moment that some satisfactory reason
                     existed for your flight. How came you to fall into the mistake?"
                  "Will you forgive me if I do not tell you? I am bound to silence."
                  "Say no more, my dear. I believe I know, anyhow."
                  "I hope not," answered Mabel, distressed. "Pray tell me what Mr. Wailes
                     said—"
                  "He said very little, but he walked to Gloucester after you."
                  
                  "Yes," said Mabel, "I saw him coming, and hid on the roadside until he passed.
                     Did he say I was heartless and ungrateful?"
                  "He said, 'Mother, read this note; every word is a tear. I know this lady is
                     under some overbearing compulsion, and I will never rest until I find out what
                     it is.' But neither Trump nor I doubted you a moment."
                  Mabel drew her hand to her and kissed it.
                  "And you will tell him that I have never forgotten for a moment that he saved
                     my life, that I have prayed so earnestly for him, thinking he was wicked—and he
                     so good and noble! Oh, wasted prayers!"
                  "Prayers are never wasted, Mabel. Shall I call you Mabel?"
                  "Dear, dear friend!" replied the girl.
                  "Prayers cannot be wasted. They are among the forces of Nature, and never lost.
                     Sometimes they are misapplied, but they always reach the Hearer; and He directs
                     the force in wisdom and mercy, as He directs the winds. Here is the carriage.
                     My boy is on the train we heard."
                  "Gone!" said Mabel.
                  "Yes. Mr. Grippe has sent him to London, perhaps to Paris, on some important
                     business. Did you know he was in the bank?"
                  "I knew there was a Mr. Wailes," answered Mabel, blushing. "Mr. Grippe has told
                     me a great deal about him, but I never dreamed that it was your son. Mr. Grippe
                     says he is the most extraordinary young man he ever knew. Oh, madam, how happy
                     you ought to be!"
                  "I am not very happy just now," answered Mrs. Wailes, rising, "because it is
                     past midnight, and I must leave you. I hear the Squire's voice, and I go home
                     in his carriage. My love, you are as a dear daughter to me. There shall be
                     nothing between us to separate us henceforth. You will come to me whenever you
                     can, will you not?"
                  "Yes, ma'am, if I may. Before you go, let me tell you something more. I came
                     here in answer to an advertisement. Mr. Grippe brought Helose from Paris, and
                     engaged me as companion, teacher—what you please—at fifty guineas a year. My
                     father is a clergyman in a poor district, with small income and many
                     pensioners, and I wished to earn the fifty guineas for him."
                  "That was very creditable, Mabel."
                  "But, madam," said Mabel, not heeding the interruption, "he brought me this
                     expensive dress to-day, saying he desired me to dress like Helose; and when I
                     expostulated, he was seized with a terrible fit of asthma. Oh, he has it most
                     dreadfully! So I had to wear the dress—"
                  "It is lovely, Mabel."
                  "Yes, ma'am; but I hate the sight of it. I cannot bear to wear it. It is a
                     sham, a pretence. It is equal to the hypocrisy of introducing 'Miss Grahame,
                     the niece of Sir Philip.' Though he did not do that, still it enraged me to
                     find everybody so polite to the silk dress and Sir Philip's niece."
                  "Pride, my dear," said Mrs. Wailes.
                  "Nay, madam; it is only honesty. I cannot afford to wear such attire. It is
                     like borrowing," she added, with a shudder. "Please tell me what to do."
                  "State your case to Mr. Grippe to-morrow," said Mrs. Wailes, amused at her
                     vehemence. "Tell him what you have told me. Do you like him? Is he kind to
                     you?"
                  "Very kind—always kind and considerate. I love him and could not bear to pain
                     him. And he gets a fit of asthma whenever he pleases, and I am really afraid he
                     will strangle sometimes. Helose always runs in horror when a spasm comes. I
                     would pay for the horrid dress, but it must have cost dreadfully."
                  "Why do you object to the gift from Mr. Grippe?" asked Mrs. Wailes.
                  "Gift! How dare he offer me a gift! and so expensive a gift. I don't want
                     gifts."
                  "Very well, Mabel; it will avail nothing to argue with you in your present
                     temper. Don't burn the dress, or cut it up, or give it away, until I see you
                     again. Good-bye, darling."
                  On the following morning Mr. Grippe requested Miss Grahame to grant him an
                     interview in the library after breakfast. There was no necessity for this
                     retirement, as they were quite alone in the breakfast-room, Helose being sound
                     asleep in her chamber; but Mr. Grippe had an idea that there was more solemnity
                     about an "interview in the library" than belonged to ordinary conversation. He
                     led her to a seat, and placing himself opposite, began by asking if she had
                     quite recovered from her accident. He had already made the inquiry at the
                     table, but it was a good introduction, so he did it again.
                  "Quite recovered, I thank you, sir."
                  "You fell, I believe?" said Mr. Grippe.
                  "Yes, sir. My foot turned there at the door."
                  "I hope you did not damage your pretty dress," said the banker, with a little
                     cough.
                  
                  "No, sir; not at all. I wished to speak to you—"
                  "Stop a minute, please! You will not mind a whiff of stramonium? No? I hope I
                     am not going to have a turn—"
                  "Please don't get it until I say a word or two!" said Mabel, eagerly.
                  Mr. Grippe chuckled, but shook his head doubtfully. "My dear, let me say a word
                     or two first. May I talk freely?"
                  "Certainly, sir."
                  "Well, I am an old man, and have not long to live. I shall go off like a whiff
                     of smoke some day. Ah, there comes a turn!"
                  "Oh don't have it, Mr. Grippe! Smoke a cigarette."
                  "Never mind, child; it makes very little difference. There will be very few to
                     lament the death of Old Grippe."
                  "How can you talk in that way, sir!"
                  "Well, I thought you might have some kind feeling for a desolate old man. But
                     no! you don't care enough for him to accept a gift that cost a few pounds,
                     though you know how deeply your refusal wounds me."
                  "But, Mr. Grippe—"
                  "Stop, child! Why should not Helose object to her dress? It is exactly like
                     yours."
                  "It is quite proper for your adopted daughter to take any present you offer;
                     but you humiliate me when you give me this costly present."
                  "How! Humiliate you! You astonish me."
                  "Because I am poor. I have nothing that accords with this dress. When I quit
                     your service I go back to my father and his poor parishioners. How would this
                     dress look in Blackfriars?"
                  "You shan't go back to Blackfriars! You cannot have everything your own way. I
                     increase your salary; it is fifty guineas and a dress, or as many dresses as I
                     please. I can increase salaries when I please. If you don't take this dress
                     I'll order a trunkfull by to-day's mail. Adopted daughter! I'll adopt you too,
                     and then I'll go off in a fit of asthma, and you and Helose can divide my
                     estate. I'll do it to-day!" and he stumped around the room, coughing and
                     choking.
                  "I'll keep the dress, sir," said Mabel, humbly, "but please don't buy any more.
                     Oh dear, he's going to choke!"
                  "Run away, child!" gasped the sufferer; "I'll soon be better."
                  And while the gentle maiden, conscience-stricken, was reproaching herself for
                     her cruel assault upon the invalid, Mr. Grippe was hobbling around the library,
                     indulging in a diabolical chuckle between the asthmatic spasms that threatened
                     his life. Mabel folded her dress and laid it away for the next party. Mr.
                     Grippe ordered his carriage and drove to Gloucester.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXXIII.
                  THE START.
                  Up to the vision on the South Terrace at Halidon Mr. Wailes had indulged in
                     many cogitations, debating questions of propriety and questions of policy, all
                     referring to his pursuit of Mabel Grahame. It is certain that he would have
                     resolved many doubts and dispelled many illusions by a determined application
                     to the lady herself, had he not been deterred by his knightly sense of
                     propriety. How could he intrude himself upon a lady who was under weighty
                     obligations to him? He could not ask for an interview without seeming to ask
                     for an acknowledgment of this obligation. Again, he had been most palpably
                     shunned by the lady—once, certainly, and perhaps two or three times. At the
                     Cathedral it was a positive repulse; at the station when she swept by him it
                     was a clear cut. How could he ignore this repeated rejection?
                  There was another set of cogitations. He never doubted that he was ready to
                     love the maiden; but there were obstacles. With an assured income of four
                     hundred pounds, very comfortable love in a cottage was attainable; but Trump
                     did not believe in love in a cottage; he did not like cottages. And while he
                     very eagerly engaged in his banking apprenticeship, and hoped to rise to higher
                     places and better revenue in time, he could not endure the idea of his wife's
                     assistance in the business of money-making. Even the practice of economy, from
                     which he did not shrink in his own case, was repugnant to him when he
                     contemplated the matrimonial state. Then he had no "expectations" excepting
                     those that referred to his own exertions. The process by which he hoped to
                     augment his resources was a slow process. His entrance upon his career was an
                     astounding, success, altogether exceptional, and the death of Brand, his
                     predecessor, had happened very opportunely to make his position permanent and
                     secure. Mr. Grippe had a disagreeable habit of putting new interests into
                        his charge without warning, and
                     another disagreeable habit of saying nothing to indicate approval or the
                     contrary as he performed his duties. Mr. Choppy, the best paid man in the bank,
                     received a salary of six hundred pounds. Mr. Wailes had decided already that an
                     equal sum, added to his original two hundred, was the least amount of ballast
                     that would warrant his embarkation upon the stormy sea of matrimony.
                  With these convictions upon his mind, there was a constantly recurring and
                     perplexing question disturbing him. Suppose he should get speech of Mabel, and
                     overcome her repugnance and establish friendly relations—what then? Could he
                     make love to her, and entangle her in an indefinite engagement? Never! His
                     mother had a habit in their colloquies of referring to her five hundred as if
                     it were his, and in spite of his sturdy independence he had caught himself once
                     and again adding this sum to his four, with a blissful apprehension of the
                     consequent possibilities. But he always shook off this dream, and always
                     registered a new vow that no inducement would avail to make him depend upon his
                     mother's annuity.
                  The last time he indulged in this interesting arithmetical exercise was during
                     the pronunciation of Mr. Thorne's grace. He had caught Mabel's look a moment
                     before, and it seemed to him that he would accept any conditions that smoothed
                     his way to her side. After dinner he would surely find opportunity to exchange
                     a few sentences—and the ice once broken! She passed through the door while he
                     held it open, and just gave him a look out of the violets; but it was enough to
                     make every drop of blood in his body dance a fandango.
                  Then came the South Terrace; and then chaos.
                  In the midst of his bewilderment, however, there came also two clear
                     convictions. First, that Mr. Clinton possessed the very necessity, sine qua non, the lack of which had hampered
                     himself—money in abundance. He had thought of Mabel always as adorning high
                     station, and there had always been a vague prophecy in his mind that she should
                     be mistress of Halidon. The attainment of money enough to buy Halidon was
                     hardly possible to him, short of a miracle; yet Mr. Grippe got it from less
                     beginnings. Then second, that Mr. Clinton probably deserved her. It was
                     difficult to acknowledge it, but he found that he would readily admit Clinton's
                     fitness for any other damsel of his acquaintance. The American had grown upon
                     him of late, showing so much manliness, generosity, candor, and manifesting
                     constantly an eagerness for his friendship that was certainly flattering. And
                     even at the moment of the shock, when Clinton pressed up to him, and out of
                     anxiety for his welfare and safety urged him to take his weapon, he could not
                     find it in his jealous heart to repulse him.
                  As Mr. Grippe's carriage rolled along the road, he asked himself a hundred
                     times if there could be any mistake about the scene on the terrace. Clinton,
                     vehement, passionate, full of ardor!—this was beyond controversy. Mabel,
                     shrinking a little at first, but as if overcome by the other's impetuous
                     pleading, yielding her hand to him and clearly consenting when he kissed it
                     tenderly. And so the answer always came that these attitudes, still floating
                     before his closed, eyes, could indicate nothing but an ardent love-plea and its
                     success. It was a very sudden business. He saw Mr. Clinton presented as a
                     stranger and so received by Mabel; but there must have been some previous
                     acquaintance. Where, when, how long?
                  Probably Wailes would have suffered more keenly under these disappointments and
                     perplexities had he not been oppressed with the weight of responsibility so
                     suddenly thrust upon him by Mr. Grippe.
                  Starting for what place—London, Paris, Berlin? with fifty pounds in his pocket,
                     on a wild-goose chase! His instructions were, "Go and do what you can"; and
                     there was no conceivable thing to do. A practised rogue had forged drafts for
                     fifteen thousand two hundred pounds—he remembered the exact sum—Grippe had
                     remitted bills on Paris in settlement, and the rogue had one mail—equivalent to
                     one day—the start of him. It was not possible for him to reach Paris before the
                     bills were cashed; and Blauvelt would be too prompt in his movements to wait
                     his arrival. This much might be taken for granted. What next?
                  Blauvelt would bolt.
                  The next thing was to find him, and finding him, to throttle him and force him
                     to disgorge. He remembered his old tutor as a truculent fellow, cold-blooded
                     and remorseless; but the difficulties in his mind all lay between his start and
                     his encounter with the Belgian. He made no provision for the contest, but would
                     wait for the emergency.
                  Arrived at Beechwood, he found Memnon, and getting a candle, changed his dress,
                     repacked his portmanteau, and resumed his seat in the carriage. A few yards
                     from the gate the hind-wheel came off, and after a short search for the
                     linch-pin, Trumpley caught up his portmanteau and hurried up the road. By swift
                     walking, crossing the common, going through byways and lanes, he could catch
                     the train. Half a mile further he found the portmanteau too heavy, and
                     determined to get rid of it. Selecting a spot where the trees grew near the roadside, he dropped it
                     over the hedge, and then sped along the road unincumbered. He made the best
                     time on the last quarter, as he heard the rumble of the approaching train
                     crossing the bridge over Merton's Brook. O that bridge! But he choked down his
                     memories, rushed into the station, secured his ticket, and fell panting into
                     the seat the guard showed him. As the door closed with a bang, he saw Radcliffe
                     Merton pass the window and enter the next compartment, and then, with a
                     preliminary snort, the train glided smoothly out of the station.
                  Limited mail, going forty-five miles an hour. He wound his watch, and noticing
                     that his fellow-voyagers were all smoking, he lighted one of the cigars that
                     Mr. Grippe had forced upon him at starting. Under its soothing influence he
                     became tranquil, and when he threw away the stump, he leaned back upon the
                     cushion and fell asleep.
                  "Reading! Ticket, please! Lunnon? All right, sir! Smoking carriage? Yessir.
                     Next stop? Eton."
                  Falling asleep again after the interruption, yet enough awake to notice the
                     departure of the passengers who had ridden this far with him, and the entrance
                     of another. Then the rasping of a match, the flare, and Mr. Radcliffe Merton's
                     ugly moustache lighted up an instant, and then darkness again. Trumpley slept
                     on, with his eyes open.
                  What in the world was Rad going back to London for? London was a desert. He had
                     left him at the table, and the thought passed through his mind that Rad was
                     taking too much Maison Rouge. He had pushed aside the small glass, and filled
                     his water-goblet with the ruby wine. Trump thought that was in bad taste, and
                     was shocked; and when Grippe called him out, Rad was filling the goblet a
                     second time. He was breathing in a thick, choking style now, something like Mr.
                     Grippe's asthma, puffing away at his cigar too rapidly to "get the good of
                     it."
                  There is a peculiarity about Burgundy. The muddiness of apprehension and other
                     symptoms that follow rapidly when champagne is imbibed, come more slowly after
                     Burgundy. The effects last longer. If one desires to get tipsy thoroughly, and
                     to stay tipsy a good while, Burgundy is the tipple adapted to that end. The
                     better the Burgundy the more pronounced the tipsiness. And Maison Rouge was the
                     best in England. Well-educated topers are unanimous upon these points.
                  Better sleep the night out. In fact Rad had dropped his cigar half smoked, and
                     was snoring in his corner. But Trumpley was wide awake now, and when the guard
                     took their tickets Radcliffe swore at him crossly and fell asleep again. Then
                     came houses and houses, miles of them, and when the train stopped in the gray
                     dawn, Mr. Wailes quietly left his companion to his dreams, and took the tidal
                     train for Dover.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXXIV.
                  CLINTON'S STORY.
                  While Mrs. Wailes was adjusting her wrappings preparatory to the general
                     leave-taking at Halidon, and while Trump was sleeping between Gloucester and
                     Reading, Mr. Clinton approached and begged permission to drive her home.
                  "I have been perplexed to find an excuse, madam," he said ingenuously, "but
                     Providence has helped me. I was most anxious to have an hour's talk with you,
                     but having brought Miss Sybil here I was bound to take her back. The Squire,
                     however, has just informed me that 'Baby' must go in the close carriage. That
                     arrangement would leave Mr. Thorne for me, unless you will consent to go with
                     me and thus add to my burden of obligation."
                  "I will go with great pleasure," said Mrs. Wailes, "and I congratulate you upon
                     your success in hiding your disappointment at the enforced exchange."
                  "What can you mean, Mrs. Wailes?"
                  "I mean your driving me instead of Sybil."
                  "Oh!" said Clinton, reddening, "Miss Sybil is a pleasant companion certainly,
                     and she is teaching me how to drive; but in this instance I am very glad to
                     take you instead. Besides, I am going to drive her to-morrow."
                  "I am not sure that it is prudent in Sybil to give you these frequent lessons,"
                     said Mrs. Wailes, when the ponies were trotting down the road; "she may teach
                     you more than you expect to learn."
                  "Do you mean that I shall fall in love with her?"
                  "Yes."
                  "And why not?" said Clinton.
                  "Because it is thought that Mr. Radcliffe Merton has a prior claim."
                  "Indeed! Did he get it by inheritance?" said Clinton.
                  "Partly, I suppose. He is heir to Merton Park, and I think the Squire intends Sybil for him. This is only
                     gossip, however. I thought it better to warn you before your young affections
                     were hopelessly bestowed."
                  "You are always kind and thoughtful, madam, and I recognise your goodness,
                     though you profess to joke. May I tell you a story?"
                  "Certainly."
                  "Many years ago, when I was quite young, I was sent to Germany to be educated.
                     My uncle, who was my guardian, consigned me to his friend, Dr. Kayser, and I
                     lived most of my German life in his family. He had one daughter, Gretchen, a
                     year or two younger than I. She was always in feeble health, inheriting
                     pulmonary weakness—a pure-minded little maiden, and after we became acquainted
                     we were great friends. I taught her English, and she taught me German. I think
                     we loved each other sincerely, as brother and sister. Flirtation, as a science,
                     is unknown to German girls, and I am sure neither of us ever thought of
                     love-making. I had no kindred, excepting my uncle, or at least I knew of no
                     other, and the affectionate friendship of Gretchen was the bright spot in my
                     life.
                  "After a year or two of preliminary study under Dr. Kayser, I had to go through
                     the University. This was eight miles from the Doctor's house, and I therefore
                     had to separate from these friends and take up my abode in the University town.
                     But once a week I walked to my old home, spending Sunday with Gretchen, and
                     walking back on Monday.
                  "My new companions did not interest me much. They were wild students who did
                     not study, but drank quantities of beer, and quarrelled constantly. As a rule
                     they did not molest me, as I was studious and shy; but there were two young
                     Englishmen at the University, who were civil and obliging, and I became
                     tolerably friendly with them. One of them I liked; from the other I recoiled
                     instinctively. As they were countrymen, they were close friends of course, and
                     they were no more attracted to me than to the German and Swiss students. I
                     could not cultivate the friendship of the man I liked, because he preferred the
                     society of his countryman, whom I disliked; so we had but little
                     intercourse.
                  "You can hardly understand my isolation, unless I enter more into particulars.
                     The students, with few exceptions, were governed by principles entirely new to
                     me. I was from a country where men quickly responded to insult, and where
                     prolonged quarrels were unknown. My idea of righting wrongs was to make the
                     time and place of settlement accord with the time and place of the injury, and
                     to settle with efficient weapons. The Germans quarrelled deliberately, and
                     fought the next night, generally with broad-swords, with their bodies encased
                     in sword-proof wrappings. The object to be attained was to cut a bit from the
                     adversary's nose. The whole business was eminently ridiculous to me; but each
                     student was expected to learn some sword-play, and I took my lessons with the
                     rest. I had no heart in it, however, and made no advances beyond the first easy
                     lessons."
                  "My friend," said Mrs. Wailes, interrupting him, "you do yourself injustice;
                     Trump says you fence like some renowned old sworder—I forget whom."
                  "Ah, yes; but I learned later, and for a purpose," said Clinton, with a grim
                     smile.
                  "Another ground of separation between me and the students was their
                     cold-blooded profaneness. They seemed to think acquiescence in time-honored
                     principles of piety the height of absurdity. They discussed the most sacred and
                     awful mysteries with flippant jests; and though I was probably but little if
                     any better than they in practice, I could not listen to these debates without
                     horror. One of the Englishmen—he whom I disliked—participated in these
                     discussions, and was as pronounced an infidel as any. The other did not join
                     these debating clubs, but he stuck to his friend.
                  "Next to their profane gabble, the thing most distasteful to me was the rude
                     style in which they talked of women. They spoke of them hardly as respectfully
                     as I would speak of my fillies; and in this also they were rivalled by the ugly
                     Englishman. In my country devotion to the sex was genuine and universal, and I
                     really did not know that men of ordinary civilisation who had ever known
                     mothers could hold the theories these fellows professed.
                  "I am coming to the end of my story. One Sunday Gretchen was cold and distant.
                     I asked her to explain the change in her manner, but she declined all
                     explanation, and left me to entertain the old Doctor after the early dinner.
                     Gretchen was the solitary friend I had in the wide world. When the Doctor fell
                     asleep after his pipe was smoked out, I went in search of Gretchen. She was in
                     a little summer-house at the bottom of the garden. I walked softly over the
                     grass, and looking through the lattice-work, I saw the English rascal seated by
                     her side, and she listening with animated countenance to his lying speeches. I
                     retired as softly as I came, and without waiting for adieux walked back to the
                     University.
                  "It was just dark when he came back. Our French tutor was with him, and they
                     were conversing gaily. The Englishman was telling Blauvelt—that was the tutor's
                     name—how he had stolen a march upon
                     me, what lies he had told Gretchen of my profaneness in debate and my low
                     estimate of women. He expressed his own sentiments exactly, and had made
                     Gretchen believe they were mine. I was at the window of my room. I believe now
                     that these villains selected the spot so that I should overhear them; and I
                     rushed down and into the street, struck the Englishman in the face, and
                     demanded a written retraction of his atrocious slanders. Half-a-dozen students
                     were around us in a moment, and before I knew what I was doing I found myself
                     in the fencing-hall, a sword in my hand, and this wretched cur opposed to
                     me.
                  "In a few minutes his sword was through my body, and I was carried to my
                     lodgings unconscious. It was a very serious wound, and weeks elapsed before I
                     was allowed to leave my bed. When I was able to go out I obtained a conveyance
                     and drove to Dr. Kayser's. The poor old man showed me Gretchen's grave, and
                     delivered her last message. 'Tell him the slanderer was revealed to me, and I
                     know my friend to be true and noble. I should like to live to see him again,
                     but it may not be.'
                  "The girl had died of acute pulmonary disease. It may be that my encounter with
                     the Englishman, and the truth concerning him, which she had somehow learned,
                     and her remorse in reflecting upon the connection betwixt her cold reception of
                     me and the quarrel that followed, hastened her death. I do not know, but I have
                     added that to my account against that man.
                  "He had left Germany before I was able to walk. I went to America soon after.
                     Since that time I have set one object before my eyes. I have studied the art of
                     fighting with all known weapons, and with the small-sword I think I am
                     invulnerable. I long for the time to come when he and I can meet once more—for
                     he thinks he is a peerless sworder—and with no possibility of interruption, to
                     try that experiment over again. He forced upon me that former encounter,
                     knowing that I was at his mercy, and he tried to kill me. I have followed him
                     from place to place in the last year, studying his habits and character, and I
                     know him to be dishonest, untruthful and cruel. He is a blot on the surface of
                     society, and I intend to wipe him off."
                  "I am greatly interested, Mr. Clinton, and greatly shocked," said Mrs. Wailes.
                     "Do I know the man?"
                  "Yes, madam."
                  "Who is he?"
                  "Radcliffe Merton."
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXXV.
                  A CHANGE OF PURPOSE.
                  They rode along in silence after Clinton's last announcement. He was so
                     evidently suppressing strong excitement that Mrs. Wailes prudently concluded to
                     give him time to grow calmer before renewing the discourse. She also was
                     greatly moved by his recital, and impressed by the earnestness and candor of
                     his manner. That he was in dead earnest in his hostility she did not doubt, and
                     the prominent thought in the good lady's mind was to prevent these headstrong
                     and passionate boys from doing deadly harm to each other.
                  "You have told me too much, Mr. Clinton," she said at length, "or not
                     enough."
                  "I will answer any question you ask, madam," he replied.
                  "My son was the other Englishman you spoke of?"
                  "Yes. He did not know of the quarrel until it was all over. He came to see me
                     before he left Gttingen, and was kind and considerate."
                  "Why has he not told me that you were acquainted in Germany?"
                  "I requested him to keep my secret. My name is changed, and I did not wish
                     Merton to hear that Stratton was in the neighborhood. I am not quite ready. My
                     uncle's name was Clinton, and his will required me to take his name."
                  "Have you met Radcliffe before?"
                  "I have seen him frequently in Berlin, Paris, London, and Gloucester. He has
                     not seen me until to-night."
                  "Do you think he recognised you?"
                  "Oh yes; I am sure of it. His gentle eyes said plainly, 'I know you.'"
                  "And what did yours reply?" said Mrs. Wailes, laughing in spite of herself.
                  "I think mine said, 'We will try that little passage over again.' That is what
                     I thought."
                  "I must talk to you as I would to Trump; may I?"
                  "Oh, madam, if I could only make you know with what filial reverence I regard
                     you, you would not ask."
                  "Well, then let me tell you first that you are harboring wicked thoughts and
                     purposes. You are a murderer in intent so long as you look forward to another
                     encounter. Even if your anger against Radcliffe cliffe is just, your purpose to wreak your
                     vengeance upon him is infinitely wicked. I am inclined to think that he has
                     grievously injured you, yet you can never punish him except by direct
                     robbery."
                  "You astound me, madam! Robbery!" said he, aghast.
                  "Yes; robbery of God, whose prerogative it is to take vengeance. Have you never
                     been taught that forgiveness is a virtue? Have you never heard of an
                     authoritative law which says 'Thou shall not kill'? I think too well of you not
                     to believe that the accomplishment of your design would fill your life with
                     remorse. How could you sleep with Radcliffe Merton's blood on your hand?"
                  "You do not see my blood on his hand!" answered Clinton,
                     passionately. "You have known him from boyhood, and he has grown up with your
                     son, and all your sympathies are on his side."
                  "That is only partly true. I sympathise with you very heartily. I think
                     Radcliffe has acted wickedly; nay, I fear he is as murderous in his feelings as
                     you are in yours. I also saw the expression in his eyes to-night. It may be
                     that he is even worse than you have painted him; but he is so much the more an
                     object of pity, so much the more entitled to forgiveness. Did you ever think
                     that redemption is something provided for sinners?"
                  "I cannot answer you, Mrs. Wailes," said Clinton, thoughtfully. "I cannot
                     endure the thought of deceiving you; yet I cannot so easily forego this—this
                     vengeance. Indeed there must needs be a perpetual antagonism between us. What
                     should I do if he were to assail me?"
                  "That is not likely to occur. If you avoid him, he will not seek you."
                  "Do not believe it, madam. I am thwarting some of his most cherished schemes. I
                     heard that he was to marry a gentle girl, his cousin. I got Sir Henry Walton to
                     introduce me to the Squire for the express purpose of preventing so horrible an
                     outrage, and I believe I shall succeed. Oh, Mrs. Wailes, would you be willing
                     to see Sybil marry that cur?"
                  "I don't know," said Mrs. Wailes, hesitating. "I have almost concluded that the
                     match would be very unsuitable. They are cousins too."
                  "Alas, yes," said Clinton.
                  "But I object to your complimentary speeches; you should not call Radcliffe a
                     cur. If you indulge in such speeches, and especially if you cultivate the
                     spirit that induces them, you will be certain to come to blows anon. I might
                     not object so strongly to a little fight with nature's weapons, if you
                        must fight; but the deliberated preparation for an encounter
                     with deadly tools is hideous in its wickedness. I cannot understand how men can
                     do it under any provocation. To kill men in the heat of battle in defence of
                     hearthstone and kindred would seem a terrible evil; but to kill without dire
                     necessity, without the excuse of sudden provocation, seems to me awful in
                     conception and consequence."
                  "What would you have me do, madam?" said Clinton, subdued and shaken.
                  "Poor boy!" said Mrs. Wailes, compassionately; "I would have you consider the
                     simple principles of Christianity. No system of ethics that men or angels could
                     invent would so exactly meet all exigencies as the law of universal charity. Is
                     it hard to forgive? then forgiveness is worthy of your manhood. Did you ever
                     hear of one who was forgiven a debt of many talents, yet who refused to forgive
                     a debt of a few pence?"
                  "Yes, ma'am," said Clinton, submissively, "I have heard."
                  "Do you think you can cast out the devil of revenge that has possessed you so
                     long? Who are the people who delight in nursing the memory of wrongs until they
                     are atoned for by blood? Your Spaniard or Italian—the members of nationalities
                     which you hold in contempt. 'Vendetta!' that is the word they boastfully use.
                     Or your wild Indian, scalp hunting—distinguished for nothing so much as for his
                     insatiable thirst for blood. Wherein do you cultivated gentlemen differ from
                     the savage when you confront one another with murderous intent?"
                  "All that you say is wise and good," said Clinton, "but there is a heap of
                     things you don't mention."
                  "Select some from the heap," replied Mrs. Wailes, laughing again, "and let us
                     discuss them."
                  "Well then, if I fail to settle with this—man, he will go scot-free."
                  "How do you know that?"
                  "Why, no one else is acquanited with his record."
                  "I think you are mistaken. I am sure there is One fully acquainted with all his
                     wrongdoing, and who makes allowance for extenuations—such as early training,
                     inherited faults, the force of temptations and the like. And if vengeance must
                     fall upon his guilty head, He has said 'Vengeance is mine: I will repay.'"
                  "If you keep hitting a fellow with arguments of that sort," said Clinton,
                     discontentedly, "there is no use in debating the point. It is very nice and
                     pious to hug Rad Merton, but I'll be—that is—I can't do it!"
                  
                  "What were you going to say you'd be?"
                  "I had almost said I'd be dog-ond," answered Clinton, humbly.
                  "I thought it must be something very bad. Is that American swearing?"
                  "I believe so, ma'am. I learned it from Memnon."
                  Mrs. Wailes had been studying the "Meditations" that morning, and she proceeded
                     with her discourse, quoting liberally, without giving quotation marks.
                  "There can be no doubt," she continued, "that man fights his brother man in
                     obedience to an instinct of his nature. Self-defence cannot be wrong per se, as one is bound to preserve his life, even
                     at the risk of the life of his assailant. And no native instinct can be wrong
                        per se, but must become evil by being
                     deflected from the purpose of its creation. Habits cannot grow into instincts,
                     neither can instincts be formed upon principle. They must be spontaneous, and
                     they are always inherently good and wise.
                  "But all personal contests that proceed upon arrangement betwixt two, as in
                     duels, are both wicked and foolish. They are bad, because they infringe the
                     divine prerogative. None but the Lord of life, or one who represents Him, as
                     the minister of law, can take away human life guiltlessly, with the solitary
                     exception noted when the necessity of self-defence may be pleaded. They are bad
                     also, because they seek to inflict extreme penalty, without perfect knowledge
                     of extenuations that might modify the sentence. Suppose, for example, that the
                     man who has done you serious injury, the most serious you can imagine, has
                     inherited from brutal ancestors brutal proclivities; suppose these inherited
                     tendencies have been strengthened by his life-training, by perpetual evil
                     example, by encouragement from those he reverse the most, and by the total
                     absence of contrary influences: surely there is some allowance due, and pity
                     should modify anger in such a case. If you say the good of society demands the
                     extermination of such a monster, you have not been appointed the slaughterman
                     of society. Of old these officers were appointed by royal authority. They are
                     bad again because the appearance of equality sought to be established by the
                     selection of equal weapons is a mere pretence, as the duellist seeks by
                     diligent practice to perfect himself in the use of the weapon, and expects to
                     conquer by superior skill or strength. Very few men have engaged in duels
                     without some expectation of success based upon their secret consciousness of
                     advantage in training, in nerve, or in something not known to their antagonist.
                     The show of equality is usually a sham, and all shams are wicked.
                  "Or such encounters are especially foolish if there is no advantage, suspected
                     or known; because he who places his own life in jeopardy, relying upon blind
                     chance, is really an atheist or a heathen. The prevalence of law in the wide
                     domain of nature, manifest to any rational observer, must dethrone this idol
                     god chance. And as there are no dual identities in the universe, there cannot
                     be an encounter upon precisely equal terms. Or if the duellist, deeply wronged,
                     tries the combat, as of old relying upon God to defend the right, he makes an
                     appeal to Divine Providence at the very moment that he violates Divine law,
                     which is an absurdity. Or if in obedience to the dictum of a clique or a
                     society he voluntarily faces the weapon of a man more skilful than himself,
                     simply because he is a villain and has injured him, thus inviting death, he is
                     simply a suicide and an ass.
                  "Here then is the conclusion. If you are confident in your skill, your trick of
                     fence, your quick aim or steady hand, you do not give the poor mortal who
                     confronts your weapon an equal chance, and you are a murderer in the eye of
                     Heaven and in the judgment of sound reason.
                  "Or if you think some fortuitous circumstance beyond the control of yourself or
                     your adversary will bring about the result, you are relying upon an agency
                     similar to that which decides the fall of the ball in roulette, and placing
                     your life in jeopardy upon the turn of a die. The assassin who takes his enemy
                     at unawares is more wise and logical than you, and less foolhardy."
                  Clinton was stunned. The previous pious arguments of Mrs. Wailes had made but
                     little impression upon him, but these harsh forms of logic, flowing from her so
                     smoothly and melodiously, and with such evident tenderness of feeling, affected
                     him in spite of his dogged determination. He was conscious of his calm reliance
                     upon extraordinary skill earned by months of patient study and practice, and he
                     felt the blood rushing to his cheek and brow as he thought of the meanness of
                     pretending an equality that he knew did not exist.
                  "I cannot answer you to-night," he said at last. "I have never been talked to
                     in this fashion before; I must think a little."
                  "I will give you a subject for meditation. Try to think of this man as
                     repentant, remorseful, and see if you can feel kindly towards him as you do to
                     others of your acquaintance."
                  The ponies trotted along the smooth road, a mile at least, before Clinton
                     answered. He tried to think of his enemy as repentant, and as he expressed it,
                     humanised, but he was constantly baffled in the effort. There would come into
                     his mind a baleful gleam from the
                     lead-colored eyes that mocked the thought of reformation. He tried to imagine
                     an intercourse with Radcliffe, as with other men with whom he held friendly
                     relations—Wailes for example—and there was something so grotesque in the idea
                     that he laughed aloud.
                  "I can certainly never like Mr. Merton," he said; "I may learn to regard him
                     with indifference perhaps. I think I can forgive the past. It is the
                     relinquishment of a purpose that has colored all my later life. But I cannot
                     resist the appeals you make, and I begin to believe that my purpose was wicked.
                     Do not judge me harshly, I pray you, madam. As I have learned so much of this
                     man's badness, I thought fate—Providence, I mean—had ordained that I should
                     punish him. Perhaps this was presumption; and in my new repentance I am eager
                     to take one step away from all this evil. Therefore take my promise. I will not
                     pursue this man any longer; I will not recall his past history; I will not
                     quarrel with him upon any pretext, unless—"
                  "Unless what?"
                  "Unless he force me, either by some new villainy or by purposely raking up the
                     dead past. Will it content you if I promise to avoid all occasion of offence,
                     and to refuse all invitations to a renewal of our contest, if they should come
                     from him?"
                  "And suppose you cannot escape a conflict?"
                  "Then," said Clinton, slowly, "I promise to spare him. His life would surely be
                     in my hands if he forced me to an encounter with deadly weapons. I seem to see
                     such an encounter, inevitable somewhere in the future; and from this hour I set
                     before my mind the inflexible purpose to spare him. You may trust me."
                  "I do trust you. Give me your hand on it. My friend, you will be all the
                     happier to know how much you comfort me. I have been filled with horror in the
                     contemplation of the evils you have only hinted; but you have set my mind at
                     ease. And now about Sybil."
                  "Sybil!" stammered Clinton.
                  "Yes, Sybil. Suppose she should have sufficient influence with Radcliffe to
                     turn him away from evil, would you interpose any obstacle to so good a
                     work?"
                  "I—I am not sure that I understand you."
                  "But I am sure that you do. If there is any hope for Radcliffe
                     Merton, it is in the constant and controlling influence of a good woman."
                  "Is there no other good woman in the world," said Clinton, "that you must
                     select this poor girl? Besides, I have told her of several of his tricks."
                  "I am ashamed of you, sir!" said Mrs. Wailes, indignantly.
                  "I mean I have told her of the tricks without telling the name of the
                     trickster. I had reserved that. My dear madam, I did it deliberately, because
                     this was the first avenue through which I hoped to damage him; but I will let
                     it end there. I will not tell her who the monster is that I have described to
                     her. Nay, I will not even tell you the ugly details of his last
                     adventures. You see how the purpose to forgive carries with it the desire to
                     condone. Verily I feel more light-hearted and happy than ever before in my
                     life. Can it be possible that my discontent hitherto grew out of my wicked
                     anticipations?"
                  "No doubt," said Mrs. Wailes.
                  "Then the better mood comes from the better purposes?"
                  "Partly. Do I understand you to say you could consent to Sybil's marriage with
                     Radcliffe?"
                  "Oh! Well, ma'am, if she preferred him to all others, yes."
                  "You have flirted a little with her, I suppose. Did you do it merely to thwart
                     Radcliffe?"
                  "I began in that way," answered Clinton, with some hesitation, "but I found
                     Miss Sybil very attractive, and—"
                  "And you flirted pleasantly enough until you met a lovelier face?" Clinton
                     started.
                  "You have gone into the conundrum business again, Mrs. Wailes."
                  "Have I? Well, I mean Miss Grahame. As you could not guess the conundrum, I
                     have told it. I thought you took a very absorbing interest in Miss Grahame
                     to-night."
                  "My dear Mrs. Wailes," said Clinton, "there is no help for it. You will have to
                     listen to another story."
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXXVI.
                  TRAVELLING COMPANIONS.
                  Trumpley had thirty-five minutes to spare at Charing Cross station. He secured
                     a return ticket to Paris, ordered breakfast, and while it was "in cooking,"
                     refreshed himself with a bath. He had slept an hour or two through the night,
                     and as the smoke of London receded and the green fields spread around on either
                     side of his train, flying towards
                     the coast, he felt that returning tide of energy and spirit wherewith happy
                     youth always beats back the assaults of evil fortune. There was a dull pain in
                     his bosom, where a little curl of glossy hair reposed. He had been in the habit
                     of greeting this fragment of humanity with a kiss each morning, and to-day he
                     had neglected this ceremony. There was a vague suspicion in his thought that he
                     had no right to the customary salutation, and therefore he refrained. It may be
                     that the ringlet resented the omission, and by some occult power shot magnetic
                     arrows into the heart of its, former worshipper; or perhaps the pain he felt
                     was the natural penalty of quasi fetichism
                     about to be renounced. He did not throw the tress away; possibly, as he traced
                     his pain to the person of the idol from whom he had stolen it, he might have
                     been deterred by the proverb that ascribes healing virtue to the hair of the
                     foe that inflicts the wound. This, however, is the author's conceit, not
                     Trump's, and the author blushes in suggesting it.
                  Wailes had a retentive memory. Compelling himself to think closely and steadily
                     upon the important business in hand, he remembered certain inaccuracies in the
                     recent correspondence with Blauvelt and Zimmermann which were explained by the
                     impending catastrophe. There had been some bills from that house a week before
                     that had to be returned on account of some informality. He remembered the
                     letter of apology that he had written. By-the-bye, the bills purported to be
                     drawn by Delisle of Paris, and only yesterday there was a queer letter from
                     Delisle asking some questions about bills from Berlin. This letter Mr. Grippe
                     had answered himself, sealing up his reply, so that Trumpley did not see the
                     contents. It looked like Delisle had suspicions too. It was a complicated case
                     altogether, and Mr. Grippe had not "hampered" him with instructions. "Be cool,
                     cautious, watchful and prompt." This was all; and this was enough if he only
                     knew the initial steps.
                  Arrived at Dover, he went aboard the little steamer, while the other
                     passengers, encumbered with luggage, were clamoring on the dock. In due time
                     all was arranged, and the boat started on her twenty miles of rough water. The
                     last passenger leaped on board as the gangway was withdrawn, and came directly
                     to the upper deck, where Wailes was seated. It was Radcliffe.
                  "Hillo, Trump!" said he. "I thought you had missed the train at Gloucester. How
                     the deuce did you manage to catch it?"
                  "By fast walking," answered Wailes.
                  "I drove rapidly when I learned of your mishap on the road, hoping to overtake
                     you. I got the train by the skin of my teeth."
                  "I had the start of you," said Trump. "Are you going to Paris?"
                  "Of course. And you?"
                  "Yes."
                  "Shall you be there long? You must come to the Hotel Meurice. Is it a
                     pleasure-trip you are taking?"
                  Better not tell Rad anything; business secrets are sacred. "I cannot say how
                     long. Hotel Meurice? Oh, no; I am going to Madame Ramor, Rue St. Honor. There
                     is quite a difference in the matter of outlay, you know, and I am practising
                     economy.?"
                  "Talking of economy, do you know that Yankee swell that has taken
                     Beechwood—Clifton, or some such name?"
                  "Clinton. Yes; he brought letters to our bank."
                  "Did you ever know him before?" said Radcliffe, very carelessly.
                  "Yes," replied Wailes; "but he requested me not to refer to the past, so I have
                     not mentioned it even to Mother."
                  Direct honesty, the exact truth; nothing withheld, nothing colored. This sort
                     of answer disarmed Radcliffe.
                  "I recognised him, Trump," said he, "and I have been thinking hard things of
                     you ever since. It is Stratton, curse him! the same Yankee that I spitted at
                     Gttingen. He has been poking about the Continent for a year or two. I found
                     some one was interfering with my plans once or twice, but could not discover
                     him. I understand it now. Has he said anything to you about me?"
                  "Nothing."
                  "Well, we know he is an impostor to a certain extent. He is travelling under
                     false colors; he bears an assumed name. I shall write to Uncle Matt and warn
                     him.'
                  "You are in error," said Trumpley, quietly; "his name has been legally changed.
                     We have the papers at the bank. He is endorsed everywhere by Sir Henry Walton
                     as a gentleman of station, and he is certainly as rich as he pretends to be.
                     Moreover, Rad, your dislike of him is ridiculous, and your suspicions
                     unfounded. I find him a thorough good fellow. Why should you remember that
                     foolish quarrel in Germany? He certainly got the worst of it then."
                  "We will try that over, perhaps," said Radcliffe.
                  "Better not," said Trump, laughing; "he is a master of fence now. I wasted an
                     hour endeavoring to get the better of him only a few weeks ago. If I do not
                     mistake, I rather dressed you at our last encounter; but Clinton
                     was positively invulnerable."
                  "Did he get the better of you?" said Radcliffe.
                  "I don't think he tried. He did not touch me, though. When I get back I may—no,
                     I won't."
                  
                  "Are you going to do any business in Paris?" said Radcliffe, suddenly, after
                     the pause that succeeded Trump's last remark.
                  "I shall probably call on our correspondents there. How this horrible little
                     tub pitches! The poor voyagers below there are getting blue. Let us smoke,
                     Rad."
                  Something wrong about Trump. This is the second time that he evaded the inquiry
                     about business. Does the young jackanapes think himself so important as the
                     representative of Browler Brothers that he cannot answer a civil question? He
                     looks important. What can be up now? It must be something out of the common run
                     of events, or he would be apt to gabble. If he would only get slightly
                     sea-sick, one could pop a sudden question, and he is not able to lie out of a
                     corner. Where in the world did he get these cigars?
                  "Where did you get these cigars, Trump?"
                  "Do you like them?" said Trump, reflecting.
                  "Yes. They are like those Mr. Grippe had last night."
                  "They are the same, I suppose; Mr. Grippe gave me a few. His smoking is
                     confined to some poisonous cigarettes."
                  "Do you correspond with Blauvelt and Zimmermann?"
                  "You mean the bank?" said Trumpley.
                  "Certainly."
                  "Ah, then I cannot answer you. Mr. Grippe has a supply of maxims which he has
                     taught me. Number one is: Never tell anything about your business, no matter
                     how unimportant it may be.' It seems to me that it is a very sensible rule; one
                     never knows."
                  This was pleasant. The young cub is actually delivering a sort of moral lecture
                     to a practised man of the world; and he looks so composed and wise. "One never
                     knows!" That implies the possibility of his interlocutor making a bad use of
                     the information. Is it only his old-fashioned oddity in stickling about trifles
                     for the sake of principle, or is he really suspicious?
                  "Blauvelt of that firm," said Radcliffe, "is our old French tutor."
                  "Indeed?" said Trumpley, indifferently.
                  "Man of first-rate abilities," continued Rad, "but inclined to be sharp, I
                     fancy. There is Calais. Those poor beggars below there are having a jolly time.
                     Look how blue that fellow's gills are. I believe I'll offer him a cigar, just
                     to tantalise him."
                  "For shame, Rad!" said Wailes; "the man is evidently suffering. Let him alone;
                     we are getting into smoother water now. What luggage have you?"
                  "None; at least it is booked for Paris. You have a portmanteau, I suppose. I
                     saw Podd at the scene of your catastrophe, and he said you had lugged it off
                     yourself."
                  "Yes, I did. You see I had to travel rapidly. Rad, we ought to offer our
                     services to some of those feeble women. Come on."
                  "Not I."
                  "Well, I must. There is an old lady with two satchels—come on. You may wait
                     upon the younger one."
                  "Can't do it, Trump. Saw them coming out of second-class carriage. Better not
                     get mixed up with that lot."
                  "Don't be such a selfish old wretch; come on. They are getting ready to land.
                     It is only to help them over the gangway and get them to the train. The young
                     woman is quite pretty. Come on."
                  "You are welcome to them both, Trump; I am going to look for a place in a
                     smoking-carriage. Here goes."
                  While Mr. Merton coolly threaded his way through the crowd of passengers,
                     Wailes took the older woman's satchels, and assisted her across the narrow
                     gangway. Two sharp-eyed French officials stood, one on either side of the
                     landing, but gave them passage. The train was near, and they were soon seated.
                     Radcliffe, who had preceded them, was nowhere visible, and Trumpley took his
                     place in the same carriage with the ladies he had escorted. They were in the
                     second-class compartment.
                  "We go to Boulogne, Monsieur," said the younger, after expressing her thanks in
                     a mixture of German and French.
                  "Ach! yes," said the elder; "we have there to meet my daughter's husband. Does
                     Monsieur know Boulogne?"
                  "I have been there," replied Wailes. "What is the address?"
                  "Monsieur Jules Blauvelt, Hotel du Nord," answered the old lady, reading the
                     address in a letter which she took from her pocket.
                  "Why, that is my friend," thought Trumpley; "possibly I may not have to visit
                     Berlin after all."
                  "Ach!" continued the old lady, reading and translating into French as she
                     proceeded, "'Hotel du Nord, Boulogne; await arrival. Come on Wednesday. Get
                     return tickets.'"
                  "Mother," said the other, in German, "we should not talk."
                  "I speak German," said Wailes quickly in that tongue. "As you ladies are
                     comfortably, seated, I will seek my friend. Boulogne is the first station, I
                     think." So saying, he gathered up his rug and left the carriage, walking along
                     the platform until he found a vacant compartment in a first-class carriage. The
                     guard closed the door behind him.
                  
                  "Is Monsieur alone?" he said.
                  "Yes," said Trump, giving him a franc. "One may smoke here?"
                  "Perfectly," answered the official, and a moment later the train moved out of
                     the station.
                  "This is my third to-day," thought Trump, as he lighted his cigar.
                  "I must economise; Mr. Grippe gave me a dozen, and they are half gone. Ah,
                     Monsieur Blauvelt, what trick are you up to now? Perhaps the solitary smoke
                     will stimulate my thinking powers. I must find some satisfactory solution of
                     this mystery. Shall I go to Berlin or not?"
                  Thinking with enormous vigor, Wailes finished his cigar. Still thinking, he
                     fell asleep. Once the guard wakened him and took his ticket, but he was asleep
                     again in two minutes. Then he saw Mabel, and though the shadows were
                     lengthening over the dreary landscape, he could see the color of her eyes. They
                     were very peculiar eyes—very deep blue. She came nearer to him, and putting her
                     hand, on his shoulder, shook him gently. He started up amazed.
                  "Paris, Monsieur!" said the guard.
                  Still dreaming, and wondering at the twilight, he got out of the carriage and
                     followed the throng passing to the luggage-room. Then he remembered that he had
                     no luggage—yes, a rug. He had left it in the carriage, and must go back.
                     Fortunately he met the guard, to whom he made his mishap known. In a trice the
                     carriage was found, and the rug also. Another stream of passengers passing down
                     the platform, taking their places in an outgoing train. There was Radcliffe,
                     bidding adieu to a tall gentleman with a magnificent moustache. The tall
                     gentleman entered a carriage, and with his hat pulled down over his eyes, his
                     rug on his shoulder, Mr. Wailes followed him and took his place in the same
                     compartment. He had "done" Paris.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXXVII.
                  A TRANSFER.
                  The author hopes Mr. Trumpley Wailes' claim to oddity is established. He had
                     been travelling eighteen hours, eager to reach the world's capital. In his
                     dreams of violet eyes there had been mingled sundry visions of meat and bread
                     and beer; for he was young and full of health, and the prospect of a dinner in
                     the Rue St. Honor was the most enlivening prospect before him when he was
                     hunting the lost rug. That he should suddenly abandon the feast and take the
                     return train for Calais, attracted by a moustache of extraordinary proportions,
                     was certainly an odd procedure. If Radcliffe had seen him he would have thought
                     so; if his present compagnon de voyage had
                     known his thoughts, he would have been certain of the fact.
                  Hunger was gnawing at his vitals. Leaning out the window, he accosted a porter
                     passing down the platform.
                  "My friend," he said, "is it possible to get bread and meat before the train
                     leaves?"
                  "If Monsieur will step to the buffet. There is time."
                  "Alas! I cannot quit my seat; but I will pay five francs for bread, meat, and a
                     bottle of English beer."
                  The porter darted across the rails like an arrow, and returned in two minutes
                     with enough sandwiches to sustain a moderate family a day or two. He extracted
                     the cork from the bottle, which he passed through the window, receiving the
                     promised coin in return. And while the gentle Trumpley demolished the solids
                     and imbibed the beer, the train passed out of the gaslight and into the
                     darkness of the country. Trump threw the empty bottle at a miserable poplar on
                     the roadside ten miles from Paris, and missed it.
                  The gentleman in the other corner lighted a cigarette, and thus encouraged,
                     Wailes lighted a cigar. He felt very placid and comfortable, and he resolved to
                     meditate silently until they passed Amiens. Then it occurred to him that there
                     might be a branch-road at Amiens, and if he made the acquaintance of his
                     companion he had better begin. There was a lamp in the roof of the car,
                     lighting the compartment dimly, but luminous enough to enable Wailes to study
                     the exterior of the quiet figure in the corner.
                  Rather tall, probably six feet; wiry-looking; face sallow; eyes hidden by his
                     hat-brim; a long thin nose, a little hooked, and under it a silken black
                     moustache covering his mouth entirely. He looked very strong and rather wicked.
                     Trump felt his pulses accelerated, and laid his hand on his breast to feel the
                     thumping at his ribs. What is this? Clinton's revolver. He had thrust it into
                     his bosom twenty hours ago, and had not thought of it since, except when he
                     undressed for his bath in London. Somehow his pulses grew calmer when he drew
                     it out and placed it by his side on the cushioned seat.
                  "Mr. Grippe said only two things to me," thought Wailes. "First, he told me to
                     act in this emergency as I would act if the money were my own. Well, it is clear that I should try to
                     reclaim it if I had lost it. Second, he exhorted me to be cool, cautious,
                     watchful and prompt. Well, I feel cool. This murderous little weapon under my
                     hand makes me more than a match for the rascal in the corner. Cautious? By all
                     means! I will select my words most carefully when I open the conversation. How
                     quiet and strong he looks! Watchful? I think I have been reasonably watchful
                     thus far. What are the probabilities? Let me consider.
                  "Blauvelt forged those bills. No use to debate that point. The bill we sent him
                     was payable in Paris and mailed to his Paris agent. He has the money in his
                     pocket without doubt, and my duty is clearly to effect the transfer of the
                     amount he stole to mine. He is going to Boulogne, intending to join his wife,
                     and will probably go thence to Havre and take ship for Clinton's country. Or he
                     may be bold enough to go to London and effect his exchanges there. In either
                     case it would be perilous to let this opportunity slip.
                  "What will he do when I make my demand? Fight? Certainly! Then I must disable
                     him. I will shoot him in the legs when he rises. I shall be arrested of course,
                     but he will be arrested also; and while the trial is pending I can telegraph
                     for Mr. Grippe. Blauvelt cannot get away with the money, at least. What a
                     hornet's nest the rascal will stir up if he loses his temper! I must be careful
                     not to lose mine. If I shoot, I must hit him in the thigh, I suppose; and
                     should that fail, I will put in the second shot a little higher. I wonder if he
                     has any offensive weapons? Very likely.
                  "Prompt? Of course. This is one of those cases where prompt action counts. I
                     saw a couple of gens-d'armes get into the next compartment. If there is any
                     powder burnt in this, they will be in here in a jiffy. I certainly can't miss
                     his legs at this distance. But I did not hit the tree with that bottle; I was
                     not cautious enough. Now for it!
                  "Mr. Blauvelt," he said aloud, "I salute you."
                  "Ma foi!" replied Mr. Blauvelt, "it is ze Odd Tromp!"
                  "Exactly," said Wailes, passing into French. "I hope Monsieur is well."
                  "Very well. I thought you were in Paris."
                  "Ah, Mr. Merton told you. I was on my way to Berlin to visit you, but seeing
                     you enter this carriage, I followed. It was fortunate."
                  Monsieur Blauvelt made a wry face. He looked intently at Wailes, but made no
                     reply.
                  "Mr. Merton no doubt informed Monsieur that I have the honor to represent
                     Messieurs Browler Brothers?"
                  Monsieur Blauvelt maintained a discreet silence. The meat and bread, to say
                     nothing of the beer, had invigorated Mr. Wailes' body, and his mind worked
                     smoothly and rapidly.
                  "There were certain inaccuracies in our later correspondence,
                     Monsieur—especially in yesterday's transactions. Our house remitted yours
                     fifteen thousand two hundred pounds in a bill on Delisle. The bill was mailed
                     to your Paris agent, and should have arrived twelve hours ago. Without doubt,
                     Monsieur has received the bill and obtained the money."
                  Monsieur was not deaf, only dumb. Trumpley continued his address.
                  "If Monsieur secured the money to-day then, it is probable that he has it with
                     him; and having it here, the little transfer I hoped to arrange in Berlin can
                     be arranged immediately. We shall reach Amiens within an hour or two; in the
                     meantime I shall receive the fifteen thousand two hundred pounds from Monsieur,
                     with ten pounds additional for expenses incurred in this journey."
                  Monsieur might as well have been dead, except that his eyes glittered with a
                     gleam that was very life-like.
                  "Because," continued the orator, "I regret to inform Monsieur that the bills he
                     sent us were forged. I beg Monsieur to remain seated; if he should rise, an
                     accident would happen."And Wailes took up the revolver and cocked it. There was
                     a crisp accent in the click of the lock that was impressive.
                  "I thought I would be obliged to injure Monsieur," said Wailes, resuming the
                     thread of his discourse; "and indeed there is but a hair's-breadth between him
                     and a very serious injury now. If I am compelled to fire upon Monsieur, I shall
                     endeavor to disable him without killing him. As Monsieur has known me some
                     years, he will do me the honor to believe me."
                  "What will you have?" said Blauvelt, finding his voice.
                  "Fifteen thousand two hundred and ten pounds, if Monsieur pleases," answered
                     Wailes.
                  "You are mad!" said the Belgian, coldly; "you need not be told that I have no
                     such sum of money upon my person. Men do not travel with such amounts in their
                     pockets. Even if your absurd claim were just, no settlement could be made in a
                     railway carriage. If I were weak enough to be frightened by your bombastic
                     display of a pistol, and should pay money to you under its muzzle, do you not
                     know that such transfer would be illegal? Bah! Put away that toy, and let us
                     discuss the question like men; we are not both boys."
                  
                  "Let us proceed regularly," said Trump, with exquisite politeness, "and I beg
                     Monsieur to pardon any apparent rudeness in my speech. In the first place,
                     Monsieur has the money. In ordinary cases he would doubtless send
                     it by post, in the form of bills upon other cities; but this case is urgent,
                     and the circumstances peculiar. The forgery will not be formally announced for
                     two days, and in two days there are forty-eight hours. Monsieur could easily so
                     employ those forty-eight hours as to postpone the settlement I
                     desire—indefinitely. If it is delayed until the train reach Amiens, and if no
                     accident occur in the meantime in handling this dangerous toy, I shall request
                     the two gens-d'armes in the next carriage to wait upon Monsieur until I can get
                     my credentials from Paris or London. Whereas, should Monsieur kindly grant my
                     request, and make the transfer at once, he may proceed to Boulogne, where
                     Madame anxiously waits his arrival, at the Hotel du Nord."
                  Blauvelt glared at the bold speaker in mute astonishment.
                  "Madame her mother is with her. They have return-tickets to London. Monsieur
                     cannot stop at Boulogne to-night if the gensd'armes wait upon him. They will
                     probably wish to remain at Amiens."
                  Under the feeble light of the lamp in the ceiling, the sallow face of the
                     Belgian seemed to grow green. His eyes were full of ferocity, mingled with
                     terror aroused by the last words of his persecutor. How much did he know? He
                     thought twenty times that he would throw himself suddenly upon Wailes and risk
                     everything in a desperate struggle. But the pistol-barrel was in a line with
                     his body, the hammer drawn back, and Trump's finger was on the trigger. And
                     while there was no pretence in the polite manner of the youth, his tones were
                     even and unembarrassed, and cold as ice. No anger, no trepidation, no
                     excitement, but a desperate tenacity, an accent of stern inflexibility that
                     awed the practised villain far more than any amount of rage and bluster would
                     have done. The handsome face of the Englishman was like the marble bust of
                     Antinous in the Hotel de Cluny, and the resemblance actually struck Blauvelt in
                     the midst of his confusion and dismay.
                  "Suppose I should be able to satisfy you; is the return of the fifteen thousand
                     all your demand?"
                  "Fifteen thousand two hundred and ten pounds," said Wailes; "no more and no
                     less."
                  "Word of honor?" said Blauvelt.
                  "Word of honor," responded Wailes.
                  "And you promise to leave me totally free? Nay, you must promise to keep silent
                     about this encounter—"
                  "Listen, Monsieur," said Wailes; "when I get this money I shall return directly
                     to Gloucester. It will be afternoon to-morrow. Then I shall tell Mr. Grippe.
                     This is all that I can do, and I hope you will not make any more stipulations.
                     At present I have only suspicions; if you turn my suspicions into certainties
                     it will be my duty to act. With my present knowledge I shall be silent until I
                     reach Gloucester."
                  Mr. Blauvelt took a pocket-book from his breast, and selecting a paper,
                     presented it to Wailes, who received it with his left hand, while his right
                     held the objectionable toy rigidly in position.
                  "That is Delisle's acceptance of your own bill," said Blauvelt; "you perceive
                     he has directed his London correspondent to pay the amount in sterling, fifteen
                     thousand two hundred pounds."
                  Trumpley examined the paper carefully. It was the very bill he had enclosed in
                     his letter to Blauvelt and Zimmermann on the previous day, and bore his own
                     initials in the corner. Across the face was written Delisle's acceptance, and
                     the order of transfer upon the London bankers. He folded the paper and placed
                     it in his pocket.
                  "When we reach Amiens," he said, "I must trouble Monsieur to endorse the bill
                     to Browler Brothers. It is payable to the order of Blauvelt and Zimmermann. I
                     will trouble Monsieur for the other ten pounds at same time; and I beg that
                     Monsieur will not injure his excellent teeth by grinding them in that
                     unpleasant manner. We shall find pen and ink in the waiting-room. Probably
                     Monsieur will take the train thence to Boulogne. May I venture to offer
                     Monsieur a cigar? No?"
                  While the throng of passengers were flitting from buffet to waiting-room and
                     booking-office at Amiens, Mr. Blauvelt obtained writing materials, and made the
                     needful endorsement upon the bill. He also politely handed Wailes ten
                     sovereigns, declining his offer to write a formal acknowledgment. Trumpley
                     resumed his seat, but Mr. Blauvelt disappeared; and when Trumpley was tossing
                     on the short waves of the Channel, under the moonlight, Mr. Blauvelt was
                     enacting the rle of the average married-man
                     of fiction, at the Hotel du Nord, Boulogne, to wit: cursing his
                     mother-in-law.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XXXVIII.
                  TOO LATE.
                  The events recorded in the preceding chapter would be out of the common order
                     if one or two apparently trivial circumstances did not account for them. Mr.
                     Clinton, in conversation with the banker, had casually mentioned Blauvelt and
                     Zimmerman, whereupon Mr. Grippe remarked that some large transactions had
                     recently brought the Berlin firm into correspondence with him. Then Mr. Clinton
                     politely hoped Mr. Grippe was secure in the transactions, which of course had
                     the effect to make that gentleman feel quite insecure, as Clinton suggested
                     some suspicion of Blauvelt's honesty. And when Trumpley came out upon the South
                     Terrace, Clinton overheard the banker mention Blauvelt's name. As he knew the
                     Belgian was truculent and unscrupulous, and supposing Wailes was going to meet
                     him, he had insisted so earnestly upon arming his friend that Trump promised to
                     take the weapon to get rid of his importunity, and Trump always kept his
                     promises.
                  The other events happened in ordinary sequence. Mr. Wailes, taking compassion
                     on an elderly female encumbered with luggage, had assisted her to the train,
                     and she revealed enough of Mr. Blauvelt's plans to make the youth act with more
                     decision in the crisis; and the oddity of his character was manifested in the
                     cold precision of his utterances under circumstances calculated to produce high
                     excitement, and in the sublime courage that carried him scathless through an
                     encounter of deadly peril. The Belgian was armed, and he would have killed
                     Wailes without hesitation if he could have done it safely. But the stronger
                     nature prevailed, as Blauvelt recognised under the polished manner and soft
                     intonations of the Englishman a purpose as relentless as death.
                  When Trumpley arrived at Gloucester, he went directly to the bank, Mr. Grippe
                     was at Halidon. James was waiting for the mail, having driven to the city in
                     the spring-cart, now laden with sundry parcels for the 'ouse. Wailes took a
                     seat by his side, and stopping to reclaim his portmanteau, safely reposing
                     under the hedge, drove down with him to the banker's residence. Mr. Grippe was
                     in his room with a real attack of asthma, but begged Mr. Wailes to walk up. The
                     ladies were invisible.
                  The banker was sitting astride of a chair, a pillow on the back, and his chest
                     resting upon it. This was a veritable attack, and the old gentleman was
                     evidently uncomfortable.
                  "Take a seat, Mr. Wailes," he said. "I feel as if I were getting my breath
                     through a tube forty feet long."
                  "I am very sorry to see you in such distress, sir," said Wailes.
                  "Perhaps I have done wrong in coming, but I was anxious—"
                  "To tell me of your failure! Never mind; it was a desperate case."
                  "No, sir," answered Trump, producing his pocket-book; "I think I have not
                     failed. Here is your bill for fifteen thousand—"
                  "What the devil—excuse me!" spluttered Mr. Grippe, taking the bill and
                     examining it eagerly. "Accepted by Delisle and made payable in London!"
                  "Yes, sir. It is addressed to our own correspondents. I had time to get the
                     London acceptance. It only wants your signature to complete the transfer."
                  "Sit down. I feel better. Tell me the whole story; it is most
                     extraordinary."
                  "Would it not be better to wait until to-morrow, sir?" said Wailes, slyly.
                     "Business talk will excite you and bring on another attack."
                  "Bring on rubbish! Never was better in my life. Ring the bell, please. James,
                     two bottles of bitter beer, some biscuit and cheese. Here, take away this
                     pillow!" and he threw it at James viciously. That exemplary servant caught it
                     on the fly, placed it soberly on the bed and vanished. Mr. Grippe put on his
                     spectacles and read the famous bill all over, with its various endorsements.
                     James reappeared, drew a table near Mr. Grippe's seat, uncorked the beer and
                     re-vanished.
                  "Now, Mr. Wailes," said Browler Brothers, "business, please. You can talk while
                     you eat. I am famishing; had no breakfast to-day.
                  The bank has been running itself. Begin!"
                  "It is a short story, sir."
                  "I want all the details. Go on."
                  "I went directly to Paris. It was nearly dark when I arrived. Before I got out
                     at the station I saw Mr. Blauvelt; he was going towards Calais. I followed him
                     and took a seat in the same carriage. We two had the compartment to ourselves
                     as far as Amiens. Before we got there I had persuaded him to return the bill.
                     That is all, sir. Of course I came directly back."
                  "You are telling me nothing!" said Grippe, irascibly. "I desire to know what
                     you said and what he said."
                  
                  "Well, sir," answered Wailes, "I told him the bills he sent were forged—"
                  "The devil! Excuse me. Go on."
                  "And therefore I was obliged to request the return of our remittance, fifteen
                     thousand two hundred pounds, and ten pounds more for my expenses."
                  "Ten pounds more for your expenses," said the banker, as if repeating a lesson.
                     "Pray go on."
                  "He objected at first. I think he said he had no money with him, and proposed a
                     postponement—"
                  "Yes; proposed a postponement," repeated Mr. Grippe, with great unction.
                  "And I was obliged to contradict him, sir, as I was sure he had the money, and
                     I thought a postponement very risky. He became excited—and—I believe he thought
                     of throwing me out the window."
                  "Well."
                  "He concluded to return the bill instead. At Amiens we got pen and ink, and he
                     endorsed the bill, as you see. He went to Boulogne, I believe, and I came
                     through, crossing the Channel by the night boat."
                  "It is important for me to know, Mr. Wailes," said Mr. Grippe, "just what
                     arguments you used with Blauvelt."
                  "I told him he would get hurt, sir," replied Wailes. "I had to do it. If you
                     will be good enough to be satisfied with this explanation—"
                  "If you will be good enough to tell me all trump that
                     was said and done, perhaps you won't drive me mad, as you are doing!"
                  "Mr. Clinton insisted on giving me this, sir," said Trumpley, producing the
                     revolver. "I have known Mr. Blauvelt many years, and I was sure he would stop
                     at nothing to silence me; so I—showed him this when he half rose to assault me.
                     I was going to shoot him in the legs. Then I should have been arrested, and he
                     could not run until I telegraphed for you or Delisle."
                  "Suppose you had been unarmed?" said Mr. Grippe.
                  "Ah, I have not thought of that. Let me see. Oh, there were police-officers on
                     the train; I should have accused him to them, and stuck by him until Delisle
                     could arrive. I did not know I had the pistol until we were locked in together;
                     I had forgotten it. When I got that in my hand, all the rest was easy. You told
                     me to be cool, cautious, watchful and prompt. I did not forget that."
                  "Have you had enough beer? Plenty?"
                  "Yes, sir."
                  "Where are you going now."
                  "Home. There was only one foreign letter to-day. I replied and got Mr. Choppy
                     to sign the answer. It was of no importance. Then as James was coming down, I
                     thought I would come and tell you."
                  "Yes; you have played the mischief telling me. Look you, Mr. Wailes: one
                     invariable rule in business is, 'No secrets from your partner.' Do you
                     understand?"
                  "No, sir," said Trump, slightly bewildered.
                  "I mean to say that you are a partner in the house of Browler Brothers; that
                     is, unless you have other views—"
                  "Other views! Mr. Grippe, I won't accept this! You overrate this little matter
                     because the amount is large. Please let it rest a week or two—"
                  "Not an hour!" said the banker, stamping his sound foot vehemently. "Don't you
                     see how feeble I am? The least thing knocks me up, and your opposition will
                     bring on a fine attack, no doubt. If you refuse to do as I say—I'll,—I'll quit
                     business! Here, I'll give you an eighth of the profits. It is more than I got
                     at first; and you may draw a hundred pounds a month for the next three years.
                     You must take charge of everything."
                  "Mr. Grippe, my inexperience—"
                  "Hang your inexperience! Get out! Ring the bell! James, drive Mr. Wailes home.
                     Don't run another wheel off! Come tell me when the horses are ready.
                     Inexperience! My dear boy, you will comfort my declining years. The cares of
                     that bank are killing me. Inexperience! When you find your experience at fault,
                     you can just draw a pistol, you murdering young vagabond! Get out, I say! Don't
                     answer me. Shake hands. You're a trump, you young villain! Get out; I am going
                     into another spasm!"
                  "Oh, Mr. Grippe! said Wailes, with tears in his eyes, "you cannot conceal your
                     kindness by attacks of asthma! I am not worthy of this generous dealing. I will
                     serve you as devotedly as I can, in whatever capacity you please."
                  "All right. First I want the exact description of that interview with Blauvelt.
                     You must write it down, word for word; do it tonight. Ah! my boy," he
                     continued, his eyes twinkling, "I know something. Do you remember you said
                     there was a young woman? Ah! I know. Well. With twelve hundred
                     pounds a year you can hunt up the young woman. I'll help you, you dog.'
                  "Alas!" said Wailes, "it is too late, too late!"
                  
                  "Too late?" said Grippe, pale with rage, "too late? Get out, you miserable,
                     inconstant rascal! Too late? It shall never be too late. I'll turn Guy Fawkes
                     and blow up Halidon before it shall be too late. Do you suppose I will let the
                     labors and plans of twenty years all be blown away by a young booby's sigh?
                     There's the carriage; get out with you! Here! Shake hands again. Never say die,
                     boy. Too late! If I was not dying with asthma, I'd die laughing at you. Too
                     late, indeed! Are you going or not? I'll throw this chair at you if you don't
                     get out, by George!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXXIX.
                  A DISAGREEMENT.
                  Within the week the new partner was formally inducted, and Mr. Grippe postponed
                     asthma until the wheels of commerce and banking were revolving smoothly,
                     bearing Trumpley on to fortune. He worried that amiable young gentleman nearly
                     to death by turning all manner of business over to him without warning, and
                     requiring instant decisions upon matters involving large outlays, chuckling
                     with high enjoyment over the careworn expression of Trumpley's pleasant
                     countenance.
                  Two days after the junior was inaugurated, Chunk ushered Mr. Radcliffe Merton
                     into Mr. Wailes' room.
                  "Hillo, Trump!" said he, vivaciously, "you have taken a step since we
                     parted."
                  "Yes," said Wailes; "rather unexpectedly to me. When did you come back? I lost
                     you in Calais."
                  "Last night. That is, I was in London yesterday. I have a financial matter on
                     hand, and want a banker. You shall have your first commission from me. Mr.
                     Grippe refused to discuss matters, and referred me to you."
                  "Indeed! Business, is it? State your case, sir, I am all attention."
                  "It is a plain case, Trump," answered Merton, confidently. "I have gone rather
                     heavily into some shares, the Dorado mine, and I require a loan of a few
                     thousands upon them. Here are the certificates. You see the allotment payment
                     is acknowledged, five pounds a share, and the second five pounds will be due in
                     a week. I have not quite enough tin on hand, and shall need perhaps three
                     thousand. Perfectly safe, you see. The certificates are for a thousand shares,
                     representing five thousand paid in. You had better go in for some, Trump. I can
                     get you a few at original price; they are selling at fifteen shillings advance,
                     you know."
                  "Did you mention this to Mr. Grippe?" said Wailes.
                  "No. He got asthmatic, and said you would do quite as well. In fact he said he
                     had turned over all that part of the business to you."
                  "Well, Rad," said Trumpley, reluctantly, "I am sorry I cannot make this loan.
                     We have declined these shares before."
                  "What!" said Radcliffe; "you don't mean to deny me, surely? Does all our
                     friendship count for nothing with you?"
                  "Business, Rad," answered Wailes; "I am dealing with you as I would with a
                     stranger. I would not lend a stranger a pound a share on this security. I
                     distrust the whole thing. Sell out, Rad. You say there is a premium of fifteen
                     shillings; sell out and stay out."
                  "You are—demented!" retorted Merton, flushing up; "when this second payment is
                     made the shares will sell for fifteen pounds. I have examined all, through it;
                     it is good. I am sure of a good profit if I get this second payment made."
                  "I am sorry I have no money of my own, Rad," said Wailes; "though if I had I
                     could not help you. One of the conditions of the partnership forbids loans,
                     even of private means, without my partner's consent."
                  "I should not expect much from your private means," said Radcliffe, rudely;
                     "but you will not be very successful as a banker, I fancy, if you turn away
                     every gentleman with landed estates who applies for accommodation. My own bill
                     at two months ought to be good for three thousand pounds."
                  "We do not lend money upon land," said Trump, quietly; "if you desire to make
                     that sort of negotiation, there is Mr. Solomons—"
                  "Many thanks. Really, I did not think your head could be turned so easily! Of
                     course your sudden advancement is calculated to induce conceit, but to set up
                     your judgment of values against able London financiers, who have invested in
                     these shares, is absurd."
                  "Why not apply to some of them for the loan you want?" replied Wailes. "We do
                     not deal in that description of security here; that is all. Besides, Rad, you
                     are not a customer of the bank, and it would be a violation of an established
                     rule to lend you, even upon consols. It is far more absurd for you to lose your
                     temper, when you know I am obliged to decline this transaction."
                  
                  "Uncle Matt is a customer, I think," said Radcliffe; "but I also think he will
                     seek some other connection. Of course I shall mention this matter to him. Mr.
                     Grippe has had a prosperous career thus far, it is said, but he has made one
                     unfortunate move lately. It is the first step backward. Out of temper! Not I;
                     but it is rather annoying to have to go back to London because Browler Brothers
                     happens to be a one-horse institution. How Tyrrell will laugh when I tell him
                     of this interview!"
                  "Better not tell him then, Rad," said Wailes, quietly. "It is a bad indication
                     for Mr. Tyrrell to laugh."
                  "What do you mean?" said Merton, fiercely.
                  "Nothing. Don't speak so loudly, please; Mr. Grippe's door is open."
                  "What the devil do I care—"
                  "Well, perhaps he would laugh too. Pooh! Rad Merton, don't be ass enough to
                     fume and bluster with me! You are making yourself ridiculous."
                  "And you are making—
                  "Stop! Don't you know that we cannot quarrel? Have the goodness to walk once or
                     twice around the square. Go down to the cathedral and come back again; then I
                     will hear what you have to say. I am in earnest. See, here are five or six
                     foreign letters, and the mail will close in an hour. Pray excuse me just sixty
                     minutes."
                  Radcliffe put on his hat and walked out. As, he pulled the door after him with
                     a bang, Mr. Grippe put his head in at the other door, nodded like a toy
                     mandarin thirteen times, and then withdrew. Mr. Wailes thought this was a very
                     strange proceeding, but dived incontinently into the foreign correspondence and
                     cleared his desk. In sixty-one minutes after his departure Mr. Merton
                     reappeared. The walk had not done him much good. His eyes were rather more
                     catlike than usual, but he was cool and polished.
                  "I come back, Mr. Wailes," he said, politely, "to ask you when it would be
                     convenient for you to vacate Rose Cottage."
                  "This evening," answered Trump.
                  "That is kind. I should like it done this morning; but no matter. I would also
                     say that the familiar terms that have existed so long between us had better be
                     modified somewhat. A great banker is hardly a fit associate for a plain country
                     gentleman. Moreover, there is a popular notion among gentlemen that banking is
                     a sort of trade, and one's caste is affected more or less by one's
                     associates."
                  "Yes," replied Wailes, with his mother's crisp accents, "you will have to
                     relinquish Mr. Blauvelt also, I fear."
                  "Therefore," continued Merton, repressing his anger, "let us be better
                     strangers henceforth. You have taken to this Yankee Clinton, or Stratton,
                     anyhow—"
                  "And you to Blauvelt," put in Trump.
                  "And Mr. Clinton cannot move in the same circle—"
                  "With Messrs. Blauvelt and Tyrrell? No!"
                  "Will Mr. Wailes please step in my room?" said Mr. Grippe, suddenly appearing.
                     "Pray excuse me, Mr. Merton."
                  "I am just going, sir," replied Radcliffe. "Good morning, gentlemen. I hope
                     Browler Brothers will be as successful as I wish them to be. Good morning."
                  Mr. Grippe caught Trump's arm, and hobbled over to his chair. He had a "turn"
                     coming on, and he coughed and sneezed between words.
                  "You're a nice banker, you dog! Ugh! ugh! To turn off a customer with landed
                     estates, you blockhead! Atsche! And your old friend too. And to decline Dorado
                     shares, you booby, with fifteen shillings profit in them, and Mr. Tyrrell
                     behind them! Ah, you cold-blooded murdering young rascal! How many revolvers
                     have you on your person? None! Get out, you vagabond! Atsche! I am sorry I
                     can't raise your salary, confound you! You're a trump, by George!"
               
            
            
            
               
               BOOK IV.
               ROUGE-ET-NOIR AT BADEN.
               
                  CHAPTER XL.
                  MAISON ROUGE.
                  Three times at least in the foregoing Books the author has been obliged to
                     close a chapter abruptly, and he hopes the reader will remember the places and
                     accept the present effort to repair the damage. The first time was at the end
                     of Chapter VI. in the First Book, where the Reverend Edward Grahame announced
                     that he had a story to tell. That story will be duly recounted with sundry
                     accessories in the following pages. The second lapse occurred at the end of
                     Chapter XXVI. in the Second Book, where a ghost was arrested, and then quietly
                     vanished from the story. In the present book she shall reappear and account for
                     her conduct. The last break in the narrative may be found at the conclusion of
                     Chapter XXXV. in the Third Book, where Mr. Clinton cleared his throat for a
                     recital that promised to be interesting, and where the story left him abruptly.
                     This was done of malice aforethought, and his story strangled in the bud,
                     simply because it was rather too soon for the revelations he was about to make.
                     If the reader will be patient and read steadily on without skipping, he will in
                     due time arrive at the last chapter in the last book, and somewhere in the
                     history he will either find Mr. Clinton's story revealed by implication, or
                     shall have it in detail. No more definite promise would be safe, as this
                     gentleman is the most restless and unmanageable character thus far
                     presented.
                  The Black Forest, which has been the scene of so many delightful blood-curdling
                     legends, stretches down to the very outskirts of Baden, and on the edge of the
                     forest a French marquis had erected a red-brick chteau near a hundred years
                     ago. It was called Maison Rouge. The house had gained an evil reputation,
                     partly on account of the wild lives of its owner and his descendants through
                     two or three generations, and partly because the peasantry were prone to people
                     such mansions with goblins when they were left untenanted by men and women for
                     any prolonged period. Then there had been savage brawls there in the old time
                     when gay nobles carried weapons in their belts, and half-a-dozen mounds back of
                     the chteau were pointed out as the last resting-places of those who had been
                     worsted in these quarrels. As a matter of course these were unquiet sleepers,
                     reappearing upon anniversaries, and revenging themselves upon modern society by
                     stalking through deserted chambers, exhibiting ghastly wounds in a very
                     disagreeable manner. There was nothing attractive about the place, and it was
                     left to owls, bats and goblins for long seasons, repulsive within and
                     without.
                  Near a quarter of a century before Trumpley Wailes found the violets in
                     Merton's Brook, Maison Rouge was swept and garnished, and occupied by an
                     English gentleman and his wife. They were evidently in their honeymoon, and
                     were overflowing with happiness. The gentleman was Mr. Harold Trumpley, who had
                     been an annual visitor at Baden for several years, and was therefore familiar
                     with the localities. It was in accordance with his character to select this
                     house, both because of its loneliness and its bad reputation, as he had always
                     been morose and solitary in his habits, and was apparently incapable of fear.
                     The goblins would find their match if they encountered him.
                  The house was supplied as if for a siege—quantities of provisions, quantities
                     of wines and all other appliances of housekeeping. For a month or two the
                     couple seemed to be content with each other's society; but as Baden filled up
                     with visitors, they gradually came out of their seclusion and mingled with the
                     gay company in the town. Then there came a young clergyman and his invalid
                     wife, who was the sister of Mrs. Trumpley, and they also took up their
                     residence at Maison Rouge. Then there came Captain Merton, a rollicking young
                     sailor, and being an old acquaintance and friend of the ladies, partook of the
                     hospitalities of Mr. Trumpley's house. He had a chamber there always ready for
                     occupation, and he had apartments also at the Hotel d'Angleterre, and he
                     flitted between the two places as the whim seized him.
                  The Reverend Mr. Grahame and his wife were really the only regular occupants of Maison Rouge after the
                     Baden season fairly set in. Mr. Trumpley was a constant attendant at the
                     "tables," where various games were in progress, and where large sums changed
                     hands night after night. Mrs. Trumpley, young and pretty, found many
                     acquaintances among the English visitors. So they also took apartments at the
                     hotel and visited their own house occasionally. Mrs. Grahame was regular in her
                     application to the healing baths, but was never seen at the play-rooms
                     frequented by all the rest of the population. Her husband drove her into town
                     each day in Trumpley's pony-carriage, returning by daylight to Maison Rouge,
                     and leading a very rational life, while his wife gradually improved in
                     health.
                  Then there came a new sensation with the arrival of Miss Radcliffe, a dashing
                     young English heiress, under charge of an antiquated companion, half-duenna and
                     half-governess. The extent of her fortune could not be accurately ascertained,
                     but it was evidently large enough to make her very attractive to all the
                     impecunious danglers at the watering-place. She would have been positively
                     pretty also but for a peculiarity in the flare of her eyebrows, which gave a
                     feline expression to her face, especially when in one of her "little tempers,"
                     which was the name her duenna gave to tolerably frequent ebullitions of passion
                     which she reserved for their private intercourse.
                  Then there came Monsieur Lamont, a banker from Marseilles. He was one of those
                     smooth-faced Frenchmen that are ever young and blooming. He was affable and
                     polite, spoke English with a charming accent, gambled at rouge-et-noir, and
                     made a succession of small winnings. Once and again he partook of the profuse
                     hospitality of Maison Rouge, and with the assurance of a connoisseur pronounced
                     the red Burgundy there dispensed, the most magnificent wine in Europe. There
                     was a goodly quantity in the cellars, and Monsieur Lamont was so emphatic in
                     his praises that Mr. Trumpley decided to bottle the larger portion of it and
                     ship it to his English home. The banker volunteered to superintend this
                     delicate operation. Everything depended upon the care bestowed in the selection
                     of bottles, corks and wax. Day after day he watched the progress of this
                     important work, lest the precious fluid should by accident moisten the plebeian
                     throats of the workmen. At last it was finished, the wine packed in cases and
                     consigned to Halidon. Monsieur Lamont vowed that he would tear himself away
                     from the entanglements of business, and drink the health of Moniseur and Made
                     Trumpley beneath their own roof-tree, some time in the coming winter. A case or
                     two was consigned to Reverend Edward Grahame, London; and it may as well be
                     recorded here that every drop of this portion found its way into the
                     gin-scalded gullets of sick paupers in Blackfriars. Had Monsieur Lamont known
                     of this terrible waste, he would have torn out his glossy black hair by the
                     handful, which desperate act would have enured to the profit of the wig-makers
                     of Marseilles who were favored with the banker's patronage.
                  Besides his devotion to Maison Rouge, mansion and wine, Monsieur Lamont had a
                     reason for prolonging his stay. There had arrived at the Hotel d'Angleterre a
                     sickly young Englishman, who pestered the banker with his attentions. This was
                     Mr. Anthony Grippe, from Gloucester, sorely afflicted with asthma, and flying
                     to Monsieur Lamont for sympathy twenty times a day. While the latter remained
                     at Maison Rouge he was secure, as Mr. Grippe was not favored with the entre to
                     that establishment. But as soon as he returned to Baden the pale-faced
                     Englishman fell upon him, and struck by him like his shadow. When Lamont was
                     making his little venture at rouge-et-noir, Mr. Grippe was at his elbow,
                     nothing down his nightly gains as methodically as if he had been engaged to
                     keep an accurate account of them, and deploring the occasional losses, or
                     "changes of luck," as heartily as if he had been personally interested.
                  There are the people, selected out of the multitudes that populated Baden and
                     its vicinity, in whom the reader is requested to take some slight interest. It
                     is probable that the experiences of novel-readers are as various as the classes
                     of novels that have afflicted modern society; but it is also probable that all
                     readers object to retrospects. If the narrative has been made interesting up to
                     the point where these backward leaps are taken, it is a constructive fraud in
                     the author if he fails to invest the "previous history" with interest also. And
                     if, on the other hand (alas!), the reader has been wearily counting the pages
                     and longing for the denoment, the writer who
                     can awaken new interest in old stories under such unhappy circumstances, may
                     take a high place in the ranks of fiction-makers.
                  It may be objected that this back-history should have been recorded first, and
                     then the story would have sailed to the haven of Finis on an even keel. But
                     this would be against all precedent. The opening chapters must needs be made
                     sufficiently stirring to catch the reluctant attention of readers. Then there
                     must needs be occasional breaks—a sort of "to be continued"—to fire the
                     flagging zeal of the yawning public. There must needs be some mysterious
                     influence, known only to the narrator, but cropping out now and then, which can
                     only be revealed in a retrospect.
                     Because if the action of the drama were commonplace, and the events followed in
                     orderly sequence, the most gigantic intellect would certainly be drowned in
                     slumber before the story were half told.
                  Proceed tranquilly then, gentle reader. All these people have been presented to
                     you in the earlier chapters; and be comforted to know that they all, excepting
                     one or two, shall either depart this life within the limits of this Books, or

                  CHAPTER XLI.
                  L'ABIME NOIR.
                  At the breakfast table at Maison Rouge assembled Mrs. Trumpley, Mrs. Grahame,
                     and the Reverend Edward. Mr. Trumpley was in town. Of late he has been spending
                     a night there occasionally, while his wife remained at the suburban residence.
                     Mr. Grahame has been hinting at the necessity for his return to Blackfriars,
                     seconded by his wife, whose health is restored in great measure; and Mrs.
                     Trumpley foregoes the frivolities of Baden for the sake of her sister's
                     society. This morning there are letters, sent out from town by Mr. Trumpley,
                     and each one of the trio finds matter of absorbing interest in the
                     correspondence.
                  First: Mrs. Grahame has a letter from America; four pages closely written.
                  "It is from Mabel, Dora," she said; "she is in Virginia. Mr. Stratton has
                     bought a plantation there. Where is Virginia, Mr. Grahame?"
                  "It is somewhere in America," answered her husband. "I don't remember the exact
                     locality. Not far from New York, I fancy. You know Sir Walter Raleigh
                     discovered it, and named it in honor of Queen Bess. Tobacco grows there."
                  "She says the country is beautiful," continued Mrs. Grahame, after receiving
                     this choice morsel of geography, history, and botany, "but rather wild."
                  "Of course," said Mr. Grahame; "Indians, no doubt. The Powhatans or
                     Passawottimies, or something. I think they are half-civilised though. Still it
                     must be uncomfortable to have such fellows about."
                  "Mabel has a son, Dora. His name is De Witt. Oh, if poor Papa had only lived
                     till this time, he would have forgotten all his anger and would have forgiven
                     Mabel! My dear," she continued, addressing her husband, "I have never told you
                     all about Mabel's marriage. Papa quarrelled with Uncle Clinton, who is our
                     mother's brother, and he ceased his visits to our house. But Mabel was always
                     his favorite, and Papa allowed her to spend the winter in New York with him,
                     and she there met Mr. Stratton and became engaged to him. There was a great
                     deal of angry correspondence between Uncle Clinton and Papa on the subject, as
                     there was really no possible objection to Mr. Stratton excepting his American
                     birth. But Papa finally yielded, upon condition that Mr. Clinton should make
                     some sort of settlement giving Mabel his property at his death. I don't
                     understand all the legal points, but after Mabel was married there was a
                     fiercer quarrel than ever, and Mr. Stratton took sides with Uncle Clinton, and
                     poor Mabel adhered to her husband. We left Canada shortly afterwards, and Papa
                     for bade us to mention our sister's name to him. We have had letters from her
                     regularly since Papa's death, and we have discovered that Mr. Clinton's
                     settlement in some way bound Papa to leave his property to Mabel
                     too. That is the reason that Beechwood is in chancery."
                  "That could hardly be," said Mr. Grahame; "your father could not make a
                     contract in America that would bind property afterwards bought in England."
                  "There is something in the title-deed to Beechwood," said Dora, "that confirms
                     the agreement. What else does Mabel say, Daisy?"
                  "She says their nearest neighbor is three miles distant. Mr. Stratton is
                     devoted to farming, and they are very happy. She fills two pages with arguments
                     to induce me to go to America and live with her. Shall we go, Mr. Grahame?"
                  "Not immediately, my dear," answered her husband; "but my letter contains a
                     very urgent invitation to Blackfriars. We must go to-morrow, I think."
                  "We will all go at the end of the week," said Mrs. Trumpley; "Mr. Trumpley
                     promised me yesterday. I have not read my letter yet."
                  She rose from the table as she spoke, and moved over to the window-seat. Half
                     hidden behind the curtain she broke the seal, humming the refrain of a song.
                     Mr. Grahame and his wife remained at the table discussing the contents of their
                     letters. They did not notice the cessation of the song; and while they were
                     still intent upon their plans for
                     the return to Blackfriars, Mrs. Trumpley read her letter. It was anonymous.
                  "If Mrs. Trumpley," it ran, "will take the trouble to send or go to Chlons, she
                     will discover perhaps the secret of Mr. Trumpley's interest in that town. In La
                     Rue Saint Jean, number four, she will find a lady living in great retirement,
                     who receives regular remittances from Mr. Trumpley, and who claims from him the
                     honor of bearing his name."
                  That was all.
                  Leaving Mr. Grahame and her sister, Dora went quietly out of the
                     breakfast-room. Entering her chamber and locking the door, she took out the
                     villainous note and read it again, pondering each word.
                  Chlons! They had spent a week there, just before coming to Baden. During the
                     week her husband was absent from her an hour each day, and she remembered that
                     he evaded her questions when she inquired with a bride's petulance where he
                     went and whom he found in the quaint town to attract him away from her. He
                     seemed oppressed with some care and anxiety, and put her off with the
                     explanation that he had unpleasant business to transact which did not concern
                     her, and which would only annoy her if she knew all its details. Somehow she
                     had so profound a confidence in the innate nobleness of Trumpley's nature,
                     though he was rugged and wilful, that the vague charge of villainy in the note
                     did not impress her particularly. But she was incensed at the thought that some
                     color was given to the insinuation by her husband's persistent refusal to tell
                     the nature of his "unpleasant business."
                  What was to be done? Should she tell Daisy? Never! Should she wait Mr.
                     Trumpley's return and lay the anonymous communication before him? Certainly.
                     That was precisely the thing to do; and in the meantime she would resolutely
                     banish the whole subject from her thoughts. Harold Trumpley, cold, morose,
                     repulsive in manner and unattractive in person, was still a gentleman,
                     incapable of deceit or falsehood.
                  She unlocked her jewel-case, placed the note therein, and relocking it, went
                     down stairs and rejoined Daisy and Mr. Grahame. They were equipping themselves
                     for a walk.
                  "Come, Dora," said her sister, "we are waiting for you. Here is your hat."
                  "Where are you going?" said Dora.
                  "To L'Abme Noir. We want your guidance. Marie has told us so many tales of its
                     horrors that we are dying of curiosity to see it."
                  "You will not need a guide," said Dora. "Take the forest-road, and climb the
                     hill on the right where the road divides."
                  "Oh, come with us," said Daisy; "we will not go without you. Do you suppose we
                     would leave you alone here?"
                  "What has Marie told you?" said Mrs. Trumpley, as she donned hat and mantle. "I
                     am afraid of hobgoblins."
                  "Not by daylight, surely," replied Mr. Grahame.
                  "They are not dangerous," added Daisy, gaily. "They are merely the ghosts of
                     former residents of Maison Rouge, and of some of their victims. It is the
                     scenery that I desire to see. Marie says it is superbly gloomy. Is the walk
                     long?"
                  "Very short," answered her sister. "The chasm is only half a mile distant; but
                     the hill is steep."
                  "We are good climbers," said Mrs. Grahame. "Are you ready? Come along. You may
                     have Mr. Grahame's other arm."
                  On the road the thick trees shut out the sunlight, and the ascent of the rocky
                     hill was rough and toilsome. The summit was a plateau surrounded by a border of
                     gloomy trees, enclosing a space of two or three acres; and across this area a
                     rift ran, opened in the rock probably by some natural convulsion in the past
                     ages. There was no vegetable growth near the chasm, which was only a few yards
                     wide, but of unknown depth. Mr. Grahame threw a pebble against the opposite
                     side, and they could hear it bounding back and forth in the ragged fissure
                     several seconds after it was lost to sight. The surface of the rock was smooth
                     and level where they stood, and also on the opposite side of the opening, the
                     jagged edges corresponding each with the other very accurately. There were
                     places where a man might leap across from one side to the other, and at either
                     end of the rift the strata seemed to run together, closing the dismal abyss and
                     shutting it up in its unique horror. There were no signs of human habitation in
                     sight, and all the surroundings were desolate and forbidding. The road wound
                     round the base of the hill, and there were few that new of the curious chasm
                     that cared to examine its wonders. This was many years ago. No doubt the more
                     modern votaries of science have explored its depths, accounted for its origin,
                     and explored the many fables that hung about it in that distant day.
                  "Harold brought me here," said Mrs. Trumpley, "two weeks ago. He was highly
                     amused at my horror. He has spent many days here, he says, when he desired to
                     get away from human society, as he was secure from interruption or intrusion.
                     Indeed he fills his pockets with cigars and comes out here still, whenever he
                     falls into one of his solitary moods."
                  
                  "Which is seldom," said Mr. Grahame.
                  "Yes. He has only been here a few times. Since the hotels have filled up he
                     likes Baden better."
                  "It would not do for a pic-nic," said Mrs. Grahame; "the hill is too hard to
                     climb."
                  "And there is no grass," said her husband.
                  "I don't think any one could be jolly here," said Mrs. Trumpley. "The
                     clock-makers who live on the road a little beyond the hill have numberless
                     stories of this locality. There is one they tell of a young English gentleman
                     who lost all his fortune at the gaming-table in Baden some years ago. He was
                     engaged to be married, and his fiance, who was a German baroness, sat by him,
                     betting with him, and lost largely also. They came out here the same night and
                     threw themselves into the Black Abyss. He left a note, saying he had been
                     betting on Rouge without success, and would try Noir. This is the latest
                     horror."
                  "If they went over here," said Mr. Grahame, looking into the dark rift, "they
                     encountered a dozen deaths before they reached the bottom. Look down
                     Daisy."
                  "Not I!" replied his wife. "Come away! Come away, Dora! What are you thinking
                     of, standing there on the brink of destruction? Let us go back."
                  Dora was thinking that the Black Abyss would be the proper place in which to
                     hide her mortification and end her dismal existence, if there should ever
                     happen to be a truth in her history corresponding with the anonymous lie about
                     Chlons.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XLII.
                  DORA'S JOURNEY.
                  The day passed without other events of importance. Dinner-time arrived; the
                     meal was delayed a little, but Mr. Trumpley did not appear. Dora read her note
                     again when she retired, and decided more emphatically that it was a fraud. At
                     breakfast the next morning Captain Merton presented himself at Maison Rouge in
                     time to partake of the morning meal. He brought a letter for Mrs. Trumpley.
                  "I told Trumpley I would be postman this morning," he said, "as I was going to
                     drive out anyhow. I was longing for some of your tea."
                  "Why did you not bring him with you?" asked Mrs. Grahame. "We have not seen him
                     for two days."
                  "Oh, he's off; went in the early train. The letter will explain, no doubt. Ah,
                     this tea is nectar. Mrs. Trumpley, if my ship is ordered to China I will bring
                     you a chest of the best the Flowery Land will furnish. We English don't get the
                     best; the Russian fellows monopolise it, they say."
                  While he was uttering this speech, he was furtively watching Dora reading her
                     letter; and she, conscious of his scrutiny, preserved her composed exterior,
                     though the color left her cheeks as she read. The note was short.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Dear Wife:—I am called suddenly away to Chlons, but
                                 expect to return to-morrow. I am disappointed, as I expected to
                                 come to you this morning; but this business is urgent. The enclosed
                                 note came last night, too late to send to you. It is probably a
                                 miller's bill, however. If so, do not distress yourself about the
                                 amount, as I was lucky last night and won enough money to redeem
                                 Halidon.
                              
                                 "Your affectionate husband,
                                 "HAROLD TRUMPLEY."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  Mrs. Trumpley put the "milliner's bill" in her pocket unopened. It occurred to
                     her that Captain Merton was watching her to see what effect that might produce,
                     and the blood came back to her pale cheeks and brow. There was a sympathising
                     tone in his voice in the next sentence that was highly offensive.
                  "Mr. Trumpley should have a good excuse for leaving such society," he said; "I
                     mean for his railway excursion. He had a good excuse for staying in Baden last
                     night; he won about twenty thousand pounds."
                  "Twenty thousand pounds!" said Mr. Grahame.
                  "At least. I saw him exchange a lot of gold for bills on the Bank of France. He
                     carried them off with him to Chlons. One more cup of tea, Mrs. Trumpley. He
                     took the early train; he will be at Chlons by noon. In fact we were up all
                     night. Lamont won a lot too."
                  The gallant captain Battled on in this style until breakfast was over; then the
                     gentlemen adjourned to the smoking-room, and in their absence Dora examined her "milliner's
                     bill." It was written on scented paper, and was very interesting. It was like
                     the note of the previous day in being anonymous, but differing in that this was
                     evidently feminine in caligraphy, if not in matter and style.
                  "If your husband, as he calls himself, is as suspicious as he is treacherous,
                     you will not receive this note. He will get an invitation to Chlons to-day from
                     Madame 'Hamet,' as she calls herself, and he will be apt to accept
                     it. Madame 'Hamet' resides at Number Four Rue St. Jean. No doubt you will think
                     Mr. Trumpley, the soul of honor, and no doubt Madame 'Hamet' holds the same
                     opinion. But nothing is easier than to confirm yourself in this well placed
                     confidence by going yourself to Chlons and making a friendly call upon Madame.
                     I am obliged to send this intelligence by post under cover to Mr. Trumpley. If
                     he should break the seal and possess himself of the contents, he will only add
                     one more wrong to the many he has done to you; but if not, and if you receive
                     this intact, it will be quite a providential intimation to you to "look after
                     your interests in person. The only motive the writer has is to unmask a
                     deceiver."
                  Mrs. Trumpley took this entertaining note to her chamber and compared it with
                     the former communication upon the same subject. They were not the work of the
                     same hand; they were unlike in everything except in unmistakable hostility to
                     Harold Trumpley. With the infallible and swift intuition of her sex, Dora
                     divined that Captain Merton knew the character of this last missive, and
                     probably of the first also. She would know certainly when she met him. Locking
                     up the two notes, she returned to the ground-floor, and finding Daisy in the
                     drawing-room, entered into vivacious conversation with her upon a dozen
                     indifferent topics; and when Captain Merton appeared at last, his quick, eager
                     glance at her face confirmed her in her suspicion.
                  And now for the motive.
                  Well, first of all, Captain Merton had offered his hand and heart to Dora a few
                     months ago, and had been rejected. While pleading for a favorable response he
                     had referred to Trumpley as a known rival, and dwelt upon his moroseness, his
                     erratic habits, his disregard of all the conventional laws of the time; and in
                     his anger when she coldly dismissed him (it was at Halidon, where she was
                     visiting), he has sneeringly wished her joy in her conquest of the savage that
                     owned the estate.
                  And when they met again at Baden he had impudently referred to his "withered
                     hopes," and was silenced with considerable difficulty, and only by her haughty
                     refusal to listen. There was something very disgusting in his languishing
                     looks, and just now there was a shade of sympathy in his tones that offended
                     her highly.
                  "Does Mr. Trumpley say when he will return?" he asked, taking a chair near
                     her.
                  "Really, I did not notice," she replied, indifferently. "Shall I get his letter
                     for you? I left it up-stairs," and she swept by him and left the room. This was
                     a little too much for the gallant sailor. He sat awhile where she left him, and
                     presently heard her voice above carolling a song. He said something to Mrs.
                     Grahame about an "engagement with Lament," took his hat and walked out upon the
                     drive. As he climbed up into his trap and gathered up the reins, the chorus of
                     her song came floating out of the window: 
                        
                           "Sing, tira, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
                           Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"
                        
                     
                  
                  Captain Merton gave his horse a savage cut with the whip, and vanished down the
                     road in a cloud of dust.
                  Mrs. Trumpley threw herself upon the lounge, her hilarious song ending in a
                     flood of tears.
                  At noon she came down, equipped for walking. She was going to Baden. Mr.
                     Trumpley has his rooms at the Hotel d'Angleterre. She would meet him if the
                     afternoon train brought him. Marie would walk in with her; they would return
                     to-morrow in the pony-carriage. Mr. and Mrs. Grahame must keep house during her
                     absence.
                  The train came, but no Trumpley. She dined in her room. No other train until
                     next morning. There was one for Chlons, leaving at ten o'clock. She put on her
                     hat, threw a thick veil over it, walked down to the station, procured her
                     ticket, and was leaving Baden behind her before she was fully conscious of her
                     acts or intentions. Halfway to Chlons a down train passed, and the thought that
                     her husband was perhaps a passenger on it entered her mind; but she was
                     confused and flightly, and the thought passed with the swift train. Perhaps
                     some magnetic influence had suggested it, as he really was there.
                  At Chlons it was raining—a regular torrent. She heeded it not, but passing out
                     into the street, accosted a woman who was gazing at the crowd of
                     passengers.
                  "Numbers four, Rue Saint Jean," she said, putting a franc in the woman's
                     hand.
                  
                  "Oui, Madame. Allons!" replied the other, looking at the careworn countenance
                     of the half-demented lady with genuine sympathy.
                  The rain lashed the pavements, drenching Dora in five minutes. She only knew
                     that her temples throbbed less painfully while the storm beat upon her, and she
                     walked on in a sort of stupor, trying to think of something to say when she
                     reached her destination.
                  "Number four, Madame," said and her guide, stopping at last. "Will Madame
                     enter? Ah, the door opens."
                  An old sister of charity coming out, struggling with an umbrella that refused
                     to expand. She glanced in Dora incuriously as she brushed by her. A second
                     sister was in the passage, and being bulky, she was impassable.
                  "Madams Hamet?" said Dora.
                  "Ah, yes," said the fat sister, moving aside; "au seconde the first door."
                  Dora ascended the stairs, and opening the door at the landing, she entered the
                     chamber. It was imperatively necessary to collect her thoughts now. She laid
                     aside her dripping bonnet and shawl, and looked curiously around the room. The
                     window-shades were down and the room darkened. A bed in the corner, and some
                     one upon it. She approached softly. Sleeping?
                  A pale-faced woman with black eyebrows and black hair. Her eyes were closed; so
                     quietly sleeping that Dora could not hear her respirations. She drew nearer,
                     and her thoughts became gradually more coherent as she looked at the cold face
                     of the dead woman. The rigid figure, the smooth bed-furniture, the white ribbon
                     under the chin, the thin nostril, so waxlike and transparent. Dead!
                  She walked down stairs, and out of the House. No purpose now but to move on.
                     She had left her bonnet and shawl, but knew it not. There was a cape to her
                     dress, and she put it over her head. Somehow she found the station.
                  "Paris?" said a porter, as she entered.
                  "Yes."
                  "Quickly, if Madame pleases; the train departs in two minutes. The office is
                     here. Ticket! Paris!" and looking doubtfully at Dora, added, "First class!
                     Sixteen frances, if Madame pleases. The change. Ah, merci! This way. Madame has
                     the carriage all to herself."
                  Perfectly mad now, and yet with enough method in her madness to preserve a
                     composed exterior. She reached Paris, and getting a voiture, was driven to
                     another station; obtained a ticket for London. How she passed through the
                     various impediments in her way she never knew, but when she landed at Dover her
                     beautiful hair was streaked with gray.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XLIII.
                  MR. GRIPPE'S LUCK.
                  On the night before Dora's departure for Baden there had been some high play at
                     the rouge-et-noir tables. The bank was out of luck. Mr. Trumpley won very
                     largely, and Monsieur Lamont with more modest ventures also made large gains.
                     Mr. Grippe sat by his side, nothing down his winnings with affectionate
                     earnestness. It was in the small hours when the players returned from the
                     rooms. Mr. Trumpley exchanged his gold for large notes on the Bank of France
                     and left for Chlons by the early train. Mr. Grippe followed Mr. Lamont to his
                     room, and congratulated him warmly upon his success.
                  "I shall return to England, Mr. Lamont," he said, "in a day or two, and in the
                     meantime we will arrange that little balance due Messrs. Browler Brothers."
                  "Ma foi!" answered the French banker, "it will be time enough to-morrow; at
                     present"—and he yawned fearfully—"I am dying of fatigue."
                  "It will take three minutes only. See, I have made a statement of the account
                     with interest estimated to this date. I did it while you were winning that last
                     rouleau. Ah! Mr. Lamont, you were courageous! Here is the sum-total in
                     francs—sixty-two thousand five hundred and two, and eight centimes."
                  "The devil fly away with the eight centimes!" said Mr. Lamont impatiently. "I
                     tell you I will make no settlement to-night."
                  Mr. Grippe became asthmatic; he lighted a cigarette and filled the apartment
                     with the pleasant odor of stramonium.
                  "Do you know, my friend," said Mr. Lamont, with a grimace, "that your 'tabac'
                     is villainous. Poof! the apartment will cease to be habitable; one cannot sleep
                     amid such perfumes."
                  "I will go as soon as you pay me," replied Grippe. "Look you, Mr. Lamont, there
                     is no time like the present. You won nearly two hundred thousand francs
                     to-night, and the money is in your pocket. Pay me your debt and I will leave
                     you."
                  
                  "And if otherwise?" said Lamont, grimly.
                  "If I am not paid to-night I will cause you to be arrested in the morning. It
                     pains me exceedingly, but my orders are stringent. I have delayed thus long,
                     waiting for your luck, at your request."
                  Mr. Lamont counted out the money, received Mr. Grippe's acknowledgment, which
                     he placed in his escritoire. As Grippe was retiring the Frenchman stopped
                     him.
                  "It is said, Mr. Grippe," he began with charming politeness, "that the
                     gentlemen of England are brave to a fault. It is so, is it not?"
                  "Cannot say, I'm sure," answered Grippe.
                  "Because," continued Mr. Lamont, "Mr. Grippe has displayed remarkable courage
                     in this affair. Now I should be charmed to exchange pistol-shots with him as
                     soon as daylight appears. I have a pair of excellent pistols in this case, and
                     Mr. Grippe will have time to arrange for the remittance of his sixty-two
                     thousand five hundred and two francs and eight centimes, in case of
                     accident."
                  "You mean a duel?" said Grippe, aghast.
                  "Precisely. We will go to L'Abme Noir at the dawn. I can find a couple of
                     gallant gentlemen to accompany us. Or if Mr. Grippe would prefer the
                     small-sword, the true weapon of gentlemen, I have those also."
                  Mr. Grippe lighted another cigarette. His breath came in spasms, and he was
                     evidently on the verge of suffocation. So was Mr. Lamont, who threw open a
                     window and leaned out gasping.
                  "You perceive how ill I am, Mr. Lamont," said Mr. Grippe between the paroxyms;
                     "these attacks usually last two days. Will you have the kindness to postpone
                     the affair until I—say until next week?"
                  "Without doubt, Mr. Grippe," answered the other.
                  "And I will retire, with your permissions."
                  "Certainly, Mr. Grippe. Good repose."
                  Mr. Grippe gained his chamber, and looking himself in, he pushed the bedstead
                     up against the door. Then he packed his portmanteau, and stretching himself
                     upon the bed without undressing, slept the sleep of the just. He depended upon
                     the asthma to wake him at six o'clock, which was train-time, but when he opened
                     his eyes the sunlight illuminated his apartment. It was eight o'clock; no more
                     trains until night.
                  He took a light breakfast in his room. Mr. Lamont sent a polite message
                     inquiring as to his health. Many thanks—very ill.
                  At noon he saw the Frenchman handing a lady into a cabriolette, and getting in
                     beside her, drove off. Mr. Grippe felt better, and ventured down stairs. He
                     strolled into the playing-room, deserted at that hour. There had been some
                     rouge-et-noir playing, and the croupier was at the table.
                  "Will Monsieur play?" he said, as Grippe approached.
                  "No comprenny par," answered Mr. Grippe.
                  "Ah!" said the croupier in English, "Monsieur does not speak French.
                     Fortunately, I know a little English. Monsieur has not tried his luck—will he
                     win a few Napoleons?"
                  A sudden desire to double the amount he had received from Mr. Lamont took
                     possession of the young banker. Two thousand pounds! he could do everything
                     with two thousand pounds. He laid five Napoleons on the table. There was a
                     slight shuffling of the cards, and five more were placed beside them.
                  "Monsieur has won."
                  He won again and again; it was the easiest business in the world. He had forty
                     Napoleons at his side, a glittering little pile. Why not finish it
                     expeditiously? He took out a note for five hundred francs and placed it upon
                     the red, with the forty Napoleons.
                  "Noir!"
                  "Indeed! Well, try the other color with a thousand."
                  "Rouge!"
                  He counted out ten thousand francs, registering a vow that he would quit when
                     he won that, and would come to the accursed table no more.
                  "Noir!"
                  And so the game progressed. When he won, he had a few hundred francs at stake;
                     when he lost, he had a few thousands. When he left the table at four o'clock
                     the eight centimes was about all that remained of Mr. Lamout's payment.
                  Going back to his room, he set himself with dogged determination to a review of
                     the situation. He had lost over two thousand pounds of the bank's money. He had
                     as much as that at his credit on the books at home, so the firm would lose
                     nothing; but he knew he was ruined hopelessly. He had not lost money only, but
                     when he met Browler senior and told him of that three hours' work, he knew that
                     he would be partner no longer, and he would have to begin life afresh, with no
                     capital and with a stained name.
                  He got writing materials and began a letter to Browler Brothers, recounting the
                     collection of the desperate debt and the loss of the money in a moment of
                     insanity, under sudden temptation. It did not occur to him that he could make up a probable
                     story of robbery or loss by some accident. Anthony Grippe robbed? Pooh!
                  He was a slow writer, and was still laboring on his confession when he heard
                     the scream of the railway-engine. He looked at his watch. To his amazement he
                     found it was ten o'clock. That was the train he intended to take. No
                     matter.
                  In case "anything happened" there were some little matters he would like to
                     arrange. There would be a few hundred pounds over when he paid the bank the
                     lost money; so he wrote a sort of last will and testament, which he enclosed in
                     the letter to Browler Brothers. When he sealed his confession, addressed it,
                     stamped it, he laid it on his table. The work was done, and it was three A. M.
                     He thought he would take a walk.
                  Out in the air he felt revived. He had eaten nothing since breakfast; he would
                     go into the play-room and get a glass of wine. Champagne was flowing there like
                     water. A biscuit and a glass—and another. Then he heard an altercation in an
                     ante-room, and recognised Mr. Lamont's voice. A little scuffle and a blow
                     distinctly heard. Mr. Grippe did not like fighting, so he slipped out
                     again.
                  Down the street and away from the glare of the lights: presently on the unpaved
                     road and under the starlight. A lovely night for a quiet walk. The letter was
                     written; also the last will and testament; he would take a good long walk.
                  Not many houses on this road. Half-a-mile from the hotel they ceased
                     altogether. Positive country. How still and placid the stars look! so cold and
                     indifferent, blinking in the heavens like ten thousand eyes. The odor of the
                     trees is pleasant. This is a wild sort of country to be within gun-shot of
                     Baden. Regular forest now, the road overshadowed by trees. Here is a hill and a
                     path climbing it, deflecting from the road. Where does the path lead? Let us
                     see.
                  Up and up. He sat down on a rock and rested. No asthma; perhaps champagne was a
                     remedy. He had left some poetry in his private drawer in Gloucester: whatever
                     possessed him to write it? If he had only burnt that nonsense before he left
                     home he would be entirely happy.
                  Up again. And here is the top of the hill, and the stars again, as he emerges
                     from the shadow of the trees. An open plateau with trees all around. What is
                     this? Oh yes! he remembers. Lamont had told him of it: L'Abme Noir.
                  And now the crisis had come; for down that black abyss he was going. He
                     chuckled as he recalled the little subterfuges he had been repeating as he
                     walked, all to himself; for when he concluded that last will and testament, his
                     purpose to find the Black Abyss and sound its depths was as clearly defined as
                     possible.
                  The stars were obtrusive in their attentions; really, it would have been less
                     unpleasant to have had pitch darkness. Then he might have fallen into the rift
                     by accident. He looked over the edge and saw that the cleft sloped away from
                     the perpendicular. The stars would be balked in five seconds after he took the
                     leap.
                  Oh what a sorry termination of a history! Anthony Grippe, who had never known
                     the force of a temptation to go astray in any of the paths that usually tempt
                     young men. Drinking, gambling—why, he had no more stomach for such things than
                     he had for murder.
                  Murder! When Mr. Lamont invited him to a little mutual murder he had some ado
                     to refrain from laughter. To aim a pistol at another man and pull the trigger!
                     Why, he would hardly do it to save his own life. But falling over that brink
                     would be called self-murder.
                  Nobody would know it, however; and once done—
                  And then all those common doctrines relating to a future state came trooping
                     into his mind. He caught himself twice repeating the Nicene Creed, every word
                     of which seemed invested with new and startling emphasis.
                  "I believe in the resurrection of the dead, and the life everlasting."
                  He walked restlessly to and fro, debating a hundred questions in his mind. How
                     would it do to go directly to Gloucester and tell the story to Mr. Browler
                     senior; then to take what remained of his life's earnings and emigrate?
                     Australia or America—he might begin afresh.
                  But it was so flagrant a breach of trust, to gamble away that money. He could
                     never face Browler. Better face the dread realities at the bottom of the chasm.
                     He knelt down on the rock and covered his face with his hands to shout out the
                     starlight. There was also a faint streak in the eastern sky. When he looked up
                     again a man stood before him.
                  "Grippe!"
                  He staggered to his feet and would have passed him, but he caught his arm and
                     held him with a grasp of iron.
                  "What are you doing, madman? Another step, and you would be in the abyss."
                  "I know. Let me go, Mr. Trumpley. I am ruined. I have gambled in that infernal
                     den and lost my partners' money."
                  "Pooh! don't be an ass. Money! How much have you lost?"
                  "Twenty-five hundred pounds."
                  
                  "Bah! I've been looking for you. I went into your chamber and waited for you an
                     hour; and not finding you I left written instructions for you in my portmanteau
                     in your room. Here is the key. There are twenty-five thousand pounds in the
                     portmanteau, which I desire you to invest. Your commission is ten per centum;
                     take it out and repay your losses. Yonder comes the daylight—away with you! I
                     shall have company here in a few minutes; go down the hill on the other side.
                     You will reach Baden in time for the first train. Give me your hand, man.
                     Good-bye! Don't go into the play-room; that is the true Abme Noir."
               
               
                  CHAPTER XLIV.
                  THE ENCOUNTER.
                  Harold Trumpley had arrived at the Hotel d'Angleterre while Mr. Grippe was
                     writing his last will and testament. He found his wife's maid Marie, who told
                     him an incoherent story of Mrs. Trumpley's arrival and departure. The girl only
                     knew that she had left in the train for Chlons; she had gone down to the
                     station, having been dismissed for the night, to bid adieu to a sister going to
                     Paris, and saw Madame enter the same train. Monsieur le Capitaine was at Maison
                     Rouge in the morning, and would perhaps know.
                  Mr. Trumpley went to the play-room. After some search he found Captain Merton
                     and M. Lamont in an ante-room. They had some broiled bones and champagne.
                  "Hillo, Trumpley!" said the Captain, hilariously. "Welcome! We will have in
                     another bottle."
                  "Not for me," answered Mr. Trumpley; "I came to ask you if you know of my
                     wife's departure for Chlons."
                  "Chlons!" said the sailor, with drunken gravity. "Well, well! Belay that and
                     start afresh. So she went to Chlons! You see, Lamont, our friend here has a
                     female acquaintance in Chlons—ha, ha!—a certain Madame Hamet. He slips away
                     yesterday to visit her, and some kind friend informs Madame Trumpley, and she
                     naturally gives chase."
                  "Who was the kind friend?" said Trumpley.
                  "How the devil should I know?" answered Merton, rudely.
                  "The kind friend lied. If you meet him, tell him from me that he is a liar and
                     sneak."
                  "Belay again," said Merton. "You must take that back, Trumpley; the friend is a
                     lady. She wrote a confidential note—"
                  "Yes; I found it. Also the other, not written by a lady, but by a cowardly
                     thief who dared not sign his name. It is one lie in both notes."
                  "Do you know who wrote them?" said Merton, slightly sobered.
                  "I think I do," answered Trumpley, with stern emphasis.
                  "Then here is the answer!" said Merton, seizing his glass and dashing the wine
                     in the scowling face of the other. In a moment he was caught by the throat,
                     lifted from his chair, and after a shake that nearly dislocated his joints, was
                     thrown in a heap on the floor. Lamont caught his arm as he rose.
                  "When will you answer this?" said Merton, gasping.
                  "When you will," replied Trumpley, coldly. "You had better get sober first.
                     Lamont, take the brute out and pump on him. If he wants me—"
                  "Here and now!" said Merton, stamping violently.
                  "Pooh! The servants would have the house about our ears in two minutes. I shall
                     be at L'Aime Noir at daybreak. Lamont, have you pistols?"
                  "Truly, a superb pair. Helas! can we not reconcile this little difference? No?
                     Impossible? Eh bien! The sword is so much more quiet; I have also a pair of
                     faultless blades. What say you, Merton?"
                  "Mr. Trumpley has the selection. I know very little about the sword," said
                     Captian Merton, sullenly.
                  "And I less," replied Trumpley. "Bring the pistols, Lamont. I will find a
                     friend to accompany me. Au revoir!"
                  Three hours to spare. Mr. Trumpley filled several pages of letter paper,
                     writing rapidly and without hesitation. When the task was completed, he sealed
                     the packet and addressed it to Mr. Anthony Grippe. He took a large package of
                     bank-notes from his breast, enclosed them in a separated envelope, and
                     addressed it to the same person. Taking these in his hand, he passed through
                     the corridor to Mr. Grippe's room, knocked, and receiving no answer, opened the
                     door and entered. There was a light on the table, a portmanteau and a letter
                     addressed to the bank at Gloucester. Mr. Grippe was not visible. Trumpley
                     returned to his own apartment, and placing his packages in a small portmanteau,
                     with his watch and seals, Dora's jewel-case, which he found in a drawer of the
                     cabinet, and from which he took the two anonymous notes, he looked the
                     portmanteau and took it to Grippe's
                     chamber, leaving it upon the table beside the other. He then put out Mr.
                     Grippe's light and closed his door. One hour gone. A servant passed as he
                     regained his own room, and Mr. Trumpley stopped him at the door.
                  "If I should not be here at seven o'clock, send Mrs. Trumpley's maid to Maison
                     Rouge at that hour in the carriage. I will leave a note on the cabinet. Will
                     you remember?"
                  "Without doubt, Monsieur."
                  Trumpley put some silver in his ready hand and dismissed him, and then wrote
                     his final note:—
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Dear Sister Daisy:—Dora has gone to Chlons, and will
                                 probably be back to-morrow. I enclose two notes which I found here.
                                 They are lies; one written by Merton, the other by Miss Radcliffe.
                                 The former is a born liar; the latter has no cause for her
                                 malignant enmity except that I declined to make her mistress of
                                 Halidon. It pains me to write this of a woman, but it is true. I
                                 have a presentiment of impending calamity, and it has oppressed me
                                 for two days. A few hours hence it will be dispelled or confirmed.
                                 I go from this place to L'Abime Noir. If I return, you will not
                                 receive this note. My executor will have full particulars of the
                                 Chlons business. Farewell.
                              
                                 "HAROLD TRUMPLEY."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  It was after five o'clock when Mr. Trumpley climbed the ill of L'Abime Noir,
                     and a few minutes after Mr. Grippe disappeared below the crest of the hill on
                     one side M. Lamont and Captain Merton appeared upon the other. The Captain was
                     dressed in black, his coat buttoned up to the throat. M. Lamont had a pistol
                     case under his arm. They bowed ceremoniously to Trumpley, who quietly waited
                     their approach.
                  "Monsieur Lamont," he said, "I regret that I have not been able to find a
                     second. Will you do me the favor to arrange the preliminaries of this
                     encounter?"
                  "Ma foi!" said the Frenchman, "this is terribly irregular, Monsieur. Suppose
                     anything serious should occur to both of you gentlemen? I should be
                     compromised. Permit me to return to Baden, and I will find an acquaintance who
                     will kindly act for you."
                  "Very well, Monsieur," answered Trumpley. "Entrust your pistols to me during
                     your absence; Captain Merton will wait with me."
                  "Lamont," said Merton, hoarsely, "don't be a fool! Load the weapons and place
                     us."
                  "Eh bien! What is to be done? Do you not see—"
                  "Listen," said Trumpley; "I will show you the way from all difficulty. Load
                        one pistol. Go down yonder out of sight and make the
                     preparations. If Captain Merton does not object, he shall have the choice when
                     you return."
                  "There is no surgeon—"
                  "No need of a surgeon; only one of us will be damaged, and he will be beyond
                     surgical skill. It is not necessary that both should die."
                  "This is not a duel," said the Frenchman; "it is a murder."
                  "Pish!" answered Trumpley; "it is the only sensible method of settlement. I
                     fought one duel with pistols, and I then swore that I would never fight another
                     except in this manner. The earth is not large enough to hold me and Captain
                     Merton both on its surface. Unless he objects to my proposal, five minutes will
                     suffice to show which of us shall remain."
                  "Let it be so, Lamont," said Merton. "It is not usual, but if Mr. Trumpley had
                     a friend here acting under his instructions, you would be compelled to
                     acquiesce; the choice is with him."
                  M. Lamont bowed gravely and retired below the brow of the hill. The two enemies
                     stood a little apart, silent and calm. The little streak of light in the
                     eastern horizon had widened, and the fleecy clouds that hung over the pathway
                     of the coming sun were flecked with orange-spots. The gloom of the dismal
                     plateau was deepened as the light increased, and the ray that shot from the
                     edge of the bright disk fell upon the pallid faces of the two men, and lent to
                     them a ghastly expression that was hideous.
                  M. Lamont reappeared. He placed the case on the rock between them and raised
                     the lid. The two pistols were side by side.
                  "I will now retire," said he, "to the shadow of the trees. When I reach them, I
                     will turn and drop my handkerchief. You will have had time to select the
                     weapons and cock them. When I regain my handkerchief, one of you will be
                     dead."
                  And just as the sun wheeled above the horizon, flooding the earth with light,
                     there was a sharp report on the verge of L'Abime Noir, and Harold Trumpley
                     leaped from the ground and fell dead, shot through the heart.
                  The Frenchman knelt down and turned the body over.
                  "This is a bad affair, Captain Merton," he said, sternly. "You English do not
                     fight like human beings. We have no witness to prove the fairness of this
                     encounter. I am ashamed of my part in it."
                  
                  "Is he dead?" said Merton.
                  Lamont took up the hand of the dead man and withdrew the pistol from his
                     relaxing grasp.
                  "Your bullet has gone through him—dead as Henri Quatre."
                  "What need of witnesses?" said Merton, brutally. "Let us throw him into the
                     cleft."
                  "Fi donc!" replied Lamont. "Come away! Leave
                     him where he lies. You and I will cross the frontier and let some one else tell
                     the story. I am dumb on the subject henceforth. Allons!"
                  And when the banker was seated in his office in Marseilles, and the white wings
                     of Captain Merton's ship were bearing him towards Malta, all Baden was ringing
                     with the story of the English gentleman who had wandered away to the dismal
                     hill, after winning fabulous sums from the bank, to be waylaid, robbed and
                     murdered by some of the brigands who always flocked to the watering-place in
                     the season. The body was carried to England to be laid in his ancestral tomb.
                     Mr. and Mrs. Grahame followed shortly after, their departure being delayed by
                     the lady's serious illness, caused by the terrible shock. New arrivals at the
                     Hotel d'Angleterre filled up the vacated rooms, and bringing new gossip with
                     them from the busy world without, they speedily chased away the memory of
                     Harold Trumpley and his party. Miss Radcliffe went to Geneva, thence to Italy,
                     and when the winter came on she was at Naples, happening by a fortunate chance
                     to find Captain Merton's ship there. Maison Rouge was once more turned over to
                     the owls and bats. Mr. Grahame went to Chlons the day after the duel, and
                     brought back to his distracted wife no tidings of Dora; and it was not until
                     they were safe in the Blackfriars parsonage, and her health partially restored,
                     that he told her the sequel of the Chlons story.
                  There had been a fire, sweeping away a dozen houses, and among them Number
                     Four, Rue Saint Jean. A Sister of Charity, Sister Clementine, had been
                     acquainted with the locality, and told of an English lady who had entered this
                     house an hour before the fire. She had met her in the passage, seeking Madame
                     Hamet, who had died two days before; but no one had seen this lady come out,
                     and among the few articles saved from the flames were a bonnet and shawl,
                     charred and ruined, but not beyond identification. And these relics Mr. Grahame
                     took away with him, assured that the hapless owner of them had passed through
                     the dark portals at the same hour that her husband met his death at L'Abme
                     Noir.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XLV.
                  
                     THE WILL.
                     In the name of God, amen. I, Harold Trumpley, of Halidon, Gloucester,
                        gentleman, being in sound mind, albeit in sore distress, do make this my
                        only will and testament.
                     I give and bequeath to my dear wife, Dora Lennox Trumpley, all the property
                        of which I die possessed, and that may be devised by will, subject to the
                        conditions that follow:
                     Whereas my death, if it should occur to-day, will have been caused by
                        certain events in my past history, it is needful that I relate those events
                        herein, in order that my executor shall appreciate the nature of the
                        obligations resting upon him as my representative.
                     Eight months ago I left Halidon greatly perplexed, owing to the condition of
                        my estate, which had just been unfolded to me by my legal adviser, and also
                        in doubt as to the success of long-cherished purposes and desires. I went to
                        Paris, and finding acquaintances there, engaged in play night after night at
                        the Strangers' Club. I played ecart with some success, winning every night
                        for a week. Among other losers was a Monsieur Hamet, who rose from the table
                        one night saying that such continued success could not be accounted for,
                        except upon the supposition that I knew the cards by their backs. I had won
                        a few thousand francs from this gentleman. I demanded the instant retraction
                        of this injurious and false charge, and as he persisted I invited him to the
                        Bois du Boulogne. We met the next morning and fought with pistols, and it
                        was my dire misfortune to kill him at the first fire. My second hurried me
                        away to Chlons, where I remained until the danger of arrest was over. While
                        there, I learned that the widow of this gentleman lived there with an infant
                        daughter. They were in poor circumstances; he was a writer engaged upon one
                        of the daily papers in Paris, and the family revenues ended with his
                        life.
                     I had rooms in Chlons, at No. 4 Rue St. Jean, and Madame Hamet took the
                        second floor of the same house. I frequently met the child in the passages,
                        was attracted by her prattle, and was led by her to her mother's apartments,
                        where I discovered her relationship to the man I had slain. It was clear
                        that the support of this helpless family devolved upon me, and during the
                        past eight months I have supplied their wants out of my scanty revenues. Two
                        days ago I was suddenly denly
                        summoned to Chlons by the announcement of Madame Hamet's approaching death.
                        I arrived one hour before she died, and she confided the little Helose to my
                        care with her latest breath.
                     I took the child away from the death-chamber, and gave her in charge of
                        Madame Villaire, at the convent of Saint Jacques (where she is known as
                        Sister Clementine). I paid her the needful expenses of the child's
                        maintenance and education for five years. I made this large payment because
                        I was oppressed with a presentiment of approaching death, which still clings
                        to me.
                     I spoke of scanty revenues. Since my marriage I have heard from my
                        solicitor, who assured me that my estate would bear no more encumbrance, and
                        that he could furnish me with no more money. The last mortgage was created
                        on the eve of my marriage, yielding me only two thousand pounds, all of
                        which was expended except a hundred, with which I entered the play-room at
                        Baden on Monday night last. I played wildly and recklessly, and won
                        twentysix thousand pounds. Out of this money I have paid my local bills at
                        Baden and the expenses referred to at Chlons, and the remainder, twenty-five
                        thousand pounds in notes on the Bank of England and the Bank of France, I
                        herewith place in the hands of my executor.
                     The charges I put upon him relate first to the infant Helose. I desire that
                        he shall go to Chlons immediately, see the child, confer with Madame
                        Villaire, and make such arrangements as seem best to him for the future.
                        While he lives, and while Helose lives, I charge him to be a father to her,
                        as I would have been, and to see that she is reared a gentlewoman; and if
                        she should marry at proper age, to see that she is portioned as becomes a
                        daughter of my house. My wife will approve of this arrangement, and will
                        approve of my purpose to leave the twenty-five thousand pounds in the hands
                        of my executor—her property, but subject to this charge.
                     The second charge relates to Halidon. After my death the mortgages will be
                        foreclosed and the property will be sold. I desire my executor to purchase
                        this estate, in the name of Dora Lennox Trumpley, should she be alive at the
                        date of such sale; and if not, to purchase it in his own name, holding it in
                        trust for final disposal as follows:
                     Failing my wife, whose death alone can divert the inheritance from her, my
                        sister, Edith Trumpley, is the natural inheritor of Halidon, and of all my
                        estate. She has an annuity of five hundred pounds, under my father's will,
                        the principal of which reverts to Halidon and its owner at her death. This
                        will, made by our father, Oswald Trumpley, is peculiar. Proud of his pure
                        Saxon blood, he expressly provides that Halidon shall not pass to a female
                        of the race, but may pass to her son, "if his father is of pure Saxon
                        strain," and if this son take the name of Trumpley at his majority. In the
                        absence of formal entail, my solicitor informs me, this provision could not
                        be sustained; but the desire of my father, thus clearly expressed, has with
                        me all the force of a legal enactment. I therefore cannot bequeath Halidon
                        to Edith, directly; but it is my will and desire that my executor shall hold
                        this estate until the son of my sister shall attain his majority, being the
                        son of a Saxon gentleman, and shall assume the name of his maternal
                        grandfather, Oswald Trumpley, when my executor will place him in possession
                        of my estate and its accretions.
                     These general directions also apply to the furniture at present in the
                        house, and to all such movable property, such as carriages and the like, as
                        may now pertain to the establishment. I desire and will that the general
                        arrangement of the house and grounds shall not be changed, in so far as
                        change may be avoided; that the deer in the park shall be cared for, and the
                        adornment of the grounds which I have begun shall be continued and
                        completed.
                     The record of my marriage will be found at the British Legation in Paris. I
                        met my wife there unexpectedly, less than three months ago, and we came to
                        Baden, after spending a week at Chlons. I have not communicated with any one
                        in England, excepting my solicitor, and to him I said nothing of my
                        marriage, as our correspondence related only to pecuniary arrangements.
                     I prefer that all the visible property standing in my name shall be sold
                        under the various liens upon it, because I cannot enumerate my debts, and
                        the law will thus liquidate all that are just. The money entrusted to my
                        executor is intended to begin afresh the formation of an estate, to be
                        inherited, first, by my wife, and second, by the son of my sister, without
                        any possible claims to be contested.
                     But it is also necessary to provide for the failure of this second
                        intention. Should there be no male heir born to Edith Trumpley, or should
                        such an heir be born not of Saxon paternity, then my executor is hereby
                        invested with all the rights herein conveyed, with no conditions or
                        limitations excepting those relating to Helose.
                     And I name and appoint Mr. Anthony Grippe, banker, of Gloucester, England,
                        at present in Baden, my sole executor; and I do cheerfully place all these
                        trusts in his hands, relying confidently upon his known integrity; and I
                        hereby give and bequeath to him ten per centum of the moneys conveyed as his
                        commission for the faithful appropriation of the residue. And I will and
                        devise that so much of those moneys as may remain in his hands after the
                        purchase of Halidon shall be employed by him in his business, and such a
                        proportion of the gains upon it as he shall decide to be just shall be added
                        to the total transferred by him to the first and second inheritors herein
                        before described. If my wife shall survive me, and obtain possession of
                        Halidon, as provided in this testament, then I desire my executor to furnish
                        her with her just proportion of such interest or profits until the maturity
                        and marriage of Helose, as provided, herein; and after this event, I will
                        and desire that she, Dora Lennox Trumpley, shall assume the absolute custody
                        and control of all my estate.
                     The presentiment of evil under which I write this will and testament is not
                        new to me, and hitherto some calamity has always followed these
                        premonitions. This time the feeling is peculiarly portentous, and I feel a
                        similar apprehension of impending evil threatening my wife. In so far as I
                        am able, I earnestly pray that evil may be averted from her; yet I make
                        these additional provisions lest the presentiment should prove truer than my
                        petitions.
                     Done at Baden-Baden this twenty-ninth day of August, in the year 1845.
                        Witness my hand and seal.
                     
                        HAROLD TRUMPLEY of Halidon.
                        Witness: JULES PREESET, Commissionaire.
                        Witness: ADOLPHE DUMAS.
                     
                  
                  
                     Mr. Grippe read this document in the gray morning-light while the train from
                        Baden was receding from that town at the rate of forty miles an hour, and
                        before the first stopping-place was reached he had made some changes in his
                        luggage.
                     The package of bank-notes he placed in the leg of his boot, the will in a
                        pocket on the inside of his waistcoat, the watch and seals in the other
                        boot-leg, carefully wrapped in various papers; and he dropped Mr. Trumpley's
                        portmanteau, now emptied, out the car window when the train was crossing a
                        stream. It was bound with heavy brass hoops, and he saw it turn over once
                        and then disappear under the rushing waters. His carriage contained no other
                        passengers, perhaps because he had indulged in a cigarette or two while
                        waiting at the station, and the pleasant odor of stramonium did not attract
                        the three or four voyagers who thrust their noses in at the door.
                     Arrived at Chlons, he promptly sought and found Sister Clementine, who
                        fortunately understood English. He saw the child, bright and happy, totally
                        unconscious of her bereavement; and leaving his address with Madame
                        Villaire, who seemed to be an authority at the convent, he arranged for
                        monthly reports to be sent him at Gloucester, and formally assumed the
                        charge of Helose and the direction of her future. The name of the banker
                        impressed the ex-court lady, whose husband had signed himself "De la
                        Villaire"—much more profoundly than that of Trumpley de Halidon. Such is
                        life.
                     When all was done, he had time to catch the Paris train. Here he remained
                        until the succeeding day, sleeping in his boots. On the following morning he
                        deposited his money with Messrs. Delisle Frres, thereby reducing the
                        apparent development of his calves materially. Twenty-five hundred pounds
                        were placed to the credit of Browler Brothers, and twenty-two thousand five
                        hundred to the credit of Anthony Grippe.
                     On the third day he was in Gloucester. Mr. Browler senior met him at the
                        station; he had a paper containing a tragic story. Mr. Harold Trumpley had
                        been murdered near Baden, and his wife, ministering to a sick woman at
                        Chlons, had fallen asleep after a tiresome journey, and perished in the
                        flames of a conflagration that had swept away half a street. Mr. Grippe
                        could answer no questions, as he was momently strangling under an aggravated
                        attack of asthma, which kept him abed nine days, at the end of which period
                        people forgot he had been to Baden.
                  
               
               
                  CHAPTER XLVI.
                  EXIT DORA.
                  Instead of getting out at the proper stations, Dora left the railway-carriage
                     at Cannon Street. It was early twilight, and the city streets were thronged.
                     She was jostled by the hurrying crowds, and after passing St. Paul's
                     churchyard, she turned down a quiet street and paused irresolute at a
                     door-step. While she stood, the door opened and a woman came out.
                  "Lodgins, mum?" she said, looking curiously at the worn face. "Lodgins? First
                     floor back wacant—ten shillin' a week. Will you look at the rooms?"
                  
                  "Yes," replied Dora, promptly. "Can you get me some tea and a chop?"
                  "Surely; walk in, mum. 'Ere's the rooms. Commodious. You can see the river from
                     the winder over this. Tea and a chop? Four-and-six, mum. Ah, furrin gold! Take
                     off yet cloak, mum. Oh, only a cape. Will you wait, mum, for the tea?" I'll be
                     back in a jiffy."
                  "And bring a doctor," said Dora as the woman was leaving; "something ails my
                     head."
                  "All right, mum. There's a doctor at the corner; I'll 'ave him in a jiffy."
                  While she was gone Dora undressed rapidly. As she took off her stays, she
                     noticed a little rent exposing the whalebone, and with a cunning smile on her
                     face she thrust two or three Napoleons into the opening, leaving eight or nine
                     in her purse. When the landlady returned, followed by a bald old gentleman with
                     green goggles over his eyes, Dora was abed.
                  "What is your name?" said she.
                  "Mrs. 'Arris, mum."
                  "Well, Mrs. Harris, here is my purse; please take care of it for me. Doctor—are
                     you the doctor?"
                  "Yes. Let me have your hand. So. You are fatigued. Where do you suffer?"
                  "My head. Can you give me something to make me sleep? I have not slept for
                     three days. Ah me! shall I ever sleep again?"
                  "I shall give you a draught; Mrs. Harris will be get it," answered the doctor.
                     "Keep quiet as you can. We will be better to-morrow perhaps."
                  Mrs. Harris brought the draught and a cup of tea in due time; also a chop done
                     to a turn.
                  "'Changed your furrin gold, mum," she began; "sixteen shillings. One week's
                     rent, ten; tea and chop, four-and-six; bread and butter, sixpence. I 'ave the
                     hodd shillin' in your purse, mum. Try to swaller a bite, mum. You'll pay the
                     doctor for the draught. Take it now, mum? The 'andle is off the cup; but you
                     won't mind that. Can't eat your chop? Well, drink the tea, poor dear! Which you
                     'avent told me your name, mum, if any one should call."
                  "Madame Hamet, Numero Quatre, Rue Saint Jean," said Dora, rousing herself with
                     difficulty.
                  "Can't remember all that," muttered the landlady. "Will you 'ave anything more,
                     mum?"
                  "No. Run out please, and take away the light."
                  Mrs. Harris retired to the kitchen, taking the untasted supper with her. While
                     she munched the chop, she counted Dora's money and soliloquised.
                  "Nine furrin pieces and a shillin'," she said. "The doctor will 'ave to be
                     paid; I'll lay aside a couple for him. That leaves seven. She talks purty fair
                     Hinglish. I must git a girl to wait on her, of course. That's another. And I'm
                     worrited so with her furrin ways and her sickness that I'll 'ave a spell
                     myself. That's two more. Four furrin pieces won't go a great way if she is sick
                     long. Must ask the doctor."
                  During the next four days and nights Dora struggled with death and the doctor.
                     She had left Baden in vigorous health, and this fact saved her life. On the
                     fifth morning Mrs. Harris found her propped up with the pillows, pale and
                     languid, but evidently in her right mind. She had repeated the same sentence a
                     hundred times in the four days, and nothing else: "Madame Hamet, Numero Quatre,
                     Rue Saint Jean."
                  The doctor was with the landlady. Mrs. Trumpley was looking wistfully at the
                     long tangled tresses of white hair that hung upon her neck and shoulders.
                  "It has turned white since I have been ill," she said. "How long have I been
                     here?"
                  "Five days, Madam," answered the doctor. "We are better to-day; the crisis was
                     last night, Madam Hamet."
                  Dora looked at him steadily without replying.
                  "We need nourishment above everything. Can you take some gruel?"
                  "Yes."
                  "And some beef-tea?"
                  "Yes."
                  "And some port-wine? Mrs. Harris, I'll send the wine. Open the
                     shutter, please. Ah, the light hurts your eyes."
                  "Yes. Can you get me glasses like yours?"
                  "The very thing. Mrs. Harris, send to the surgery in half-an-hour. I will leave
                     the wine and the glasses—"
                  "And your bill, Doctor," said the patient. "Mrs. Harris, you have my
                     purse."
                  "Yes, mum," replied the landlady, rather landlady, rather appalled by the
                     sudden restoration of reason, and rather subdued by the quiet authority in
                     Dora's manner. "'Ere it is, mum. I've 'ad to spend some—"
                  
                  "No doubt, Mrs. Harris. Thank you. We will settle to-morrow. I feel almost able
                     to go out. May I venture, Doctor?"
                  "Well, not to-day, Madam," replied the doctor; "we are not so strong as we
                     think. When we can take—hum—say a beef-steak with relish—say to-morrow. We have
                     had a severe attack; nothing but a strong constitution and the most watchful
                     attendance and most prompt treatment of symptoms could have brought us through.
                     Allow me," and he felt her pulse. "Ninety-one; a little febrile still, but the
                     crisis is past. I think we can reply upon the vis
                        medicatrix now. And the wine—"
                  "Will not beer do as well, Doctor? I do not like wine."
                  "Ah, well, perhaps," answered the doctor, relinquishing two shillings profit
                     with a struggle; "if we think beer agrees with us better. Bass, Mrs.
                     Harris."
                  In the evening Dora was up and dressed. Mrs. Harris had brought her a paper,
                     and it contained the frightful story that Mr. Grippe had heard on his return to
                     Gloucester, with some additions. Mr. Harold Trumpley of Halidon, Gloucester,
                     had been waylaid and murdered near Baden, and his body had been brought across
                     Channel and interred with the bones of his ancestors at Merton. His wife had
                     died at Chlons, and her body had been consumed in the great fire described in a
                     previous paper. Dora read this account twenty times, as if trying to fix the
                     tragic events in her memory. There was a dull sensation in her mind less
                     agonising that would have been possible had she not been more or less demented.
                     The journey from Baden to London was like a troubled dream, in the midst of
                     which the episode at Chlons, with the dead woman on the bed, the incessant
                     sweep of the rain, and the forlorn horror of her own condition, betrayed and
                     cast out, were the salient points. She dimly remembered her arrival at her
                     lodgings, and the secretion of the few coins in her stays. The death of her
                     husband seemed the natural accompaniment of the story, and the sense of
                     bereavement was less acute than the sense of unspeakable injury and wrong done
                     to her. The memory of her sister was apparently effaced entirely, and there
                     gradually grew upon her a positive doubt of her own identity. She crept into
                     bed at last without undressing, and once in the night she arose, and with her
                     white hair streaming around her she paced the narrow chamber, somnambulic.
                     Crazed, positively; yet retaining such semblance of reason that no one ignorant
                     of her previous history would have suspected the aberration.
                  She was up early the next day. Mrs. Harris brought her a beefsteak steak and
                     beer; her bodily health came back rapidly, and her appetite was ravenous. After
                     breakfast she sat an hour or two poring over the paper again. She read and
                     re-read the dismal paragraph, and finally tore off that side of the sheet and
                     put it in her pocket. As she was folding the fragment, a word on the opposite
                     side caught her eye. It was an advertisement:
                  "Wanted: A housekeeper, to take charge of Beechwood, near Gloucester, at
                     present unoccupied. Apply, with references, to Mr. Codicil, Number Six, Old
                     Court, City, at ten o'clock A. M."
                  When she had read this two or three times, laboring to fix the locality of "Old
                     Court" in her mind, she suddenly started up and went into the street. At the
                     door she met Mrs. Harris.
                  "Lawks!" said that lady; "you come on me like a ghost! Are you going out? You
                     'ave no bonnet."
                  "Lend me yours," replied Dora, promptly.
                  "Taint fit for the likes o' you," said the landlady, taking it off, however.
                     Dora tied it on her head, and going to the corner, which was a cab-stand,
                     entered one of the vehicles. The driver touched his hat as he closed the
                     door.
                  "Number six, Old Court."
                  She paid the fare when the cabman let her out, and walked up the stone steps,
                     glancing at the signs on the doors in the hall. A boy came out of one of the
                     offices, and stared at her curiously.
                  "Where is Mr. Codicil's." she asked.
                  "In 'ere, mum," answered the boy; "walk in, mum. He will be 'ere every minnit
                     now. Take a seat, mum."
                  Left to herself, she began to arrange her thoughts. What should she say to Mr.
                     Codicil? She took out the bit of paper and read the advertisement again.
                     References!
                  And then by that mysterious faculty or instinct, or what you may please to call
                     it, by which insane persons reach swift decisions, she emerged from the
                     difficulty on the instant. She had noticed a stationer's shop adjoining Number
                     six, and she quietly walked out of the office, down the steps and into the
                     shop.
                  "A sheet of note-paper, please," she said to the shopman; "a pen and ink and
                     envelope," and she laid a sixpence on the counter.
                  And when Mr. Codicil arrived, half-an-hour later, he found an old woman with
                     green spectacles and a poke-bonnet waiting patiently in his office. She seemed
                     to be deaf, but put a note in his hand, which he opened and read as
                     follows:
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "BEECHWOOD, October 1st, 1844.
                              
                              "The bearer, Mrs. Hamet, is well known to me, and I confidently
                                 recommended her to any one needing a housekeeper, as eminently
                                 trustworthy and capable.
                              
                                 DORA LENNOX."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  Mrs. Harris never saw the old poke-bonnet, and never received the pay for it
                     directly; and through she referred to the loss of it so long as she remained
                     above-ground as a heinous robbery, she probably had secured its value in her
                     previous provisions against contingencies while she had custody of Dora's
                     purse.
               
            
            
               BOOK V.
               SOME ODD TRICKS.
               
                  CHAPTER XLVII.
                  ANOTHER.
                  The Third Book in this history closed with the account of an interview between
                     Mr. Wailes and Mr. Radcliffe Merton which was the reverse of friendly. There
                     had been a growing coolness between these old friends, and their later
                     intercourse had been marked by sundry cross-purposes, and the creation of
                     sundry suspicions on either side. First of all, each had detected the other's
                     admiration of Mabel; and the knowledge that each possessed of Mr. Clinton's
                     rapid progress in that lady's favor did not modify their private antagonism. It
                     was one of those cases in which a junction of forces against a common enemy was
                     not to be thought of. The young men had discovered that they were predestined
                     rivals at the Halidon dinner-table, only by intercepting glances, bold on one
                     side and shy on the other. Next came the revelation to Trumpley that Mr. Merton
                     was on good terms with Blauvelt, and Merton's discovery that Trump was silent
                     and suspicious. Therefore, when Radcliffe failed in his financial scheme, the
                     smouldering fires burst out, and a first-class quarrel ensued. It is very
                     probable if Mabel had remained at Blackfriars, their old friendship would not
                     have terminated so rudely. Radcliffe had learned to endure what he called
                     Trump's "milk-soppishness," after many trials of his patience when Wailes
                     steadyfastly refused to join in his questionable adventures; and Wailes had
                     learned to wink at Rad's numerous aberrations, under the delusion that he would
                     be wiser when he grew older. But now the breach was positive and past the possibility of healing; their
                     old relations could never be restored. A pair of gentle eyes had enlightened
                     them both together.
                  Mr. Grippe came into Trumpley's office at three o'clock, with his hat on.
                  "Letters all gone?" he said.
                  "Yes, sir," answered Trump.
                  "Are you going to move to-morrow?"
                  "No, sir; this evening."
                  "Hump! you are prompt. Come on; I have to send the carriage to Merton this
                     afternoon, and I will send you in it. Give me your arm, please; you can set me
                     down at Halidon."
                  When Mr. Grippe got out, and the lodge-gates were out of sight, Wailes arranged
                     in his mind the proceedings that would be necessary. To get out of Rose Cottage
                     was the first thing, and to get out all the Wailes property was the next. The
                     furniture belonged to the house. They had taken all their belongings in trunks
                     a year or two ago when they arrived from the Continent. He would stop at Rose
                     Cottage long enough to tell his mother of Rad's rudeness, and then go on to
                     Merton and hire a van. They would go directly to Gloucester to the Royal Hotel,
                     and find a permanent home to-morrow.
                  Arrived at the stile, James opened the carriage-door, and as Trump descended,
                     that grave footman handed him a letter.
                  "For Missus Wailes, sir," said James. "I'm to wait for a hanswer."
                  "Are you going to the village, James?" answered Trump; "if so, I'll go with you
                     in a minute."
                  "Dunnon, sir. I filler your directions," said James; "Mr. Grippe said I would
                     get my horders from you."
                  Wondering what this could mean, Trumpley crossed the stile and met his mother
                     on the little lawn. She was snipping off some late roses for the
                     dinner-table.
                  "Why, Trump," she said, advancing to meet him, "what is the matter? You are
                     nearly two hours before your time."
                  "Nothing, Mother; only we have to move. Mr. Merton wants the Cottage."
                  "Mr. Merton?"
                  "Yes; Mr. Radcliffe Merton. I told him we would vacate it tomorrow, and he said
                     he would like to have it this afternoon. Mr. Grippe was kind enough to send me
                     down in his carriage. I will go to Merton and get a van, and come back in a
                     cab. We can go to Gloucester easily before dark, and to-morrow we will find a
                     house. I am sorry to take you away from your flowers, Mother; but it was not my
                     fault."
                  Mrs. Wailes had the roses in a dainty little apron; she let go the corners as
                     Trump spoke, and the flowers were scattered over the green lawn. She walked
                     over them towards the house.
                  "Away with you, Trump!" she said; "you can tell me about it as we go. I will
                     pack up, while you are gone. Trump, agree with the man about the price; you are
                     such a reckless vagabond! And you think you are rolling in wealth, with your
                     twelve hundred a year. What letter is that?"
                  "Oh, I forgot it, Mother," answered Trump. "It is from Mr. Grippe. I suppose;
                     James gave it to me at the stile. I'm off!"
                  "Stop, sir! Let us see what—Hay! it is quite an epistle. Let us sit down here
                     and read. What a nice hand he write! It is far better than yours, Trump."
                  Spreading the sheet out upon her lap, the good lady read:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Dear Madam:—The late Mr. Trumpley entrusted me with
                                 certain moneys before his death, with written instructions, which
                                 may now be carried out. Your compliance with some provisions is
                                 needful; and one of these provisions is, that you shall reside at
                                 Halidon. Your apartments over the South Terrace have been carefully
                                 kept as you left them, and they now wait your return. I beg you to
                                 occupy them at once—this evening. I send the carriage for you, and
                                 the spring cart will be at Rose Cottage before you will have packed
                                 your trunks. Mr. Trumpley Wailes' room is also prepared, and his
                                 occupation of it is also a part of these instructions. At the
                                 proper time I will produce these documents, and hope to satisfy you
                                 that I have faithfully carried out your brother's wishes.
                              "I may add, that Mr. Radcliffe Merton's rather sudden notice to
                                 vacate Rose Cottage had nothing whatever to do with the
                                 arrangement. I had prepared my household for your arrival before I
                                 left Halidon this morning.
                              "I have the honor to be, dear Madam,
                              
                                 "Very respectfully your obed't servant.
                                 "ANTHONY GRIPPE."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  Mother and son looked at each other in mute bewilderment.
                  "What does this mean, Trump?"
                  "What does this mean, Mother?"
                  And they glared at each other again.
                  
                  "My son," said Mrs. Wailes, "you have not done well in concealing from me your
                     real feelings."
                  "Concealing from you, Mother!" answered Trump, with a guilty blush; "what can
                     you mean?"
                  "If you have known, or even suspected that Mr. Grippe was stark mad, you should
                     have told me. You must have seen some symptoms of insanity before this proof
                     arrived. What has he said to you?"
                  "Nothing about this; I am utterly at a loss to account for it. May I read the
                     note? Thank you, ma'am. 'Mr. Trumpley Wailes' room!. I have no room I can never
                     have a room at Halidon."
                  "Has Mr. Grippe said anything about Mabel to you, sir?"
                  "No, ma'ma—yes, ma'ma—that is—I don't know. He said he would help me find some
                     one. I told him it was too late—"
                  "Too late! What in the world do you mean, Trumpley?"
                  "I mean that Miss Grahame has already made her choice, or has allowed herself
                     to be chosen by—by—another—"
                  "Another what? Another great body! Another? You are as mad as Mr. Grippe.
                     Another? Oh you precious simpleton! What have you said to her?"
                  "Not a word, Mother."
                  "Who is Another, Trump?"
                  "Mr. Clinton. It is all right, Mother. He is a gentleman; he has plenty of
                     money; he is good-looking. I like him, and I am resolved to conquer the foolish
                     repugnance I feel. He invited me to-day to begin my week at Beechwood to-night,
                     and I accepted. I am going there, with your permission—"
                  "And I am going to Halidon. I will find out the bottom of this Another business
                     before I sleep."
                  "Oh, Mother, I entreat you do not even hint to Miss Grahame that I have
                     indulged in these foolish dreams! Please let events take their course; it was
                     only a passing fancy—"
                  "If I did not know you were telling stones I'd knock you down, sir. Come, help
                     me pack up—you infant! Another! Oh you wretch!"
                  Mr. Wailes followed her submissively. There was some very hasty packing done.
                     Trump's portmanteau was put in the carriage, the spring-cart was laden with
                     trunks and boxes, and they blade adieu to Rose Cottage by starlight. The keys
                     were sent to Merton Park by Milly Galt, who blundered along the lane with her
                     apron to her eyes. She also had a neat little note from Mrs. Wailes to Miss
                     Lucy, in which she regretted that she had not sooner known Mr. Radcliffe's wish
                     to have the Cottage, and enclosing the rent up to the end of the quarter, and
                     announcing the fact that she would be at Halidon, where she hoped to meet her
                     and dear Sybil, with her compliments to the Squire, her love to Sybil, and was
                     very affectionately hers, Edith Trumpley Wailes.
                  "It seems to me, Trump," quote Mrs. Wailes, as they lost sight of Milly, "that
                     Miss Lucy can detect a striking resemblance now between Mr. Radcliffe Merton
                     and Another."
                  "Whom do you mean, Mother?"
                  "I mean that amiable quadruped from Berkshire that the Squire persists in
                     showing to all his visitors, and that grunts with so much satisfaction when you
                     fill his trough."
                  "Don't be too hard on Rad, Mother. He was in a great rage, and I am afraid I
                     tantalised him. Poor Rad! he is eaten up with selfishness. I said some hard
                     things to him, as he enraged me by his insolent tones. He was constantly
                     implying that Mr. Grippe had made a mistake in clothing me with such powers,
                     and that I was insufferably conceited on account of my sudden promotion."
                  "I hope you did not quarrel, Trump," said his mother.
                  "Oh no! Rad Merton will not quarrel with me very seriously."
                  "Why not?"
                  "Because he knows I can polish him off. We have tried the gloves and the foils
                     to his entire satisfaction. I never knew Rad to engage in a contest where the
                     result was doubtful."
                  "That remark will match my reference to the gentleman from Berkshire," said
                     Mrs. Wailes. "Radcliffe is a scamp, Trumpley."
                  "Yes, a regular scamp."
                  "We will let him off now with no worse title. I hope you and he will be better
                     strangers hereafter. You never saw his mother? Well, I will tell you a secret,
                     Trump, which must go no farther. She is hateful!"
                  Mrs. Wailes said this so emphatically that the carriage stopped. They looked
                     up, and found that the lodge-gates of Halidon were swinging open. Trump
                     alighted and took his portmanteau.
                  "You will make my excuses to Mr. Grippe, Mother. A previous engagement, you
                     know; Mr. Clinton invited me as I passed Beechwood this morning."
                  "I suppose I might say two previous engagements," whispered Mrs. Wailes; "Mr.
                     Clinton's engagements to Another—or did you say there was an engagement?"
                  "I never asked, ma'ma."
                  "Well, suppose you ask him to-night. Do, Trump, just to satisfy my
                     curiosity."
                  
                  "Not I, Mother."
                  "I suppose you will let me hear from you occassionally; and I suppose I may
                     drop you a line occasionally from Halidon, that is if you take any interest in
                     Halidon?"
                  "While you are there, Mother, I take great interest."
                  "And Another? Good-night, Trump. Come nearer, my son, and let me whisper. You
                     poor goose, you milksop, you darling boy, don't be such a blockhead! There is
                     no such thing in the wide world as Another; and if there were, I'd—poison him.
                     Good-night."
               
               
                  CHAPTER XLVIII.
                  THE LIBERAL TRIO.
                  There was a Liberal Club at Merton, and Mr. Podd was president. When Mrs.
                     Wailes was dismissing Trumpley at Halidon gates, Mr. Podd was calling the
                     meeting to order. It was not a very large meeting, which was fortunate, as the
                     accommodations were limited. The hall was a loft over the carriage-builder's
                     shop, and the rent paid by the club for the premises was not in the coin of the
                     realm, but in gin, which was imbibed by the proprietor of this chamber, who was
                     also excused from the payment of the weekly dues. As a matter of pure courtesy,
                     Mr. Spokes who was also furnished with pipes and tobacco, paid for out of the
                     club treasury, through this was not in the original contract. It was a touching
                     sight, and regularly recurring, to see Mr. Spokes select a pipe, fill it, light
                     it, and lay down tuppence on the table, and to see the rude grace wherewith the
                     president pushed back the coins, saying, "None o' that' ristocratic nonsense,
                     Spokes! Pipes and baccy is free to you." And the picture was complete when Mr.
                     Spokes slipped the money back into his greasy pocket, with a murmur of
                     dissent.
                  The furniture was rather useful than ornamental. The room was Mr. Spokes'
                     dormitory, and a rickety bedstead in one corner made seats for four members, or
                     if the meeting was full, for six. Inverted paint-kegs, the seats of defunct
                     carriages, some of them cushioned, with the moss and hair sticking out of the
                     odd holes, the hubs of damaged wheels set on end, and two chairs, comprised the
                     remainder of the furniture, excepting the table, which belonged to the
                     adjoining tap-room, and was lent by the obliging publican who furnished the
                     beer, gin, and pipes.
                  On the present occasion the meeting was unusually interesting, as a stranger
                     was presented, introduced by Mr. Podd as Munseer Blowell from France. Munseer
                     Blowell was a sallow gentleman, with a black mustache covering his mouth. He
                     spoke very good English, and in a little address with which he acknowledged the
                     introduction, he assured the club that the thrones on the Continent were all
                     tottering, and that the true proprietors of all things, the producers, were
                     about to take possession of the world. There were some obstacles to be removed,
                     such as standing armies, policemen and bloated aristocrats, and the plain duty
                     of each son of freedom was to thin out the ranks of these enemies of progress
                     whenever occasion served. He had great hopes of England, as the workingmen of
                     that nation were brave to a fault, and only needed the stringent rules of
                     continental organizations to make them thoroughly efficient.
                  Munseer Blowell had not been a practical workingman; his hands were too white
                     and delicate. But he had always been a philosopher. The best efforts of his
                     useful life had been directed against governments and priestcraft. His native
                     country was Belgium, where important people were ground to the dust by effect
                     superstition. He moved to free Germany, and spent years in literary work, and
                     other years in financial operations, some of which had not been successful,
                     because absurd laws forbade forgery. And now he had come to freest England, and
                     had identified himself with the downtrodden yeomanry of that land.
                  It was a curious fact that two institutions, which priest-ridden people
                     asserted had been possessed by primal man in Eden, to wit, the Sabbath and the
                     marriage relation, were the occasion of the most flagrant wrongs under which
                     modern humanity groaned. The Sunday laws of England were huge blots on her
                     statue-books; the tyranny of the marriage-tie and the difficulties in the way
                     of divorce were an outrage upon the nineteenth century; and if Mr. Blowell
                     should finally fail in his efforts to abolish these absurdities from England,
                     his purpose was to migrate to Americans, where free love, free thoughts, free
                     theft, and free speech held perpetual carnival. The men who were in power there
                     were abreast of the age.
                  There was some desultory debate after the orator concluded his address, and the
                     meeting adjourned. The receipts of the evening proving inadequate to the outlay
                     for gin, beer and tobacco, Mr. Blowell claimed the privilege of contributing
                     three shillings to the fund, which
                     made the sum in hand equal to the publican's demands. Mr. Spokes extinguished
                     the candle and crawled into his couch, merely kicking off his boots. The club
                     separated; Mr. Blowell, who was going to Gloucester, accompanied by Mr. Podd
                     and another member, walking up the main road, by the margin of Merton's
                     Brook.
                  Arrived at the mill, they turned aside to rest on the bench that set against
                     the wall. A fierce mastiff came out of his kennel, rattling his chain and
                     growing ferociously. Mr. Podd walked up to him and kicked him in the ribs,
                     invoking sundry blessings upon his head at the same time for "his cussed
                     noise." The dog crawled submissively back into his box, and the trio peacefully
                     continued their discourse. The third Liberal was a locksmith from Gloucester,
                     who had been to Merton village repairing a defective lock that defined the
                     skill of the local workmen. It was on the door of the town-hall, and was
                     complicated.
                  "What aristocrats have you, my friend," said Mr. Blowell, "that are ripest for
                     destruction?"
                  "They're all ripe enough," answered Podd. "Wailes is the ripest. I dessay."
                  "Wailes?" said Mr. Blowell.
                  "Yes; he is the worst of the lot. He was a cadger only a month back, now he is
                     a banker; but he was as good a 'ristocrat when he was a cadger as he is
                     now."
                  "Seems to me," said the locksmith, "that the new man at Beechwood is bad as
                     any."
                  "Clinton?" replied Podd. "Yes, he is another. He's got a couple o'
                     niggers—reg'ler slaves; one of 'em told me so hisself. I'd like to skin him if
                     I could!"
                  "I fixed his locks when he came," continued the other. "He has a chest in the
                     hall that weighs a ton. I s'pose he keeps his plate in it. I mended that lock
                     too."
                  "What sort o' lock?" said Podd, in a husky whisper.
                  "Werry peculiar; the tumbler falls unexpected like. I worked two hours on that
                     cussed lock before I found out where the hitch was. The key was lost; I made
                     the new one."
                  "Why didn't you make two new ones?" said Podd, with a chuckle. "If
                     you had a second key it would be conwenient, s'posin' he should lose t'other.
                     He! he!"
                  "I could make another fast enough," answered the smith; "or for that matter, I
                     could open his chest if he lost his key. I know the trick on it now: lift the
                     tumbler a bit apast the half turn, and then shoot the bolt. I could do it in
                     the dark. Was two hours on that cussed job."
                  "What could you do it with, Johnny?"
                  "These!" and he produced a bunch of skeleton-keys. "The lock on the town-hall
                     was worse than any lock at Beechwood."
                  "My friends—my good friends," interposed Munseer Blowell, "It is indiscreet to
                     talk of such matters in such a place. Who may not be behind this excellent
                     stone wall? Let us walk; on the open road one is safe, if one does not speak
                     too loudly. Your conversation is very interesting—decidedly!"
                  The three worthies left the shadow of the mill. The dog came out as they
                     departed, received another affectionate kick, and crept back, with a smothered
                     whine.
                  "My goot friends," said Munseer Blowell, when they were fairly on the road,
                     "what is this that your converse about?" A chest containing plate, owned by an
                     aristocrat, and secured by a lock at which you laugh!"
                  "You would not laugh," replied the smith, "if you had bin two hours trying at
                     it. The cussed tumbler fell just where it ought to rise."
                  "But you know the trick now—is it not? In the dark, with those curious little
                     wires, you could—see if the plate was secure?"
                  "Easy enough. That is, if the house was empty."
                  "It is as good as empty," said Podd—"only Clinton and the nigger. I dessay me
                     and Munseer could amuse them, if they should happen to be awake, while you
                     tried your wires. This lane goes past Beechwood and comes out in t'other road.
                     S'pose we walk this way? Must be past midnight."
                  Munseer took a watch from his pocket, touched a spring, and it sounded four
                     musical notes. "One and three-quarters," he said, replacing his watch. "It is a
                     well-known fact that sleepers repose more soundly between midnight and four
                     o'clock than at any other time. What reason have you for thinking the heavy
                     chest contains plate, my goot friend?"
                  "Got no other use for it," answered the locksmith; "besides, it is lined with
                     welwet. The tumbler falls sudden, a bit apast the half turn."
                  "Suppose we should look after this plate," suggested Munseer, "and fierce dogs
                     should assault us, for instance—have you any weapon, my goot friend?"
                  
                  Podd took out his pruning-knife and opened the blade. It was broad and strong,
                     and six inches in length. "I could find a dog's gizzard with this, if he was no
                     bigger than a man."
                  "Very goot! And I have this," and he produced along dagger from his bosom,
                     "which is still more effective. We need not fear the dogs. Our goot friend here
                     could arrange the tumblers, without any unnecessary noise, and we could remove
                     the plate to some place of security, where the locks would be stronger; we
                     would make three equal parcels, and each one could take care of his own
                     portion. My goot friend has not spoken of the outer door, however."
                  "The main door has a old-fashioned lock—big wards. A handy fellow could open
                     that with a crow-bar."
                  "And after that should be opened," said Munseer—"is there perhaps another door
                     within?"
                  "Werry possible," answered the locksmith, sarcastically; "he's got more money
                     than he can spend, and mebbe he has put up another door inside the hall. There
                     was only one door last week."
                  "My goot friends," said the orator, stopping in the middle of the lane and
                     facing his companions, "this aristocrat is holding our property in his chest.
                     It is ours, because we represent the artisans who made it, the miners who dug
                     the ores, the smelters who labored amid fierce heat to purify the metal. And
                     now we, the true owners, because we belong to the many, are tramping through
                     dark lanes, while he, the solitary usurper, reposes on his luxurious couch. We
                     will not disturb him, but we will take our metal and partition it fairly, and
                     when we find others—our brother workingmen—in need, we will gladly give them
                     their just portion. Think how pure the joy will be to aid the struggling
                     victims of cruel laws and customs! To brave men like you I may express the
                     regret that I feel, and which my sympathising soul tells me you
                     feel, that this act of reclaiming our own involves no risk, nothing to prove
                     our manhood—only to remove some curious tumblers which my goot friend here
                     constructs and defies, and then silently convey the gaudy trappings of
                     aristocracy to some secure locality, where we can melt them and fashion them
                     into ingots ready for coinage. We will not harm anything but dogs—"
                  "He hasn't got no dogs," said Podd.
                  "Alas! then it is a bagatelle, is it not? Should the plate be heavy, we have
                     strong shoulders. In this sylvan solitude there are no policemen. Nothing but
                     prudence deters us from going boldly and demanding the restoration. Why should
                     we make clamor when it is only to take and go?"
                  "Suppose some one should be awake in the 'ouse?" suggested the smith. "You
                     can't shoot heavy bolts without some noise."
                  "The night is dark, my goot friend," replied Munseer, "and if we fail to
                     accomplish our purpose, we can retire in safety. All that we need is
                     caution."
                  "They do say," muttered the locksmith, "that people walk about
                     Beechwood o' nights that have been dead and buried many a year."
                  "Bah!" replied the orator, in high disdain; "these are tales to frighten
                     children. My goot friend Podd, what mansion is this? One could hide in that
                     grove secure."
                  "This is Beechwood," answered Podd. "It's easy enough to say 'Bar!' Munseer,
                     but I swear I saw something move under them trees a week ago and
                     melt away into the air. I'd rather tackle Halidon than this place any time
                     after dark. But I'm not afeard! This is the stable-gate. It is locked, but we
                     can lift it off the hinges. So now remember, if we have to cut for it, to come
                     down the drive and out here, and then keep to the right."
                  "Softly!" said Monsieur, as they filed through the gate; "the house is
                     here—quiet as the tomb. Is your knife open, my goot friend?"
               
               
                  CHAPTER XLIX.
                  TIGER.
                  The attractive quadruped that inhabited the kennel at the mill was a large,
                     yellow mastiff, between whom and Podd Miss Lucy Merton would have detected a
                     resemblance. There was the same strong under, projecting, the same cruel blink
                     in the eyes, the same stump of a nose, with wide nostrils, the same yellow
                     teeth, visible when the thin lips parted. And the taint hide of the florist was
                     not unlike the yellow hair of Tiger, who had a sleek coat and looked altogether
                     more respectable than Mr. Podd in his ordinary attire.
                  It is very likely that these two animals formed their mutual attachment upon
                     some recognised attributes that were common. The outward ugliness for which
                     they were both distinguished was one bond of sympathy; the universal
                     antagonism, to all other living things was common to both. Tiger's life was
                     spent in darting out of his kennel, and as far as his chain would permit, at
                     everything that passed. There was no
                     creature that Podd regarded with favor; he scowled habitually at all things
                     sublunary, and at the sun, moon, and stars.
                  The good understanding that subsisted betwixt the biped and the quadruped was
                     due to Tiger's veneration for Podd. The gardener threw him bones and crusts at
                     such times as he took his luncheon on the long bench at the mill, and the dog
                     received the morsels as dainties from the king's table; for some dim
                     recognition of royalty hedged about the man, in the dog's perceptions, and he
                     took the kicks and objurgations which Podd dispensed liberally as part of his
                     rights as a loyal subject. It was a curious fact that Podd had no touch of fear
                     in his intercourse with Tiger, who was a terror to everybody else. When in his
                     most savage moods, and when the miller dared not come within reach of him, Podd
                     would roll him over with naked hands, pulling his bits of ears, cuff and swear
                     at him with perfect composure and with perfect impunity.
                  On the night when the liberal trio rested on the mill-bench, Tiger, saw and
                     recognised the king, but felt bound to rush at the courtiers that accompanied
                     him. He rather expected the kicks. While they remained in earshot he reposed
                     with his head on his paws; when they, arose to depart he flew out again, took
                     another kick, meekly, and returned to his kennel.
                  Tiger had not had his supper, and he was restless. As the retreating footsteps
                     of the three worthies died away, he came out again, and lay on the ground
                     blinking at the stars. The habit of the gardener, when he occupied the bench,
                     was to eat, and Tiger was accustomed to look for crumbs. The bench was beyond
                     the length of the chain, and he could only look wistfully in that direction.
                     Then a cat, came creeping from the mill; she was going down to the race for a
                     drink. Tiger flew at her of course, tugging at his chain. Grimalkin, with
                     thickened tail, took to a tree, and as the dog stretched out after, her, his
                     cruel eyeballs projecting, the staple came out of the box and Tiger was free.
                     He tore up to the tree, snapping viciously but harmlessly at the cat secure in
                     the upper branches; then sniffed around the bench, and finding nothing, trotted
                     down into the road, his stump of a tail pointing to the quiet heavens and his
                     chain rattling behind him.
                  Podd had drawn out the staple one day, and when he put it back he had not
                     driven it home. Each time that the dog rushed out of his kennel he had loosened
                     it a little, and the last savage dash at Grimalkin liberated him. He took the
                     trail of his monarch and sped along the secluded lane, starting on his
                     expedition just as Podd lifted the gate from its hinges at Beechwood.
               
               
                  CHAPTER L.
                  DORADO AGAIN.
                  Mr. Radcliffe Merton quit the bank after his interview with Wailes, and passing
                     down Queen Street, encountered a certain Mr. Consol, a stock-jobber. Mr. Consol
                     had made "little operations" for Mr. Merton once and again, and had proved
                     himself quick and shrewd, and the young squire had a good deal of confidence in
                     his ability. There was not much stock-jobbing done at Gloucester, still the
                     Dorado had been advertised liberally, and Mr. Consol might be able to do
                     something.
                  "Oh, Consol," said Radcliffe, "I was thinking of you. Have you ever heard of
                     the Dorado Mine?"
                  "Heard of it?—of course. Are you in it, Mr. Merton?"
                  "Ya-as, a little," answered Merton. "Fact is, I went in too deeply, not
                     expecting the call. I paid the allotment price, and now I am short of the
                     needful tin to meet this sudden demand. Wonder if you could find a customer? I
                     almost think I would sell out."
                  Mr. Consol had a customer. "How many, Mr. Merton? Twenty-five hundred? Suppose
                     you leave the certificates with me?"
                  "Hang it! no. I'll take the evening train, I think, and place them in London.
                     No difficulty there; can get five shillings advance probably."
                  "I'll give you a cheque for two shillings advance," said Mr. Consol "I had an
                     inquiry to-day, and will buy your lot at a risk, if you like."
                  "Done!—away with you!" replied Radcliffe. "Come to your office and write your
                     cheque."
                  Mr. Radcliffe was in quite a serene frame, with the cheque in his pocket, as he
                     drove down the road to Merton. He did not know that Mr. Consol was busy
                     transferring his shares to Matthew Merton, Esq., at the very moment that the
                     hopeful nephew was chuckling over his good fortune in "getting out." But it had
                     happened that the Squire, reading the florid notice in the Gloucester
                        Palladium, had decided to invest all the money he could raise in
                     "Dorado," provided he could get the shares at anything near the allotment
                     price. Mr. Consol had the Squire's order to "pick up" just the amount Radcliffe
                     held, and when he entered the post-office he met the Squire at the door, and
                     announced the purchase.
                  Squire Mat was very much elated, as he had "read up" on Dorado, and carried little slips cut from newspapers
                     referring to this "valuable property" in his pockets, which he consulted at odd
                     times with great interest. The original announcement made by Radcliffe, at the
                     Halidon dinner, was intended to operate upon Mr. Grippe and Sir Henry Walton,
                     as the good Squire was generally impecunious; and anyhow, Mr. Rad did not
                     desire to earn his "commission" for inducing subscriptions at his uncle's
                     expense. The money he had decided to invest in the mine was really Sybil's, and
                     the profits on the venture were to be hers.
                  "I have bought your shares, Mr. Merton," said Consol, when they met.
                  "Well done! How many?"
                  "Twenty-five hundred. I am just mailing the order for transfer; you will have
                     the certificates in two days. But you will need two or three thousand pounds
                     more in a day or two, as the instalment will be due."
                  "All ready, Consol," answered the Squire; "I can get the money from Grippe.
                     Shall I give you a cheque now?"
                  "As you please; to-morrow will do. Shall you be in town tomorrow?"
                  "Certainly; I will come on purpose. I am going to meet an appointment now, and
                     am tardy as usual. Good morning."
                  The Squire's appointment was with Mr. Clinton; he had promised to take luncheon
                     at Beechwood. As he rode rapidly away from Gloucester he tried to calculate the
                     addition he was about to make to Sybil's little fortune. Some of the papers
                     predicted an advance of a pound per share after the payment of the second
                     instalment; others prophesied that the third instalment would never be called,
                     as the ore was coming up by cart-loads, and there would be dividends within a
                     few months. The Squire was not accustomed to such mental labor, and he
                     dismissed the subject from his mind for the present. One thing was clear: Sybil
                     would have a good lot of money when he sold out.
                  Memnon threw the gates open as the Squire cantered up, and took charge of his
                     horse at the door. Mr. Clinton was in the hall, and welcomed his guest very
                     cordially. "My dear Squire," he said, "I am delighted to see you. I have
                     ordered Phillis to put on the chops, and in ten minutes all will be ready.
                     Meantime, will you come to the stables and look at the ponies?"
                  "The very thing! Have you had the shoes changed?"
                  "Yes, sir. I drove to Merton yesterday and found your smith. I just said Squire
                     Morton did not approve of the ponies' feet, and told him to do for them as you
                     would order if you were present. He growled at Gloucester quite viciously, and
                     he informs me that it will take two or three months to get Baby's feet in shape
                     again. But he has undertaken the cure."
                  "Colts' hoofs, you see," said the Squire; "these blockheads play the deuce with
                     a colt's hoof. They should not be pared at all. Come on; we will have a look at
                     them. I am half an hour late; have I kept you waiting?"
                  "No, sir—"
                  "See here, Clinton, you must not say 'yes, sir' and 'no, sir.'"
                  "What shall I say then?"
                  "Say' yes' and 'no.' You were talking to Sybil the other day, and you kept
                     saying 'Yes, ma'am.' It's perfectly horrid!"
                  "Surely you did not wish me to say 'Yes, miss'?" answered Clinton.
                  "No; that would be still worse. Say plain 'yes' when you are talking to equals.
                     You might put in the 'Sir' if addressing a duke, unless you were intimate with
                     him, and in that case it would be indecorous. 'Yes, sir,' belongs to servants;
                     don't rob them of their lingo."
                  "Did Miss Sybil say all that?" said Clinton, ruefully.
                  "No; certainly not. She is a goose! She flew in her father's face for
                     criticising your Americanism."
                  "She has done a little in that line herself," answered Clinton. "I wonder how
                     long it will take me to get civilised? She tells me I say 'Phaginny.'"
                  "Of course!" roared the Squire—"ho! ho! But never mind. Ah! the sly vixen did
                     not tell me she had been putting you through your paces. Was she hard on you,
                     eh?"
                  "No, sir—that is—no. She talks so beautifully herself that her scolding was
                     musical."
                  "Yes, yes. Isn't she a duck!" answered the Squire, his eyes moistening. "She
                     spent an hour last night arguing with me about the propriety of your manner of
                     speech. She defended you in your absence if she scolds you when present.—Ho!
                     here are the ponies. You must have a window over the manger, Clinton.
                     Ventilation. Ho, Baby! Her coat is like velvet. Your groom has not been so
                     liberal with t'other."
                  "I believe I must? have the credit of Baby's glossy coat," said Clinton,
                     blushing. "In Virgin-ia I used to curry my horse myself, and I was trying my
                     hand on Baby this morning. She is fond of me, and I like to curry her."
                  
                  "You're all right if you can fall in love with a horse," answered the Squire.
                     "What gate is this? Oh, I remember; this is the lane to the mill. You must
                     change those antiquated hinges, Clinton; no use in locks, when a stout fellow
                     could lift t'other end off. There's the bell; I must wash my hands. Come on; I
                     will not let your chops get cold."
                  Captain Lennox had added an enclosed porch to the main front of the house,
                     which diversified the plain lines, and furnished pleasant seats in mild
                     weather. After luncheon Mr. Clinton and his guest sat here with their pipes,
                     the former meditating the construction of a new vocabulary, and the latter
                     thinking of his fortunate investment in mining stock.
                  "Do you know anything about this Dorado Mine, Clinton?" said the Squire.
                  "I have seen the prospectus," replied Clinton.
                  "Did you take any shares?"
                  "Oh no."
                  The Squire wriggled in his seat; there was an uncomfortable intonation in
                     Clinton's voice. "You have so many schemes in America," said the Squire, "that
                     you are not satisfied with moderate interest, I suppose."
                  "Rather, I try to be certain of the security of the principal," answered
                     Clinton.
                  "Well, the Dorado seems to be secure enough," and the Squire pulled out his
                     newspaper slips. "Look at this."
                  "I have seen that. But I had investigated Dorado in London before the
                     Gloucester paper mentioned it. I think it is—a humbug!"
                  "A what?" said the Squire.
                  "A humbug, a fraud. I would not give a shilling a share for the Dorado."
                  "Will you take the trouble to read the names?" said the Squire,
                     horror-stricken. "I mean the American names."
                  "I have read them."
                  "But this," and the Squire laid his finger on the list of supporters and
                     endorsers. "Surely you will say nothing against this name. No American can say
                     anything against this."
                  "Well, Squire," replied Clinton, tranquilly, "I will say no more. It is not
                     impossible that there is a silver-mine in Nevada very productive, and that
                     Dorado is its name. I have not been there; but I should be very sorry to think
                     any friend of mine had put good money in this speculation."
                  "Why, it is selling at a profit this very day."
                  "Very likely. I suppose the managers will not let it collapse until they get
                     two or three more instalments paid. It may keep up until Christmas, or it may
                     melt away into thin air this week. Sir Henry had some, but he sold out, I
                     think."
                  "I wonder if Grippe took any?" said Mr. Merton.
                  "I fancy not. Wailes has charge of such matters, and he would not be caught
                     with chaff of that description."
                  "Rad spoke in high terms of it t'other night," observed the Squire; "he and
                     Trump generally think alike."
                  Clinton was silent. The Squire's pipe was out, and he laid it on the seat
                     beside him as he rose to depart.
                  "The truth is, Clinton," said he, as he buttoned his coat, "I have bought some
                     of that infernal stock. I begin to feel uneasy about it now. I met Consol in
                     Gloucester to-day, and he told me he had picked up twenty-five hundred shares
                     for me. I'll sell out to-morrow, by Jupiter! Baby's money, too! Come! will you
                     ride to Merton Park with me and dine without ceremony?"
                  "Many thanks, Squire. Please allow me to hold the invitation; this evening I
                     expect a visitor. Are you going? Memnon, bring Mr. Merton's horse."
                  Memnon opened the gates for the Squire's egress, and when he returned to the
                     stable, he found Mr. Clinton drawing the girth of the saddle on the back of
                     Phaginny. "Law! Mars Clint, let me fix de hoss," said Memnon. "You done got
                     snaffle on. Dat hoss wants de stiff bit."
                  "Never mind, Memnon," said Mr. Clinton. "Open the gates for me. I will return
                     in an hour," and he leaped into the saddle and went off in a gallop.
                  Mr. Consol was in his office. Seeing a cavalier in the street before his door,
                     he came out. Mr. Clinton beckoned him to the curb. "Mr. Consol," he said, "I
                     wish to make a purchase of some shares—twenty-five hundred Dorado. I want the
                     identical shares Mr. Merton bought to-day. If you see him to-morrow, buy them
                     for me at a profit, What did he pay?"
                  "Never reveal customers' secrets, Mr. Clinton," answered the cautious
                     stock-jobber. "He has not paid anything; not due until to-morrow."
                  "Of course not, I forgot. Well, keep my secret too; I particularly desire to be
                     unknown in this transaction. If you can manage to get those shares for me, say
                     at two shillings advance, I will pay you treble commissions."
                  
                  "Can't do that, Mr. Clinton; commissions are regular. If the Squire wishes to
                     sell to-morrow—"
                  "See here, Mr. Consol; suppose you take a cab and go to Merton Park this
                     afternoon. You don't have to mention names, but you can offer Mr. Merton two
                     shillings advance for authority to transfer his shares to you. You will want
                     the money? I will go to Browler Brothers and get it now."
                  "Time enough for that when you get the shares. Cab will cost about ten
                     shillings—"
                  "Here is a sovereign. You understand the case, do you? I want the same shares
                     Squire Merton bought to-day, and no others; and I must not be known in the
                     transaction at all. If the Squire consent to sell, you can take the blanks with
                     you and get the transfer signed this evening, paying Mr. Merton the difference.
                     You don't seem satisfied; what is the obstacle?"
                  "I suppose it is all right, Mr. Clinton; but you are a comparative stranger to
                     me, and—"
                  "Come to Browler Brothers. Hi, Sonny! hold my horse."
                  Sonny was a ragged whelp who was busily engaged in rolling another ragged whelp
                     in the dusty street. He sprang to Phaginny's head and seized the bridle. Mr.
                     Consol followed Clinton to the bank.
                  "Mr. Choppy," said Clinton, as the smiling cashier approached, "a word in
                     private, if you please. Mr. Consol has an order from me for an investment.
                     Please tell him if my cheque will be honored for—say ten thousand pounds."
                  "Yes, sir; or for twenty thousand either," said Mr. Choppy.
                  Mr. Consol hailed a cab and left Gloucester five minutes later.
               
               
                  CHAPTER LI.
                  PRINCE PRETTYMAN.
                  Doctor Maguire had been busy for a week or so. There were some cases of low
                     fever in Merton, chiefly among the poorer villagers; and as these did not deal
                     much in fees, the Doctor was particularly attentive to them. Squire Merton, who
                     knew of the practitioner's kindness to his poorer tenants, beset him with daily
                     invitations to the Park to "dinner and a rubber," but Maguire had really not
                     been able to accept his hospitality. Besides his Merton "pashints," he had a
                     mysterious patient, somewhere near Gloucester, and the old gig was seen on that
                     road nearly every day, Jalap trotting along with so decided an air of business
                     that the fee was no doubt promptly paid by that customer at least.
                  The Squire met the gig near the entrance to his own grounds on the same
                     afternoon and at about the same hour that Mr. Consol started from Gloucester.
                     "Hillo, Doctor!" said he. "Glad to meet you. Are you coming to dine
                     to-day?"
                  "Faix, Squire," replied the Doctor, "I think I will. More betoken, I have not
                     had a dacent meal for a week."
                  "How are the Merton people, Doctor?"
                  "Getting along.—You ould ragamuffin, ye've got your ear in limbo again!" This
                     last remark was addressed to Jalap as the Doctor descended from his perch and
                     adjusted the headstall.
                  "Why don't you saw off that horse's ear, Doctor?" said the Squire.
                  "It's the only divarsion the poor brute has," answered the Doctor. "If he
                     didn't look so comical, I wouldn't mind it. Get along, Jalap!"
                  "Seven o'clock, Maguire," said Mr. Merton, as they parted.
                  "I'll be punctual. Bedad, I'll give Miss Lucy another chance," he added as soon
                     as the Squire was out of earshot; "and I must get back in" time to dress too.
                     If she don't find some unlucky resemblance, maybe I'll win this time."
                  The Doctor stopped at Beechwood. His patient there was apparently in ordinary
                     health, as she was sitting in the large drawing-room conversing with Mr.
                     Clinton. It should have been stated earlier in this history that Doctor Maguire
                     was a member of the Royal College, and had achieved an extensive reputation in
                     London before he buried himself in the little village of Merton, where he had
                     prepared the just proportion of the inhabitants for their burial,
                     secundum artem, for the past ten or twelve
                     years. Mr. Clinton had applied to a famous practitioner in London, shortly
                     after taking Beechwood, for professional services, and was surprised to learn
                     that so skilful a physician was within easy reach of him. The city magnate
                     spoke of Maguire in terms of such extravagant commendation that Mr. Clinton was
                     entirely satisfied to put the case in his hands. The ailment was purely mental,
                     and as the Doctor was groping in the dark, knowing nothing of the previous
                     history of his patient, he always entered the gates at Beechwood with certain
                     misgivings.
                  There was some secret between Clinton and the lady that was carefully guarded. They never addressed each
                     other by name when the Doctor was present. Mr. Clinton had informed him at the
                     outset that he had a kinswoman at his house, living in great seclusion, and
                     suffering from mental depression, and had requested the Doctor to keep the
                     secret of her residence there from the gossips of the vicinity. He hoped when
                     she was well enough to present her formally to his friends, but was himself
                     ignorant of the cause of her distress. She was restless at night, and was a
                     somnambulist. He had awakened her suddenly the day before he called the Doctor
                     in, and she had preserved a dazed appearance and manner ever since. This was
                     all.
                  The Doctor asked a few questions, suggested some changes in diet, and going out
                     to his gig, was followed by Clinton.
                  "I think I perceive a decided improvement to-day," he said, "and if you can
                     discover any method by which you can awaken her interest in sublunary things,
                     she will mend rapidly."
                  "What do you mean, Doctor?" asked Clinton, eagerly.
                  "I mane if you can give her something or somebody to love who will love her—not
                     a great masculine body like yourself, but a gurrill. Why the divil can't you
                     marry a young woman and try the experiment!"
                  "Marry!"
                  "Certainly! It's a risky operation, I know; but if you get a goodnatured young
                     woman, the risk will not be great—I mane to yourself. To the pashint I am sure
                     it will be beneficial."
                  "I know a young lady, Doctor," said Clinton, thoughtfully, "who would exactly
                     suit your description; but—"
                  "But what?"
                  "But she may object to the arrangement."
                  "Is that all? Lave it to me; I'll find one to shoot. Bedad, I know one this
                     minnit! Can you jabber French?"
                  "Oh yes; French and German are as easy to me as English."
                  "It's all settled, thin. I'll put you in the way at oncet. I must see ould
                     Grippe about it."
                  "Don't make any rash engagements, Doctor. Jewhillikin, Doctor, I'm a regular
                     blockhead!"
                  "Well, it's a healthy sign when you know your disase, and you are in a fair way
                     to be cured. What is it?"
                  "Why, I can get the very lady you describe without the least trouble. Are you
                     going past Halidon? Really! Give me a seat in your gig that far, and I will
                     arrange everything at once."
                  "Ah, you sly rashkill!" said Doctor Maguire, after dropping Mr. Clinton at the
                     lodge-gates; "you are afther ould Grippe's French daughter, are you? Well, good
                     luck to you. Get along, Jalap! Confound your skull, you've got your ear down
                     again! So! I'll put a stitch or two in your ear, me boy, some fine day. And if
                     you get that black-eyed French gurrill, Mr. Clinton, it's my belafe that she
                     will put several large fleas in your ear now and thin."
                  Mr. Clinton, hearing none of these remarks, entered the spacious park with an
                     elastic step. He did not seem to dread fleas, as he shook hands with the young
                     ladies, who received him with evident pleasure. Five minutes after his arrival
                     Helose had him at the piano, doing his half of a duetto manfully.
                  Leaving her at the instrument when he had inveigled her into solo performances,
                     he sat down by Mabel and resumed the vernacular.
                  "Fair cousin, I have found some mission-work for you," he said, "and I hope you
                     will engage in it at once—to-morrow."
                  "Is it in a foreign field?" said Mabel, laughing.
                  "No; quite near you—at Beechwood. There is one there who sorely needs gentle
                     ministrations. I am too rough, unpolished, half humanised to do any good. Will
                     you come?"
                  "Can you refer to the dear old lady I saw there in the conservatory? Alas! I
                     promised to see her the next day, but Helose was ill, and I could not leave
                     her."
                  "Yes. She is suffering some mental! derangement that I cannot understand. I
                     have theories, but do not know enough to act upon them. I am afraid to refer to
                     her past history, which I know in great part, but you can do it safely. You
                     will learn to love her, and she will love you without learning. In a few days I
                     will tell you—nay, I will tell you now—she is Dora Lennox."
                  "Dora Trumpley!" said Mabel, a hundred fragmentary stories rushing upon her
                     memory; "my dear Aunt Trumpley—"
                  "No! I cannot fathom the mystery; but when I called her Aunt Trumpley, she
                     fairly shook with rage, and bade me never mention the name again."
                  "I will go as soon as Mr. Grippe comes," said Mabel. "My dear Aunt Dora! I will
                     write to Papa to-night—"
                  "No; you must please wait a little. You must not tell Mr. Grippe either, or any
                     one else. There is some terrible story in the past which we must unravel, you
                     and I, and then we will know what is the true course. A day with her will
                     reveal more to you than I have learned since I first discovered her. Ah, here
                     comes Mademoiselle. You cannot come this evening, but as early as you will
                        to-morrow. Ladies," he continued,
                     in French, "I am desolated that I am obliged to leave you; but I expect a
                     guest, and must return to prepare for his arrival. Au revoir!"
                  An hour later Mr. Grippe arrived. He limped up the drive, and the two girls
                     fluttered out to meet him as soon as he was in sight. Helose took away his cane
                     and gave him her shapely arm, and Mabel assisted him on the other side. It was
                     evident that the old gentleman was a prime favorite.
                  "You are earlier than usual to-day, sir," said Mabel. "Are you quite well?"
                  "Quite well, indeed!" said Mr. Grippe; "of course I'm not. Never was quite well
                     since I was born; but I am no worse than usual. Oh! this is far nicer than
                     canes. How would you girls like to escort me in this fashion to Gloucester
                     every day?"
                  "That would be perfect," said Helose, when Mabel translated the banker's
                     proposition; "we would go to the shops and to the cathedral, while Monsieur was
                     making money in the bank."
                  "And you gypsies would be turning the money into ducks and drakes. Mabel, sit
                     down here and read this aloud to me. Helose, sit here on the other side. Read
                     slowly, child, and when Helose does not understand, translate for her."
                  Mr. Grippe had required Trump to write a detailed account of his adventures in
                     search of Blauvelt, suppressing names; and the youth had written very nearly
                     the identical account given to the reader in a previous chapter. The reading
                     was one of the most comical performances possible. Mabel recognised the chief
                     actor in the first few lines of the narrative, and was enormously interested.
                     At the end of each sentence, Helose flew at her like a raging French tigress
                     for the translation. Mr. Grippe sat between them, preserving a stolid exterior
                     and chuckling constantly.
                  "Where you got the feuilleton?" said Helose. "It is charming."
                  "I had it made to order," answered Mr. Grippe.
                  "What name the chevalier wiz pistolet?"
                  "Prince Prettyman; he is a stunner," replied Mr. Grippe. "I will bring him here
                     and introduce him. What have you to say, Mabel?"
                  "Nothing," answered she, "except that he must leave his weapon behind him; I
                     have a horror of them. How did he happen to be armed?"
                  "Oh, he does not tell that part. Well, he had a friend who was part Comanche
                     and part alligator. This friend has lived in forests and caves and such
                     unwholesome places, and generally shot a panther or bear for breakfast. When he
                     heard that Prince Prettyman was going on a journey, he gave him the weapon,
                     extorting his promise to carry it; so when he assaulted the ogre he happened to
                     be armed. I have an idea that the blockhead would have done the same thing
                     empty-handed."
                  Mabel translated this wonderful story for the benefit of Helose.
                  "And now, girls," said Mr. Grippe, "go dress for dinner. We shall have company
                     to-night, a lady and a gentleman; I have sent the carriage for them. The
                     gentleman will be Prince Prettyman, and the lady his mother; they will spend
                     some time with us. I intend the Prince to marry one of you—perhaps both. Give
                     me my cane, Helose. Away with you!"
                  "When Prince Prettyman comes," said Mabel to herself, as she arranged her
                     tresses before her mirror, "if he is forgiving and gentle he may tell me this
                     story over. And he may tell me about another exploit, when he rescued a poor
                     drowning girl; and he may tell me what he did with the little curl he stole,
                     when the poor girl was totally unconscious. But he can't marry both of us."
               
               
                  CHAPTER LII.
                  STOCK TRANSFERS.
                  Mr. Radcliffe Merton tossed the reins to Tim, and descended from the dog-cart.
                     He felt very comfortable, and consequently amiable. He had passed through a
                     very pleasant little quarrel with the best friend he had ever known, and the
                     retrospect was cheering. He had parted with securities of doubtful value, and
                     had the cheque in his pocket, and this was more cheering. He had a vague
                     purpose to do personal damage to Trump and Clinton, especially the latter, and
                     he had been revolving schemes in his mind all the afternoon to entangle him in
                     a quarrel. He had "ordered Trump out of his house," and he knew Trump would get
                     out at any cost. To-morrow he would take possession of Rose Cottage, and make
                     it a bachelor's paradise.
                  He would go to Halidon to-morrow. That Grahame girl was positively distracting!
                     When in London the other day he had hunted up the Reverend Edward; found him in
                     Blackfriars, in a perfect hole. Had
                     sent in his card; Reverend Edward was out. Called again next day; Reverend
                     Edward was engaged, and hoped Mr. Merton would excuse him; which Mr. Merton
                     concluded to do. But this rebuff only made him more determined to have Mabel.
                     He had sent the Reverend Edward a letter of introduction from Sir Philip too. A
                     nice sort of clergyman, to treat his brother's friend with rudeness! What the
                     devil did it mean anyhow?
                  That Yankee impostor must be at the bottom of it. He would call at Beechwood
                     and ask him. Ask him what? Berlin! Mr. Clinton was at Berlin a month ago, when
                     he and Blauvelt were caught at some card-tricks. They were odd tricks, and
                     Radcliffe left Germany sooner than he had intended. It was only cleaning out a
                     young cub with more money than brains. If they had not done it, somebody else
                     would. It was easy enough to explain, though a one-sided statement would be
                     damaging. If the Reverend Edward had only seen him, and referred to the matter,
                     he could at least have called that Stratton fellow to account. Strange that he
                     did not know him at Berlin. But that beard disguised him. False beard probably.
                     Must tell Uncle Mat about him. And there he comes.
                  The Squire rode soberly up the carriage-way and dismounted. As his horse, was
                     led away to the stables, he stood on the steps watching him.
                  "He nurses the off fore-foot, evidently. Hillo, Sam! lift the oil fore-foot and
                     see if anything is the matter."
                  "Yessir," answered the groom; "frog sore."
                  "The deuce! What will I ride to-morrow?"
                  "Be well by to-morrow, sir; only a scratch."
                  "Ah! he got that at Beechwood. They have been cutting down the bushes near the
                     stables. Hay, Rad!"
                  "What did you say about Beechwood, Uncle?" said Rad, approaching; "I thought
                     you mentioned Beechwood."
                  "Yes, Saladin stepped on a snag there; limps, you see. Doctor his foot, Sam. Do
                     you know what to do?"
                  "Oh yes, sir. Be all right to-morrow."
                  "Clinton has improved Beechwood wonderfully, Rad. You must call on him; he is a
                     thoroughbred. Gave me luncheon to-day; pickled oysters, just from America.
                     Superb! By-the-bye, he made me feel very uncomfortable about that Dorado Mine.
                     You have some?"
                  "Not I," answered Radcliffe; "sold out to-day."
                  "To-day! Pray, how much did you hold?"
                  "Twenty-five hundred—got two shillings advance."
                  "And I bought them, you rascal," blurted out the Squire; "and Clinton, who
                     seems to know all about it, evidently thinks it a fraud. He said he would not
                     give two shillings a share."
                  "How the devil did you come to buy my shares, Uncle?" said Radcliffe, uneasily.
                     "If I had known you had such an intention, I would have cautioned you—"
                  "Why, you recommended the stock to Sir Henry Walton t'other night! I heard
                     you."
                  "Yes, sir," replied his nephew; "but Sir Henry is not my uncle—that is, they
                     have called for another instalment, and mines are always risky. I'll have to go
                     to London and sell out for you. Hang the Dorado! I was just congratulating
                     myself on the sale. You see, sir," he continued, observing the Squire's blank
                     countenance, "they always paint these Yankee schemes rose-colored, and you must
                     add a little salt."
                  "Well, let us go in; Maguire is coming to dinner. Don't tell the girls about
                     the stock. I bought it with—no matter. If Clinton had not mentioned it, I
                     should have had no uneasiness."
                  "You seem to have great confidence in this Yankee, Uncle. It is my opinion that
                     he is an impostor."
                  "Pooh! you are warped by British prejudice. Impostor! Why, he has twenty or
                     thirty thousand pounds in Grippe's bank."
                  "He may have stolen it," replied Radcliffe. "I happen to know that his name is
                     not Clinton. I knew him on the Continent by another name; so did Trump. Who is
                     this coming up the drive in a cab? Consol, by Jupiter!"
                  Mr. Consol walked up the stone steps, nodded to the younger Merton, and
                     requested a private interview with the Squire. He was ushered into the
                     "office," the apartment in which the Squire received all his visitors who came
                     on business. Rad was itching to know the stock-jobber's business, but his only
                     chance was to pump his uncle after the private interview was over.
                  When they were seated in the office, Mr. Merton begged his visitor to state his
                     business. Mr. Consol proceeded very cautiously.
                  "Did I understand you to say you wished the shares transferred to your own
                     name?"
                  "Certainly. Why do you ask?"
                  "Because, if you should desire to sell out, you could just let the certificates
                     stand transferred in blank—"
                  "Sell out?" said the Squire. "Not much chance of that, I fancy."
                  
                  "Why not? If you wished to buy a few hours ago, why should not some one
                     else?"
                  "But I paid two shillings advance—"
                  "That is nothing. It was said at first there would be no call made after the
                     allotment. To-day's paper has a letter from the superintendent in Nevada, in
                     which he says they have struck a new lode. Just as like as not the shares will
                     sell at four shillings premium to-morrow. If it were not for this
                     instalment—"
                  "Four shillings a share! I should like to sell mine at that price," said Mr.
                     Merton.
                  "Are you serious, Squire?" said Mr. Consol.
                  "Perfectly."
                  Mr. Consol drew some blank forms from his capacious pocket, and taking up a
                     pen, rapidly filled one up and pushed it across the table to the Squire. "If
                     you will sign that transfer, Squire," he said, coolly, "I will give you my
                     cheque for two hundred and fifty pounds. There will be two commissions; but you
                     can give me your cheque to-morrow for them."
                  "Did you tell any one that you had sold me this stock?" said the Squire.
                  "Never reveal my customers' business," answered Mr. Consol.
                  "Of course I never mentioned you; but another customer applied to me to-day,
                     shortly after you left Gloucester, and he was so hungry for the stock that I
                     thought I would quietly take a cab and see if you would sell. Four shillings
                     premium, was his offer. Could get the stock in London, no doubt, easily enough,
                     but—to tell the whole truth, I thought I might make a double
                     commission. Ha! ha! ha!"
                  "Ha! ha! ha!" replied Mr. Merton, signing the transfer. "Consol, you are a
                     brick! This two-fifty is clear profit then?"
                  "Except the two commissions, Squire. Ha! ha! ha! Good afternoon, Squire. No,
                     thank you. Well, just one glass. Port? Prim! Must get back to telegraph my
                     London correspondent to stop transfer and return the certificates. That saves
                     his commission too. Ha! ha! ha! pretty good afternoon's work, and after
                     business hours too."
                  "I say, Consol," said the Squire, "that was a, neat trick you played me. You
                     bought my nevvy's stock and sold it to me. Now, if he had known that I was the
                     buyer he would not have sold, and if I had known he was the seller I should not
                     have bought."
                  "Exactly, Squire. Ha! ha! ha! never reveal customer' business.
                        Good afternoon, Squire. Not another drop. Well, just one
                        drop.Must be off now, or my London man will be gone home. Lives
                     at Paddington. That is the most astonishing Port I ever tasted. Don't come out,
                     sir. Hi, Cabby! all ready! Back!"
                  The cab overtook Mr. Clinton walking back to Beechwood from Halidon. Mr. Consol
                     took up the pedestrian, and announced the success of his mission to Merton
                     Park. Arrived at Beechwood, Mr. Consol produced other blanks, and at Mr.
                     Clinton's urgent solicitation accepted his cheque in settlement; and when the
                     stock-jobber left the shade of the beeches the transfer was complete, excepting
                     the exchange of certificates in London.
                  Left alone, Mr. Clinton took a pipe, and soliloquised in his native tongue as
                     follows: "Most people would call this a shady investment. It is a clean loss to
                     me as the case stands. I would not sell the stuff if I had an offer, unless Mr.
                     Blauvelt or the Honorable should propose the purchase; and it is not probable
                     that either of them will apply to me. The old gentleman said it was Baby's
                     money. Maybe it is not a loss after all; I am going to own Baby or die! What
                     use would money be to me if I failed to get Baby? And if I get her, this cheque
                     is only a transfer in advance. She is a wonderful little woman: so shy and yet
                     so frank. Cold as ice whenever I try to court her in my blundering fashion, yet
                     warm as a sunbeam at other times. What a queer lot these women are! All except
                     Mrs. Wailes; she has a way of finding out all a fellow thinks, and she has
                     another way of saying all she thinks. How savagely she pitched
                     into me the other night! She made a long speech that sounded like one of
                     Melville's sermons. Baby is one of the good sort too. If she knew that I had
                     been getting ready for her precious whelp of a cousin for two or three years,
                     what would she think? That was a famous stab of Mrs. Wailes, when she showed up
                     the meanness of fighting a fellow at disadvantage and calling it fair. It was
                     like that infallible thrust of mine—one, two,coup, and straight carte over
                     the arm; never knew it to miss. And, by George! I was thinking of putting it to
                     Mr. Rad in that way at the very time.
                  "Won't do! I shall not be cajoled or driven into an encounter with the rascal.
                     Won't do it! I have felt so much happier in every way since I decided against
                     it. After working up to the point through two or three years, making each step
                     sure, and just ready to dress Mr. Rad, lo! he slips through my fingers like a
                     greased eel. Somebody else must do his knitting for him—I'm out.
                  "Some day I'll tell Baby. Don't know how to tell her either. It will not be complimentary to say that Mrs.
                     Wailes changed all my plans in half an hour, when Baby's gentle remonstrances
                     against fighting made no impression. But they must have made a profound
                     impression, and therefore the elder lady's arguments were only the clincher.
                     How could I have ever gone for Baby with bloody hands!
                  "I think I will tell Wailes all about it. Something is the" matter with the
                     fallow, and he has pushed me away two or three times when I was getting
                     confidential. Can't do anything while he is here. This is my house, and my
                     guest is lord of it while he remains. He must choose the topics when we talk.
                     By George! maybe he likes Baby! Of course; how could he help it! I'll find out
                     this night or burst!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER LIII.
                  RESEMBLANCES.
                  When Doctor Maguire drove up to the entrance-hall at Merton Park, Jalap had
                     just worked his ear under the headstall. The gallant steed presented a front
                     that was reckless and knowing; a sort of "who cares" appearance that was
                     defiant of proprieties. The doctor replaced the bridle and punched Jalap in the
                     ribs. The latter took the punishment meekly, and consoled himself with oats
                     after he was led away to the stables.
                  Dinner came and went. The party was inclined to be dull. The Squire had not
                     told Rad of the stock transfer; in fact, the old gentleman was a little sore
                     about the whole business, and looked, with a discontented expression at his
                     hopeful nephew, who sat by Sybil and seemed to be carrying on a quarrel in
                     whispers. It was a good deal like a quarrel; Rad was saying rough things about
                     Mr. Clinton, and Sybil was defending the absent like a good woman as she was,
                     Rad had been accustomed to regard Sybil as his own property, secured by
                     mortgage, and only needing the formality of foreclosure. But now, he began to
                     have a dim apprehension that the title would be disputed. Miss Merton's eye was
                     unusually erratic, and her discovery of resemblances more numerous than common.
                     The doctor was polite and attentive, and after dinner claimed Miss Lucy for a
                     partner at the whist-table. Radcliffe sat apart, reading a late number of
                     "Bells Life," and meditating an early retreat. There were some fellows in
                     Gloucester who were going to have a night of gaming, and he had been invited to
                     join them. He had declined the invitation in the morning, because the rule of
                     the club to which they belonged was "Cash up," and his exchequer was low; but
                     he had Consol's cheque in his pocket now, and felt very much inclined to drive
                     up and take a hand.
                  A servant brought a note to Miss Merton, interrupting the game. She read it
                     with an exclamation of surprise. "It is from Mrs. Wailes, Papa," she said, "and
                     encloses some money to pay the rent of Rose Cottage to the end of the quarter;
                     she has moved away."
                  "Moved away?" said the Squire.
                  "Yes; she has gone to Halidon for the present, she says. Is sorry she did not
                     know that Mr. Radcliffe wanted the Cottage sooner, and sends her regards to you
                     and her love to Sybil."
                  "Why, what the devil does this mean, Radcliffe?" said the Squire. "Have you
                     been turning Mrs. Wailes out?"
                  "No, sir," answered Rad, stammering; "I told Trump to-day that I should want
                     the Cottage, but I did not dream of such a prompt response. The fact is, Trump
                     is so stuck-up since he got in with Grippe that one can't speak to him."
                  "Trump stuck-up! Humbug! Trump would not be stuck-up if he owned Halidon and
                     the bank both. You must have been in no end of a rage to quarrel with Trump.
                     Stuck-up! Rubbish! Cut, Doctor."
                  "What must I do with the money, Father?" said Lucy.
                  "Give it to Rad."
                  Radcliffe took the notes coolly and put them in his pocket. The amount was not
                     large, only twenty pounds, but it would do to begin with; and those Gloucester
                     fellows would not have to cash his cheque. Taking the opportunity when there
                     was some debate at the card-table over a disputed trick, Mr. Radcliffe walked
                     out, and finding Tim, was bowling along on the Gloucester road before he was
                     missed.
                  Gone to Halidon! Then she would have to account for her sudden move, and the
                     story would damage him there. The best way of egress from the dilemma was to
                     stop at Halidon, ask for Mrs. Wailes, and make whatever atonement and
                     explanation he could. It only required brass, and he had enough of that.
                     Besides, he would probably get a glimpse of Mabel, and perhaps would find an
                     opportunity to speak to her. He longed to hear the sound of her voice. The
                     redeeming spot in this man's entire history was his deep and earnest admiration
                     of Mabel, who had captivated him at first sight, impressed him with a profound sense of her goodness, and
                     awed him by the stately dignity of her demeanor.
                  "I wish I were not such a scamp," he muttered, as the gates of Halidon came
                     into sight; "if I had only been milksoppy like Trump, and had met this girl
                     before she saw the infernal Yankee, I might have been far happier. I'll get
                     another look at her anyhow. Tim, the gates are shut; jump down and ring."
                  When the Squire discovered Rad's departure, he began to reproach himself for
                     unnecessary harshness. The whist-party was broken up by tacit agreement. Mr.
                     Merton took Sybil upon his arm, and promenading the long hall, discussed all
                     the matters now on the tapis: Mrs. Wailes, Radcliffe, Trump, and Clinton. The
                     doctor, seated by Miss. Merton on the old-fashioned sofa, seized the golden
                     chance, and renewed his assault upon her virgin affections. He placed his elbow
                     on the back of the sofa, and supporting his head with his hand, he gazed at
                     Miss Lucy with an air of desolation that he had practised an hour at the
                     glass.
                  "All these comforts surrounding you, Miss Lucy, have the, tendency to harden
                     your heart," he began.
                  "Dear me, Doctor! that is what Mr. Thorne said."
                  "The—mischief he did!" answered Maguire; "and I think it is a small business in
                     Thorne to be appropriating my speeches."
                  "Oh! it was in his sermon last Sunday. He dined here afterwards, and hardened
                     his heart by taking all the comfort he could get."
                  "But I meant to suggest that you become indifferent to the woes of others. Now,
                     there's me for instance—"
                  "Doctor, would you mind it if I were to mention a resemblance—"
                  "Certainly not, Miss Lucy."
                  "Well, you look like Jalap when his ear is under the headstall. Your finger has
                     bent your ear over; you know how cunning your horse looks when he gets that ear
                     down."
                  "Upon my word, Miss Lucy!" said the doctor, "that is an original discovery. I
                     have threatened to cut off that ear a dozen times, and now I'll do it."
                  "That would be cruel, Doctor," answered Miss Merton, "and I am sure you will
                     not hurt Jalap; I have heard of your great kindness to the poor people of
                     Merton."
                  "But they don't pin their ears down," said the Doctor, savagely, "and thus
                     suggest those abominable resemblances to you. I wish you could discover a
                     likeness in me to the man you would be willing to marry."
                  "Doctor," said Miss Lucy, "you remind me of Sir Lucius O'Tralee."
                  "He must be a countryman of mine, anyway," answered, the Doctor, moodily. "What
                     ridiculous trick did he play?"
                  "Ridiculous! None, sir. He was a gallant gentleman, and he courted a lady I
                     knew, so diligently that she married him at last."
                  "Be jabers! he's the boy for me! Do you mane that I may win your affections at
                     last by persistent effort? Why, Miss Lucy, I'll make a fresh proposal to you
                     every day for a year."
                  "Very well, Doctor. Lady O'Tralee told me that she married him at last to get
                     rid of him."
                  "The divil! Excuse me, Miss Lucy, but this is the worst resemblance of all. If
                     you are going to take me at the end of the year merely to get rid of me, you'll
                     be badly done. Faix! I'll take you on my rounds in the gig."
                  "You will have to fix Jalap's ear—"
                  "Vesicating epispastic! I'll fix him!"
                  "I believe that is swearing, Doctor. Is it Latin or Irish?"
                  "It's half and half, Miss Lucy—half Latin and half Greek; and Greek is the same
                     as Irish, you know: it only manes that I'll blister the rashkill. Am I to
                     understand that you favor my proposal?"
                  "Well, Doctor," answered the lady, "you are so impetuous. You propose to court
                     for a whole year—"
                  "Divil a bit! I said every day for a year—I mane every day in the present year,
                     and that will make a hundred proposals."
                  "Suppose I agree to entertain no other proposals, Doctor," said Miss Merton,
                     "and to give due consideration to yours? Since old Mrs. Grumpy told me how
                     tenderly you ministered to her, I've felt very kindly towards you; you must
                     have a good heart."
                  "It's just a blazing coal of fire, Miss Lucy! I can't say much about the
                     goodness, but the extent of its devotion to you can niver be told. Faix! if I
                     could cut a hole in my ribs and let you see how it bates, you would take me
                     off-hand."
                  "And then I should be discovering all kinds of resemblances, Doctor, and you
                     have no patience—"
                  "Pashints! I've got forty on my list, and thirty-five of them pay nothing.
                     Botheration! Miss Lucy, you may discover a likeness to the ould fellow himself
                     if you plaze, as soon as you promise to become Mrs. Maguire."
                  "Here comes Papa; I'll ask his opinion about the matter, Doctor. You have
                     proposed several times, but you never would wait for an answer; I am sure I
                     never rejected you."
                  
                  "Rejected me!" said the Doctor. "The last time I proposed do you know what you
                     said?"
                  "No; I don't remember."
                  "Well, you said I resembled ould Podd. If you will indicate what encouragement
                     there was in that I'll be obliged."
                  "I am sure, Doctor," replied Miss Merton, with her eye in the corner, "I cannot
                     help the resemblances. When you remind me of other people and things I should
                     be very deceitful if I did not say so."
                  "Thrue for you, Miss Lucy—"
                  "Now there's Radcliffe. I happened to say last night that he was like the
                     giraffe I saw at Regent's Park—he was craning his neck up, trying to look over
                     the blind—and he was quite nettled."
                  "He's a simpleton," answered the Doctor, promptly.
                  "Of course. Now, there was the hippopotamus; he kept moving about in the tank,
                     with his nose up, and swimming over to the side where the children were
                     throwing bits of cake—"
                  "What is that about the hippopotamus, Lucy?" said the Squire, approaching. "You
                     mean at the Zoo? Are you telling the Doctor what you said about his
                     resemblance? Ho! ho!"
                  "Yes, Papa; there is no objection, I'm sure. Well, Doctor, I only said that the
                     hippopotamus was so amiable and patient when the bad children threw him pebbles
                     and sticks instead of cakes, that—that he reminded me of you when the little
                     rascals at Merton rang your office-bell that night. You remember you said that
                     they would have measles or something before they died, and you would administer
                     their medicine?"
                  "Yes," grunted the Doctor.
                  "Well, I caught the eye of the hippopotamus, and it said just as plainly as
                     possible: 'Some fine day one of you young vagabonds will tumble into my tank,
                     and if I don't make mincemeat of you my name's not—'"
                  "'Maguire!'" shouted the Squire—" that's what she said, Doctor; and by Jupiter!
                     the fellow's eye did twinkle so significantly that I've no doubt Lucy hit his
                     thought precisely. We had been talking about the satisfaction you could take
                     out of the boys when you physicked 'em; and we concluded that Lucy had made her
                     point. Ho! ho! ho!"
                  "Ha! ha! ha!" responded the doctor. "And now, I must be off. Sorry to tear
                     meself away, but I must see the village people to-night. Miss Lucy, we'll have
                     another lot of likenesses when the Squire invites me to dinner again."
                  The doctor meditated as he drove homeward under the stars.
                  "Ould Podd, Jalap, and a hippopotamus—a baste that looks for all the worrild
                     like an overgrown pig under the influence of a strong narcotic. Be jabers! she
                     has nothing left now, barrin' the divil."
               
               
                  CHAPTER LIV.
                  STILL ANOTHER.
                  The reception Mrs. Wailes met as she descended from the carriage at Halidon was
                     flattering. Mr. Grippe, bareheaded, stood out on the gravel, and with courtly
                     politeness assisted her as she alighted. On either side of him stood a fairy,
                     each lovelier by reason of the contrast with the other, and each beaming with
                     smiles that were full of sweetness and indicative of hearty welcome. Mr. Grippe
                     resigned her to the fairies, who escorted her up the stone steps, while he
                     hobbled after. They led her into the great drawing-room, blazing with lights,
                     and placing her in the arm-chair, which was Mr. Grippe's throne, divested her
                     of bonnet and wraps. The excellent lady, usually composed and self-possessed,
                     was slightly excited by her novel surroundings, as she had not had the
                     opportunity for a little quiet meditation since the receipt of Mr. Grippe's
                     invitation; and her dialogue with her son, just concluded, added to her
                     excitement; which the sight of Mabel, bright and blooming, suggested the
                     possibility of the existence of Another. There was in her mind also a vague
                     sense of the obligation resting upon her to administer twenty-five grains of
                     strychnia to Another, should he appear.
                  Mabel's bloom was deepened a little because she saw no Prince Prettyman, and
                     she was dying to know why he had not appeared. Mr. Grippe, who was always
                     prompt about things, was trotting about, under excitement also, and she could
                     not suggest to him the propriety of asking Mrs. Wailes to explain the Prince's
                     absence. She would have to wait until it came out naturally.
                  Helose was French, and simply charming; nothing had occurred to make her claws
                     protrude, and she was velvety. Mabel looked at her and listened to her voluble
                     welcomes with great admiration.
                  "Ah, Madame has come to create terrible strife," she said; "Mabel and I have
                     agreed to scratch each other, a l' outrance,
                     for her favor. But not to-night; we postpone the combat until Madame is
                     rested."
                  
                  "But you must talk to me in English, Mademoiselle," said Mrs. Wailes. "Do you
                     not remember that we agreed to banish French?"
                  "Oh yaas. That will also be polite for me, because Madame will talk mosh, and I
                     very leetle."
                  "And when you and Miss Grahame begin your combat, I would suggest that you
                     scold each other in English—"
                  "Ah, then I am conquered; Mabel scold perfectly in three—four language, and I
                     know not the English scold-words."
                  Mr. Grippe was eager to get off his formal welcome. He fidgeted around the
                     trio, while they laughed at this last sally, and when they regained their
                     composure, he found his opportunity.
                  "I am truly happy, Mrs. Wailes," he said, "to welcome you back to your ancient
                     home; and I shall feel the more honored the more your assert your rightful
                     authority. You will believe my assurance that all I wrote you is true, and
                     we'll wait a day or two for full explanation and proof, at present necessarily
                     delayed. Your son is not with you."
                  "He sends his excuses, Mr. Grippe. He had promised to spend some days at
                     Beechwood, and Mr. Clinton expected him to-night. I cannot answer your welcome
                     properly, as the whole proceeding is beyond my powers of comprehension; but I
                     have no difficulty in accepting your hospitality for a few days, which I do
                     very gratefully. These dear girls will bring back my lost youth while we
                     explore old Halidon together."
                  No Prince, pretty Mabel! Helose did not care about the Prince; her jest about
                     the combat for Mrs. Wailes' favor was partly true, however. On the day of the
                     dinner, when Mrs. Wailes sat with Mabel instead of cultivating Helose, the
                     latter was jealous. Certain attentions were due to "my adopted daughter" from
                     all the visitors at Halidon; so Helose, with a little spice of malice, had said
                     to Mabel, "Do not dislocate your ankle again, ma belle, and thus monopolise
                     Madame!" And Mabel winced, feeling guilty. Helose was also jealous because Mr.
                     Clinton had been more impressive and apparently confidential with Mabel that
                     day. There were smouldering fires ready to flame out upon provocation.
                  Mrs. Wailes was wise and considerate. She was strongly attracted to the English
                     girl, while she felt only a polite interest in the other; therefore she was
                     diligent in her attentions to Helose, giving Mabel's little hand a gentle
                     pressure slyly when occasion served. Tea was served in the library. They all
                     went out upon the South Terrace afterwards, and while they sat there Mr.
                     Radcliffe Merton arrived, and alighting, from his vehicle, joined them, fully
                     equipped with modest assurance.
                  He shook hands with Mr. Gripped, bowed to the young ladies, and taking a vacant
                     chair near Mrs. Wailes, addressed her with tears in his accents.
                  "I am deeply wounded, Mrs. Wailes," said he, "to find you here. A few petulant
                     words to Trump have wrought great mischief; after all these years of
                     friendship, it seems to me that I should have endured more from him with better
                     temper."
                  "Trump is usually patient and forbearing," answered Mrs. Wailes, "and he has
                     said nothing to me that indicated resentment—"
                  "So much the worse, ma'am," said Radcliffe. "If he had been in a real good
                     rage, I shouldn't wonder at this move. Is he here?"
                  "No."
                  "That is unlucky," said Radcliffe, secretly rejoicing that Trump was not
                     basking in the light of the violet eyes; "but I'll see him to-morrow and make
                     no end of apologies. I don't know what to say to you, ma'am, except that I am
                     heartily sorry and mortified."
                  "Pray, say nothing then," responded Mrs. Wailes. "No harm has been done. Trump
                     only told me that you wanted the Cottage as soon as possible, and we vacated it
                     at once. I should have done the same, however, if you had not wanted
                     possession."
                  "You were going away, anyhow?" said Radcliffe, surprised.
                  "Yes."
                  "Well, that is a relief. It was only last week that you spoke of plans for the
                     winter—"
                  "But circumstances have occurred since then to change my plans—nothing
                     connected with your disagreement with Trump. How bright the stars are!"
                  "Beautiful!" answered Radcliffe, rising. "I am going to Gloucester. Miss
                     Grahame, I am recently from Blackfriars; may I say a word to you in
                     private?"
                  While Mabel, stricken speechless by this proposal, sat silent, Mrs. Wailes took
                     the arm of Helose and stepped out upon the lawn. Mr. Grippe had gone into the
                     library, and they were alone upon the terrace. Radcliffe had made the request
                     with no definite plan of attack, and was trying to call up some plausible
                     story, when Mabel stood suddenly before him.
                  "Blackfriars, sir!" she said. "Is my father ill?"
                  "Oh, no; forgive me if I have alarmed you. I—I did not see Mr. Grahame, though
                     I called twice. Once he was out, the second time he declined seeing me; and as my business
                     was of great importance to me—I desired to ask you for the
                     explanation of his denial."
                  "I cannot enlighten you, sir," answered Mabel, coldly.
                  "Will you please resume your seat and hear what I have to say—"
                  "In the library, if you please," said Mabel, moving towards the door; "there is
                     nothing you can have to say that Mr. Grippe may not hear."
                  "Pardon me again," said Radcliffe, stepping between her and the door; "I will
                     detain you but a moment. I called on Mr. Grahame to obtain his consent before I
                     addressed you. My life depends upon the success of my suit. I ask you to look
                     upon me as a suitor for your hand. I have never—nay," and he caught her hand as
                     she brushed by him, "you must hear me out. I love you so madly that I am not
                     accountable for any violation of proprieties! I swear to you that I will leave
                     no means untried—I will kill any man who stands between you and me! And I will
                     destroy myself when I relinquish the hope of possessing you!"
                  He held her hand in a vise. She did not struggle, but her face, dimly visible
                     in the starlight, was ablaze with resentment.
                  "Release my hand, if you please," she said.
                  "Not until you answer me! Do you want me to swear more solemnly? Do you think I
                     am not in earnest?"
                  "I think you have dined recently. James, take this person away! he is drunk."
                     The air of infinite scorn and disgust with which she spoke would have
                     annihilated a sensitive suitor.
                  James had appeared unexpectedly, coming round the corner of the house, and
                     promptly drew near the excited couple. Radcliffe dropped the imprisoned hand,
                     and without a word moved out upon the grass. Mabel opened the library-door,
                     rubbing her hand vigorously with her handkerchief, and seeing Mr. Grippe
                     nodding over his newspaper, passed him, gained the staircase, went to her own
                     room, and after an elaborated ablution, sat down and indulged in a good
                     cry.
                  Rage, pure and simple, drew forth the tears. The insolence of this assault, so
                     outraging all decency! And no one near to defend her! She felt so unprotected
                     and desolate. She would go back to Blackfriars at once; her father would shield
                     her. Ah, when the brute called on him, he denied himself. Oh, noble father! And
                     she cried a little more, thinking of him, and longing to lay her head on his
                     breast.
                  An arm slipped around her waist, and her wet hands pulled gently away from her
                     face—Mrs. Wailes kneeling by her chair.
                  "What troubles you, my dear?" said the gentlest voice in England.
                  More tears now—a flood of them. She had found a resting-place almost as good as
                     the Reverend Edward's sturdy breast. When she got her voice back, she tried to
                     tell her distress.
                  "The hideous brute! he seized my hand, ma'am, and held me while he talked. He
                     said he loved me, the wretch! How dare he insult an English gentlewoman! No
                     amount of drunkenness will excuse him."
                  "Of whom are you speaking, Mabel?"
                  "Of that cat-eyed, ugly wretch, Radcliffe Merton—so hateful to me that the mere
                     sight of his name on a letter drove me from your house! There, it is out! Yes,
                     Mrs. Wailes, on the morning after my accident your maid brought a letter
                     addressed to this man, and I, never having seen him, concluded that your son
                     was he, and that you were his wretched mother; and the one horrible fact
                     pressing upon me constantly is that his mother murdered mine!"
                  "What dreadful words! Poor child, you do not know what you are saying."
                  "Do I not?" answered Mabel. "Listen. This man's father killed my uncle. There
                     was no proof, but my father says it is certainly true. He drove his wife mad—I
                     mean my uncle's wife. My mother, who was in feeble health, died when I was
                     born, and my father says the shock killed her. Surely you ought to know the
                     story—"
                  "What was your mother's name, Mabel?" said Mrs. Wailes, a light breaking upon
                     her mind.
                  "Daisy Lennox."
                  "My darling! my dear girl! how could I be so blind! Your mother was my dearest
                     friend. I will tell you to-morrow how I sought for her and Dora; but you
                     mentioned your uncle—do you mean Dora's husband?"
                  "Yes, ma'am; Harold Trumpley of Halidon."
                  Mrs. Wailes started to her feet. More light still; she was dazzled and
                     confounded; and while she still strove to reconcile the conflicting accounts
                     she had received from Baden after her brother's death, and the vague rumors of
                     his wife's death at Chlons, Mabel continued her story.
                  "There was something about Captain Merton's courtship of my Aunt Dora. I don't
                     know the particulars; but she rejected him and married Mr. Trumpley. There was
                     also some story of previous quarrels between them. Father says they were both
                     jealous and exacting; but they were married, and went to Baden with my parents.
                     Captain Merton and Miss Radcliffe were there, and by some means they managed to sow discord between husband and
                     wife. Aunt Dora left Baden, and her husband was found dead the next day. We
                     have the letters—or at least De Witt has them—"
                  "De Witt!" said Mrs. Wailes, horrified.
                  "Yes, ma'am; Mr. Clinton—my cousin. He is the son of my mother's sister
                     Mabel."
                  "Cousin!" said Mrs. Wailes. "My child, perhaps your hatred of Radcliffe is
                     measured by your affection for your cousin. Tell me, if you have more than
                     cousinly affection for him?"
                  "Dear Mrs. Wailes," said Mabel, laughing gleefully, "don't you know? Alas! I
                     think De Witt loves Another."
               
               
                  CHAPTER LV.
                  LOSS AND GAIN.
                  While Mr. Radcliffe Merton was delivering his impassioned address on the South
                     Terrace, the sharp eyes of Helose were taking in all the gestures; and though
                     she gave courteous attention to Mrs. Wailes, she was snapping her white teeth
                     with a click, and mourning that she did not have Mabel's disengaged fingers
                     between them. The light of the stars was not sufficient to show Mabel's look of
                     horror and repugnance at the discreet distance of twenty yards, though Mr.
                     Merton could see it very distinctly. It was all over in a minute or two, and
                     when Mabel whisked through the door into the library, the young gentleman
                     stepped down from the terrace and approached the two ladies.
                  "It was horridly rude of me," he said, "to invite you to retire; but I had a
                     word to say to Miss Grahame that I was not at liberty to say in public. Allow
                     me to escort you back to the terrace."
                  "Do you not feel cool?" said Mrs. Wailes to Helose, when they resumed their
                     seats.
                  "Oh no, Madam; the air is charming."
                  "Well, I do. If you will excuse me, I will get a shawl."
                  "Allow me, Madam—"
                  "By no means. I will return presently; but I think you had better come
                     indoors."
                  "If Monsieur is cold—" said Helose.
                  "On the contrary," answered Radcliffe, "I am stifling." This was a slight
                     exaggeration, but his cheeks felt comfortably warm. He had a vague impression
                     that his ears had been boxed soundly by the little hand he had rudely seized a
                     moment before.
                  Mr. Grippe was still somnolent as Mrs. Wailes crossed the room. She found her
                     shawl, and hearing the young people in animated conversation on the terrace,
                     she ascended the staircase in search of Mabel. Her door was ajar, and she saw
                     her sitting in the corner, her face covered with her hands. Without hesitation,
                     Mrs. Wailes entered her chamber, and kneeling by the sobbing girl, took her in
                     her arms.
                  "Monsieur speaks French?" said Helose, when Mrs. Wailes left them.
                  "No—that is, not well enough to converse; but you speak English
                     charmingly."
                  "I have taken some lesson," answered Helose. "I have a letter in English which
                     I obtained at the Madeleine; some gallant gentleman have write the letter to
                     instruct me and to amuse himself." She took a letter from her pocket as she
                     spoke. "See, it is here. It say many pretty English words. I have learned them
                     all. But hlas! the pretty words are all lies," and she tore the letter up in
                     minute fragments and scattered them upon the terrace.
                  "This is a devil of a mess!" muttered Radcliffe; "and I'll be hanged if I can
                     see my way out of it."
                  "It is the English style, is it not?" continued Helose. "I am desolated to
                     think Monsieur had such trouble. He have to make lies for Mees Sybil also, and
                     for Mabel."
                  "If you will listen to me," said Radcliffe, "I will explain."
                  "Listen?" said Helose. "It does not need. Monsieur can write one letter again.
                     He can make new lies, and say there is no Mees Sybil and no Mabel."
                  "I assure you," said Radcliffe, "that you do me injustice. You gave me no
                     encouragement. When I came here to dinner and saw you—"
                  "And Mabel—it was to Mabel you look. You address to me not the word; and when
                     Mabel was retired, you no longer could remain."
                  "I had to go to London and to Paris—"
                  "Ah then! you have to make more letters for the Madeleine, is it not?"
                  "You will not hear me!" said Radcliffe, rising. "I will leave you now and hope
                     to satisfy you hereafter. You have destroyed my letter, and you drive me away. When your anger
                     is over, I will come again. Ready, Tim! Au revoir, Mademoiselle!"
                  James, who had been lingering within call since Mabel had departed, opened the
                     gates to give the dog-cart egress. Looking with stolid composure after the
                     retreating vehicle until it was lost in the darkness, he rentered and locked
                     the lodge-gates. "That Merton is a bad lot!" he said, shaking his head
                     solemnly. "Miss Gram was mistaken. It was not drunk—it was devil; and if it
                     came in the way of duty, I'd like to punch 'is' ead."
                  Mr. Merton meantime pursued his way to Gloucester. The Festive Club was his
                     objective point. It was quite nine o'clock when he arrived, and the members
                     were busy at their usual vocation—passing money from one to another upon the
                     cast of a die or the turn of a card. There were no "debts of honor" due to or
                     by the members of the "Festive," as their cardinal law forbade all gambling
                     upon honor; "money up" was the invariable rule.
                  Radcliffe found a place at the roulette-table, and in the course of an hour or
                     two had parted with all his loose money. He had Mr. Consol's cheque, however,
                     and the obliging treasure of the club cashed it for him; and just as Munseer
                     Blowell was delivering his peroration at Merton Village, Mr. Radcliffe Merton
                     resumed his seat at roulette.
                  Wine in abundance. Radcliffe liked wine, especially Burgundy; but he imbibed
                     sparingly, though frequently, and lost a good number of twenty-pound notes.
                     Convinced at last that he was "out of luck," he suddenly left the table, the
                     larger part of his money gone.
                  "Curse that Dorado!" he said. "It has brought me into trouble all the time; and
                     after getting out of it so nicely, I have squandered the most of the proceeds
                     her. By all the gods! I'll put what's left of it upon the next roll, and then
                     quit either way."
                  He counted out the remainder of his money, and putting on his hat and overcoat,
                     laid the banknotes on the table. The ball spun round a short minute and fell
                     into the wrong compartment—Dorado was all gone.
                  Tim was waiting at the door for him. Some unusual touch of human emotion
                     flashed upon Merton's mind as he thought of Tim's long vigil out in the cold.
                     He went back, and tossing off a bumper of Burgundy, refilled the glass and took
                     it out to his groom. "Here, Tim, you have had a long watch; this will warm your
                     blood. Drink."
                  "What is it, Mr. Radcliffe?" said Tim, doubtfully.
                  "Red Burgundy, you rascal! Not quite equal to old Grippe's; but' will do. Down
                     with it!"
                  While the strange liquid trickled down Tim's throat, his master climbed up to
                     his perch. Taking the empty goblet from his servant's hand, he tossed it
                     carelessly into the street. "That will spoil the set," he muttered. "The
                     'Festive' will have a memorandum against me. G'long, Maggie!"
                  As he turned out of the high-street and took the Merton road, the town-clock
                     struck five; the dawn was at hand.
                  Before he reached Beechwood he saw a man running at full speed, meeting him.
                     The light was not strong enough to distinguish what he was like. "Hillo,
                     friend!" said Radcliffe, as the figure flitted by; "Is the devil after
                     you?"
                  The fugitive made no reply, and as Merton pulled up his horses as if to stop,
                     he scrambled through the hedge and disappeared.
                  "He has been at some villainy," said Merton; "but it is no business of ours. I
                     hope he has been murdering that cursed Yankee!"
                  Past Beechwood and approaching Halidon. Another pedestrian, but walking soberly
                     and with stately grace. The dawn was here.
                  "Miss Gram!" said Tim.
                  "What!" answered Radcliffe, checking his team.
                  "Miss Gram! No sich walk in Hingland!"
                  Radliffe passed the reins to Tim, and stood in the road suddenly, confronting
                     the lady. "By all the gods," he said as she stopped, "my luck has changed!
                     Allow me to offer Miss Grahame a seat. Tim, turn the horses!"
                  Mabel passed him silently, but he caught her arm and drew her back. "Come,"
                     said he, with a brutal laugh, "your game is up! I am going to give you a
                     drive," and he passed his arm around her waist. "Where are you going? To visit
                     the Yankee? Rather early, I should think."
                  "How dare you, sir!" said Mabel, as she struggled to get free. "Release me and
                     begone!"
                  "Begone! Certainly; but I shall take you with me. Tim, give me a lift!"
                  "Help!" screamed Mabel.
                  "Bah!" said Merton, catching her mantle from her shoulders and throwing it over
                     her head. Drawing the folds tightly over her face, he raised her bodily and
                     carried her to the roadside. She struggled violently, and tried to tear the
                     mantle from her face. In vain. With Tim's aid he placed her in the bottom of
                     the dog-cart, and kneeling by her side, held her down with the grasp of a
                     giant.
                  "Listen!" said Merton, carefully uncovering a little pink shell of an ear, while he held the cloak
                     tightly to her face—"Listen! Do you suppose I am going to rest under your scorn
                     and hatred? Never! I shall take you where no eye but mine will see you, and
                     keep you until you learn to look upon me with favor. You silly girl! you do not
                     know what a devil you defy. If my infatuation were less, I might consider all
                     the risks I incur in abducting a lady from the highroad and carrying her off to
                     my den. But I heed no consequences! I would not release you now if I knew that
                     death was the consequence of detaining you! I am glad to see that you have
                     enough sense to cease your useless struggle. The sooner that you know you are
                     entirely in my power, and entirely helpless, the better. Tim, drive to the
                     Cottage!"
                  "Better not go down this road," said Tim, with drunken gravity. The Burgundy
                     had fallen on top of six mugs of ale, which Tim had taken at regular intervals
                     while waiting at the door of the club; and "harmless" as either was alone, the
                     joint forces of ale and wine had been too much for Tim.
                  "Why not?"
                  "Cause we shall meet Merton people coming to Glo'ster, and shall pass two or
                     three lodges, and day is coming."
                  "How shall we go then?" said Merton, irresolutely.
                  "There is a lane back yonder that comes out by the mill. It is longer, but is
                     apt to be quiet."
                  "Go on then. Keep the rein tight on Maggie, and she will move faster. By all
                     the gods! I believe the girl is smothered; she has not moved since we put her
                     in. Drive on; I will uncover her face when we reach the lane."
                  And when they passed under the trees in the narrow lane, he cautiously removed
                     the cloak from the pale face. A flush crept over it, her eyes opened, and
                     starting up with unexpected vigor as she caught sight of Beechwood and the two
                     gables, she cried stentoriously, "Help! help! Mr. Wailes! Mr. Clinton! Help!
                     help!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER LVI.
                  THE GHOST REAPPEARS.
                  "My dear Wailes," said Clinton, swinging the gate open, "welcome! I am ashamed
                     of my thoughtlessness. And you have carried your portmanteau all the way from
                     Rose Cottage! I could have sent Memnon, if I had not been so hopelessly
                     thick-skulled."
                  "Pooh!" answered Trumpley, "it is only half a mile. I rode as far as
                     Halidon."
                  "Indeed! Here, Memnon, take it to Mr. Wailes' room. You have dined, of
                     course?"
                  "Yes," answered Wailes; "but you will have to give me some food before
                     bed-time. My dinner was light, and eaten very hurriedly."
                  "That's jolly!" exclaimed Clinton, producing his whistle and sounding two
                     notes. "Ah, here's Phillis. Phillis, my friend Mr. Wailes will be hungry anon.
                     I give you no orders; I merely announce the fact."
                  "Werry well, Mars Clint. What time anon come?"
                  "Mr. Wailes, will you please answer the question?" said Clinton.
                  "Nay, the case is not urgent," answered Wailes; "you have your regular hours,
                     of course. Whenever you call, I shall be ready."
                  "Mars Clint don't have no reg'lar hours for nuffin," said Phillis,
                     discontentedly. "Him go to sleep in day-time, and walk about all night. Him eat
                     dinner when mos' people done gone to bed one time, and don't eat none next day.
                     Nebber mind—him git married some day; den we'll see about de hours! I'll have
                     supper ready at ten o'clock, sar," and Phillis departed.
                  "That remark about marriage," said Clinton, as they entered the hall, "was
                     partly prophetic and partly threatening. Wailes, my dear friend, if I ever get
                     a wife, I shall have to thank you for rescuing her from great peril."
                  "I do not understand you," said Wailes, stammering.
                  "Do you not? Well, I have selected my future partner, and she is a lady who
                     owes her life—"
                  "Pooh!" said Wailes, "don't talk rubbish. Where are we going?"
                  "Up to my den first," said Clinton; "the pipes are there. We will smoke a
                     little, and I will tell you a story."
                  "About your ghost?"
                  "Yes; it is time you should know. The tobacco is in that cannister; here are
                     the pipes. What are you looking at so intently? The swords? Do you recognise
                     them?"
                  "They certainly look like the Gttingen small-swords," said Wailes, taking the
                     weapons down from the wall; "are they really the same?"
                  "Yes. When I got over my—little accident, I prevailed on the master of arms to
                     give them to me for a new pair. I thought I would renew the trial with Mr. Merton some day,
                     and I had a fancy for the same weapons. Don't look so grave," he continued,
                     laughing; "I have given up that intention. Your mother assaulted me one night,
                     and—and—exorcised me; I had been possessed for years. I cannot tell you all she
                     said, but the sum of it was, that I—conscious of superior skill—meditated
                     cold-blooded murder under the guise of a fair encounter. It was every word
                     true, Wailes. Lay down your pipe and let me show you something."
                  He took down a pair of foils as he spoke, and chalked the buttons.
                  "Now stand here," he said, giving a foil to Wailes. "You are wonderfully expert
                     with the weapon, but you are no match for me, Button your coat, please—so! Now
                     I will put four chalk-marks on your right breast in four passes, all within two
                     inches of the second button. En garde!"
                  There was a rasping of steel against steel, a rapid interchange of thrusts,
                     lasting two or three minutes only, and Clinton lowered his point.
                  "It is done," he said; "examine your coat. Did you feel any of the
                     thrusts?"
                  "No," answered Wailes, in astonishment; "but here are the spots, beyond
                     doubt."
                  Clinton returned the foils to their hook on the wall, brushed off the
                     chalk-marks from his friend's coat, and coolly lighted his pipe. They drew up
                     their chairs to the hearth, where a wood-fire was burning.
                  "Now, my friend," said Clinton, "you will begin to understands. I spent a year
                     in incessant practice, with the best teachers I could find. I had one in Paris,
                     and stuck to him until I mastered him. Then I went to Vienna and found another,
                     and finally went to Naples, where I learned my best tricks. My instructor there
                     invested his art with a certain glamour that charmed me; I stayed with him
                     until he told me he could teach me no more.
                  "In all this time, and indeed until a few nights ago, I had one set purpose; it
                     was to make the same kind of a hole in Rad Merton's body as the one he made in
                     mine. I could afford to wait, I could select my own time; but all other plans
                     were subordinate to this one. I really believe the devil had entire control of
                     me during those years.
                  "You see how shabby the whole business is! I cannot tell you how heartily I
                     blush when I think of it. It is like Rad's own tricks; it is about equal to
                     playing cards with an ignorant booby, when you can read the backs. Pah! how
                     could I be so base a whelp as to entertain the purpose? And how can I be
                     grateful enough for the deliverance wrought by your good mother's agency?
                  "And—greatest marvel of all—I expected to go to this gentle girl, and ask her
                     to take my bloody hand. Think of it, Wailes!"
                  "What did Mother say?" asked Trumpley.
                  "Rather what did she not say," answered Clinton. "I knew of course that the
                     whole story was new to her. I told her that night after Mr. Grippe's dinner;
                     and yet the lecture she gave me sounded like a moral essay read out of a book.
                     She is a wonderful woman—wonderful!"
                  Wailes had a sly suspicion that Mrs. Wailes had quoted from the Meditations; he
                     knew her tricks. But he was loyal and silent. While they sat and smoked, he
                     recalled certain passages in the same fountain of wisdom.
                  "Obligations," quoth he, or rather quoted he, "must be founded upon relations.
                     You can see that a man is bound to do certain thin'gs as a member of society,
                     which he would not be bound to do if he were alone in the world. There are
                     duties belonging to the subject of a state, differing from the duties demanded
                     from the member of a household. I have always been taught that there is a law
                     of brotherhood perpetually pressing upon the sons of men. It forbids
                     selfishness; it banishes vengeance; it inculcates beneficence. The formulation
                     of this law is found in the Decalogue; in the Gospel it is summarily stated in
                     the axiom, 'No man liveth unto himself; no man dieth unto himself; But his life
                     and death have a far-reaching effect upon the whole course of human
                     history."
                  "Go on, my dear fellow," said Clinton; "it sounds like a page from Paley."
                  "Paley be blowed!" answered Wailes, irreverently; "he did not begin to
                     apprehend the law. There is more of pure ethics in a page of Sir William
                     Hamilton than in the whole of Paley's writings."
                  "It is all very fine," said Clinton after a pause; "but the whole of human
                     history just contradicts your axioms."
                  "Of course. Humanity is in an abnormal condition. Logic as really demands
                     regeneration as revelation does."
                  "I hear the clatter of dishes," said Clinton—"prepare. Do you know what Phillis
                     will give you?"
                  "No."
                  "Well, I will tell you; Pongoteague oysters. A barrel arrived today: fifteen
                     days' from Baltimore, and packed in ice. My friend, if you have never had
                     Pongoteague oysters, you will have a new sensation sation. Let us go to the dining-room; Phillis
                     will summon us to her feast in five minutes."
                  The sonorous announcement of midnight by the old clock in the hall startled the
                     young gentlemen as they sat in the drawing-room after supper. Wailes prepared
                     to retire, Clinton lighting his candle. As they were shaking hands, the door
                     leading to the main hall opened, and with noiseless tread a lady entered the
                     room. Her beautiful hair, white as snow, was arranged in broad folds upon her
                     head. There was a longing expression in her eyes, as she advanced to Clinton,
                     holding out her hands. "I want Daisy," she said, softly. "Did you not tell me I
                     should see Daisy?"
                  Clinton sprang to her side, took her hand, and led her to the sofa. "Dear Aunt
                     Dora," said he, "you will wait a little, will you not?"
                  "I cannot wait! I want Daisy," she answered, plaintively. "Send him for her,"
                     and she pointed her slender finger at Wailes.
                  "This is my friend Mr. Wailes," said Clinton.
                  "Yes—Trumpley Wailes. He told me. Ah! young gentleman, you are ill-named."
                  "Do not say so, Madam," replied Trumpley; "my mother was Edith Trumpley, and my
                     name came from her."
                  "Edith!" she answered, dreamily. "Edith! Certainly; bring her also, De
                     Witt."
                  "I will, Aunt Dora, at daylight. Will you wait until daylight? It will only be
                     a few hours. Let me take you to your room."
                  She took his arm, nodding her head to Wailes as she went from the room. While
                     Wailes was debating the question whether he should retire or not, Clinton
                     returned.
                  "You may as well extinguish your bed-candle," said Clinton; "after seeing so
                     much, you will not sleep until you know more. Do you know her?"
                  "You called her 'Aunt Dora,'" said Wailes; "she must be Dora Lennox. She is
                     also Mrs. Hamet."
                  "And the widow of Harold Trumpley," said Clinton. "I will despatch a message to
                     Doctor Maguire; the crisis of her disease is at hand. Memnon!"
                  The sable Greek appeared.
                  "Saddle Phaginny. I will write a note to Doctor Maguire; you must go to Merton
                     and find him. Don't return without him."
                  "All right, Mars Clint," and Memnon vanished.
                  "Excuse me one moment, Wailes; I must send for Mabel too. She can come at
                     daylight; and we will go for Mrs. Wailes a little later." He opened an
                     escritoire and wrote two notes. In five minutes the tramp of Phaginny's hoofs
                     was heard on the gravel. Clinton went through the conservatory and out at the
                     secret door.
                  "When you get the Doctor started, Memnon," he said, "ride with him as far as
                     Halidon; and get in there, and see that Miss Mabel Grahame gets this note at
                     once. Away with you!"
                  "And now, Wailes," he said, as he returned, "come up to the den and hear a long
                     story. No sleep for you to-night, my boy."
               
               
                  CHAPTER LVII.
                  APPROACHING A CRISIS.
                  Mr. Clinton deliberately divested himself of coat and waistcoat, and donned his
                     dressing-gown. He exchanged his boots for moccasins, and recommended similar
                     changes to his guest. Wailes was provided with gown and slippers; and with a
                     log or two added to the fire, some bottles of bitter beer on the table, and the
                     inevitable pipes, the two young gentlemen prepared to "make a night of it."
                     Clinton closed the inside shutters, wheeled his great chair to one side of the
                     hearth and the sofa to the other, and stretching himself out upon the latter,
                     began his story.
                  "Aunt Dora will sleep now until five o'clock," he said; "she is very regular in
                     her habits. I can talk with perfect freedom to you now, and indeed I brought
                     you to Beechwood for that purpose; but I had arranged to have your mother also,
                     and Mabel, to-morrow, and to tell you all together."
                  Wailes winced slightly at the mention of Mabel.
                  "You know Mabel?" continued Clinton; "that is, you saw her at Mr. Grippe's
                     dinner. Had you seen her before?"
                  "Yes, certainly," replied Wailes, thinking this was a strange question to come
                     from the man who had so recently thanked him for saving her life. The next
                     sentence or two bewildered him still more.
                  "Captain Lennox had three daughters. The eldest, Mabel, was my mother; the
                     second, Dora, you saw to-night. She is the widow of your uncle, Harold Trumpley
                     of Halidon. This much I know positively, but there are mysteries about her
                     marriage and her reported death that I cannot unravel. You will aid me anon.
                     The third daughter, Daisy, was the mother of Mabel Grahame."
                  
                  Wailes started to his feet, threw his pipe in the fire, walked round to the
                     head of the sofa, shook Clinton's hand violently, and then resumed his seat.
                     "Go on, you jolly old long-legged brick, go on!"
                  "Ah!" said Clinton, somewhat surprised at this demonstration, "that is your
                     British fashion of recognising the family connection. Well, your uncle married
                     my aunt, so we are almost kin. Better get another pipe."
                  Trump meekly selected a new pipe from the box, filled and lighted it, taking a
                     sip of beer first.
                  "There is no such thing as Another," observed Trump.
                  "Another! There are forty at least," answered Clinton, "in the same box."
                  "Certainly. Excuse me," said Wailes; "I was thinking of something else.
                     Proceed."
                  "You have disturbed the flow of my ideas with your confounded Another," said
                     Clinton. "Well, I found all this out in America. The letters came to me at my
                     Uncle Clinton's death, and—you shall see them—after reading them over a hundred
                     times, until I had all the actors distinctly formed in my mind, I decided to
                     come over here and hunt for kindred."
                  "Count me in, my dear Clinton. You shall call mother Aunt Edith."
                  "Thanks. That will be Another."
                  "Never mind," replied Trump, confused, "but go on."
                  "Well, I went to Baden first. Several of the letters are dated Maison Rouge,
                     near Baden. I spent a month there. I went to Maison Rouge. It is an old
                     tumble-down ruin, no tokens of life about its mouldering walls. Of all the
                     places I ever saw it seemed the most dismal, except L'Abme Noir."
                  "The Black Abyss! Do you mean the Pit of Darkness?"
                  "Pretty nearly. It is a chasm near Baden; a rift in the rocks on a sterile
                     hill, surrounded by gloomy trees. The people who live there, ignorant and
                     superstitious, have a hundred legends, all horrible. I found one old man living
                     in a hut at the base of this hill, a maker of wooden clocks, who told me a
                     coherent story of an English lord who had been murdered there the quarter of a
                     century ago. I bought two clocks from him, and he told me the names of victim
                     and murderer. The victim was Harold Trumpley; the assassin was Captain Merton.
                     This corresponded with my old letters, as you will see. I went thence to
                     Chlons, and after a week of patient toil I found La Sœur Clementine, who had
                     seen the last of Aunt Dora. She had no doubt about her death; but by persistent
                     inquiry I found that her evidence was all circumstantial, and being hungry for
                     kindred, I rejected her story. Then I came to England, Beechwood first, of
                     course. By-the-bye, Beechwood is my property; it comes to me as the sole heir
                     of Mabel Lennox. I can prove my right without difficulty. But your beautiful
                     English jurisprudence has covered Beechwood with so enormous a debt, that it is
                     more profitable to deny ownership and pay the chancery rental.
                  "I found Aunt Dora first. Your mother helped me. Do you remember what she said
                     that night we watched here together? The next night I watched alone, and found
                     her in the conservatory. She has been somnambulic for years. I wakened her, and
                     revealed myself. She was greatly shocked, and has been more or less demented
                     ever since. Maguire promises her complete restoration, however. To-morrow I
                     shall introduce Mabel and your mother, and the Doctor is very sanguine.
                  "Then I found dear Mabel. I did not know she was so near until the day of Mr.
                     Grippe's dinner. I found an opportunity to say a" word or two just before you
                     started off so suddenly. By-the-bye, again it is curious, but she told me she
                     had injured you in some way, mixing you up with Rad Merton, and—hey!—what is
                     the matter now?"
                  Trump had risen again, throwing another pipe on the hearth, danced a most
                     absurd pas seul, kicked a chair over, set it
                     up again, and then resumed his seat. "Oh, what a blockhead! Mother was right.
                     Go on, please, I am all attention. One more mouthful of beer."
                  "It's my, opinion," said Clinton, "that you have had beer enough to-night. Help
                     yourself, however, and welcome."
                  "It isn't the beer, Clinton," said Wailes. "I have been carrying a great load
                     upon my mind, and am just getting relief. It is the reaction."
                  "My dear fellow, go to bed," said Clinton. "I am ashamed of myself for keeping
                     you up so late, listening to my dull stories."
                  "If you say bed to me again I'll throw this beer-bottle at you! Go on."
                  "Decidedly inebriated!" ejaculated Clinton. "Wailes, your head is not worth
                     shucks."
                  "What are shucks?"
                  "Shucks are the covering that nature provides for maize while it is; growing.
                     When it matures, the shucks are taken off and thrown away. I believe some Yankee has utilised them as
                     a substitute for hair in mattresses."
                  "Thank you; the explanation is lucid. Pray go on."
                  "There is not much more to tell; I will give you the letters. Will you read
                     them to-night, or wait?"
                  "To-night, by all means."
                  Clinton unlocked a cabinet and took out a bundle of letters, which he gave to
                     his friend.
                  "There are no secrets in them which you may not know. I have told your mother
                     of their contents, excepting so far as they related to her brother and Aunt
                     Dora. Somehow I have shrunk from all reference to her, waiting until I can
                     learn all the truth. I asked Aunt Dora once, but she repelled me so vehemently
                     that I have not dared to renew the investigation in that direction. I did not
                     tell Mrs. Wailes who Mabel was either, because—"
                  "Because?" said Trump.
                  "Because we were discoursing about Another," answered Clinton. "The truth is,
                     Wailes," he continued, with averted face, "I am spoony, and Sybil was the topic
                     last night. By-the-bye, she never tires of talking about Trumpley Wailes. Maybe
                     you are spoony too?"
                  "Mr. Clinton," said Trump, with stoical indifference, "calm your apprehensions.
                     I am in pursuit of something substantial: I am seeking money. I give my best
                     energies to my daily business. I like it: it is promising. If no unusual
                     calamity befal us, in the course of ten or fifteen years I shall be in a
                     position to indulge in these dreams. I admire Miss Sybil greatly, but as for
                     spoons—Pshaw! Do I look like a man that would grow spoony?"
                  "What a tremendous philosopher you are!" answered Clinton, with admiration. "I
                     had a sneaking hope that you would be attracted by a dear little lady that I
                     know. But I'll tell her that your soul is swallowed up in money. She will
                     hardly believe it—"
                  "Don't trouble yourself," said Trumpley; "my remark was almost too sweeping. I
                     knew you were frightfully jealous, and only wished to ease your mind. But I can
                     easily imagine that a precious angel—such as I have dreamed about—could blow my
                     money schemes to the dogs with one flap of her wings. Besides, my dear mother
                     should have a companion. I may conclude to marry for her sake."
                  "Very kind of you, Wailes," replied Clinton, stretching himself out upon the
                     sofa; "read the letters, you deceitful old humbug, and I'll take a nap."
                  Within the hour the nap was interrupted by the arrival of Doctor Maguire and
                     the return of Memnon. The note had been delivered at Halidon; Miss Grahame had
                     not retired, and she sent a dainty little note in reply, saying she would be at
                     Beechwood early in the morning, and that Mrs. Wailes would follow later. Dora
                     was sleeping peacefully, and Doctor Maguire retired. The house was quiet again,
                     Clinton making good progress in his second nap, and Wailes engrossed in the
                     letters, when the hall-clock struck four.
                  The letters were all from Daisy Grahame or her husband, and were all addressed
                     to Mrs. Mabel Stratton. The first related the story of Daisy's marriage, and
                     referred to Mr. Trumpley's courtship of Dora. The second told circumstantially
                     of Dora's marriage in Paris; this was the first letter dated at Maison Rouge.
                     There were half-a-dozen letters, all written within the month, referring to
                     their life at Baden, hinting vaguely at some cause of distress, and once
                     alluding to Mr. Trumpley's unfortunate "entanglements." A later letter, written
                     by Mr. Grahame after Trumpley's death, expressed the writer's conviction that
                     he had been the victim of a wicked conspiracy, in which Captain Merton and "the
                     woman Radcliffe" were chief conspirators. Trump read this letter carefully,
                     twice. The next letter told of the burial of Mr. Trumpley at Merton, and
                     deplored the serious illness of Miss Edith Trumpley. "If I could have seen
                     her," Mr. Grahame wrote, "I would have explained many things to her which I
                     cannot venture to write. If Daisy gets strong again, we will return to
                     Gloucester in the spring." He also regretted that "Mr. Grippe, a young banker
                     at Gloucester, who had been at Baden when they were there, was confined to his
                     room by a frightful attack of asthma. He had seen Harold the day before he
                     died, and might possibly have told me some things I desired to know."
                  Hist! What noise is that? Oh, the clock, striking five. No, some one is moving
                     in the hall below. The outer door has a peculiar creak; Wailes had noticed it
                     when he entered the house. Surely, the door opened.
                  He laid down the letter, and taking the candle, moved softly to the door. No
                     harm to go down and look. Ah! here are the Gttingen blades; he would take one.
                     As he opened the door, Clinton awoke. At the same instant, the snap of a key
                     slipping from the wards was heard. Clinton with moccasined feet came,
                     noiselessly to his side, wide-awake and composed as possible.
                  "Burglarious!" he whispered; "the rascals are working at the plate-chest. Hold
                     a moment."
                  He threw off his gown as he spoke, took a revolver from the wall and stuck it in his waistband. Then seizing the
                     other sword, he nodded to Wailes, and they passed out into the corridor.
                  "Be discreet, Wailes," he said; "don't kill if you can help it. We may have to
                     maim the rogues, but let us be merciful."
               
               
                  CHAPTER LVIII.
                  THE SECOND RESCUE.
                  Munseer Blowell's repeater had deceived him. It was not one and three-quarters,
                     but four o'clock that it announced. Time had flitted away on silken wings while
                     they walked from Merton; and while they rested on the mill-bench, and while
                     they were discussing the rights of man and very uncommon sense in the quiet
                     lane, they loitered and time sped on. The hall-clock struck five as the
                     locksmith threw back the bolts on the outer door.
                  Thick darkness in the hall. Munseer Blowell, dagger in hand, stepped lightly
                     past his companions and entered. The others, encouraged by his bold example,
                     followed. Moving cautiously along the wall, the locksmith found the great
                     chest. He announced the fact in a hoarse whisper. "Here it is! Now you two keep
                     quiet and listen."
                  A faint rattle of the skeleton-keys; he had to select the proper one by
                     feeling. Presently they heard it grating in the lock. Almost too much noise,
                     Mr. Locksmith!
                  "Cuss the tumble!" said he, after a futile effort or two; "it falls in a new
                     place every time."
                  "My goot friend," said Munseer Blowell, "I have matches in my pocket. Will a
                     light aid you?"
                  "Don't want no lights, Johnny," said Podd; "can't you bust the lid open?"
                  But light came very unexpectedly. The door at the end of the hall opened
                     suddenly, and a flare of light poured in. The back corridor illuminated by two
                     candles placed on a bracket against the wall just opposite the door. Two men in
                     their shirt-sleeves, each with a shining blade in his right hand, standing in
                     the doorway. The locksmith dropped his keys as he rose, and with prompt courage
                     dashed through the door by which he had entered, pulling it after him, to
                     baffle possible pursuers, and, fled gallantly to the main gate on the highroad.
                     It was locked, but fear lent him vigor, and he cleared the hedge at a bound.
                     Taking the road to Gloucester, he ran with increasing speed, until a passing
                     vehicle met him. Then, tearing through the hedge again, he continued his flight
                     by lanes and byways until he reached Gloucester common. He lay down here under
                     the trees, watching the fading stars until he regained his breath, and then
                     walked soberly into the city.
                  "Monsieur Blauvelt!" said Wailes, as Johnny disappeared; "and in a new rle!"
                  "Zee odd Tromp!" answered Munseer Blowell; "sauve quit
                        peut!" He darted to the front door, which Podd had opened, after
                     fumbling with the lock two or three precious minutes. Out in the air at last,
                     he rushed past Podd, reached the gate below the stables, and raced down the
                     lane, Podd following, and gradually gaining on him. He caught his arm at last,
                     a short distance from the gate.
                  "Hold on, pardner!" said the gardener;" this is not English fashion, to run
                     like hares at the first blow. If Johnny had stood by us—"
                  "A thousand thunders!" replied Munseer; "quit my arm, or I'll use my dagger on
                     you! Ha! they come! They bring chains, I hear them rattle!"
                  "Chains be blowed!" answered Mr. Podd, angrily. "Put up your frog-sticker. Cuss
                     your French liver!"
                  "Ah, you will have it then," said Blauvelt, turning suddenly upon Podd, who
                     retreated a step before the gleaming dagger. And as they glared at each other,
                     a new actor appeared, just visible in the twilight.
                  Tiger, his chain dragging after him. His vision was better than that of bipeds,
                     and he quickly recognised the king, and the antagonism between the monarch and
                     the courtier. Rearing his huge body on his hind legs, he threw himself upon
                     Blauvelt, and fastened his yellow fangs in the Frenchman's throat. There was a
                     momentary struggle, and man and dog rolled together upon the ground.
                  This is a sorry termination of an illustrious career, Mr. Blauvelt! But there
                     is no help for it.
                  Podd seized the chain and tugged manfully at it. In vain. Tiger had been
                     fasting, and he tore away at Blauvelt's throat, regardless of cuffs and kicks.
                     Then Podd knelt on the ground beside him, and seizing Blauvelt's dagger which
                     lay on the grass, he drove it into the dog's neck.
                  It was the common mistake of those who practise kingcraft. The subject, loyal and obedient, who had been
                     content to serve with unmurmuring fidelity, who had taken cruel treatment so
                     long and patiently, licking the hand that smote him, forgot everything but this
                     last injury, and quitting the still carcase of the courtier, caught King Podd
                     by the shoulder, and with savage fury tore at his tough muscles.
                  Clinton and Wailes had followed the fugitives, and reached the scene at this
                     critical moment. The dawn had come.
                  Tiger was embarrassed by his riches. So far backward as his canine memory
                     extended, he had been chained to a box, and had only been able to growl and
                     snap at passers-by. But here, suddenly, with new freedom thrust upon him, he
                     had very nearly committed two murders, and now two more were possible.
                     Releasing Podd's shoulder, he dropped his head and rushed at Clinton, his jaws
                     dripping blood.
                  It was the common mistake of democracy, learned in nothing but the
                     invincibility of brute-force. Tiger's loyalty to Podd was a caricature of the
                     allegiance due to the lord of creation from the subordinate orders. Tiger's
                     assault upon Clinton was a flagrant denial of this lordship, albeit enforced by
                     intellect and virtue.
                  Clinton stuck the sword in the ground, drew the pistol from his waistband, and
                     put a bullet in Tiger's brain when he was within three feet of him. The dog
                     rolled over on the roadside, jerked out his legs convulsively once, and then
                     remained motionless.
                  "It is the miller's dog," said Wailes.
                  "Then he has met his proper doom," answered Clinton. "What an enormous brute he
                     is! He has throttled both our burglars, I believe. Is not this Podd?"
                  "Yes."
                  "Hillo, Podd!" said Clinton; "look up, man! Where are you hurt?"
                  Podd answered with a groan. He was meditating a plan of escape, and meantime
                     silence was golden.
                  "He has been wounded somewhere," said Wailes; "look at this bloody dagger."
                  "This is Blauvelt beyond doubts," said Clinton, "and I think he is sped. The
                     dog has lacerated his throat terribly. Wailes, we must get them to the house
                     somehow. I will go for Memnon. Will you wait here?"
                  "Yes; but hark! I hear wheels."
                  "Ah!" said Clinton, "they are coming down the lower lane. Run down to the
                     forks, and I will cross here; one of us will intercept them. What's that?"
                  A shrill cry came floating over the hedges.
                  "Wailes! Clinton! Help!"
                  The two men heard. Clinton knew it was at woman's voice, and that she called on
                     him for aid. He leaped the hedge, rushed across the triangular meadow, and
                     reached the lower lane as the vehicle rattled past.
                  Wailes knew it was Mabel's voice; he had heard it once before, when she,
                     recovering from her swoon, thought she was in deadly peril. She was in peril
                     again, and called him—him! Down to the fork of the lanes like a shot. The
                     distance was not measured, nor the time recorded; but when he stood there
                     breathless, watching the approaching vehicle, it seemed to him that he had
                     reached the goal at one leap.
                  Rad Merton's trap. Tim driving furiously. Rad kneeling on the back-seat,
                     holding Mabel in his arms, and forcing a cloak over her head. He planted
                     himself in the middle of the lane, sword in hand. He would stab the lead-horse,
                     leap aside and throttle Merton. Foolish boy! the onset of that furious team
                     would brush you out of the road like a heap of chaff. But he stood there
                     without doubt or trepidation.
                  A shot. Maggie leaped from the ground and fell. The horse in the shafts
                     stumbled over her body, and Tim rolled down from his perch. A pale face,
                     relentless as death, came up the side of the wrecked dog-cart, and a pair of
                     iron hands caught Merton's collar and hurled him in the dust beside his stunned
                     servant; and the same hands, transformed into velvet, lifted Mabel from the
                     seat and bore her swiftly away. She freed her face from the mantle and peered
                     anxiously at her rescuer. "Is it you!" she murmured; "is it indeed you? Ah, I
                     am safe now!"
                  Trumpley made no reply. He threw away his weapon and crushed her delicate body
                     in his arms.
                  "Let me down, please," she said; "I can walk. I am not hurt. Did you kill
                     him?"
                  "Oh no; but I'll go back and kill him if he has harmed you."
                  "No, no! do not leave me. Where am I?"
                  "At Beechwood. Don't look over there; a fellow got hurt this morning—dog bit
                     him."
                  "Did you hear me call you?" she said, blushing.
                  "Yes; I should have heard you if I had been dead."
                  
                  This was an original proposition, and required meditation. Mabel was
                     silent.
                  "How did it happen?" said Trump.
                  "He met me in the road. De Witt sent for me last night, and I started at dawn.
                     James opened the gate for me, and went back for his coat. Instead of waiting
                     for him, I walked up the road. But it would have made no difference; that
                     wretched man had his groom with him, and they would have murdered James
                     probably, if he had been with me. Still, I cannot account for his absence."
                  James had snatched up his coat, and while struggling into it in the dim light,
                     missed his footing and rolled into the kitchen-area, striking his thick skull
                     on the stone steps, and falling senseless at the bottom.
                  "What did he say to you?" said Trump. "Never mind the dog, he is dead."
                  "I cannot tell you. Ugh! he said he loved me—the brute!"
                  "Did he? When did you see him first?"
                  "On that day when I ran away. Ah! you have never cared to ask me why. And now
                     you have saved me the second time—"
                  "We will talk of it hereafter. I know you had a good reason for your flight.
                     You shall tell me this evening. Here is Clinton."
                  Clinton came flying over the hedge and joined them. He caught Mabel's hand and
                     kissed it, laughing hilariously.
                  "We are even, Wailes," he said. "That was a neat shot. Do you know that Mabel
                     kept popping her pretty head in the way? I had to wait until they were almost
                     upon you before I fired. You reckless vagabond! they would have trampled you to
                     death in another minute. Let us get my pretty cousin to the house, and then we
                     will go back and look at the wreck. Where's Podd?"
                  That estimable citizen was reposing on the other side of the hedge. He had
                     crawled away from the scene of conflict as soon as their backs were turned; and
                     when their voices died away, he took to his heels again, and reached the mill
                     as the sun appeared above the eastern horizon.
                  Mabel told her story more succinctly as they proceeded. Clinton led them to the
                     conservatory wall, and opening the secret door, led the way to the
                     drawing-room. Dora was there, and Dr. Maguire was feeling her pulses. Clinton
                     paused upon the threshold, but Maguire beekoned him in.
                  "All right, me boy," he said. "Pulses as calm, as an infant's; no oppression
                     about the head. All we want is quiet, and the gurrill you were to get. Have you
                     brought her? The drownded Duchess, be jabers!"
                  "Aunt Dora," said Clinton, "I could not bring you Daisy; but I have brought
                     Daisy's daughter Mabel. Take her to your arms."
                  Which she did.
               
               
                  CHAPTER LIX.
                  SWORD-PLAY.
                  Taking Memnon and the doctor, Clinton and Wailes went back to the spot where
                     Blauvelt was lying. Memnon took a stable-door from the hinges, and they placed
                     the unfortunate philosopher upon it. He was not dead.
                  "I am thinking he is beyond the reach of drugs," said Maguire, examining his
                     throat; "but we will see what can be done. Lift him gintly, and we will get him
                     to the house and put in a stitch or two. You are only in the way, Mr. Clinton;
                     we three can carry him."
                  Clinton relinquished his hold, and seeing them through the gate, returned for
                     the sword he had left sticking in the ground. Where was the other? Why, Wailes
                     had it. He saw it in his hand when he put the bullet into Maggie's ear. He must
                     have thrown it down in the lane. Only a step; he would go look for it.
                  Before he reached the fork he found it. It was in the hand of Radcliffe Merton.
                     Clinton suppressed a sigh of regret, and accepted the inevitable.
                  His neat attire torn and dusty, his brow scratched and bleeding, he was not
                     attractive in appearance. Over the malignant face that confronted Clinton, the
                     fine gauze of conventional propriety was drawn.
                  "Are you seeking me?" said Merton, bowing politely.
                  "No; I am seeking the weapon you carry," answered Clinton, with cold
                     composure.
                  "Ah! Well, you shall have it presently. Am I right in supposing you shot my
                     mare?"
                  "Yes. I had some thought of shooting you instead."
                  "Indeed! May I ask your reason?"
                  "You were abducting a lady with brutal violence—"
                  "Is that all? Cannot one pick up a stray milliner or governess in the road
                     without incurring your displeasure?"
                  "We will not discuss the matter," said Clinton, gravely. "Oblige me with the
                     sword, if you please, and get away."
                  
                  "I am afraid you will have to take it," replied Merton. "It is such a fine,
                     bright morning, that a little exercise will do you good."
                  "Excuse me," said Clinton; "I cannot consent to gratify you."
                  "The last time, I had the pleasure of making a hole in your Yankee body. I was
                     younger then, and only half did the work."
                  "Let that suffice," replied Clinton. "I have kept these swords ever since you
                     wounded me at Gttingen, intending to renew the contest some day; but the
                     obstacles are insurmountable. Give me the sword and begone."
                  "Pardon me. Can I not say something or do something that will induce you to
                     change your mind? Are you interested in this Grahame wench?"
                  "Shame on you, Merton! I will not talk with so utter a blackguard. Keep the
                     sword if you will, and go to the devil!"
                  "All in good time. Please enumerate the obstacles you spoke of before you go.
                     Will you excuse me if I remove my if I remove my coat; I see you are without
                     yours?"
                  "Mr. Merton," said Clinton, "look you, I am not the clumsy boy you wounded in
                     Germany; I am an expert swordsman. I do not know the man among my instructors
                     who can master me. The chief obstacle is the dead certainty that I should kill
                     you."
                  "How considerate!" replied Radcliffe, "and, if you will excuse me, I will add,
                     how conceited! Two minutes will suffice to convince you of your error."
                  "I promised a gentle lady that I would spare you," said Clinton, reluctantly.
                     "I must keep my word."
                  "How gallant!" answered Merton, stepping back and taking off his coat. "If you
                     turn, I will stab you in the back. You miserable adventurer! you insolent
                     Yankee sneak! defend yourself, or die without resistance!"
                  With two strides he reached the middle of the lane, and crossed swords with
                     Clinton, who coolly awaited his approach.
                  The bright blades glanced in the sunlight as they went through the ordinary
                     parades of thrust and parry. In Radcliffe's baleful eyes there were desperate
                     determination and malice. Over Clinton's manly countenance there gathered a
                     stern traquillity that was portentous. He soon discovered that Merton demanded
                     all his attention, and that the most exact precision was needed to deflect his
                     sword from his body. His skill was a vast improvement upon that of the German
                     student.
                  Then there was a rapid interchange of thrusts, and the hilts of the weapons
                     clashed together so violently that Merton was driven backward two paces.
                  "Let it end here, I pray you," said Clinton. "You have doubtless discovered
                     that you are no match for me; I could have killed you twice."
                  "Yankee brag, Mr. Stratton! Let us resume."
                  At the second encounter Clinton faced the sun. Radcliffe had gradually drawn
                     him into this position across the narrow lane. The American discovered the
                     trick on the instant, and drew the point of his sword across the other's face.
                     It was a mere scratch; but Merton drew back a step, and Clinton turned his back
                     to the sun as he gained the middle of the lane again. With patient skill
                     Radcliffe worked around his antagonist, and once more got the sun in his eyes.
                     Pressing upon him with rapid thrusts, the hilts clashed together again, and
                     again Merton was driven backward.
                  They stood apart a minute. With all Merton's rascality, he was a man of
                     dauntless courage, yet there crept into his mind a gloomy conviction of his
                     inferiority. He glanced at Clinton's face, cold, stern and confident, and once
                     more approached with extended weapon.
                  "Take notice," said Clinton as the swords crossed, "I will not have the sun in
                     my eyes. So long as you keep in the road, well; but if you persist in driving
                     me to the hedge, I shall do you some terrible injury."
                  Radcliffe made no answer; he had made up his mind. He would take a thrust if he
                     must, but he would kill Clinton on this round.
                  "I will give you another warning," said Clinton. "Your waistcoat is buttoned
                     with three buttons; I will take off the middle one."
                  There was another sharp struggle, the blades flashing like electric streams
                     between them, and Clinton sprang backwards, lowering his point.
                  "The button is gone," he said, composedly. "Will it satisfy you?"
                  It was a white Marseilles waistcoat, double-breasted. The buttons were little
                     golden balls, secured in the eyelet-holes by rings. Radcliffe was partial to
                     finery of this sort, especially in evening dress. He took off the garment and
                     laid it on his coat by the roadside, and striding forward, confronted Clinton
                     once more.
                  "You are expert," he said, as their blades clashed; "but that is not very
                     remarkable. Yankees have a natural aptitude for picking up gold. Perhaps you
                     got your money in that fashion."
                  The grassy lane was trampled in a large circle, which they had traversed many
                     times as they changed their positions in the fierce encounter. The chirp of a
                     bird in the hedge was the only sound heard in the still morning, except the
                     sharp click of steel and the tramp
                     of their feet as they moved around on their battle-ground. Pressing upon
                     Merton, Clinton gradually backed him up to the hedge, and with a sudden sweep
                     of his blade tore Radcliffe's weapon from his hand. Advancing a step, he placed
                     his point on his adversary's throat for an instant, and again stepped backward,
                     lowering his sword. Merton stood motionless before him until he retired, then,
                     leaping into the circle, regained his sword, and faced him again, painting and
                     indomitable. Clinton held up his left hand with imperious dignity, and
                     Radcliffe paused.
                  "How often shall I give you your life?" said Clinton, sternly; "let this end
                     here. By all rule you are bound to acknowledge yourself vanquished. If you are
                     a gentleman, you will accept your defeat and begone."
                  "My life is worthless to me so long as you live," answered Radcliffe. "You have
                     some tricks of fence that are novel, but I am learning. Let us resume."
                  "Hear another word," said Clinton: "you are a bad lot, Merton, but you face
                     death so manfully that I cannot find it in my heart to harm you. Get away now
                     with a whole skin, and let me keep my promise."
                  "Was it silly Sybil who pleaded for me?" answered Radcliffe with a sneer.
                     "Pooh! you must have done some extensive bragging as well as some extensive
                     lying to extort the plea from her. I know you have been sneaking about Merton
                     Park traducing me, and I am going to pay you off this morning. Come on!"
                  "It is inevitable!" said Clinton, furiously. "Look your last upon the sunlight!
                     You are a blot upon the fair face of nature, and I am about to take you
                     off!"
                  In this last encounter both men fought with the most elaborate precision.
                     Merton exposed himself recklessly, yet pressed so vigorously upon his adversary
                     that he was kept upon the defensive. Twice Clinton's exact parry merely
                     deflected Merton's blade enough to escape the thrust, which passed through his
                     shirt-sleeve. Instead of the usual interval between them, they gradually worked
                     closer each to the other, and each intent upon what he meant should be the
                     final coup. Clinton's purpose was to inflict
                     upon Radcliffe a precisely similar hurt to that he had received at Gttigen. The
                     slender blades quivered in their strong hands, and seemed to twist themselves
                     together in the rapid interchanges. The muscles of their right arms swelled out
                     in knots as with grim ferocity they stamped upon the dewy grass and circled
                     around in the lane. Each watched for the crisis, and at last it came.
                  "Un, deux, coupe; habet!" said Clinton;
                     "straight carte over the arm!"
                  The fencer will understand the manœuver, which, if rapidly executed, is
                     effectual. Instead of the parry, however, Radcliffe recoiled a half step,
                     turning his wrist in the parade of seconde,
                     and throwing Clinton's sword upward with his forearm, the sharp point caught
                     Merton above the eye, while his blade passed through Clinton's arm, under the
                     muscles of his shoulder, grazing his ribs, and so out at the spine, pinning his
                     arm to his body. They fell apart without a word, and the faintness that crept
                     over the stalwart American brought to his memory the German duel. Merton,
                     relinquishing his sword, stumbled across the lane and fell.
                  "Wailes, me boy," said a voice, "he is here; and—be jabers! so is Rad
                     Merton!—and we want two barn-doors."
                  "I don't need any, Doctor," said Clinton. "If you will please pull this
                     infernal hot skewer out of my arm I can get along. Jewhillikin! how you hurt!
                     Look to Mr. Merton, Doctor; I am afraid he is hurt more seriously."
                  "And who the devil hurt him?" said Maguire. "Tare an' ages! what possessed you
                     to play with such dangerous implements? It is a wonder you arn't both
                     kilt."
                  "Doctor," said Radcliffe, "am I blind?"
                  "It looks very like it. We'll take you to the house and examine—"
                  "Never! My groom is in the lane below, not the quarter of a mile off. If you
                     will lead me to him I can get to Gloucester. Will you lend me your arm? My coat
                     is here somewhere. Ah! thanks. Now I can walk if you lead me. Can't you blind
                     my handkerchief over my eyes?"
                  Trumpley took the handkerchief, folded it, and tied it over his brow. With the
                     blood streaming from his arm and back Clinton drew near.
                  "Merton," he said, his voice tremulous with tender pity, "I would freely give
                     one of my eyes to restore yours if I could. The memory of this morning's work
                     will embitter my future life. I entreat you to come to Beechwood and have your
                     wounded—"
                  "Many thanks," said Radcliffe; "no! I should die there when I might recover
                     anywhere else. Hearken! Do not waste sympathy upon me; the chief regret I shall
                     feel, if my hurt is serious, will be that I cannot see to kill you.
                     Good-morning!"
                  Tim had repaired damages to a certain, extent. The dead mare was lying stiff in the lane, but the other horse
                     was unhurt, and the harness patched up; and with the fumes of the Burgundy
                     still confusing his brain, Tim drove slowly back to Gloucester, his wounded
                     master sitting erect and silent beside him, enduring agony, yet making no
                     sign.
               
               
                  CHAPTER LX.
                  HIGH DUTCH.
                  The breakfast at Beechwood was delayed. Blauvelt's wounds were dressed by
                     Doctor Maguire, and he was sent to Gloucester Hospital. The pony-phaeton was
                     despatched to Halidon for Mrs. Wailes, and upon her arrival she and Mabel were
                     left with Dora, while Maguire gave attention to Clinton's hurts. The doctor put
                     in sundry stitches with grim satisfaction; while the patient groaned, and
                     heroically refrained from objurgatory remarks. It was done at last, the arm
                     bounded up in pasteboards, and Clinton remanded to bed under pain of fever,
                     gangrene, tetanus, and dissolution. Mrs. Wailes made tea, and her son and the
                     doctor wrought havoc among the biscuits and chops that immortalised Phillis.
                     Mr. Grippe stopped at the gate, and took Trumpley to town with him. Doctor
                     Maguire invaded Dora's chamber, founded her pulses accelerated, administered an
                     opiate, sternly ordered perfect quiet in a darkened room, and departed for
                     Merton, promising to return in the evening. He was also required to carry the
                     intelligence of Radcliffe's "accident" to Merton Park, and to surppress or
                     embellish the narrative according to his own excellent judgment. As soon as the
                     gig was out of sight, Clinton summoned Memnon, and with his assistance dressed,
                     buttoning his coat (with an empty sleeve) across his breast, and was driven to
                     Gloucester.
                  Mrs. Wailes and Mabel had possession of Beechwood at luncheon time. Mr.
                     Clinton's instructions to Phillis were simply to take her orders from the
                     ladies. He returned in the afternoon, went soberly to bed, and waited for the
                     doctor's return and his permission to rise.
                  The dinner was rather more lively. Mr. Clinton was allowed to come down, and
                     lie upon the sofa while his guests dined. Dora was better: tranquil, and
                     disposed to sleep. Milly Galt, overflowing with happiness, had been formally
                     inducted into the office of lady's-maid to Dora, having been sent by the doctor
                     early in the day. Clinton was making sundry wry faces over a bowl of panada,
                     which was the only nutriment the inexorable medico permitted.
                  "This duck is positively enchanting," quoth the doctor, who occupied the head
                     of the table. "Mrs. Wailes, let me send you a wing."
                  "Give it to Mr. Clinton, Doctor," said Mrs. Wailes; "he will starve on that
                     Panada."
                  "Not a morsel! Starve? He would live on pure water ten days. Panada is strong
                     diet for him."
                  "How long shall I live, Doctor, if I take a little bread and meat?" asked
                     Clinton.
                  "Not over a week."
                  "And how long do you intend to feed me on panada?"
                  "If we heal up with the first intention," said the doctor, "you may have tay
                     and toast a week hence."
                  "Very well. I'll make my will to-morrow, and then commit suicide on beef and
                     mutton."
                  "If you keep quiet in bed all day to-morrow," said the doctor, "it is barely
                     possible that I'll give you tay and toast at night."
                  "Tea and Toast be—that is, I'd as lieve stick to panade. Wailes," he continued,
                     in Greek, "I went to Gloucester this morning to see about Merton. He will not
                     be blind."
                  "Where did you find him?" answered Wailes, in the same tongue.
                  "He has my old rooms in Queen Street. They have sent to London for Sir Thomas
                     Morgan, the great oculist. But his eyes are not seriously injured—Heaven be
                     praised!"
                  "What are you young gentlemen saying?" said Mrs. Wailes.
                  "Clinton is only airing his Greek a little, Mother. You will excuse him,
                     ladies, as he is feverish and his mind is wandering."
                  "Certainly," interposed Maguire; "let him go on. It will do him good."
                  "Wailes," continued Clinton, "I tried to kill him. He was so
                     fierce and bloodthirsty, that I lost my temper for one short minute, and it was
                     done. But my point glanced on the bone, and only tore the flesh over his right
                     eye, passed through the left eyelid, but did not wound the organ. I was with
                     him when the doctor made the examination."
                  "With him?" said Wailes.
                  "Yes. He was savage at first, when Tim told him I was there. I went in without
                     invitation or announcement. I told him about Gretchen and her death; he had to
                     hear me. And I discovered at last the cause of his insane desire to kill me.
                     What think you was the provocation?"
                  
                  "The old quarrel in Germany?"
                  "No. He thought I was courting that lovely maiden by your side; and he was
                     wonderfully mollified when I told him she was destined for Another."
                  "Gentlemen," said Mabel, in melodious Greek, "it is proper that I should tell
                     you I understand you."
                  "The devil!" said Clinton, in good English.
                  "I think you had better keep to your gibberish," said Mrs. Wailes, highly
                     offended.
                  "I beg a thousand pardons," said Clinton, humbly; "but you did not hear what
                     Mabel said?"
                  "The violet eyes were sparkling with merriment.
                  "Well, Ma'am," continued Clinton—"Oh! how my arm hurts!—She merely announced
                     that she understood Greek, after Wailes and I had told no end of secrets."
                  "Greek is a very unsafe tongue, Mr. Clinton," said Maguire. "I allowed you to
                     go on because I was interested; but how the blazes do you think I could have
                     got on in my profession without a smatterin' of the ancient tongues. And now I
                     can tell you that Radcliffe may have inflammation; that will play the mischief
                     with your diagnosis."
                  "And I suppose I may as well add," said Mrs. Wailes, "that Trump recited his
                     early Greek lessons to me, and that I also am tolerably familiar with that
                     tongue."
                  "Of all the awful sells I ever heard of," said Clinton, "this is the worst!
                     This arm will drive me mad! I think I will go back to my dismal couch."
                  "Suppose you thry a bit of Haybrew," said the doctor, with a strong brogue.
                  Clinton groaned.
                  "Please continue your account," said Mabel. "You can resume the vernacular;
                     only your Greek is far better than your English."
                  Clinton raised himself on his unhurt arm and glared at her speechless.
                  "I have made a little vocabulary," continued Mabel, "which we will go over
                     presently. Tell us more about that unhappy man."
                  "But the very thing I wished to tell Wailes you must not hear," answered
                     Clinton.
                  "It will keep, probably," said Mabel, with a blush. "Mrs. Wailes desires to
                     hear a more coherent account; of your doings this morning."
                  "I am too faint to talk," replied Clinton; "loss of blood and starvation begin
                     to tell upon me."
                  The doctor took up the wing of the duck, shook off all the fragments of
                     dressing, put it on a plate with a small slice of bread, and sent it to
                     Clinton.
                  "Afther goin' to Gloucester," said the doctor, "in disobedience to my orders,
                     you don't deserve a taste. But I'm forgiving in my disposition. Masticate
                     thoroughly!"
                  "Memnon," said Clinton, with his mouth full, "throw this panada out of the
                     window! Doctor, may I have another wing?"
                  "Not a feather!"
                  "I've a great mind to eat the bone, then."
                  "Clinton, tell us about your encounter," said Trump, "and I will smuggle some
                     food to you to-night."
                  "I walked down the lane," responded Clinton, promptly, "got the sword I had
                     left there, and then went for yours. You threw it away, and no wonder! I think
                     you had enough to carry without it—I mean a feminine walking dictionary."
                  "You should say 'keyarry,'" answered Mabel spitefully, "as you, say 'keyar' for
                     car, and 'keyarpet' for carpet."
                  "Very well," said Clinton; "then I met Mr. Merton, who had obligingly brought
                     Wailes' sword with him. He asked me if I shot his mare, and candor compelled me
                     to acknowledge the fact. He then made other remarks the reverse of
                     complimentary, and finally invited me to renew a contest which we began in
                     Germany some years ago."
                  "Well?" said Mrs. Wailes.
                  "I declined, Ma'am, most positively. He refused to give up his weapon, and I
                     told him to keep it. He then said he would stab me in the back if I refused to
                     face him, and he meant all he said. There was nothing left for me to do but
                     defend myself."
                  "What next?" said Mrs. Wailes. They had all risen from the table and were
                     standing in a circle around Clinton's sofa.
                  "I can hardly tell. I know my purpose was unwavering to content myself with
                     defensive warfare. Several times he exposed himself, but I did not harm him,
                     except to scratch his face, and that only by way of warning. I cannot tell how
                     long we were at it. I had my hands full, Wailes! The fellow fences like an
                     expert. At last he said something that exasperated me furiously, and he glared
                     so malignantly at me out of his cat-eyes that in the last fierce skrimmage I
                     tried to kill him. I knew I was going to catch it, before he hit me. He
                     assaulted me so resolutely, so vigorously, and yet so recklessly, exposing
                     himself without hesitation, that I saw clearly I must disable him or die. If I had not thrown up
                     my arm when I felt his point, it would have gone through my body. Once I
                     disarmed him and put my sword to his throat—like those Dutchmen used to do,
                     Wailes, you remember. He stood like a statue, with his arms folded, gloomy and
                     defiant; and when I stepped back, he clutched his sword again and came at me.
                     He is a born devil!"
                  "Poor Radcliffe!" said Mrs. Wailes. "What will be the end of this? What will
                     people say—"
                  "People will know nothing about it, Ma'am," said Doctor Maguire.
                  "I tould a cock-and-bull story at the Park; nobody knows how his eyes were
                     hurt, nobody knows how Mr. Clinton was hurt. The burglars will get the credit
                     of most of the damage. Let us all kape quiet, and decline any conversation on
                     the subject, in view of pending legal proceedings. Radcliffe will not be apt to
                     spake of it; his groom is a close mouthed rashkill, and will tell nothing about
                     the drunken frolics of his master. He was blind drunk av coorse, or he would
                     niver have tried to carry off the Duchess—"
                  "Why do you call me Duchess, Doctor?" said Mabel.
                  "Mars Clint," said Memnon, putting in his head, "'skuse me, Sar, but Mr. Grippe
                     done wait half-an-hour in de parlor. He come in while you was all talkin'
                     Dutch."
                  "Bedad," said the doctor, "there's your answer, Miss Mabel."
               
            
            
               BOOK VI.
               THE HALIDON RUBBER.
               
                  CHAPTER LXI.
                  EXIT RADCLIFFE.
                  The gentle reader will not have failed to notice that the events recorded in
                     the preceding Book were all compressed within the limits of two days. The
                     arrival of Mr. Grippe at Beechwood disarranged some deep-laid schemes, and
                     prevented the enlargement of that portion of the history beyond reasonable
                     bounds. Mr. Trumpley Wailes had in his mind's eye a prolonged dialogue with the
                     lady of the violet orbs. And the orbs, in innocent unconsciousness, were
                     shooting arrows, tipped with gold and jewels, into the heart of the mercenary
                     wretch, whose affections were set on Mammon. She had a way of listening
                     intently whenever he spoke to her, as if she desired to catch not only each
                     word, but each intonation, and then analyse them secretly. Both she and Trump
                     had several little speeches prepared, touching rescues and flights, and it is
                     highly probable that some serious entanglement would have followed if Mr.
                     Grippe had not opportunely arrived to prevent the catastrophe. The little
                     conversation they had at dinner, where there were listeners on all sides, was
                     totally inconclusive and unsatisfactory.
                  Mr. Grippe promptly announced the object of his visit. He had come for the
                     ladies. Instructed by Clinton, Wailes had informed him of the existence of Mrs.
                     Harold Trumpley, and the banker had been in a state of great agitation all day.
                     But he was quite tranquil now, and rather startled Mr. Clinton by demanding the
                     surrender of Mrs. Trumpley. Her presence at Halidon was absolutely necessary,
                     as he had a trust to discharge in
                     which she was personally interested. Mrs. Trumpley was quietly sleeping, having
                     been drugged by Maguire, and the doctor positively forbade any disturbance of
                     her slumbers; and if the business were at all exciting, he would strongly
                     protest against it for several days to come. After much debate, it was agreed
                     that Mrs. Trumpley should come to Halidon in three or four days, and in the
                     meantime Mrs. Wailes and Miss Grahame should visit her daily, provided they
                     returned to Halidon in time for dinner.
                  The arrangement was made without consulting Mabel or Trumpley. The latter was
                     especially disgusted, as his dear mother could not reach Beechwood until he had
                     left for that horrid bank, and she would have to return to array herself for
                     dinner before he got back. He had engaged to spend a week with Clinton; and now
                     that the poor fellow was wounded, he could not think of manufacturing an excuse
                     to shorten his visit.
                  Mabel was disgusted, because she longed to spend as much time as possible with
                     her new-found aunt. She did not care for dinners; but there was poor Helose,
                     and she did not think it fair to forsake her entirely. Why did not Mr. Grippe
                     or somebody else suggest bringing Helose to enliven poor De Witt while he was
                     swathed in bandages? She would be very willing to come with her, and she could
                     amuse Aunt Dora, while Helose amused De Witt.
                  One thing was settled: she and Mrs. Wailes had to go home at once. Mr. Grippe
                     was obstinate; he had left Helose all alone, and they would please get
                     ready.
                  Mr. Wailes wrapped his mother's shawl carefully around her shoulders, while
                     Miss Grahame was donning hat and mantle up stairs.
                  "Trump," whispered Mrs. Wailes, "there is Another that I have found—"
                  "I don't believe there is Another—"
                  "But there is. I asked Mabel if Mr. Clinton had manifested anything beyond
                     cousinly affection, and she says he also has Another."
                  "If that is the case, Mother," answered Trump, "these two Anothers will be like
                     two negatives in English, and prove mutually destructive. What else did she
                     say, Mother?"
                  "Very little," said Mrs. Wailes, dryly. "If you intend to go droning through
                     life like an overgrown calf, it is very likely that Another, number three, will
                     appear upon the stage. I happen to know that Algernon Walton adores Mabel."
                  "The little rascal!"
                  "He will be Sir Algernon Walton, though. He seems to be a bright youth; I think
                     I will recommend him to Mabel. He calls her Cousin Mabel too."
                  "I like his impudence," said Trump.
                  "So do I. He had not been in the house with Mabel half-an-hour before he had
                     made love to her decidedly—I mean at Halidon at the dinner-party."
                  "If I were sure of your approval, Mother, I might court Miss Grahame; not too
                     rapidly, though. You see, Mother, she thinks she is under no end of obligations
                     to me. She referred to Merton's Brook this morning, and she adds this last
                     adventure to that. Now, I am not going to make love to her while she thinks
                     that sort of nonsense. She would conclude she ought to sacrifice herself to a
                     fellow that pulled her out of the water, and helped her out of Rad Merton's
                     trap. Please let me court in my own fashion."
                  "Very well, Trump," answered Mrs. Wailes; "I shall not interfere. I have had
                     plenty of opportunities to court for you, but have not even hinted that I
                     should like to call Mabel my daughter. You know she is Daisy's daughter?"
                  "Yes, ma'am."
                  "Well, if you don't begin your courtship pretty soon I mean to adopt her; then
                     she will be your sister. I shall invite my young friend Algernon to visit me;
                     he is a well-grown youth, and Mabel remembers him as a play-fellow, no
                     doubt.—All ready, Mr. Grippe. Good-bye, Mr. Clinton. Don't come out. Come,
                     Mabel."
                  Mr. Wailes assisted the ladies. Mr. Grippe got in after they were seated. Trump
                     shook hands with his mother first, and then with Miss Grahame. It was such a
                     little mite of a hand! Trump wished he could cut it off and hang it round his
                     neck with the other fetich. By-the-bye, he had kissed it, that is, the other
                     fetich, once or twice, while Clinton was sleeping and he was reading. And now
                     he kissed his hand to the retreating carriage in the darkness. It was the
                     baldest hypocrisy; he was only kissing the fingers that had held the little
                     lump of warm velvet a minute ago.
                  "My friend," said Clinton, when he rentered, "I appreciate your kindness; well
                     do I know that Halidon eclipses Beechwood—"
                  "There you go again with your humbug! Doctor, may Clinton smoke?"
                  "Of course he may," answered Clinton. "Come with us, Doctor, and try my
                     Lynchburg tobacco. How long do you mean to keep my arm sewed up?"
                  
                  "Two months, if you're restive," replied the Doctor, promptly; "If you obey my
                     directions, I may relase you in a week. I must be aff. Let us see your tobacco;
                     if it is quite mild, you may have a whiff."
                  Instead of getting off, the Doctor took a pipe with the younger gentlemen. The
                     tobacco was pronounced entirely safe, and when Maguire rose to depart, Clinton
                     gave him a neat little bag of tobacco, with pipe and stem.
                  "I think you may ate a beefsteak for breakfast," said the Doctor, examining the
                     patient's pulses. "Seriously, the main thing is to remain quiet while the wound
                     is healing; a little inflammation would play the divil with your arm. Will you
                     promise to go to bed by ten o'clock, and to lie abed all day to-morrow?"
                  "If you say I must," answered Clinton.
                  "Thin, bedad, I say it!" responded the Doctor; "and now I'm aff in earnest.
                     Squire Merton will be here to-morrow; what sort of a story do you intind to
                     patch up for him?"
                  "Indeed I am not going to do any romancing, Doctor," answered Clinton; "If you
                     expect me to corroborate your yarns you will be disappointed."
                  "I suppose you can hould your tongue," said Maguire. "I forbid any conversation
                     on the subject of your hurts; it would tend to inflammation."
                  "Well, sir, I promise to avoid the topic; and if the Squire don't ask direct
                     questions, I shall volunteer no information."
                  After the Doctor departed the friends drew up to the fire for a quiet talk over
                     the events of the day.
                  "Wailes," began Clinton, "after a couple of fellows have been through such
                     experiences as you and I, it is not possible to keep up a cold-blooded reserve.
                     I want your advice. The Doctor has spun some astounding yarns at Merton Park,
                     but I cannot maintain my present relations there under false pretences. I must
                     tell Miss Sybil at least the exact truth about the scrimmage."
                  "Decidedly," said Wailes.
                  "Thank you; I knew you were true grit! Now, how am I to tell her? I am resolved
                     to say nothing to her against Radcliffe; I have done him all the harm I shall
                     ever inflict upon him. How his eyes escaped I cannot imaging; he must have had
                     his sword in my arm at the instant I touched him."
                  "Suppose he had encountered me instead of you?"
                  "What would you have done Wailes?" said Clinton, curiously.
                  "I think I should have run; or I should have suggested English fighting, with
                     nature's weapons."
                  "And then?"
                  "And then I should have doubled him up in two minutes," answered Wailes.
                  "I saw you will pull him out of his carriage," said Clinton, "and I am afraid
                     you were not as gentle as you might have been."
                  "Ah! He was holding her—her in his arms. It is a wonder that I did
                     not run him through; I had the sword in my hand, I remember. By-the-bye, he
                     will expect me to stone for that assault."
                  "Not he," answered Clinton.
                  "Why not?"
                  "Because I had a little conversation with him this morning. He will go to Paris
                     as soon as he can travel; his eyes require Continental skill."
                  Wailes puffed away at his pipe for some minutes in silence. He had known
                     Radcliffe a good many years, and he had never known him to forego vengeance or
                     forgive an injury. That he would demand satisfaction for the affront seemed to
                     him as certain as to-morrow's sunrise; yet Clinton spoke so confidently that he
                     was staggered.
                  "There is something more," said Wailes at last; "but I ask no questions:
                     perhaps you should not tell me."
                  "On the contrary, I must tell you, for this is the agreement. I came very near
                     blurting it out when we were doing the Greek. By-the-bye, did you notice
                     Mabel's accent? Where did she get her Greek?"
                  "I was stunned," answered Trumpley. "It is my belief that the old goddesses we
                     used to quote could not have uttered similar music. I suppose her father must
                     have instructed her. What have you to tell me about Rad?"
                  "Not much. It was difficult to get the opportunity. I desired, as I had to
                     speak to him in private; but I managed it by talking German. First, I told him
                     some things I happen to know about Dorado and his interest in it—no matter what
                     it was. He was defiant still. Then I had to translate into German a little
                     document I had written in good English. And he was not quite to defiant then,
                     and consented to spend the remainder of his useful life on the Continent if you
                     and I suppress this document. Here it is."
                  "What is it?" said Wailes.
                  "Only a dying confession. Before I called in Queen street I went to the
                     hospital and saw Blauvelt. The physicians had informed him of his imminent danger, and he dictated his
                     story, in which our friend Radcliffe is seriously compromised, and signed it
                     before a magistrate. I wrote it with my sore arm; it hurt like blazes,
                     too!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER LXII.
                  SOME DISMISSALS.
                  Certain events followed the burglarious attempt upon Beechwood in orderly
                     sequence. A grave, self-possessed gentleman had called upon Mr. Clinton early
                     in the day, having previously questioned Mr. Wailes at the bank, and having
                     obtained from him a succinct account of the night-alarm and the circumstances
                     that followed. A prolonged interview with Munseer Blowell succeeded, and the
                     grave gentleman, being assured by the attending physicians that the foreigner's
                     hours were numbered, promised him entire immunity upon condition that he
                     betrayed his comrades. To do Munseer Blowell justice, he stoutly refused this
                     invitation, until his interlocutor gave him a list of the members of the Merton
                     Liberal Club, and even repeated portions of his own admirable oration delivered
                     the previous night. Mentally cursing the despotic government under whose
                     tyrannous sway such occult police powers were possible, Mr. Blauvelt "leaked,"
                     to use the expressive term employed by his congeners. His goot friend Podd was
                     already known, and his other goot friend, the locksmith "Johnny," without a
                     patronymic, was identified by the bunch of skeleton keys found in the hall at
                     Beechwood.
                  Johnny was furnished with lodgings in a stone building belonging to the State,
                     and before noon Mr. Podd, who was found hidden in Tiger's vacated kennel, was
                     accommodated with an adjoining apartment in the same establishment. No better
                     proof of Mr. Podd's prejudice could be furnished than the parental care
                     bestowed upon him by the powers he derided. His wounds were carefully dressed,
                     his photograph taken, and the solitary door of his chamber (furnished free of
                     rental) was securely locked and barred, his protector taking the key away with
                     him. No enemy could break in upon him, neither could he incur any risk of harm
                     by wandering out in the rascally world. His health was so sedulously guarded
                     that beer and tobacco were kept from him, and he was even required to perform
                     unaccustomed tomed ablutions, under the sanitary regulations of his domicile.
                     Mr. Podd was a philosopher, and he spent the greater portion of his time in
                     sleep, during the absence of his attendant.
                  As Mr. Podd and Johnny both pass out of this history in the present chapter, it
                     may not be amiss to anticipate a little, in order to give a connected account
                     of their adventures. The slow-moving machinery of an effete government,
                     administering obsolete laws, did not dispose of these cases until winter had
                     possession of England, and Munseer Blowell, interred in September, was only
                     remembered as an actor with Podd and Johnny in the nocturnal adventure at
                     Beechwood. The latter was specially indignant when Mr. Clinton, who was
                     required by the same shabby government to give his testimony, announced that
                     the lock on the plate-chest was a burglar-proof lock, and not the same that
                     Johnny had described with the erratic "tumbler." Johnny privately informed an
                     obliging policeman who stood near him, that the inherent meanness of the
                     American character was manifested in thus seducing him into profitless danger,
                     by getting a new lock from London after he had mastered the mysteries of the
                     old one. "If the old lock had been there where the tumbler fell, a little apast
                     the 'alf-turn," he observed, "we should have been clean off before them swells
                     woked."
                  The health of these worthies was of so much importance in the estimation of
                     their guardians, that a change of climate was determined upon. Accordingly,
                     Johnny and Podd took passage in a government vessel for a prolonged voyage, and
                     for a permanent residence in a semi-tropical island near the antipodes. There
                     they still reside, and the population of which they form a part is nearly
                     unanimous in abhorrence of law and morals. It may, therefore, be concluded that
                     the lines have at last fallen to them in pleasant places.
                  The clubs of which they were honored members deplored their loss very
                     seriously. The Merton Club, of which Podd was president, fell into decay, and
                     the occupant of the loft over the carriage-shop lamented the loss of the free
                     gin grievously. The Gloucester Club is still in existence, and has passed
                     resolutions since Podd's departure that totally dismembered the British Empire.
                     Legislators and rulers are still keeping up a show of authority, but the
                     Gloucester Liberals know it to be a sham and a delusion. It only remains for
                     them to disband the police and tear down the Bastiles that dishonor the land,
                     to make Britain a fair representation of that other kingdom that is paved with
                     good intentions.
                  Mr. Radcliffe Merton sold his dog-cart and horse, discharged Tim, and went to Paris the day after his
                     accident. He knew a famous oculist there, he said, and desired to place his
                     eyes under his care. As he also passed from the present stage in this chapter,
                     it may as well be stated here that his life is devoted to extracting something
                     more than his allowance from his mother, in which efforts he is constantly
                     baffled by her superior acuteness. His vision is good as ever, and his personal
                     appearance is somewhat improved, as the scar on his brows has changed the
                     feline expression of his eyes. He steadfastly declines all invitations to
                     revisit England.
                  Dorado collapsed the day after the Squire's transfer. The great "property"
                     representing millions, vanished into an extremely attenuated vapor far less
                     tangible than atmospheric air. There were multitudes of small holders, widows,
                     orphans, impecunious clergymen, single ladies of uncertain age, whose revenue
                     had been very small when derived from consols, and who had placed their capital
                     in the tempting Dorado. To all of these the loss was serious. Mr. Clinton
                     lighted his pipe with his certificate before his arm was out of duress. An
                     honorable official, who had believed in the scheme to an unlimited extent, and
                     had innocently endorsed the prospectus, could not bear to hear it mentioned,
                     and wept copiously when any one forced him to listen to the story of the fraud.
                     His sufferings were all from an excess of benevolence, as his pecuniary loss
                     was trifling, he having sold out before the collapse.
               
               
                  CHAPTER LXIII.
                  CROSS PURPOSES.
                  Mr. Grippe arrived at the bank an hour earlier than usual. Wailes was already
                     there, as the walk from Beechwood was short, and he was always restive until he
                     had analysed the morning mail. Mr. Grippe found him immersed in a heap of
                     letters.
                  "Dorado gone, sir," said Wailes, as Grippe hobbled by. "Here is a letter from
                     De Lisle, who is in London, asking our assistance—"
                  "Assistance?" said Grippe, aghast.
                  "Yes; only to institute legal proceedings against the promoters of Dorado. He
                     coolly takes it for granted that Browler Brothers are holders."
                  "He is an ass! Write him so," said Mr. Grippe.
                  "I had better put it in French then," said Trump; "It sounds so abrupt in
                     English. I have written him, regretting that we could not aid him,
                     as we had no interest whatever in Dorado either for selves or clients."
                  "That is better," answered Mr. Grippe; "he will infer the fact that I proposed
                     to state. Any special letters? No? Well, come into my room; I have something to
                     say to you."
                  Wailes followed his senior into the inner office. Mr. Grippe took his
                     accustomed seat, opened a drawer, and took out half a dozen pestiferous
                     cigarettes, which he laid in a row upon his desk, within easy reach of his
                     hand. Trump was alarmed, as he had learned the tricks of Mr. Grippe's asthma,
                     and knew there would be some agitating discussion to follow so formidable a
                     preparation.
                  "I think of sending you to—to—New York," he began. "No, hang it! that won't do
                     either—say St. Petersburg. We have an unsettled account there—Paul
                     Snickemoff."
                  "Remittance came this morning,"answered Wailes.
                  "Ah, indeed! So much the better. Well, Corfu will do."
                  "What is the matter, Mr. Grippe?" said Wailes.
                  "You are such a reckless vagabond that I had better not tell you. Give me a
                     match, please. Puff, puff! Will you go at once if I tell you?"
                  "Certainly, sir," replied Wailes. "I will go if you wish it, without
                     explanations."
                  "Well, then," said Grippe, producing a paper, "here is a telegram I received
                     last night. It is from—no matter whom. It says that Belgian rogue is in
                     England, and has come purposely to kill the man who left him at Amiens. What
                     are you grinning about? I have had no sleep all night trying to device some
                     plan to get you away."
                  "Poor Blauvelt will not harm me, Mr. Grippe," said Wailes; "he is in the
                     hospital two streets off, and dying. I did not tell you yesterday, because I
                     saw you were agitated enough, but it was Blauvelt who was with Podd at
                     Beechwood, and who was throttled by the dog. Doctor Maguire says his hurts are
                     certainly fatal. Who sends the telegram?"
                  "The same fellow who notified us of his forgery. Are you sure he is going to
                     die? Well, that's kind of him, anyhow. As we got back the money, and as he
                     failed to kill you, I think we are bound to forgive him—that is if he
                     dies."
                  "I am saddened when I think of his family. He has a pretty young wife—"
                  
                  "And a mother-in-law," said Mr. Grippe; "and the mother-in-law is the very
                     person that let out the secret of his intended vengeance. She was under great
                     obligations to you because you had aided her at Calais. She had about five
                     pounds of 'tabac' in her bag, which you lugged ashore under the noses of the
                     French officials. You are a nice young man, to smuggle 'tabac' into
                     France!"
                  "I thought the bag was heavy," said Trump. "Well, Sir, when shall I start for
                     Corfu?"
                  "Dash Corfu!" replied Mr Grippe. "What the mischief do you want in Corfu?"
                  "You mentioned it, sir," said Trump, meekly.
                  "No matter if I did. I am far from well, Wailes; I shall not live over a month.
                     I have had several warnings. Smoked ten of these things last night. I'll go out
                     like a snuff some night."
                  "I hope not, sir," said Wailes, sympathetically. "Doctor Maguire says you will
                     live forty years with your asthma—"
                  "Dash Maguire!" replied the banker; "what does he know about asthma? He says it
                     is a 'disease of the fifth pair,' and wants to physic me with antimony; he'd
                     fix me in forty minutes! I tell you my life hangs by a thread, and any sudden
                     irritation would carry me off like a flash. Another match, please."
                  "Can I do anything to avert so great a calamity?" said Wailes, who began to
                     expect some astounding proposition.
                  "Exactly. You can make my few remaining days as placid as possible, if you will
                     just oblige me in a small matter—"
                  "Let me know your wishes, Mr. Grippe. I owe you too much to refuse you, no
                     matter what you ask. What shall I do for you, sir?"
                  "Get married!" gasped the banker. "Puff, puff! Ah! this is a famous attack; I
                     could die in two minutes! If you will just take a wife—a lovely girl—will make
                     you happy—I have her now at Halidon. There! there! don't speak! Run out now; I
                     will call you when this frightful spasm is over. Get out! confound you!"
                  Trump sat down at his own desk, stunned; the proposition was so sudden. Did Mr.
                     Grippe wish to have him married right off, without any sort of preparation or
                     warning? What would she say? he had not said a word to her. Could it be
                     possible that the banker had arranged matters with her without consulting him?
                     The thing was too absurd! Really, it was very indecorous in Mr. Grippe, though
                     it was all intended in kindness. What a jolly old brick he was, to be sure! It
                     would be dastardly to keep him in suspense if he was really set upon the thing.
                     Confound that asthma!
                  "Come in again," said Mr. Grippe; "I have found transient relief. Wailes, I
                     have very special reasons, which you would appreciate if you knew them, to
                     hasten this affair. It will relieve me of a load of responsibility that is
                     frightful. What do you say?"
                  "I cannot say anything, sir, until I find out the lady's sentiments—"
                  "Sentiments be blowed!" said Mr. Grippe, rudely; "sentiments are not the
                     trouble. It is settlements; and I promise you that these shall be
                     satisfactory."
                  "But, Mr. Grippe," persisted Trump," there are certain proprieties which one
                     must observe. You cannot snap up a lady at a moment's notice and marry her
                     whether she will or no. It is customary to do some preliminary courting—"
                  "Certainly, you may court as much as you like. All I want is your promise to
                     marry the girl—well, say in two weeks, or three. You can get dresses and things
                     in a week; special license, of course."
                  "Really I am at a loss, Mr. Grippe," said Trump, slowly; "yet I think I may
                     promise, if Miss Grahame should accept—"
                  "Miss Grahame! Miss Devil's grandaunt! You infernal young villain! you are
                     making a consistent member of the Church of England very nearly swear. I am not
                     talking of Miss Grahame."
                  "May I ask what lady you referred to?" said Wailes.
                  "Helose, of course, you great booby! Miss Grahame! Why, Miss Grahame has not a
                     penny in the world."
                  "Helose!" said Trump, white with rage; "the devil's grandaunt's grandmother!
                     Helose! Oh you may swear at me for the next two weeks, Mr. Grippe; and I will
                     engage to swear back so long as you propose so monstrous an absurdity! Ah! that
                     infernal poison you smoke has turned your brain."And he strode about the office
                     like a caged hyena.
                  "Will you please take a seat?" said Mr. Grippe. "We can certainly discuss the
                     matter without making fools of ourselves. Allow me to ask if you did not refer
                     to a young woman whom you supposed to be at Halidon, when you first came
                     here?"
                  "Yes, sir, I did," answered Trump, promptly.
                  "And did you mean Helose then?"
                  "Certainly not, sir."
                  "And how the devil did you know anything about Mabel, who had only arrived one
                     day before, and whom you had never seen?"
                  "I beg your pardon," said Trump, beside himself with disappointment and
                     intoxicated with old memories—"I beg your pardon, but I had seen her, and held
                     her in these arms. Ah! what am I saying! The fumes of this horrible stuff have affected
                        my brain also. May I open a window?"
                  "Certainly not," replied Grippe, watching him with sleepless vigilance; "do you
                     wish to kill me? What is all that about holding Mabel in your arms?"
                  "Nothing, sir," answered Wailes, in confusion; "please forget that I said that.
                     I had met Miss Grahame before she came to Gloucester at all, and—I am telling
                     you this in strict confidence, Mr. Grippe—I had fully determined that I would
                     never marry any other woman. Please don't ask me any more questions, sir."
                  "But this arms business," persisted Grippe, "that must be
                     explained. As much confidence as you like, but no half confidences."
                  There was no help for it. Trumpley told the story of Mabel's arrival in the
                     wrecked train, of her accident and rescue, and of her sudden departure from
                     Rose Cottage, her arrival at Gloucester the next day, and his conclusion that
                     she was Mr. Grippe's adopted daughter.
                  "And now, Mr. Grippe," concluded Trump, "I have told you all this with less
                     reluctance, because I know you will deal kindly with me. For some reason Miss
                     Grahame avoided and repelled me: do not ask her why. She has intimated her
                     readiness to explain to me, and in due time I will ask her, with your
                     permission. You know all about yesterday's adventure. I intended to ask your
                     consent before I spoke to her at all, because I cannot trust myself. If I begin
                     to talk to her I shall certainly ask her to be my wife—"
                  "What the devil do you want?" said Mr. Grippe fiercely, as Mr. Choppy appeared
                     at the door.
                  "Beg pardon, sir," said Mr. Choppy, "but here is a telegram, marked
                     'immediate.' I thought I had better bring it. I knocked twice."
                  Mr. Grippe took the despatch and read it, and Mr. Choppy discreetly withdrew.
                     The banker laid the paper on his desk.
                  "Go on, Mr. Wailes," he said.
                  "I only had to say, sir, that I must also see Mr. Grahame before I speak to his
                     daughter. That is another reason why I have not accepted your kind invitations
                     to Halidon."
                  "And you have overturned all my plans," said Mr. Grippe. "I had made a draft of
                     my will, confound you! I had left you something, which you would have inherited
                     in a week or two, for you have shortened my life, you mule! And you would have
                     relieved me of the care of this great, bouncing French vixen—I mean my dear
                     daughter—and Mr. Grahame's address is number ten, River street, Blackfriars,
                     and this telegram is from De Lisle, who begs me to send you to London at once,
                     to help him unearth some villainy of Blauvelt's—and the train will start at
                     noon, so get out—the devil take you! Good-bye! I'll tell Clinton."
               
               
                  CHAPTER LXIV.
                  CROSSER.
                  The Reverend Edward Grahame had a pensioner named Kirby. If he never had a
                     regular Christian name it had been lost in his youth, and he was known among
                     his congeners by the name of "Soak Kirby," which had probably been earned by
                     years of patient application to gin, and by a physical idiosyncrasy which
                     enabled him to imbibe and absorb unusual quantities of that liquid without
                     previous preparation or notice. Mr. Kirby's ostensible occupation was that of a
                     coal-heaver, but being afflicted with several varieties of pulmonary disease,
                     and always in a dying condition, his present business was washing bottles and
                     tumblers in a tap-room near Mr. Grahame's chapel. He took his wages in a fluid
                     form, and was chronically impecunious. There was something frightful in the
                     relentless and tyrannical way exercised by, Soak over the gentle parson, who
                     was constantly impressed by the conviction that his pensioner was a huge fraud,
                     and as constantly filled with self-reproach for his harsh judgment. Soak kept a
                     dismal cough somewhere in his manly bosom, which he evoked at pleasure. It was
                     ventriloquial, and seemed to come from some unknown depths in his organism, and
                     threatened instant dissolution. It was sepulchral, ragged, hideous, shaking his
                     gin-soaked carcase. He had a theory, often expressed, that his trunk was a vast
                     chasm, the vital organs of respiration torn into shreds, and his heart dwindled
                     to the dimensions of a hickory-nut, and within this cavern the cough raved and
                     rattled.
                  On the day succeeding Mr. Grippe's stormy interview with Wailes, Mr. Kirby was
                     ushered into Mr. Grahame's study. There was a tacit understanding that gave him
                     right of entry upon all occasions, and Mr. Grahame laid aside his sermon to
                     entertain his visitor. "Well, Kirby," said he, "how are you to-day? Take a
                     seat."
                  
                  Mr. Kirby looked around the room, searching for some place to bestow his hat.
                     It was a very dilapidated hat, with a black band upon it. Mr. Kirby,
                     fortunately for Mrs. K., was a widower. He found a flower-stand at last, with
                     some plants of Mabel's upon it, and deposited his ornamental tile among the
                     flowers.
                  "Ugh! ugh!" answered Soak, "cough wuss; tore me to bits last night. Doctor says
                     I must have some sherry."
                  "Sherry?" said Mr. Grahame. "How much sherry, Kirby?"
                  "Quart."
                  "I'll see the Doctor, Kirby—"
                  "No, you won't! 'T'ant our doctor; swell doctor from west-end. Saw me 'xpiring
                     in the gutter. Got out of his shay and sounded my lungs. Guv me arf-crown and
                     drove away. Spent the arf-crown in sherry, accordin' to borders. All gone. Ugh!
                     ugh!"
                  In the midst of Kirby's paroxysm another visitor was announced. He followed the
                     servant into the study, and she, depositing the newcomer's card upon the
                     writing-desk, gave him a chair and departed.
                  "Excuse me a moment, sir," said the Parson courteously. "Kirby, I will see you
                     later in the day; I must ask Doctor Smith about the sherry. I don't believe it
                     is good for you."
                  "Not a-goin' to have Doctor Smith foolin' round me," said Soak, viciously; "his
                     last dose nigh finished me. Never mind, sir, I'll git along. Don't want no
                     cheap sherry neither! Swell doctor said I must git it from Fortnum &
                     Mason's—four-and-six a bottle."
                  "Well, well," said Mr. Grahame, "I'll see about it. You can go now."
                  "Won't have to worrit much longer with me, sir," said Soak, regaining his hat
                     and shuffling to the door. "Ugh! ugh! cough rackin' my vitals. Swell doctor
                     says I may go off any minnit. Ugh! ugh!"
                  "Stop, Kirby—four-and-six, you say? Let me see if I have it—yes. I'm very
                     dubious about it though. Good morning."
                  Mr. Kirby made a sweeping bow, including Mr. Grahame and the later visitor, and
                     banged the door after him.
                  "And now, sir," said the Parson, "I am at your' service. You will pardon me for
                     keeping you waiting, but I make it a rule to give my poor parishioners the
                     first attention."
                  While he spoke, Mr. Grahame was hunting the card, which he had slipped in
                     between two leaves of the unfinished sermon.
                  "The apology is due from me, sir," said the gentleman, "for interrupting you.
                     But I return to Gloucester this evening and—"
                  "Want sixpence more," said Mr. Kirby, reappearing. "Homnibus to Helephant and
                     the Cawsil; 'nother bus to Piccadilly."
                  The gentleman quietly put a shilling in the dying man's hand. The effect was
                     electrical. Here was a new swell throwing shillings about like dirt. Kirby sunk
                     into a chair near the door, dropped the cherished hat upon the floor, and
                     coughed five minutes while he reflected.
                  "It cuts me to the 'art, sir," he said gloomily, when he regained his voice,
                     "to take money from Mr. Gram. The calls he has upon him is amazin', and mostly
                     himpostors, I dessay."
                  "Very likely," answered the stranger, dryly.
                  "Yessir; that's what I says. Now when a ginwine case comes up—"
                  "Like the present," suggested the gentleman.
                  "Zactly. Then Parson cawnt do justis to his own feelinks. 'Cause why? 'Cause
                     money's already used up on some wot aint worthy. And I says—"
                  "If you will go to the omnibus-stand and wait for me, I will rejoin you
                     presently," said the gentleman. "I am going to the Elephant and Castle
                     too."
                  While this dialogue was progressing, Mr. Grahame was industriously seeking the
                     visitor's card. He had seen the girl place it on the edge of the desk. He may
                     have brushed it off. Yes, there it is in the waste-basket. As Kirby retired the
                     second time, Mr. Grahame regained the card and glanced at the name.
                  "Mr. Radcliffe Merton."
                  The visitor approached the Parson with a smiling countenance. He was met by a
                     front of stern dignity thatwas appalling.
                  "Your address was kindly furnished by Mr. Grippe," said the young gentleman,
                     "from whom I would havebrought credentials if time had served. I left
                     Gloucester very suddenly."
                  Mr. Grahame bowed.
                  "I scarcely know how to say what is on my mind, sir," continued the visitor,
                     chilled by the other's manner. "Coming thus unannounced, it seems indecorous to
                     tell you that I admire your daughter and have come to ask your consent—"
                  "Stop, if you please, sir!" said Mr. Grahame. "You can say nothing to me about
                     my daughter that will be agreeable to me. If you have no other business, it
                     will hardly be necessary for me to detain you longer. Good morning, sir."
                  Trump gazed with blank amazement at the frowning face of Mabel's father. There
                     was an aromatic odor of gin in the apartment, left by the suffering Soak, and
                     the thought flitted through Trump's mind that the Reverend Edward was
                     inebriated.
                  
                  "I cannot affect to misunderstand you, sir," said Wailes, slowly, "but I am
                     sure there is some strange mistake—"
                  "No mistake, sir, except on your part. My daughter can never have authorised
                     this visit, which—"
                  "Certainly not, sir," answered Trump. "I have scarcely spoken to Miss Grahame.
                     I refrained purposely until I could see you and tell you my condition and
                     prospects."
                  "Really, sir, I am not interested in the matter. I have weighty reasons for
                     declining intercourse with you and with all your kindred. It is painful to say
                     so, but you compel me."
                  "I leave you, sir," said Trump, his head thrown back and his frank eyes
                     blazing. "I say only two words; if this is a mistake, I shall be rejoiced to
                     know it; if not, neither I nor my kindred will ever trouble you or your kindred
                     again. Good morning, sir!"
                  Trump found Soak waiting at the stand. The invalid was propped up against a
                     lamp-post, gasping.
                  "You infernal old cheat!" said Trump, "if you dare to bark at me with that
                     fraudulent cough again, I'll call a policeman and give you in custody. Do you
                     suppose you can impose upon me, with rum exuding from all your pores? Get out,
                     you villain!"
                  As the 'bus rolled away with this truculent youth, Soak took the shilling he
                     had given from his pocket, examined it intently, bit it, and still dubious,
                     dived into a gin-shop and changed it incontinently.
                  Mr. Grahame resumed his seat at the desk, and pulled his sermon before him,
                     dipped his pen in the ink and finished the sentence which Kirby had
                     interrupted.
                  "A fine state of mind I am in," said he, "for sermonising. Now that fellow
                     would deceive any one with his frank, bright smile and bold eyes. I was
                     attracted to him when he came in. He has the impudence of the—the Radcliffe
                     Mertons of all ages! To come here the second time, after my blank refusal to
                     see him only the other day! I threw his card in the waste-basket there, and
                     here goes the other. I don't think I shall have a third."
                  He set himself resolutely at his task, wrote to the bottom of the page, dried
                     it on the blotter and turned over a new leaf. A card dropped out.
                  "Eh!" said the Parson; "what is this? 'Harold Trumpley Wailes!' Where did it
                     come from? Bless my heart! it is the card Jenny put upon the desk, as sure as a
                     gun! And I have been saying the most insulting things to that gallant
                     youngster—the son of my old friend, the nephew of my brother-in-la! Jenny!"
                  Jenny was exchanging amatory chaff with the baker's young man at the
                     area-rails, and did not hear.
                  "Jenny! Confound the girl! Jenny!"
                  "Coming, sir," answered Jenny. "Get away with you, Mr. Crust; Mr. Grahame don't
                     allow no young men about here."
                  "Jenny, how in the world did you put this card in the sermon? Is this the card
                     the gentleman gave you?"
                  "Yes, sir; you pushed it in the sermont yourself. I seed you doin' it while
                     Soak was coughin'."
                  "Did I?" answered the Parson, meekly. "Well, well! I am going to the Elephant
                     and Castle, and then to the bank. Dear me, what a dreadful mistake! I don't
                     know how long I shall be absent, but hope to be back by dinner-time."
                  The Parson's chase was fruitless; no sign of Trump at the Elephant and Castle.
                     Messrs. Smith, Payne and Smith were Mr. Grippe's correspondents; he would
                     inquire there. Mr. Wailes? Yes; he had been there. Was at Charing Cross Hotel.
                     By underground railway to the big hotel. Mr. Wailes had gone. Was going back to
                     Gloucester. No doubt had taken the last train.
                  Mr. Grahame was quite tired when he got back to his sermon. He dined frugally;
                     then the postman came with a letter from his darling—eight pages.
                  That night Mr. Grahame packed his portmanteau, and the next day's train took
                     him to Gloucester.
               
               
                  CHAPTER LXV.
                  A CONFESSION.
                  Boldly disregarding the injunctions and deriding the prognosis of the faculty,
                     Mr. Clinton mounted the pony-phaeton, driving with his left hand, and proceeded
                     to Merton Park on the same day that Mr. Grahame spent in hunting Mr. Wailes.
                     When the latter was giving Soak Kirby his parting benison, Clinton was passing
                     through the Park gates. The Squire received him uproariously. He had
                     yesterday's Times, and the paper contained a communication which
                     Clinton must see. It was about Dorado.
                  "I have read it, Mr. Merton," said Clinton; "but it gives me no new
                     information."
                  
                  "No," answered Squire Mat; "but it confirms your hints. The whole thing is
                     exploded."
                  "Of course. I tried to impress you with my doubts the other day; but you were
                     so confident."
                  "Sold out!" said the Squire, poking him in the ribs. "Come in; the girls are
                     somewhere. What ails your arm? Oh yes; Maguire told me. I did not half
                     understand him, but I think he said you were chasing some burglars, and fell
                     down and trod on it. Hillo! Lucy! Baby! Where are you?"
                  "Here, Papa," answered Sybil. "Oh, Mr. Clinton! I am glad to see you out. The
                     doctor said you were in great distress—starving with a giant appetite. I will
                     get you some luncheon—"
                  "But I am on strict diet, Miss Sybil," said Clinton; "the doctor restricts me
                     to 'tay and toast.' It is terribly thin aliment too."
                  "We have the remnant of a grouse-pie," replied Sybil, thoughtfully. "We had
                     luncheon half-an-hour ago. Do you think you could venture to take just a
                     little?"
                  "He did not forbid grouse-pie specifically," said Clinton; "and if the remnant
                     is not too large, and you will carve for me—I am lame, you see—"
                  "Come into the dining-room. Papa, where is the port? Mr. Clinton will take
                     some—"
                  "Not a drop; wine is forbidden. Just a morsel of the pie and a mug
                     of beer;and then if you will take me a little drive, you will earn my lasting
                     gratitude."
                  "We are going to Halidon presently," said Sybil, with a blush; "but Lucy and
                     Papa can go in the carriage, and I can drive the ponies. May I, Papa?"
                  "Certainly, Baby. Clinton, I am plagued about that confounded stock. The poor
                     fellow that bought it was just in time to lose his entire outlay. I went after
                     Consol to get the fellow's address, but the blockhead would tell me
                     nothing—might as well talk to a stone wall I thought I would divide the loss,
                     anyhow."
                  "How much was it, Squire?" said Clinton, innocently.
                  "Twenty-five hundred."
                  "When did you sell?"
                  "On the same day—two days ago."
                  "Oh, then," said Clinton, "set your mind at rest. I think I know the buyer. You
                     must not ask me any questions, but I may tell you he will not lose a penny. Is
                     that what you call a remnant, Miss Sybil? It is like the mighty pastry of the
                     old romances."
                  "Papa tells of a tenant of his who always takes his beer in a gallon measure.
                     The reason he gives is that' he can drink as little as he likes.'"
                  "There is a sequel to the story," answered Clinton; "you promised to carve for
                     me."
                  "I did not promise."
                  "Cruel! Look at my arm."
                  The Squire departed to order the carriage and find his elder daughter. Mr.
                     Clinton attacked the remnant. Between the mouthfuls he glanced, at Sybil like a
                     cannibal. She did not manifest the least trepidation, but quietly replenished
                     his plate as fast as he emptied it. At last there was no remnant.
                  "I think I should like to prolong the feast about six weeks," said Clinton;
                     "that is, if my arm would keep useless and you would carve for me—"
                  "And the supply of remnants were larger," said Sybil. "I would get you
                     something more, but I really think you have had enough for an invalid; and now
                     I will get my hat."
                  "You are a regular angel, Miss Sybil," said Clinton, fervently. "I have not had
                     so glorious a feed for a year. Oh, what a barren waste this earth would be
                     without gentle woman—"
                  "And grouse," said Sybil.
                  When the carriage turned into the highroad, Clinton proposed that they should
                     go by Rose Cottage, up by the mill-road, and through the lane back to Halidon.
                     The Squire and Miss Merton preferred the road to the narrow lanes, so Clinton
                     and Sybil took the longer route. Sybil drove.
                  "I should have your seat," she said as the ponies trotted away.
                  "But my wounded arm is on that side."
                  "Well?"
                  "Well, if you were about to fall out, I should require my sound arm to catch
                     you," and he gave her another cannibal glance.
                  Rose Cottage had already gotten a deserted look; the blinds were closed and the
                     flowers drooping.
                  "Ho, Baby!" said Clinton, addressing the off filly; "trot more slowly! We shall
                     be there too soon."
                  "Where?" said Sybil.
                  "To a place I wish to show you. I am making up a story. I have a confession to
                     make to you."
                  Sybil began to feel some trepidation. The grouse-pie had infused new life into
                     the American, and his big eyes devoured her with so grisly an appetite that she
                     trembled.
                  
                  "Here is the mill; and there is the kennel. You will fear the dog no more, Miss
                     Sybil. Turn to the right. Gently, Baby! Ah, Baby! you are spoiled."
                  "Where is the dog?" said Sybil.
                  "Dead; and by my hand. His fate has been sealed since you told me about him. I
                     came down here once to kill him, but he was chained up and I could not bear to
                     shoot him. But yesterday the fates favored me, and he came at me, free."
                  "And hurt your arm," said Sybil, horrified. "Somehow I knew the doctor was not
                     telling the truth about you, but—but I did not like to ask—"
                  "Why not?" said Clinton, trying to see her eyes.
                  "Because I—it was not polite to express a doubt. Did he bite your arm?"
                  "No; he did not touch me. Ho! Baby. Stop here, Miss Sybil; this is the scene of
                     my story. Turn their heads across the lane and they will be quiet, nibbling the
                     hedge."
                  Sybil, her heart beating, knowing by unerring intuition what was coming,
                     feeling that a good, quiet cry in her own chamber would be so
                     nice, sat like a statue by his side while he told his story.
                  "Sybil," he began, with tender gravity, "you need not be told I love you; you
                     have known that many days. But, loving you, I cannot deceive you; and when you
                     hear all my story, if you give me no answer, I will go back to America.
                  "Your Cousin Radcliffe and I are old enemies. We quarrelled years ago in
                     Germany; we fought there, and he wounded me desperately. Since my recovery I
                     have been hunting him to kill him. When I came here I learned that you were
                     destined for him, and I sought you out to save you from so horrible a fate as a
                     life-long union with him. But I found you so sweet and good that I loved you
                     before I could give any warnings.
                  "Mrs. Wailes revealed to me the true nature of my hatred of Merton. It was
                     wicked, and my purposes were mean; and so I resolved at last to molest him no
                     more, to let him court you if he would, and to have no renewal of my quarrel on
                     any terms.
                  "Two days ago we met here. Do you see how the grass is trampled? By a curious
                     accident we were both armed, and he assaulted me just here, sword in hand.
                  "I could have killed him twenty times, but I had sworn to spare him, and I did.
                     At last with devilish cunning he spoke disrespect fully of your—of you, my
                     darling—and then I forgot myself and my better purposes, and resolved to kill
                     him.
                  "He escaped death by a half-miracle. It was not skill that saved him, but
                     desperate hardihood. In order to kill me he boldly faced almost certain death,
                     and in passing his sword through my arm, he threw up my point and escaped with
                     a scratch.
                  "You have heard that Wailes and I chased some thieves out of Beechwood grounds
                     and into this lane. We were armed with the swords, and they were left out here
                     in the lane when we took the wounded Frenchman in. I returned for the weapons,
                     found one, and met Radcliffe here armed with the other. It looked like the
                     decree of fate.
                  "And now he is gone; he is in France, and will not return. I have never
                     believed it possible that you could marry him, and I have dreamed that you
                     might some day marry me. Sybil, I will not distress you by pressing an
                     unwelcome suit. I know I am not worthy of you—you, so good, and I so rude and
                     wicked. But if you would allow me to love you, and would continue to humanise
                     me by your gentle admonitions, perhaps—in time—you would forget that I was an
                     American that could not talk good English—"
                  "I never said that!" interrupted Sybil.
                  "Did you not? Well, Mabel did."
                  "Mabel?"
                  "Mabel Grahame. Don't you know? She is my cousin."
                  "Ah!" said Sybil, coldly.
                  "And she will be nearer still to me, I hope; for I intend her to marry my dear
                     friend Wailes. Oh, Sybil! I was afraid you might like him; he is so gallant a
                     fellow."
                  "I do like him," said Sybil, spitefully.
                  "Ah! but I meant—love. Oh, Sybil, it will be terrible to put the broad ocean
                     between you and me! But I am resolved; if you tell me you cannot love me—"
                  "I am not falling out, Mr. Clinton! You need not hold me."
                  "Forgive me; I did not know what I was doing."
                  "Mr. Clinton, I think you are deceiving yourself. I think you really love
                     Another—"
                  "Sybil!"
                  "I mean grouse-pie. Behave, sir! How dare you squeeze my poor arm! There, you
                     may love me—till your arm gets well; and I'll—ask Papa if I may—love you a
                     little!"
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER LXVI.
                  THE LAST ANOTHER.
                  On the next day—alas! it is the last day—there was an impromptu dinner-party at
                     Halidon. Mr. Dipperly did not officiate this time, as the banker had decided to
                     have the feast very suddenly, and issued his invitations the same morning.
                     Squire Merton and his daughters; Mr. Clinton and Mr. Wailes, to escort Mrs.
                     Dora Trumpley; that is, to follow the Halidon carriage, which was sent for her.
                     It was a business-dinner. Mr. Grippe had a communication to make, in which some
                     of the guests were interested. The Squire was invited, because he was the
                     "friend of the family." Before the feast was spread, Mrs. Wailes, Mrs. Trumpley
                     and Mabel attended Mr. Grippe in the library, where the will was read and
                     discussed. The effect upon Dora was precisely contrary to Mr. Grippe's
                     expectations. Instead of being agitated, she was calmed by the assurance of her
                     husband's fidelity and affection. And this was due in great measure to
                     Clinton's judicious explanation of many mysteries, and the testimony of the old
                     letters written to his mother from Maison Rouge. He had spent the morning in
                     earnest debate with his aunt, and she was prepared for the confirmation
                     afforded by the will. The burden of grief and mortification which she had
                     endured twenty years, was all removed, and gave place to tender memories. The
                     only sign of weakness she gave was in clinging to Mabel, who was present at
                     this preliminary reading, at Dora's urgent solicitation.
                  "Do not leave me, darling," she whispered, when they parted to dress for
                     dinner; "come with me to my room; you and Edith both."
                  "My room is your room, Dora," said Mrs. Wailes. "I was put over the South
                     Terrace before we knew, or before Mr. Grippe knew of your existence."
                  "We will be on either side of you, Aunt Dora," said Mabel; "the three chambers
                     are en suite."
                  "I am only a guest, Edith," replied Dora. "I have promised De Witt, Beechwood
                     will be my home while I live. I could not bear to stay here. We will talk of
                     this hereafter, Mabel; you will stay by me, will you not?"
                  "Yes, while you are here. But I cannot live with you at Beechwood."
                  "Why not?" said Dora, as they ascended the staircase.
                  "Because De Witt has engaged Another!"
                  The dinner was in progress when a new guest arrived, and threw the entire
                     company into dire confusion. He had come by the late train from London. Mabel
                     flew at him on his entrance, clung to his neck, laughing and crying, and beside
                     herself for joy. Dora, who sat at Mr. Grippe's right hand, greeted him warmly;
                     the ready tears that filled her eyes drawn forth by the contrast between
                     Daisy's comely husband, and the gray-haired parson, worn by years of toil in
                     Black-friars. Room was made for him between his daughter and sister, and the
                     great business of life was resumed. Clinton sat by Sybil, who, exhorted him
                     occasionally to remember the grouse-pie, and moderate his voracious appetite.
                     He was still left-handed and helpless. Trumpley, who had not exchanged words
                     with Mabel, sat at the end of the long table silent and grave. The sudden
                     appearance of Mr. Grahame spoiled his appetite.
                  The red Burgundy came in due time, but, warned by Clinton, Mr. Grippe did not
                     mention the name. The American opened the door for the egress of the ladies.
                     One glass of wine followed, and then Mr. Merton proposed joining the better
                     part of creation. The Squire was longing for the whist-table, and there had to
                     be the conclave in the library first.
                  Mr. Grahame had not seen Trump. He was the first to leave the dining-room, and
                     when the entire company was assembled in the library, the Parson found himself
                     opposite the handsome youth to whom he had offered so sore an affront the
                     previous day. No chance to speak now; Mr. Grippe was spreading the will out
                     before him, and clearing his throat for a preliminary speech.
                  "Ladies and gentlemen," he began, "the paper I hold was entrusted to my care by
                     the writer the day before his death. It is his last will and testament. The
                     provisions it contains are peculiar, and I never have been able to comply with
                     them until now. To Mr. Harold Trumpley, I am under obligations that my entire
                     fortune could not repay; I owe my life and honor to him. And I have called you
                     all here to aid me to discover the exact wishes of Mr. Trumpley as herein set
                     forth, because the chief purpose of my life is to fulfill these wishes to the
                     letter."
                  This was said with grave dignity, and Mr. Grippe proceeded to read the will.
                     When it was finished, the banker requested Squire Merton to favor him with his
                     opinion.
                  "There can be but one opinion, Mr. Grippe," said the Squire, promptly. "Mrs.
                     Dora Lennox Trumpley inherits all and singular."
                  
                  "I think not," said Dora, gently.
                  "Why not, Aunt Dora?" said Clinton.
                  "Because there was evidently a desire in my husband's mind that the son of
                     Edith Trumpley should inherit Halidon."
                  "That was my judgment, Madam," said Mr. Grippe, "until two or three days ago,
                     when I learned that you were living. The knowledge that Mr. Trumpley Wailes
                     probably, nay, certainly as I thought, would inherit Halidon, hastened the
                     formation of our partnership. I am glad to add," he continued, bowing to Trump,
                     "that the connexion is a great gain and comfort to me. Mr. Wailes has displayed
                     the most remarkable abilities, and I do not know the man in England for whom I
                     would exchange him."
                  "There is a condition annexed to his inheritance," said Mrs. Wailes; "he must
                     relinquish his father's name—"
                  "Which I will never do!" said Trump, speaking for the first time.
                  "Not for Halidon?" said Dora, looking with admiration at his kindling eyes.
                  "Not for all England!"
                  "The difficulty is not insurmountable," said Mr. Grippe.
                  "I think it is," said Clinton; "my acquaintance with Wailes has been tolerably
                     intimate of late, and of all the—"
                  "What?" said everybody, when he paused.
                  "I was trying to find English words to express my meaning, but I can't, the
                     vocabulary is limited; I must say it in American."
                  "Out with it!" said Trump.
                  "Well then, of all the obstinate, mule-headed suckers I ever met or read about,
                     Wailes is the worst! Now, try your experiment, Mr. Grippe, and see if I am
                     right."
                  "I was going to suggest," resumed Mr. Grippe, "that Mr. Wailes need not
                     relinquish his name. He has only to add 'Oswald Trumpley' to his present
                     name—"
                  "Which is to relinquish my birthright," said Trumpley; "I will certainly never
                     do it. But there is a more serious obstacle still."
                  "What is it?" said the banker.
                  "My uncle has twice stated there in forcible terms his desire that Aunt Dora
                     should inherit positively. The reference to the heirs of my mother is only a
                     provision against a contingency that has not arisen. Aunt Dora lives, and her
                     title is unimpeachable. But if she had died, I could not inherit Halidon."
                  "I do not understand you," said Mr. Grippe.
                  "Because Mrs. Harold Trumpley has nearer kindred than I. If she should die
                     intestate, her property would go to Mr. Clinton, and—and Another."
                  "Yoicks!" said Squire Mat, "the boy has put us on the true scent. My dear Mrs.
                     Trumpley, let us settle this at once, and get to the whist-table. Make your
                     will, leaving the property to Clinton and Another. If Clinton has a grain of
                     sense"—and the Squire winked furiously—"there won't be Another long; there will
                     be only One. Ho, ho, ho!"
                  "There is a serious obstacle in that direction also," said Mabel, malignantly
                     scowling at Sybil. "Mr. Clinton has his eye upon a different Another."
                  "I'll have nothing to do with your confounded property!" said Clinton, in a
                     rage. "There is no such thing as Another. Mrs. Wailes said so: did she not,
                     Wailes?"
                  "Trump winced and remained silent.
                  "We shall have to postpone the consideration of the question, I suppose," said
                     Mr. Grippe, rising. "Ladies and gentlemen, will you oblige me by remaining at
                     Halidon another day? We will resume the discussion to-morrow night, and in the
                     meantime pray reflect upon the matter. Mrs. Wailes, will you please take the
                     Squire's arm and lead him to the drawing-room? He is dying for whist."
                  "Mr. Clinton," said Miss Lucy, catching his sound arm as he passed with Sybil;
                     "will you please excuse me, but I see such a striking resemblance."
                  "Where? What?" said Clinton, aghast.
                  "Don't you remember," said Miss Lucy, her eye sailing into its accustomed
                     corner; "don't you remember when Papa was carving the goose at dinner, that he
                     could not pull the skewer out of the wing? And when you were sitting there,
                     looking so sheepishly at Sybil, I thought—your arm being pinned down to your
                     side—that you resembled that excellent fowl."
                  "That is true, Sister," said Sybil, delighted; "the man is a regular
                     goose!"
                  "And you are Another, dear," said Lucy, sailing after Mrs. Wailes, while her
                     eye came back.
                  Mr. Grahame gave his arm to Dora, Mabel clinging to the other, and the trio
                     marched after Miss Lucy. When the Parson had seated the ladies, he returned to
                     the library.
                  Mr. Grippe was folding the will. Trump was standing at the window, looking out
                     upon the terrace. Mr. Grahame approached and laid his hand on his shoulder.
                     Trump turned, and seeing who it was, recoiled a step.
                  
                  "Only a word, sir," said Mr. Grahame. "You will credit me when I tell you that
                     I have not known a peaceful hour since I discovered my mistake."
                  "I do not understand you," said Trump, coldly.
                  "Ah! you pain me. Youth should be forgiving. Do you nurse resentment against an
                     old man who made a blunder so utterly ridiculous that I can hardly
                     explain—"
                  "I beg your pardon, Mr. Grahame," said Trump, composedly, "there could be no
                     mistake. Nothing has occurred since you so emphatically declined my
                     acquaintance to change our relations. I am not accustomed to compliments of
                     that sort, and while I nurse no resentment, I beg to say that I accept your
                     decision."
                  "And you can never forgive—"
                  "There is nothing to forgive, sir. If there is—or if you think there is—I do
                     most heartily forgive you; but I am quite content to remain a stranger, for I
                     cannot forget."
                  "I took you for Radcliffe Merton," said Mr. Grahame; "his card was on my desk,
                     and I thought it was yours. If I had known you were Trumpley Wailes, the man
                     who saved Mabel, do you think I could have spoken such words?"
                  "Oh, forgive me, Mr. Grahame," said Trump, as a flood of happiness swept over
                     his soul, "and let me explain—"
                  "I will hear nothing, sir," said Mr. Grahame, sternly. "If you have apologies
                     to make, you must make them to Another. Mabel! come here!"
                  And she came.
                  "Go out on the terrace with my friend, Mabel. Mr. Wailes, I will confirm
                     whatever she says."
               
               
                  CHAPTER LXVII.
                  THE TRUMP-HOLDER.
                  Mr. Grahame entered the drawing-room and took the seat vacated by Mabel, and
                     was soon engaged in earnest conversation with Dora. Mr. Clinton was playing
                     whist, having stipulated that Sybil should shuffle, cut, deal, and arrange his
                     cards for him. He was guilty of revokes and blunders that thoroughly
                     exasperated the amiable Squire, who was his partner, and drew from him emphatic
                     expostulations that would have been furious if Baby had not held him in check
                     with uplifted finger; and as the good father slowly recognised the relations
                     subsisting betwixt Sybil and Clinton, he became more placid, winking violently
                     at Lucy whenever Clinton made a new blunder.
                  Mabel, rather surprised at her father's summons, yet yielding prompt obedience,
                     accepted Trumpley's offered arm, and stepped out with him upon the terrace.
                     Orion was just heaving his huge bulk above the horizon, and the stars in his
                     belt and scabbard glittered in the eastern sky.
                  Mr. Grippe put away the will. He hobbled to the door of the drawing-room, and
                     found all his guests enjoying themselves. Then he hobbled to the terrace door,
                     which was ajar; Trump and Mabel were promenading. Mr. Grippe hobbled round to
                     the oriel window jutting out upon the terrace, and hidden by the heavy
                     curtains, he seated himself there and peeped feloniously.
                  "I have not seen Mademoiselle," said Wailes, after he had counted the steps
                     from one end of the terrace to the other: there were eighteen.
                  "Helose went to Paris this morning," answered Mabel. "Sir Henry Walton pressed
                     her so earnestly that Mr. Grippe consented. Lady Walton and Algernon were here
                     too, and joined in the plea."
                  "Algernon?" said Trump, jealously. "That is the young gentleman who took you
                     down to dinner that time?"
                  "What time?" said Mabel, innocently.
                  "Oh, you know well enough," said Wailes; "he was quite devoted too. I thought
                     his glances would melt the heart of a stone."
                  "Alas!" replied Mabel, "it did not last. When the omelette souffle came in, his glances and his heart centered on
                     that; and now he is dying for Helose."
                  "And you have not told me why you fled from Rose Cottage," said Trump,
                     suddenly. "Do you know I have been tortured with the apprehension that I drove
                     you away."
                  "I told Mrs. Wailes—did she not tell you?"
                  "Not a word."
                  "Why did you look so—so ill-natured to-night?" said Mabel. "You bowed so
                     elaborately when I came in that I thought I must have offended you again."
                  "Again?"
                  "Yes. Were you not offended when I passed you in the station at Gloucester, and
                     when I met you in the cathedral?"
                  "Offended?" answered Trump. "No; I was bewildered, mortified tified, wounded; yet I was sure you had a
                     reason. Will you tell me now?"
                  "On the morning after you saved me from drowning, and while I was thinking how
                     I could best show my gratitude to you, the servant brought a letter. It was
                     addressed to Radcliffe Merton, and I thought you were he."
                  "Ha!" said Wailes, "what fatality has made that man my evil genius! Your father
                     drove me from his house yesterday, having made the same mistake."
                  "I had heard of this bad man, and the history of his bad parents, and my father
                     had charged me to avoid all intercourse with him at any risk. So when I thought
                     you were he—oh, how cruel!—I fled. I did not tell Mr. Grippe; I did not tell
                     any one, not even my dear father, about my accident until I discovered my
                     mistake at the dinner that evening; and then you fled.
                  "What were you doing at Blackfriars?"—suddenly.
                  "I went to ask Mr. Grahame's consent to—"
                  "Do you know why I called for you when Merton was carrying me away?" she said,
                     interrupting him. "I thought you had rescued me from death once, and to be held
                     down by that villain's hands was worse than death. Somehow, I thought you would
                     hear me."
                  Trump had her hand in his by this time, and was almost crushing it.
                  "Hear you! Oh, Mabel! I have heard your voice crying 'Save me!' constantly
                     since the day I drew you out upon the bank. At night and in the daytime, in the
                     thronged city and on the roadside, in the quiet lanes and on the rough waters
                     of the Channel, always, everywhere, I heard you; and while you repulsed me, as
                     you did at the cathedral, I still heard you, and longed to fly to you. At the
                     dinner that terrible night I caught just one blessed glance from your dear eyes
                     which told me the barriers between us were gone, and when I saw you again it
                     was here, here,"—and he stamped upon the terrace—"and Clinton was kissing your
                     hand—this hand!" and he imitated Clinton's example on the spot. "Then I went
                     away; I had to go, and I did not care to come back again. If I could not love
                     you, could not devote my life to you, I could not find any prize in the present
                     life worth a contest. How long the assurance that I had found you only to lose
                     you again, oppressed my soul! But the other night Clinton told me of his
                     kinship and of Sybil, and once more I could kiss this little curl, which I
                     stole from you, poor child! when you were swooning—"
                  "I saw you, sir," said Mabel, turning the violets up to him, with a dewdrop on
                     each, glittering like diamonds in the starlight. Trump put them both on his
                     moustache.
                  "And you have known, Mabel, all this time that I loved you, and could never
                     love any other—"
                  "I heard you say so," answered she, softly, "when I was unconscious that
                     day."
                  "And you have been willing that I should love you all the time?"
                  "No, no!" she said, with a shudder; "while I thought you were Merton. I was in
                     deep distress, but I could not help remembering how brave and kind you were. I
                     knew you—might love me if we met, and I did not dare to let you speak to me
                     when I saw you in the cathedral; because I was afraid that while you talked to
                     me I would forget who you were. I was more ready to think of your great service
                     than of your evil reputation. Oh, how could I look at you and believe such
                     things!.
                  "I wrote everything to father two days ago. I told him of the railway accident,
                     which I had concealed from him until then. Poor Father! Oh, Mr. Wailes! you do
                     not know how noble, how self-denying, how tender and loving he is. When I came
                     here, leaving him alone in dismal Blackfriars, what do you suppose induced him
                     to let me come?"
                  "I cannot understand it," said Trump, gazing with rapture at the violets
                     looking at him so trustfully, and trying to believe them while they said she
                     loved him. "How any sane man who had the right to keep you would ever consent
                     to part from you, passes my comprehension."
                  "Well, I will tell you; let us sit down here."
                  Mr. Harold Trumpley, in some of his oriental wanderings, had found two sofas
                     made of bamboo twisted into a hundred folds by Japanese fingers, but holding
                     two people very comfortably if they would sit close. These were placed at
                     either end of the terrace, and the young people seemed to think they were large
                     enough. Somehow in taking the seat Trump's arm got pinned between the back of
                     the sofa and Mabel's belt.
                  "Father has a poor pensioner," she began, never dreaming of Trump's imprisoned
                     arm, "named Kirby—"
                  Trump started, straightening his arm out, and then unconsciously bending
                     it.
                  "Excuse me," he said. "Go on."
                  "Well, poor old Kirby has been a great sufferer for many years; he has no lungs
                     whatever."
                  
                  "No," said Trump; "I should think not. I saw him, I suspect."
                  "Did you? Ah, then I know your kind heart would pity him. Poor Kirby! What did
                     he say to you? and what did you do for him?"
                  "I cannot remember the exact conversation," said Trump, blushing safely under
                     the stars. "We parted suddenly. Ah, my darling, I was thinking of you!"
                  "Well, poor Kirby was in great distress. Our money was all gone; none to come
                     until next quarter-day, and then only a pittance. We would not borrow or incur
                     debts, and I happened to see Mr. Grippe's advertisement for a companion for
                     Helose, offering fifty guineas a year."
                  "Yes," said Trump, bending his arm a little more.
                  "It sounded like a fortune to us; it would buy so many delicacies for poor old
                     Kirby's declining years. And so when I pleaded with Father for Kirby's sake, he
                     consented. If it had not been for Kirby, you would not have risked your life to
                     save mine—twice, twice!"
                  Trump's arm was a perfect semicircle now, and Mabel was so close to him that
                     another person might easily have found room on the narrow sofa. She did not
                     appear to know it though.
                  "If I live," said Trump, fervently, "to revisit Blackfriars, I will hunt up
                     that gin-soaked old vagabond and feast him like a prince! I spoke roughly to
                     him, my darling. My own Mabel, you have not said yet you loved me."
                  "Never mind the vagabonds; it is Kirby you must help, for Kirby sent me to
                     you!"
                  "Yes," said Trump, deceitfully, "Kirby too."
                  Mr. Grippe was making frantic efforts to dance a three-legged dance without
                     shaking the curtains—one sound leg, one defective leg, and his cane. The
                     problem of the Halidon succession was being rapidly solved. From the
                     drawing-room came "the Squire's voice, roaring like Homer's Stentor, passing
                     through walls and doors, and startling the couple on the terrace.
                  "Who the devil has got the Odd Trump?"
                  And while Mabel nestled closer to him, and while Grippe persisted in his
                     saltatory efforts, she whispered—
                  "I think I have!"
                  And Trumpley stopped her mouth.
               
            
            THE END.
