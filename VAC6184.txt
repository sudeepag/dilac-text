            PREFACE.
            I PRESENT you with my first book. It is no fiction. The actors described are, or have
               been, living men and women: some of them still survive; others tenant the narrow
               house of the dead. Besides, the writing or reading mere fiction would be like sitting
               by the table, and going through the motions, without having any thing to eat.
            I am aware that books, like water, will find their level, and upon the great literary
               ocean I launch my little bark, to buffet the waves of criticism. If wrecked upon the
               rock of the classic and learned, I hope and honestly trust that it will find a
               resting-place in the hearts of the million of my countrymen.
            So far as it is political, I have given no opinion of my own, but have faithfully endeavored to represent
               the opinions of others. I have said nothing in extenuation, or set down aught in
               malice, against any person or party; but if any one, by a perusal of its pages, shall
               find a picture, in which he has been an actor, true to the letter—as Nathan said unto
                  David—Thou art the man!
            
            I have compressed the interesting details of thirteen years into a short story,
               hoping not to weary you. Read it: if you do n't like it, let the fault be with

            The border ruffian, or, Kansas and Missouri
            
            THE BORDER RUFFIAN.
            
               CHAPTER I.
               
                  
                     
                        Deep settled o'er the broad-spread plains,
                        no sound is heard, dumb silence reigns;
                        No wave in the air is toss'd;
                        O, my God! my child is lost.
                     
                  
               
               BRIGHT as a ray of light from the burning mountain, on the deep, dark shades of
                  night; lovely as the view off heaven to a dying man, is the sight of rest to a
                  worn-out, weary traveler. About one dozen years ago, far toward the setting sun,
                  on the border of Missouri, after traversing the plains the live-long day, "I lost
                  every trace of my way, and wandered in the shades of night." When about to give up
                  in despair, and lie down upon the cold, damp earth, with no cover but the canopy
                  of heaven, I fortunately discovered that I was near the plantation of Colonel
                  S——.
               Go with me, kind reader, to the residence of the Colonel, and we will apply for
                  food and rest. The Colonel is alive to the wants of a stranger. He knows by
                  experience the value of a comfortable bed
                  and a warm supper, to one who is tired, cold, wet, and hungry. He has been a long
                  time in the Western country, but in early boyhood received an Eastern education;
                  though somewhat rough in his manners, he is a true gentleman; tall in person, with
                  a muscular frame, and is a true specimen of a live Border Ruffian. He
                  is used to camp-life, and has told me of his many skirmishes with the Indians; but
                  I have no time now to relate them.
               I will now introduce you to one of the most interesting families with whom it has
                  been my fortune to become acquainted in the Western country. Mrs. S—— is a native
                  of the West, and a true type of a gentle countrywoman—affectionate, confiding and
                  faithful; the mother of an only daughter, who (at that time) was about five years
                  of age; possessing the mild, sweet temper of her mother, with the energy and
                  determination of her father. Sweet and beautiful child! The prairie breeze, as it
                  rustles through her golden locks, whispers no tidings of the future. Kind reader,
                  imagine a man of middle age, far removed from his native land, and one whose life
                  has been a thousand times in the most imminent peril—one who has no kindred at
                  hand save an only daughter, and of such an age—and you may form some idea of the
                  embrace with which the Colonel pressed Cora to his heart.
               Then go with me to the heart of a mother, whose first-born is gamboling beneath
                  the shade of her brow, while her sweet little sister sleeps beneath the dark,
                  green sod. Mark the mother, how closely she watches every movement, and then you
                  have but a faint glimmer of a mother's love.
               Thirty years prior to the time alluded to, Missouri was admitted into the Union as
                  a slave State. The Colonel, by his marriage with his lady, became the master and
                  owner of a black family of some fourteen persons, or, as they are more familiarly
                  called in Missouri, fourteen "negroes." For the present, I will only speak of
                  Dixie, a mulatto girl, about fifteen years of age, the immediate body servant of
                  Mrs. S——, and nurse of Cora.
               I was a guest at the house of the Colonel in the beginning of the summer of 1850.
                  Late one evening my attention was called to the unusually quick steps and glaring
                  eyes of Dixie, as she approached her mistress, when the following conversation
                  ensued:
               
                  Mrs. S. Where is Cora?
               
                  Dixie. She come home, missis.
               
                  Mrs. S. You lying spawn, she has not come home; I have been watching
                  the road all the time. Where is she, I say? Tell me, quick!
               
                  Dixie. I—I—I—went to sleep, missis.
               The mystery was soon revealed. Dixie and Cora had gone off to gather flowers on
                  the prairie. Dixie, true to the custom of her race, had lain down to take a nap,
                  and Cora, in search of the enticing flowers, had wandered off and lost her
                  way.
               All was bustle and confusion for a time; horses were saddled; neighbors were called; I was soon in
                  my saddle; a company of some forty men were soon collected; tin horns paraded, and
                  guns provided; and then a general rendezvous, after which we separated into
                  several parties, agreeing, if either party found the child, the others were to be
                  warned by the firing of guns, blowing of horns, etc.
               Then, o'er hill and dale, through brush and swamp, we dashed off, each and every
                  one anxious to win the prize. Fields, prairies, and woods were crossed in every
                  direction. I was with a small party, the Colonel being one of our party. We looked
                  into the most intricate places, listening ever and anon for horn or gun. But,
                  alas! no sound disturbed the silent wind. Still, on and on we pursued our course,
                  until the day no longer lent its friendly aid. A dark cloud was gathering in the
                  western horizon; black night was gently drawing her mantle o'er the broad and
                  beautiful prairies. All parties were slowly and sadly returning. The Colonel and I
                  were the last.
               I shall never forget the looks of that mother! It was now dark, and deathly Still;
                  the storm thick, fast gathering, and on the eve of bursting upon us. The last hope
                  of that mother lingered faintly on our return. I would have given every thing I
                  possessed in the world, to have returned the child to the mother. But fate
                  compelled us to return with empty hands. Who but a mother can fathom the feelings
                  of the heart that beat in the breast of that woman, as she clasped her hands and
                  exclaimed:
               "O, my God! my child is lost!"
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               
                  
                     
                        Ah! poor Dixie, awoke too late;
                        But to receive and lament her fate.
                     
                  
               
               FATAL as the sun-stroke upon a feverish brain, deadly as a poison asp to the bosom
                  of the oriental queen, this unexpected stroke fell upon the joy of a confiding
                  mother. Through the long vigils of the night, the moaning of the mother, the
                  pattering of rain, the low, dead sound of distant thunder, chased away coaxing
                  sleep from dull and heavy eyes. Welcome as the year of jubilee to the Egyptian
                  bondman was the first ray of light that broke upon the eastern horizon. The new
                  day brought new scenes. The Colonel on yesterday showed no lack of nerve; to-day
                  he was sad and inactive. The mother, on the contrary, rose to the duties of her
                  mission, to fill the sphere marked out by Heaven for her sex. Thus it is ever,
                  when man is overcome with grief, and ready to lie down in despair, woman rises up,
                  like a guardian angel, in the last day, to whisper comfort in the ear of the lords
                  of creation. He who has not heard, in the dark hour of trouble, the soft voice of
                  woman, knows not her mission.
               
               Mrs. S—— lost no time in making every preparation, in fitting out the different
                  parties to start in fresh pursuit of Cora. She also seemed to take into
                  consideration the circumstances under which she was lost. And in the general
                  bustle I observed that Mrs. S—— had Dixie tied with a rope, and was drawing her up
                  to a small tree in the yard, for chastisement. Now, it so happened that there was
                  a negro-trader in the neighborhood, who had taken a fancy to Dixie, and had
                  offered the Colonel a thousand dollars for her, which he was disposed to take; but
                  the sale had been prevented by her mistress. The Colonel seldom chastised his
                  slaves with the rod; he was unrelenting in his feelings for disobedience, and
                  proposed the sale of Dixie as a better punishment. Mrs. S—— gave her consent, but
                  said that she would whip her first, if it was the last act of her life. And,
                  accordingly, Dixie was chastised and sold.
               I was much amused at the conversation of two common men of the neighborhood, who,
                  for brevity, we will call Jeff and Abe. They held a low and interesting
                  conversation upon the subject of Dixie's treatment, to which I paid particular
                  attention, and shall never forget. It was as follows:
               
                  Abe. Poor, down-trodden African! how long shall he groan beneath the
                  tyranny of his master?
               
                  Jeff. The happiest people, as a race, upon the face of God's earth;
                  at least, that portion of them who are in this country, enslaved.
               
                  Abe. According to the constitution of man, there is no real
                  happiness to be found outside of the invigorating name of Liberty.
               
                  Jeff. Ah! liberty! What is liberty? Has a man the liberty to take
                  his neighbor's goods? has a subject the liberty to insult the king? has a private
                  man the liberty to assume official station? has a soldier the liberty to go to
                  sleep on his post—a crime punished with death by military law? And is this not a
                  similar case? Dixie slept on her post, and let destruction come to her charge. Her
                  sentence is milder than that of a soldier.
               
                  Abe. Yes; but I speak of constitutional liberty: the liberty to
                  pursue happiness; the liberty to obey the laws of one's country.
               
                  Jeff. That I understand to be the liberty of the white man; the
                  liberty of the sane man; the liberty of the adult; not the liberty of the minor,
                  the negro, the Indian, or the idiot.
               
                  Abe. Ah! Dixie's father was a white man. By what unknown law in
                  metaphysics do you deprive the child of the inheritance of the father.'T is not on
                  our statute-books.
               
                  Jeff. In the language of the English poet: 
                     
                        "From nature's chain, whatever link you strike,
                        Tenth, or ten-thousandth, breaks the chain alike."
                     
                   A mule is the colt of a horse; yet a mule is not a horse.
               
                  Abe. The ass is of a different species from the horse. There is but
                  one species of the human family,
                  differing only in the color of the skin, as a white horse or a black horse.
               
                  Jeff. I know you think so; but there is a very wide difference, both
                  in body and mind.
               
                  Abe. The colored man has been borne down with slavery from
                  generation to generation, and kept in ignorance, until servitude and abuse have
                  made him inferior in mind; he is not inferior in body.
               
                  Jeff. So far as regards physical strength, the negro is not inferior
                  to the white man; yet he is of a different temperament: he can endure more heat,
                  but not so much cold; he is the native of a warm climate—naturally very indolent;
                  yet he is capable of enduring much labor; but he will not labor of his own accord;
                  he prefers ease of body to ease of mind; he takes no thought for the future, and,
                  if he lived not with the white man, he would go back into barbarism.
               
                  Abe. You do n't argue the question fairly; you strike a blow at half
                  of creation with the word "negro;" your theory condemns a man to eternal servitude
                  for one drop of blood.
               
                  Jeff. I condemn no man for the place of his birth. It may be
                  unfortunate to be born in Rome. I know it is unfortunate to be born in the
                  kitchen. The decrees of fate are beyond the control of man.
               
                  Abe. My Bible teaches me that the human family are the descendants
                  of Adam, having a common origin and a common destiny. Give me one Bible, one God,
                  one religion, one people, and one liberty.
               
                  Jeff. I know you think so; but that has never been, and is not now,
                  the history of man. He has now several Bibles, different gods, a variegated
                  religion, five or six peoples, and no such thing as one liberty.
               
                  Abe. Ah! but is not our great mission upon earth to convert the
                  heathen, to reform governments, to teach that all men are brothers, to "do unto
                  others as you would have them do unto you?"
               
                  Jeff. To "do unto others as you would have them (under similar
                  circumstances) do unto you," is the best understanding of that passage of the
                  Scripture. St. Paul, in the conversion of the wicked, meddled not with
                  governments, or with master and servant. You would reform the fathers of the
                  Church.
               
                  Abe. We live in a progressive age; darkness and barbarism must give
                  way before the light of freedom and religion; weights from all shoulders will be
                  removed in this generation.
               
                  Jeff. We will see.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER III.
               
                  
                     
                        O woodsman! wind that horn again,
                        High on the breeze, with heavenly strain;
                        No sound so sweet to faltering ear—
                        To anxious hearts no sound so dear.
                     
                  
               
               THICK as the locusts of Egypt, thoughts crowded through the brain of those most
                  deeply interested as to the whereabouts of Cora. The country had been diligently
                  searched for five miles around, and many of the neighbors had given up in
                  despair.
               The sun was mounting the eastern horizon; the clouds grew thin and scattered far
                  away; the breeze of the morning, cooled by the late rain, invigorated both horse
                  and man. The Colonel had engaged some of the most expert woodsmen to make further
                  search, who had set out upon their mission, taking a north-west course. In company
                  with the Colonel, I soon followed, we having determined to penetrate the
                  territory; for the Colonel was of opinion that some foul play had been enacted by
                  some of the settlers of that virgin soil. And while we pursue—a few miles in the
                  rear of our party—let us turn and listen to a conversation between Mrs. S—— and
                  Aunt Patsie, a neighbor woman that had come to comfort the distressed mother as
                  far as she could. Aunt Patsie was a very peculiar person. She could tell you the
                  birthday, without a moment's reflection, of every child that had been born in the
                  circle of her acquaintance for the last thirty years; she could tell the day of
                  every battle of the Revolution; and, when a little excited upon religious topics,
                  she could describe, in minute detail, the individual character of each of the
                  twelve Apostles. It is said that Artemus Ward can hatch more curiosity than any
                  man in America: but arouse Aunt Patsie's bump of inquisitiveness, and get her head
                  set on curiosity, and she could hatch Artemus Ward. Mrs. S——, therefore, was
                  hopeful that Aunt Patsie could, in some way, account for the disappearance of her
                  lovely and innocent child.
               Aunt Patsie, said: "The weather being warm, she could not have suffered with cold;
                  the rain being hard, she might have fallen into some stream and drowned. The dark,
                  rainy night must have frightened the poor little creature; but I never knew one of
                  so tender age to die of fear. Indeed," continued Aunt Patsie, "a prairie-wolf
                  might undertake to eat a child of that age; a hungry wolf is a desperate animal,
                  and they sometimes go in gangs."
               Mrs. S—— thought of the story of Romulus and Remus, who were, when infants, thrown
                  into the river Tiber, in a basket, and afterward rescued and suckled by a wolf;
                  and her imagination pictured the wolves fondling with her sweet little pet. "O,
                     they could not!" and the anxious
                  mother wrung her hands.
               Aunt Patsie raised her spectacles, and rubbed her hand over her forehead, as she
                  said: "I tell you what it is, Jane: my Tom saw two Indians skulking along
                  yesterday morning, and I will bet my salvation they have taken that child."
               "O, my God! no—no!" and Mrs. S—— prayed secretly for relief from the
                  prophetess.
               I was conversing with the Colonel upon the dangers to which the sweet little Cora
                  was subjected. We had just emerged from a deep ravine of timbered land, and
                  entered the border of a broad and beautiful prairie, when the Colonel suddenly
                  checked his horse. His countenance told me that some distant messenger had met his
                  ear. No word was spoken; we paused a few moments in breathless silence: then came
                  the sound of the woodsman's horn, in clear and distinct notes, o'er the
                  broad-spread plain before us. "They have found her," said I to the Colonel, as we
                  sped off in the direction of the welcome horn. We soon neared the party, and were
                  doomed to disappointment; for we were only greeted with the bonnet and apron of
                  little Cora, or what was supposed to be hers.
               We were now across the State line and in Kansas Territory, near the domicile of a
                  man who bore the Colonel a certain deadly hatred. And, notwithstanding one of the
                  party had been informed by said man that he knew nothing of Cora or any other lost
                  child, the Colonel said the child could not have been so near the premises without
                  some knowledge of the family; and proposed putting said man to the torture until
                  he should tell the truth. As I had some doubts of the identity of the bonnet,
                  etc., and thinking that a little time would probably give us some due to this
                  bonnet, I told the Colonel and party a short but true story upon circumstantial
                  evidence. It is as follows:
               On the border of a Western State lived an aged man, highly respected and wealthy,
                  the father of an only daughter—who at that time was about seventeen years of age,
                  and very beautiful—by the name of Minnie. There was a young man in the
                  neighborhood by the name of Hardin, who had been raised by a mechanic in humble
                  circumstances in life. Minnie and Hardin had been play and schoolmates from
                  childhood. A certain thing that the old gentleman called pup-love had
                  grown with their growth and strengthened with their strength. The old gentleman,
                  not liking the course of events, for bade young Hardin the prerogative of his
                  premises. Minnie was a dutiful child, and would not disobey her father; yet she
                  met Hardin at a certain place by the road-side, where they had many long and
                  interesting interviews. At last, one day, young Hardin, not liking to remain where
                  circumstances so oppressed him, said to Minnie: "Your father objects to me because
                  I am poor. I will seek fame and fortune in a distant land. When I have gained the
                  requisite recommendations, I will come to your father's house and claim what I
                  have the right and honor to claim," And
                  Minnie and her lover parted, with aching hearts and flooded eyes.
               A steamer was advertised to depart from the coast the next morning.
               Hardin went to the neighboring village and put up at an inn, where he had been
                  much in the habit of stopping. Now, it so happened that the same night there came
                  to the inn a certain mule-driver, and called for lodging. The inn being crowded,
                  the landlord petitioned Hardin to admit the mule-driver to share his bed and room,
                  to which Hardin consented. The two were soon after lighted by the landlord, up an
                  outside flight of stairs, to Hardin's little room. While preparing to retire, the
                  mule-driver took a fancy to Hardin's watch, for which he effected a trade by
                  giving Hardin his watch and a few dollars in money; and, to use a Western phrase,
                  they both "turned in." The mule-driver soon fell asleep. But this was not the case
                  with Hardin: he thought of Minnie; he thought of his voyage; he thought of the day
                  of his return; he thought of days gone by, and of the many long and tedious
                  seasons that he had loved, so dearly loved, his Minnie. He could not sleep; nay,
                  he could not lie still; and, bordering on distraction, he arose, intending to
                  spend the remainder of the night on the road to the steamer, and thus left the
                  mule-driver all alone.
               Now, it so happened that a robber had been watching the mule-driver, for it was
                  supposed that he had money. This robber, in ambush, saw the mule-driver lighted up
                  to his room, and he saw the retreat of young Hardin, when he mentally exclaimed,
                  "Ye gods! a glorious opportunity!" Then, silently and unseen, he approached the
                  stairway and gently ascended. A light pressure upon the door, which had been left
                  unfastened by Hardin, turned it slowly upon its hinges, and he entered the room;
                  then paused to listen; no sound met his ear save the deep slumber of his victim; a
                  whole eternity passed through his mind in a moment! An aged man lay before him, in
                  the soft and sweet embrace of sleep; the night breeze, as it rustled through the
                  silver locks upon his temples, told of the many years he had labored for his
                  money; the pale moon glimmered through the lattice of the window, and showed the
                  assassin where to strike. He grasped the handle of a polished blade with his right
                  hand, and slowly drew it from its scabbard, as he gently raised his left hand to
                  his brow to hide his countenance from the God of heave. Suddenly plunging forward,
                  he struck the fatal blow; then, one death-struggle, one deep moan, and all was
                  still, save the trickling of the dead man's blood.
               The assassin hastily searched his coffers, and again sped away with cautious feet.
                  As he neared the bottom of the stairway, the iron tongue of Time told the dark,
                  dead hour of night, and the pulse of the town was still. 
                     
                        The moon was sinking in the west,
                        The night-hawk sought a place of rest;
                        The clouds of night, with quick'ning speed,
                        Hid a devilish villain's deed.
                     
                  
               
               
               And he sped to the brushwood. Morning came; the dead man was found; the landlord
                  told how and where he had left him. Suspicion fell upon young Hardin. Pursuit was
                  made; the steamer had not yet sailed The watch of the mule-driver being found with
                  young Hardin, the manner in which he left the town, was the circumstantial
                  evidence against him, under which he was tried, condemned, and executed.
               Minnie, knowing nothing of the innocence or guilt of her lover, died of a broken
                  heart.
               Five years after the above transactions, this same robber was taken, tried, and
                  condemned to hang, for the murder of another man. He wrote in his confession that
                  the mule-driver was the first man he ever murdered.
               By this time we received satisfactory information that the bonnet and apron
                  belonged to a little girl in the neighborhood, who had lost them on her return
                  home from school.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               
                  
                     FATE! ah, mysterious Fate, thou sneaking ape of time; who art thou, that
                        write the lives of men without their leave, and stamp the record with thine
                        own image?
                  
               
               MISFORTUNES seldom come single-handed; but when once set in, they seem to follow
                  each other in swift succession, as though they were trying how much one can bear;
                  like Satan, when he afflicted the patriarch Job, they seem to try one experiment
                  after another, until a man is borne down with grief; but a life's experience has
                  taught me that it is generally for our good.
               Colonel S—— had made extensive preparations to go to California in search of gold,
                  a thing he had no need of under the sun, for he possessed a fine plantation and
                  plenty of servants. That he was not satisfied can only be accounted for by the
                  declaration of Jeremiah, the Hebrew prophet, that "man is strange, and wonderfully
                  made." A few days before his appointed time to start, the accident of the loss of
                  Cora had occurred, which interrupted all his arrangements, for the time being.
               
               The last lingering ray of light faltered in the west; the broad mantle of night
                  slowly and calmly covered the Western home of the Border Ruffian. A light tap with
                  the knuckles upon the door—which, in the West, takes the place of the
                  alarm-bell—announced the arrival of a stranger. A moment after, his old friend
                  Mingo was admitted, who left him one year previously for the land of gold. The
                  low, deep cunning that lingered in the corners of Mingo's mouth told the sadness
                  of his tale. But we will let him tell it in his own fashion, with a vow that it
                  was as true as the first chapter of Matthew:
               "After we got out upon the plains, we thought all creation was going to
                  California. The road was lined with a moving caravan as far as the eye could
                  reach, before or behind; and all seemed to press forward with an indecent haste.
                  After some days' travel, it was evident that many teams were failing; stock would
                  weary and fall, and be left to die by the road-side. By the loss of teams, wagons
                  also had to be left. Dead animals, deserted wagons, and new-made graves began to
                  line the road. Nor was this all. Indiscreet men, as their teams began to fail,
                  would throw out a portion of their provision to make the load lighter. Bacon,
                  flour, cheese, crackers, we frequently met with on the road, but, what is very
                  remarkable, we never found either whisky or tobacco.
               "We were at last much frightened by the number of new-made graves. They were
                  everywhere to be seen. Many a poor gold-hunter found his last resting-place upon
                  that broad and desolate plain, separated from home and friends—and, in many cases,
                  from a loving wife and little children—and laid with hasty hands into a new-made
                  grave, with a blanket for a shroud, and the cold, damp earth for a coffin. It is
                  strange how heedless one walks above the dead. On the night of the twenty-first
                  day of our journey, I slumbered heavily, and was awakened about daylight by
                  Picayune, who was very sick. This was the first misfortune we had met. We applied
                  immediately to our medicines, but all to no effect; he grew worse and worse,
                  until, at last, we closed his eyes upon the scenes of earth. I chiseled, as well
                  as I could, the letters of his name upon a rough stone, and placed it at his head,
                  and left him, with the prayer that the keeper of all the dead would guard his
                  resting-place.
               "Burtice separated from me in California. I afterward understood that he was
                  unfortunately wounded by a Chinaman, and I suppose he is dead. When I got into the
                  mines I found we had to wash so much dirt to get the gold, my soap soon gave out.
                  I was not able to undergo the bodily fatigue. I could not dig like a ground-hog,
                  and wash like a widow woman, with half a dozen starving brats gazing into the tub,
                  watching the bubbles on the suds, expecting them to burst into loaves of bread.
                  Being sick, Milo started home with me by water, but long before we arrived at the
                  port of our destination, he, poor fellow, had to give up his last cares of the
                  world, and was silently committed to the bosom of the deep. And here am I, with less gold than I had when I
                  started."
               And Mingo, after receiving some presents from Colonel S——, went home to his
                  family.
               I said to the Colonel; "It is not all gold that glitters; a prize is magnified
                  when it is far away; we eagerly seek it in the distance; the thorns and briers
                  that lie in the pathway are overlooked; and we are apt to rush headlong to some
                  distant object, when it would be better for us to take up, with cautious hands,
                  those things that God and nature have placed in our way, and, with a cheerful
                  heart, be contented with an honest living."
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Conscience! what art thou? Thou tremendous power!
                           Who dost inhabit us without our leave,
                           And act within ourselves another self,
                           A master-self, that loves to domineer,
                           And treat the monarch frankly as the slave;
                           How dost thou light a torch to distant deeds!
                           Make the past, present, and the future frown!
                           How, ever and anon, awake the soul,
                           As with a peal of thunder, to strange horrors,
                           In this long, restless dream, which idiots hug—
                           Nay, wise men flatter with the name of life!
                        
                     
                     EDWARD YOUNG.
                  
               
               THE golden leaves of the forest rustled on the ground; the low, still winds from
                  the west drove the prairie-hens to the fields; the burning grass on the prairies
                  announced the approach of autumn. Another long and dreary summer had passed
                  away.
               Since the loss of Cora, Mrs. S—— had been the constant inmate of her room, and her
                  health, by this time, had so declined that the Colonel determined to call in a
                  physician.
               Dr. D—— lived at some distance; but, for his large experience and popular name,
                  the Colonel was induced to send for him. I shall never forget the bearing and demeanor of this extraordinary man. A
                  man of few words, with grave and stern countenance, with iron firmness of purpose,
                  he seemed to look through human nature as though he understood the secret spring
                  of life.
               I was anxious to hear the Doctor's opinion of Mrs. S——; for her case, to me, had
                  appeared most singular. You can not imagine my surprise when, after an examination
                  during which the Doctor asked a great many questions, he remarked to the Colonel,
                  in slow and measured tones: "I do not believe I can help her without the aid of
                  mesmerism." This was new to us, and unexpected. The Colonel made strong objections
                  to his lady being made the subject of an experiment. The Doctor coolly remarked:
                  "Then she must be made the subject of a graveyard."
               After a long pause, the Doctor wisely remarked that it could do her no harm. After
                  a long private conversation between the Doctor and the Colonel, they decided to
                  try the experiment, much to the gratification of, at least, my curiosity.
               As this part of the story must here take the appearance of a romance rather than
                  the faithful record of historical facts, I must let Mrs. S—— tell her own story,
                  as she related it to others, at the time:
               "I had been suffering with a dumb headache for several days, without the least
                  intermission. When Dr. D—— made the 'passes' before my face, it seemed to me, for
                  a moment, that my head was bursting—every thing before me began to dance and
                  disappear. I recollect nothing more. When I was aroused to consciousness, my head
                  was free from pain, and I felt much relieved. When I was told by the Doctor and
                  other persons present that, while in the mesmeric state, I had conversed upon
                  various subjects quite rationally, and that I was very interesting in
                  conversation, I was surprised; but when they told me that I had conversed with,
                  and told them where Cora was, I did not believe the testimony of my own husband. I
                  thought I was the victim of a joke.
               "But when Dr. D—— made the 'passes' the second time, they seemed to throw down the
                  wall that stood between my two selves. I spoke of my old self in the third person,
                  and said: 'She is a cold and careless mother.' My new self saw and conversed with
                  Cora. She told me that she was with very nice people. I told her that I did not
                  want her to come home; that I had rather she would stay where she was, and learn
                  how to work, and go to the church, and get religion. I told her that I would not
                  stay here; that I was going away, and that very soon; and her father would not
                  take her to church, for he was a cold man of the world.
               "When Dr. D—— made the 'passes,' and I was again awakened, I had some faint idea
                  of my two selves—an inkling of that inner consciousness, which seemed but a shadow
                  of the mind. Yet the whole universe could not convince me that there does not
                  dwell within ourselves another self, more spiritual, more lively, more conscious—a
                  tenant of this mortal clay far superior
                  to our waking consciousness."
               When Dr. D—— returned the next day, after what had transpired, Mrs. S—— was
                  unwilling to undergo the operation again. The Colonel also objected, as, when she
                  was in the mesmeric state, she would talk constantly of Cora, which called to her
                  waking hours, and also to the mind of the Colonel, most sad and gloomy
                  reflections.
               Now, the strangest part of this whole story is, that Mrs. S——, for a few days, was
                  very positive that mesmerism was no deception, and that she had realized, done,
                  and said all that was said of her; but in one week she denied the whole affair,
                  and said that she was imposed upon, and that she had no faith in mesmerism.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               
                  
                     TIME! thou venerable sire, and mysterious harvest-hand! who gave you that
                        old scythe, that never needs the whetting-stone, yet will not cut the thread
                        of fate, or wound the gods? Is that thine only tool, thou builder of towns
                        and cities, founder of governments and nations, and father of the arts and
                        sciences? No mortal eye hath seen thy cradle; none shall see thy grave.
                  
               
               FIVE mortal years had lived and died since the loss of Cora, and no tidings of her
                  had been received. The American States were prosperous and happy; emigrants were
                  flocking to the West by thousands; Kansas was preparing to make her début into the sisterhood of States. Missouri, jealous
                  of the aspirations of her young sister, voluntarily assumed the task of arranging
                  her wardrobe. But the maiden Queen of the West was disposed to listen to
                  flatterers! Missouri would, indeed, clothe her in a white robe; but her flatterers
                  would trim it with a black ribbon.
               It was given out that emigrants from the North were flocking to Kansas to make her
                  a free State under the Douglas policy, who had no thought of making Kansas their
                  home. This opportunity was also eagerly
                  embraced by Missourians. A law had been enacted in Kansas allowing all tax-payers
                  to vote. The poll-tax being only one dollar upon each head, any one could vote
                  that could pay that tax.
               Parties from Missouri were fitted out for no other purpose than to go to Kansas,
                  vote for some pro-slavery man, and return. It was on one of these occasions, when
                  a party was preparing to start to Kansas for that purpose, with the Colonel at
                  their head, that my attention was again called to another conversation between
                  Jeff and Abe. It ran as follows:
               
                  Abe. I think it is very unfair for those Missourians to go to Kansas
                  for no other purpose than to try to make her a slave State.
               
                  Jeff. I have heard an old saying that "it is as fair for the goose
                  as the gander." The Free-State people are doing the same thing.
               
                  Abe. But slavery ought not to be extended.
               
                  Jeff. That is only a difference in opinion. Free-State men think one
                  way, and Slave-State men think the other.
               
                  Abe. But the Free-State men are right; they act upon the principles
                  of justice and equal rights.
               
                  Jeff. I know that you think so; but why take the territory from the
                  Indians and give it to the negroes?
               
                  Abe. To make it a free State is not giving it to the negroes.
               
                  Jeff. Your doctrine will lead to that. Confine the western
                  emigration of slavery to the borders of Missouri, make all the territory west
                  free, and in twenty years your new States will be governed by the negroes.
               
                  Abe. That is bare assertion. Where is the free State that is
                  governed by the "negroes," as you call them?
               
                  Jeff. The negroes at present are in better business; but open the
                  virgin soil west with freedom to the negro, and he will leave his master in
                  Missouri, and seek a shelter among you; politicians will favor him, and, under the
                  majority form of elections, he will command the balance of power. That is what I
                  mean by "governing."
               
                  Abe. Yes; but if we do not extend to him the right of suffrage?
               
                  Jeff. Then you repudiate your doctrine, and had better let him
                  remain in slavery.
               
                  Abe. We can take him out of slavery, and not extend to him
                  citizenship.
               
                  Jeff. There is no middle ground; no half-way house. You would
                  enslave him to the nation, instead of individuals. What is the difference?
               
                  Abe. In what manner would that enslave him to the nation?
               
                  Jeff. Deprive a man of citizenship, give him no voice in the laws
                  that are to govern him, and what is he but a slave?
               
                  Abe. He is still at liberty to work for whom he pleases, and
                  regulate, in part, his own wages.
               
                  Jeff. What is a sterner master than necessity? The slave that
                  defrauds necessity, defrauds himself, and not his master.
               
               
                  Abe. Then you would make all poor men slaves.
               
                  Jeff. They are, in the sense you mention; but, while they are the
                  slaves of necessity, they are freemen, because they are citizens, and have a voice
                  in the laws of their country, and the way is open to them to rise above necessity.
                  If they have the personal merit, they may rise to the first gift that is in the
                  people of the nation. The man who is not a citizen can not rise, because that
                  barrier is impassable; it hangs before the eyes of energy like a dark cloud of
                  misery, through which no fugitive can pierce.
               
                  Abe. Honesty compels me to acknowledge that the prejudice against
                  the black man, on account of color, will have to give way; and it will, in time:
                  he must and will become a citizen.
               
                  Jeff. Then you make no difference between antislavery men; their
                  disputes are but a question of time!
               
                  Abe. E-x-a-c-t-l-y! There is, however, another view of the subject:
                  some anti-slavery men are for sending them out of the country, or forming a
                  government for them somewhere on the continent.
               
                  Jeff. To send them out of the country! There is not one in fifty
                  that would be willing to go; besides, if sent to themselves, they would come to no
                  good; and, if governed by a portion of the whites, they would be little better
                  still than slaves. As to settling them on the continent—to make a nation within a
                  nation—first, it would be gross injustice to deprive any portion of the white race
                  of their territory for that or any other purpose; secondly, the black nation would
                  be but the slave of the white. What you condemn in individuals, you would
                  inaugurate in nations. What is the difference?
               
                  Abe. You talk very fairly. But slavery can not be justified; it is
                  wrong in nature; man is not a beast. God gave man dominion over all the beasts of
                  the fields; the fishes in the sea; the fowls in the air; but to man over man he
                  gave no dominion.
               
                  Jeff. You would make heaven on earth. I fear it is a dangerous
                  experiment. As to your quotation from the Bible, I will satisfy you with the Bible
                  before we get through.
               
                  Abe. No, I would not do so; but I would have man to follow the
                  course marked out for him by the God of the Universe.
               
                  Jeff. Your doctrine would bring all people under one government.
                  Would you separate Church and State?
               
                  Abe. We will speak of that at another time; for the present, I am
                  more concerned for the Missourians. They will get into trouble in Kansas. I had
                  rather see this business settled peaceably.
               
                  Jeff. I have much to say upon the subject yet, and hope that you
                  will seriously reflect upon it.

               ON a hot and dusty day in August, Colonel S—— called at a certain house in Kansas
                  for a drink of water. A pitcher of water was handed him by a girl some ten years
                  of age.
               Kind reader! behold a thirsty man, with a pitcher of cold water in one hand, the
                  other resting upon a rail of the fence, gazing, with that intensity of look with
                  which the serpent charms the bird, upon a meek, half-grown woman, and you see
                  Colonel S—— looking at Cora. Five years had fled since he beheld that beautiful
                  child, and, as unexpected as an angel from heaven, she stood before him, in all
                  the simplicity of her beauty. Could he be mistaken? The outlines of those ruby
                  lips, upon which he had impressed thousands of kisses, were there; the long, black
                  lashes that shaded those crystal blue eyes, which had so often looked upon him
                  with childish love, were there; the same golden ringlets, that time had lengthened
                  and care improved, clustered round the face of the beautiful maiden. Colonel S——
                  trembled. Cora, unconscious of the earnest gaze of her father, modestly traced the
                  hem of her apron with one hand, while with the other she plucked the blushing
                  blossoms from a rose-bush that stood by the yard-fence. She started with surprise
                  when the Colonel asked her name.
               "My name is Cora, but they call me Betty," she modestly replied.
               When prudence masters passion, when all the elements of our nature submit to will,
                  it is then the great monitor of the mind is revealed: it is then we are reminded
                  of the doctrine of the great Teacher, "What will it profit a man to gain the whole
                  world, and lose his own soul?"
               Colonel S—— knew the danger of making him self known at the time, even to his own
                  child. How she had been taken there—the disposition of those people toward
                  her—what idea she had of her parents and home—were all questions to be approached
                  with great caution and delicacy. But, fully satisfied that this lovely maiden was
                  his Cora, he could not refrain from asking a few more questions, and the following
                  conversation ensued:
               "Does your father live here?"
               "No, sir; my father is dead, and my mother, too."
               "Where did they formerly live?"
               "In Missouri; a long way from here."
               "How long have you lived here?"
               "Ever since my father and mother were killed."
               "Who killed your father and mother?"
               "Snake-sheed and Dart-feather."
               "And who brought you here?"
               "Snake-sheed and Dart-feather."
               
               "Where did they get you?"
               "They killed Dixie, and went home and killed father and mother, and were going to
                  kill me, and then they brought me here."
               Cora's bosom was heaving, and her eyes were full. The Colonel saw that it would
                  not do to prolong the conversation, and he only added: "Do they treat you well at
                  this home?" and Cora replied, "Not very."
               The Colonel turned to join his party with a joyful, but, at the same time, a heavy
                  heart. The election was the next day, and they had thirty miles to travel.
               The Colonel's party had murmured, one to another, like the apostles of Jesus: "Why
                  talks he with the woman?" The Colonel had said, in his heart: "I have a well of
                  water, springing up into eternal life." But he kept his own counsel.
               And off the party dashed away for the precinct.
               Cora returned to her silent work, brooding over the mysterious conduct of the
                  stranger. She had grown old enough to realize the fact that people do not always
                  tell the truth; and it perhaps entered her mind, for the first time, that her
                  parents still lived. For long and weary hours she pondered over the actions of
                  Snake-sheed and Dart-feather; she called to mind all she had ever heard of the
                  Indian character; and she half knew her father; but why he had so unceremoniously
                  left, she could not divine: but her mind was opened to a new train of
                  reflections.
               Colonel S—— and party had accomplished their mission in Kansas, which was to vote
                  at a certain election. On the return home, many of the party could not be
                  detained. The Colonel, taking into his confidence Burtice, of California
                  notoriety, and a few other friends, determined to remain a few days in the
                  neighborhood of Cora's Kansas home, and take her back to Missouri; for law was a
                  thing talked of at this time in Kansas, but seldom put in force, excepting the law
                  of power. Certain citizens of that virgin soil bore a deadly hatred to all
                  Missourians; and it was evident that Cora was dwelling with one of that class.
                  Burtice was selected by the party as the most suitable person to go to the place
                  of Cora's residence, in disguise, and ascertain how matters stood.
               It was evening, and the sun was down, as Burtice approached a hewed-log house that
                  stood in a skirt of timber not far from the waters of Owl Creek. When met at the
                  door, by a tall and bony man, he made application to remain with him over night;
                  being refused, he insisted, complaining of being very tired. His external
                  appearance was that of a New Englander, and the Major took Burtice for one of his
                  own countrymen; so he finally consented to keep him all night.
               "I guess this is a fine country for keows," said Burtice, as the Major welcomed
                  him to a seat. Burtice played off upon the Major entirely to his satisfaction,
                  with the exception of one thing—he could get no interview with Cora. So he
                  returned to the Colonel with the following information:
               
               That two Indians had brought the child there some five years previous, and openly
                  acknowledged that they had stolen her from Missouri; that the Major had coaxed the
                  child away from them; that he sent her to school, and was much attached to her,
                  and said he would not give her up, even to her own father, were he to come; and
                  that the Major believed the story of the Indians, as above related by Cora, or
                  pretended to believe it; that Cora was attached to some of the Major's family, was
                  evident to Burtice.
               "A private interview must be had with Cora," said the Colonel, firmly.
               Burtice said he had not been upon a fool's errand; that he had left his watch in
                  the room where he slept, designedly; that he would return some time the same day
                  for its recovery, at which time he hoped that a more favorable opportunity would
                  present itself for an interview with Cora.
               The watch was returned to Burtice by the hand of Cora: he whispered in her ear,
                  "Dixie," and the name of her mother, and that he desired a private interview with
                  her. He obtained it before he left the premises, by an artful arrangement of
                  Cora.
               Burtice left, assuring Cora that he would be at the end of a certain lane that
                  night, at a certain hour, to meet her. Cora returned to her occupation and to her
                  reflections. O God! could this be a dream, or was it reality? How strange it all
                  seemed! Busy thoughts crowded each other out of Cora's brain, until night arrived,
                  and with night the crisis.
               It was dark, and Cora trembled. Silently and unseen, she prayed to God to direct
                  her. When she raised up from her prayer, she said, mentally, "My mother taught me
                  how to pray so, long ago. I will see her, if she is alive, though it cost me my
                  life." And she sped to the end of the lane.
               "God bless you!" said Burtice, as he threw her on his horse, and galloped to the
                  Colonel's party.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VIII.
               
                  
                     
                        The memories of childhood, and young dreams of age,
                        Are twin-sister flowers in the mind of the sage.
                     
                  
               
               TWO years prior to the visit of our voting party to Kansas, Burtice had returned
                  from California. He had made some money, and was now settled on a farm in
                  Missouri, the father of a small family, the owner of a few slaves, and much
                  interested in making Kansas a slave State; said he would make a hundred trips to
                  Kansas, and vote every time, if, by so doing, that would give a start to the
                  pro-slavery men of Kansas. He said: "Get the institution once planted, and the
                  Northerners would not emigrate to the territory, as they abhorred a slave State
                  like the devil does holy water. They are raised to believe that there is something
                  in slavery repugnant to republicanism; they think a slaveholder is an aristocrat,
                  in favor of an aristocracy, with no sympathy for the laboring class. Poor victims
                  of mistake! If you can get one of them to live in a slave State, you will change
                  him as certain as a tadpole turns to a frog. I once knew a young man by the name
                  of Fox, who wedded a lady in a slave State, himself having been born and bred in a
                  free State. By the union he became the owner of a few slaves. He at first said
                  that he didn't like the 'Union as it was;' that he preferred a union
                  of his own, and proposed to set the slaves free. But as this created some strife
                  in the household, he consented to try the 'Union as it was.' It was
                  the custom in that neighborhood to hire out negroes on the first day of January.
                  In all slave communities some of the slaves have to be hired out, their owners not
                  being in a situation to want their labor. 'Please God, massa, I no want to live
                  dis year wid Mister Fox,' was the universal cry of the negroes that had to be
                  hired out. Besides, we have Illinois on the east, Iowa on the north, and to have
                  Kansas on the west, Missouri will be like a dry stick poked into a hot
                  furnace."
               By such reflections, the pro-slavery men of Missouri resorted to extraordinary
                  means to defeat the Free-State men of Kansas.
               Burtice had traveled much, and read some; and hear him a little further
                  soliloquize upon the peculiar institution:
               "Who are the wise men of the earth that would take God's work in hand, 
                     
                        "And make us live as angels do,
                        And fatten on the desert air;
                        Would banish vice of every hue,
                        And leave us still just as we are?
                     
                  
               
               "There is no joy of life without labor, and a very large portion of the human family can not live
                  without labor; and he who thinks labor is a great hardship is much mistaken. It is
                  only the lazy man, and one who is not used to labor, that thinks it a hardship;
                  and to him it may be. But to labor is the design of nature, and nature's God. If
                  you say that some labor, and others reap the benefit—let us see. Take the head of
                  a large family, who, perhaps, is not taking hold of labor with his own hands, but
                  is diligently looking after the labor of his family, who, it is said, labor for
                  him. Observe the careworn countenance; the restless and wakeful slumber; the
                  watchful and diligent eye; the nice and close calculations to make the production
                  of the labor of his family meet their necessities. And then observe the laborers
                  of his family: mark the gleeful laugh, the joyful countenance, and the sweet
                  repose; and then tell me that the father of that family enjoys more than they the
                  fruits of their labor, and you had as well say 
                     
                        "A mountain moved without a cause,
                        Or Nature changed against her laws;
                        A blind man sees without his eyes,
                        And this at last is no surprise.
                     
                  
               
               "The negro slave is one of his master's family; he never becomes of age, or free
                  to do and manage for himself; he is always a minor, and under the care and
                  protection of his master; he is ever joyful and contented, being fully aware that
                  he is a minor and never becomes of age; the responsibilities of manhood never
                  enter his brain; and he lives that joyful life of childhood to which the worn-out
                  man can turn, in his imagination, and say: 
                     
                        "I am wand'ring back to the days of my childhood—
                        The mill, the pasture, and deep-tangled wildwood;
                        The orchard, the cellar, and apple that mellows,
                        The sound of the horn, and laugh of my fellows.
                        The morning's brief meal, and refreshments at noon,
                        The stroll in the wood by the light of the moon;
                        The bath in the river, and fisherman's line,
                        The herding of cattle, and feeding of swine.
                        The morning in the field, the song of the lark,
                        The evening at the cot, the play at the park;
                        The long nights of winter, and games of the season,
                        The fine flow of spirits ne'er tainted with treason.
                        The bright days of summer joyfully seen,
                        The rove through the garden of flowers serene;
                        The blossoms of spring, and leaves of the fall,
                        The sound of the voice of a playmate's call;
                        The memories of childhood and young dreams of age
                        Are twin-sister flowers in the mind of the sage.
                        O sweet path of childhood, flowers of the past!
                        I traverse thee in dreams, and hug thee so fast!
                        When day opens eyes, and morning lays cold,
                        The gray hairs of age, and sorrows of old,
                        I would go back to slumber, live o'er again
                        The joys of my youth, forgetting the pain
                        Of age, sorrow, perplexities, and strife,
                        That shade and darken the last end of life.
                     
                  
               
               "I hold the doctrine that he who is not a free man and a citizen is a minor of the
                  State, and ought to have some responsible person held accountable for his actions.
                  This will be conceded by every true statesman. And he who will not consent to
                  recognize the negro as a minor must admit him as a citizen. As Fanny Fern says, 'That tells the
                  whole story.'
               "When I was wounded and reported killed, in California, and unfortunately
                  separated from my friends, without money, and almost dead from loss of blood, I
                  was only able to crawl to an old cabin, in an out of-the-way place, the sole
                  mistress of which was an old negro woman. She had been a slave in early life—in
                  fact, nearly all her life; had been taken to California by her owners, and,
                  through the vicissitudes of the early struggles there, had been left all alone.
                  She made her living by washing for the emigrants or gold-hunters. In this hour of
                  darkness and desolation she was my only surgeon and nurse. I shall never forget
                  the kind attentions of that old creature. She told me that for forty years, on her
                  old master's plantation, she had done nothing but nurse the sick; and, perhaps, to
                  that experience alone I am indebted for my life. She said that the raw Africans,
                  several of whom had been brought upon her master's plantation, were universally
                  held in contempt by the negroes as being altogether inferior to the negroes of
                  this country. In fact, the many stories that she told me of their inclination to
                  barbarism, which are not fit to appear in these pages, convinced me that the
                  portion of the African race now in this country are infinitely better off than
                  their original ancestors, or that portion of the race now in their native
                  land.
               "Yet I am not an advocate of the slave-trade; not because I think it would be a
                  hardship upon the African, or that it is morally wrong, but that it is an injury
                  and a curse to the white people of this country; a bone of contention between
                  individuals and between States; the apple of discord and the Pandora-box of the
                  State-house; the canker-worm that is gnawing the roots of the tree of Liberty; the
                  raven that is plucking the feathers from the American eagle; the rings of Saturn
                  that eclipse the brilliancy of the Star-spangled Banner; and the fate that is
                  wrenching the scepter from the grasp of the Goddess of Liberty.
               "If we can manage the Africans among us, I am willing to leave the originals to
                  perish in the mire of their native land."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IX.
               MAJOR SIX was the common appellation applied to Cora's Kansas father. It is said
                  he received it by the following circumstances: When a boy at school he was very
                  contentious with his playmates upon all subjects of dispute, and always
                  strenuously contended for the decision of the majority, placing an undue accent on
                  the first two syllables of the word majority; from that circumstance
                  he received the name, among the boys, of the Major. And when quite a young man he
                  had an unfortunate quarrel with a celebrated boxer, who knocked him down six
                  times; and he raised and rushed at his antagonist every time, until they were
                  separated by some friends; and from that day he was called Major Six.
               Individuals and societies seldom choose the names they wear; and characters often
                  change the names of men.
               The flight of Cora did not fully develop itself to him until the next morning. His
                  knowledge of the West and Western men taught him that pursuit was useless; and he
                  gave vent to his fit of anger by swearing destruction to all Missourians. He said
                  that he would take from Missouri a thousand negroes to pay for the loss of
                  Cora.
               And from that day Major Six commenced seeking followers to persecute Missourians;
                  and thus we leave the Major organizing one of the most formidable bands that ever
                  shed the blood of a pro-slavery man in Kansas.
               While we glance at the residence of Colonel S——, we find Cora once more happy in
                  her native home, though changes around that home hung over her childish memory
                  like a dark and dismal cloud. Her mother—that loving mother, the memory of whom
                  nerved her trembling limbs in her late flight from her prison-house in Kansas—had
                  long since been laid in that narrow house that tenants all the dead; and her only
                  solace for that mother was to visit, silently and unseen, the place where they had
                  laid her. Like Mary of old, on the morning of the first day of the week, before it
                  is yet light, she goeth to the sepulcher, and there communes with the God of all
                  the living. And with her own little hands she pressed the crumbling dirt to the
                  roots of a rose-bush in that soil resting so lightly upon the breast of her
                  earthly parent; there she dropped faithful tears, to sink down to the bony fingers
                  of the hand that rested upon her infant brain when her mother last called down
                  Heaven's blessings upon her child. Then again her childish heart was gleeful and
                  merry. How sweet to visit the places of her early and infant sports! The orchard,
                  the pasture, the garden, the rivulet, and
                  the pond, were sources of unbounded delight. But Dixie—ah! poor Dixie—was gone,
                  the nurse and companion of her childhood.
               In those sad hours of the past Cora's mind wandered back to her Kansas home, and
                  her memories of that prison-house were sad, with one exception: there was a ray of
                  light in the dark memories of her Kansas trip. It was her thoughts of Don Partlo,
                  a member of the Major's family, two years her senior. She thought of their strolls
                  in the woods in search of flowers; of the kind and willing hand with which he
                  would help her do her task; of his flowing curls and manly face; of his generous
                  temper and bold daring, for she had never known him to falter when courage and
                  resolution were demanded. And she wondered if fate and fortune, during her
                  pilgrimage in this wide world, would ever permit her once more to see the sweet
                  and lovely face of Don Partlo.
               Cora, at this time, stood on the middle-ground between child and womanhood; in
                  that half-way house where the robe of childhood is consecrated to the memory of
                  the past, and the costume of woman covers the young and ardent heart, beating high
                  with hope; and she loved the youth of Kansas.
               Don Partlo was a boy that Major Six had picked up. As the Major had no children of
                  his own, he was endeavoring to perform the office of father to some one. It was
                  said by some that the father of Don Partlo was a Western trapper, and that he was
                  born among the Indians; it was also said that his nativity was in the East, and
                  that he was brought West by some of the emigrants, from whom he escaped. Be this
                  as it may, it is certain that none but Anglo-Saxon blood coursed through his
                  veins. His attachment to Cora was early formed, and he had rendered her Kansas
                  home a paradise to what it would have been without him; and he said in his heart,
                  "When I am a man I will see her again." And he did see her under the most trying
                  circumstances.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER X.
               ON the margin of a broad and beautiful prairie, surrounded by a grove of young
                  timber, stood the house of Burtice. When I sought relief from solitude, and
                  desired the comfort of invigorating society, I usually visited the house of this
                  man; for it was the resort of numerous friends, who were ever joyous and
                  happy.
               I was surprised one evening, when entering the front room, to find it vacated,
                  save a venerable lady, sitting upon one corner of the hearthstone, busily plying
                  her fingers with some needlework. Upon the other corner lay stretched at full
                  length a huge mastiff. Midway between the two sat an old house-cat, eyeing the
                  mastiff and mistress, and ready to retreat from the first invader.
               I passed through; in the back yard was assembled a large party of men. I soon
                  ascertained that another voting trip to Kansas was in vogue. Having no disposition
                  to engage in the council, I sought the company of two men who were seated closer
                  to the house, when my attention was again called to another conversation between
                  Jeff and Abe. It is as follows:
               
                  Jeff. You have not answered my question of Church and State.
               
                  Abe. Moses, the Hebrew law-giver and man of God, united Church and
                  State; and yet no one can shut their eyes to the fact that numerous bloody wars
                  have grown out of that union. Our fathers, when framing this government, thought
                  it best to separate them. I would not lay a Vandal hand upon the Constitution.
               
                  Jeff. Then there must be two revolutions. After the negro is made a
                  free man, and the right of citizenship conferred upon him, what will be his
                  position in the Church? How would you like for one of your daughters to take a
                  seat in church by the side of a big buck nigger?
               
                  Abe. A change of fashions sometimes strikes the eye very harshly:
                  that is a matter of taste and fashion. How would you like for your daughter to
                  take a seat in church by the side of a big greasy white man? I know that you would
                  not like to associate your children with the mean and low; but the white man who
                  is not decent is inexcusable—the negro has now the excuse of being a slave; and as
                  to the fashions of the day, I never expect to see them expelled from the church,
                  or elsewhere. We must not confound the spirit with the body: though one may be low
                  in this life, he may be high in the life to come.
               
                  Jeff. You do not exactly understand me. Will it not take a revolution to admit the negro to all
                  the privileges of the Church?
               
                  Abe. I can not see that it would.
               
                  Jeff. Before we get through, I will give you some very strong proofs
                  that the negro is not the equal of the fathers of the Church, spiritually
                  considered.
               
                  Abe. I would like to see the evidence, and will patiently await your
                  convenience, and let you show me, at this time, what right one man has to property
                  in another—to own him like a beast.
               
                  Jeff. You look at one side of the question only: the master has no
                  more property in the slave than the slave has in the master—the master being
                  entitled to the labor of the slave, and the slave to the care of the master. These
                  are absolute titles, one as much so as the other. The slave is bound to the master
                  for his labor, if he is able to perform it; the master is bound to the slave for
                  his care, whether he receives the labor or not. If the slave fall sick, or is
                  crippled for life, no portion of the master's care is removed; it is the absolute
                  property of the slave; he demands it; the laws of his country give it to him; and,
                  in some cases, it is demonstrated that the slave has a more valuable property in
                  his master than his master has in him. Your comparison of the slave to a beast is
                  incorrect. If the master's horse fall lame, and is a cripple for life, he shoots
                  him to save his fodder. Not so with the slave: he is bound to protect him; that
                  protection is the slave's property, and he dare not touch it. Even after the slave
                  is dead, the law protects his last right of property in his master, to lay him
                  decently in the grave.
               
                  Abe. Well, that is something, I confess, upon which I never strictly
                  thought before. But this much I say: if the property of the master is no more
                  absolute than the property of the slave, it is, at least, a little more
                  respectable.
               
                  Jeff. Of course; the white man, being the superior race, is entitled
                  to the superior position. Besides, to reverse the position would be like turning a
                  cart upside down: the bed would not carry the wheels with the same facility that
                  the wheels carry the bed.
               
                  Abe. That is a beautiful illustration, but, according to your
                  doctrine, all superior races should hold dominion over all inferior ones; superior
                  minds over inferior ones. What has become of your democracy?
               
                  Jeff. I have not said that all superior races should domineer over
                  all inferior ones, nor that superior minds should domineer over inferior ones; far
                  from it. That the minds of some men are superior to others, even of the same race,
                  no one will deny; but that such should domineer over others is far from the truth.
                  All wise men should make the best use of the talents God has given them, for the
                  benefit and comfort of the whole race. A truly wise man is meek and lowly of
                  heart.
               
                  Abe. Yet you affirm that the white race should hold dominion over
                  the black in this country. Have you any other excuse than that the whites are the
                  superior race? If there is any other excuse for slavery, I would like to hear it. You sweep the
                  whole black race with the club of inferiority, put the whites over them, and then
                  assert, in the next breath, that the superior should not domineer over the
                  inferior. This is strange logic. Where is the right of the white man over the
                  black? I would like to see it in a more distinct light. If I am in error, may God
                  direct me to the right!
               
                  Jeff. I will offer no better right, at present, than that of a
                  long-established custom, and the apparent necessity that the races should live
                  together, which would be impossible only with their present relations, the
                  slaveholders themselves not being accountable for those relations. About two
                  hundred and forty years ago "a Dutch vessel arrived at Jamestown, Virginia, with
                  twenty Africans, and offered them for sale as slaves. They were purchased by the
                  people. These were the first slaves brought into the country: and thus was laid
                  the foundation of that system of slavery which now exists in the United States.
                  The majority of the people of Virginia were for a long time opposed to slavery,
                  and laws were passed to prevent it; but the selfish policy of the kings and
                  proprietors in England encouraged the introduction of slaves, and the evil could
                  not be resisted by the colonist." Thus a wrong—if it be a wrong—was forced upon
                  our ancestors. An attempt now to rectify it would do more harm than good.
               
                  Abe. In quoting the history of Virginia, why not quote that other
                  passage, which says: "The colony hitherto consisted almost entirely of men who
                  came for the purpose of acquiring wealth, and who intended again to return to
                  England. But, in order to attach them more to the soil, and to induce them to
                  regard this as their home, in 1620 the Company seat over ninety girls to be
                  disposed of among the young planters for wives. At first the price of a wife was
                  one hundred pounds of tobacco; but the demand for them increased so much that it
                  soon rose to one hundred and sixty pounds." And this is the same year that they
                  sold them the negroes. Who would now think of offering tobacco for a wife? That
                  part of the barbarism has passed away: why do you wish to retain the other?
               
                  Jeff. Had the system of slavery passed away as easily and as early
                  as the sale of wives, we would not now be discussing it. The one hundred pounds of
                  tobacco was probably required to pay the passage of a girl. The sale of a wife is
                  contrary to all civilization: the sale of a slave is a different sort of
                  contract.
               
                  Abe. He that would purchase a slave is, in my opinion, at best, but
                  partly civilized. The purchase and sale of wives and slaves are the relics of
                  barbarism. One has been abandoned by all civilized countries; the other will
                  be.
               
                  Jeff. Time and circumstances change things; for, while the price of
                  slaves has very much advanced, instead of selling our daughters, we have to
                  provide a pretty good fortune to get them off our hands. But I see the men are
                  coming in. We will speak further upon this subject at another time.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XI.
               
                  
                     PRIDE may ride upon the golden wheels of Fortune; titles wear the livery of
                        Fame; and Eloquence stir the waters of the river of Time, while Virtue
                        leaneth upon her staff, bidding defiance to the invader.
                  
               
               IN the city of P—— there flourished a female academy, under the immediate care of
                  Mr. ——. Colonel S—— made the necessary arrangements for placing Cora with a family
                  in that city, to attend what he termed boarding-school. Previously, Cora had only
                  attended, for a short time, a small country school of little children; boys and
                  girls all mixing, without distinction of sex. When Cora received the information
                  that she was to attend the academy, she lost no time in making every necessary
                  preparation. She remembered the innocent plays of her childhood with the little
                  girls of Kansas; and she thought that to be associated with so many large girls of
                  her own age would be very nice. That she would be behind them in letters, she much
                  feared; but she hoped to make up for that deficiency with kind and lady-like
                  behavior.
               Thus her mind was occupied while she made all haste to regulate her wardrobe. The
                  morning of her departure at last came. She turned back, with one long, lingering
                  look, as the shades of her father's house disappeard from her view; she thought of
                  the shade-trees, and all their endearments; and, in taking leave of the scenes of
                  her childhood, her mind wandered to the grave of her mother. She buried her face
                  in her hands.
               The coach-driver gently drew the reins of his horses, as though he would have them
                  tread lightly upon the road, as he said, secretly, "Cora is praying."
               The morning of the first day of the school Cora made many new acquaintances, and
                  passed through the ordeal of her lessons with great satisfaction to herself. She
                  saw that application would soon put her at the head of her class, and she was
                  highly animated.
               The girls were all very clever. Evening came, and the labors of the day were over.
                  Cora was gratified with an invitation to spend the early part of the night at the
                  room of little "Sis"—a fancy name in vogue for one of the most brilliant girls in
                  the school—where, it was said, several of the young ladies would meet and have a
                  nice time. Cora attended with a joyful heart, and entered freely into the plays
                  and conversation. But she was soon thrown on the reserve. The girls romped and
                  talked until Cora hung her head in very shame. Cora had passed
                  the usual age at which youth and innocence shake hands and bid each other an
                  eternal farewell; but seclusion, the lack
                  of association, and her own modest temper, had kept her in the innocent path of
                  childhood. The girls with whom she was now associated had reached that point in
                  female education which teaches that it is no harm for one woman to talk to
                  another.
               When Cora was alone in her own apartment, she mentally said, as the language of
                  the girls still echoed through her mind, "Those girls have live
                     mothers."
               That night Cora formed a determination to attend strictly to her studies, and
                  leave the girls to romp without her company. Little Sis profited by her example,
                  and, at the close of the session, those two young ladies were robed with the
                  highest honors of the school.
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               
                  
                     
                        DEATH! ah, fatal Death! thou pale-faced ghost!
                        Loathsome neighbor, unwelcome visitor,
                        And indiscriminate butcher of all!
                        Tread softly in thine ancient path, lest thy
                        Tools grow dull, and, weary of thine own trade,
                        Thou invoke the gods for a holiday.
                     
                  
               
               NEAR the waters of Owl Creek, in the territory of Kansas, lived Hawkeye. He had
                  for many years been a trapper on the Upper Missouri; and, from a bloody skirmish
                  he once had with an Indian of that name, he received the appellation, by which he
                  was ever afterward called. Of late he concluded to try the pleasures of domestic
                  life. His wife was the niece of Burtice. Being naturally fond of seclusion and
                  wild scenery, he settled upon the wide-spread fields of Owl Creek, and commenced
                  the cultivation of the soil. He was the father of two little girls, Rosa and
                  Dolla; and lived in a neat cabin of his own erection, and was providing almost
                  entirely for the wants of his family upon his own premises. Besides a small herd
                  of cattle and swine, he had two horses, Big-bobtail Sorrel and Little bobtail
                  Sorrel, of which the whole family were very fond. They were tied up every night close to the cabin, for as yet he had no
                  stable.
               Rosa, being the eldest, would carry the corn for Big-bobtail, and Dolla would
                  carry it for Little-bobtail. The two children and mother claimed Little bobtail,
                  for he was gentle and kind—they all could ride him without fear. Big-bobtail would
                  snort and paw; and little Dolla said he was a bad horse, and that papa might have
                  him. Hawkeye always rode the Big-bobtail; and the little girls, when they would be
                  anxiously looking for the return of their father, would closely watch the pranks
                  and maneuvering of Little-bobtail. He would neigh, paw, and stick his ears forward
                  whenever his keen, animal sagacity or instinct detected, in the distance, the
                  sound of the hoof of his returning companion.
               Late one evening in the twilight, little Dolla came running in, clapping her tiny
                  hands, saying, "Mamma, papa is coming, for Little-bobtail is pawing and pointing
                  his ears up the road;" and she ran and called Rosa to get the corn. In a few
                  moments Hawkeye was securing his horses and kissing his children. That night, when
                  Hawkeye took his seat at the board of his little family, his faithful wife
                  discovered that the brave brow of her husband was slightly darkened, and, with an
                  imploring look, said, "What is the matter?" Hawkeye replied, "This infernal negro
                  question will ruin us yet." The mother of his two little babes was silent; the
                  dread of some calamity had taken possession of her soul, and she could not reply,
                  but said, mentally: "We have no negroes—may never have any; why meddle with the
                  subject? I wish my husband was a wooden man, upon whom the designs of the
                  Pro-slavery and Anti-slavery parties could take no effect; then we might live in
                  security, for I feel that nothing else could disturb us."
               Hawkeye was a violent pro-slavery man, and one that the Anti-slavery party much
                  feared; for all agreed that, when excited, he was a desperate man. They said,
                  "Make the old trapper*
                  mad, and he would shoot a man as quick as he would a wolf."
                     
                     *Hawkeye, though an old trapper, was a man of middle age.
                  
               The cock had announced the middle of the night; Rosa and Dolla were nestled in
                  each other's arms; Hawkeye breathed heavily, as though he was disturbed in his
                  sleep. The vigilant ear of Mary, his loving wife, detected some uncommon sound.
                  She crept to the window, and saw horses standing around the house, and men busily
                  engaged harnessing Big and Little-bobtail Sorrels. She hesitated; then said, "O my
                  God! robbers are upon us!" Hawkeye bounced up and seized his gun, and Mary clasped
                  the little children in her arms. At this moment the door was opened; Hawkeye saw
                  he was overpowered, and threw down his gun.
               One of the men said, addressing himself to Hawkeye, "You are my prisoner."
               Hawkeye demanded, "By what authority?"
               "By the authority of Major Six, sir," responded the would-be officer.
               
               Hawkeye was disarmed. The premises having been searched for ammunition, the party
                  started off, taking Hawkeye and his two horses.
               Little Dolla pulled the skirt of her mother's dress, saying, "Mamma, where are
                  they taking papa?"
               "Hush!" whispered Rosa; "mamma is praying."
               The sun rose next morning upon the pale face of Hawkeye; the blood that had
                  coursed through his veins with such wanton vigor was now sinking in the soil of a
                  wide and desolate prairie.
               We have seen the gathering of men at the house of Burtice. About this time that
                  expedition arrived in the neighborhood of Owl Creek. They had been to the polls
                  and voted, and hearing of the fate of Hawkeye, determined to have revenge.
               Burtice provided a party to conduct his niece and her little ones to Missouri,
                  after getting all the information they possessed concerning the party that took
                  Hawkeye, which, of course, was very meager, as the men were only seen in the
                  night, and a dark night, too. But they had taken the horses—a minute description
                  of which was obtained.
               The party in charge of Mary started for Missouri. Burtice, with fifteen select
                  men, remained on the scout in the territory.
               Burtice returned the next week to Missouri with Hawkeye's Big-bobtail Sorrel
                  horse. Some citizens of Kansas found two men, near the margin of Owl Creek,
                  hanging silently, between heaven and earth, to the limb of a tree. The ravens had
                  picked out their eyes.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               "IF it feeds nothing else, it will feed my revenge. Has not an anti-slavery man a
                  heart, sympathies, hopes, human desires, and moral obligations, as other men have?
                  Has he not a right to wish for, to hope for, to pray for, the greatest bonds of
                  freedom? Has he not a right to feel for, to love, and to cherish, the human race?
                  Is his heart made of stone, and his ears of brass, that the wailing sound of his
                  fellow-man should be shut out from his soul?
               "No! he has a mind, a heart, and an arm to raise on the side of the oppressed, and
                  against the oppressors and those who favor them. The pro-slavery men of our own
                  territory hinder us of half our strength. They feed the Missourians, eavesdrop our
                  conversations, set out baits to catch our men, and, if they hang them not, they
                  favor it.
               "We will give some of them a few lessons, and the balance will flee the territory,
                  and anti-slavery men will not be found hanging to trees for the ravens to pick. If
                  it feeds nothing else, it will feed my revenge."
               
               Thus whispered Major Six, in his secret thoughts, late one afternoon, as he
                  approached the house of a friend, with whom he wished to counsel concerning the
                  character of some men who lived at Timber Point. On the southern bank of a deep
                  and muddy ravine, a few acres of timber had been cleared away, in the edge of
                  which, and near the creek, stood an old log house. It had been built many years
                  since by the Indians, but was now the residence of a neighbor and close friend of
                  Major Six, by the name of Dutch Bob.
               The sun silently sunk in the west, leaving the last traces of his glory mantling,
                  with the shades of twilight, Major Six and his friend, as they held the following
                  conversation:
               
                  Major Six. I believe, if Ned should get any in formation of our
                  intentions, he would let the cat out of the bag. He sees those men, you know,
                  every day, at Timber Point; says that he was born and raised in Kentucky; is very
                  loud-mouthed for our party; but, may he not be a wolf in sheep's clothing? I tell
                  you he must not be trusted; at least, not without some further investigation.
               
                  Bob. Well, as to his having been born and bred in a slave State, it
                  is a well-known fact, when a citizen of a slave State takes a turn against
                  slavery, they are the worst in all the deck. And, also, when a man born and bred
                  in a free State takes up with pro-slavery men and their "institution," as they
                  call it, they are worse, and a great deal worse, than a man born and bred among
                  slavery.
               
                  Major Six. I know all of that. But Ned lives close to those men, and
                  I suspect him because they have not beaten him off. I tell you, Bob, "Birds of a
                  feather will flock together."
               
                  Bob. Ned has a very fine place; it is one of the most desirable in
                  the territory. That, I think, is the reason he does not leave the
                  neighborhood.
               
                  Major Six. I fear him. He must be taken by some stratagem and
                  carried away from home, or he must share the fate of those with whom he lives.
               The Major rose to take his leave. "I will arrange that," whispered Bob, and he
                  squeezed his hand.
               As the western hemisphere blindfolded the eye of day, the shades of night fell
                  between the two.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIV.
               "THE times are getting p-r-e-c-a-r-i-o-u-s! It is no use to argue this subject any
                  longer. The pro-slavery men are unrelenting and vicious; they have no respect for
                  a man's sympathies, or his kindness of heart. What they lack in argument they try
                  to carry by force. A man had as well be convicted of horse-stealing as accused of
                  abolitionism, in their community. With them it is the unpardonable sin; one for
                  which there is no redemption in this world, or the world to come. You may take
                  their horses, burn their houses, kill their sons, and they say you are a robber
                  and a murderer; but, if you touch their negroes, they say you are an
                     Abolitionist, which is equivalent to saying you are an imp of the
                  Devil, let loose from the bottomless pit to terrify and enslave mankind. But get
                  into an argument with them on the peculiar institution, and they will say
                  something about lowering the white man, raising the black, and striking a level
                  between the two on the yellow; or some other such nonsense."
               Thus Abe was speculating, in his own mind, as the slender form of his neighbor
                  darkened his door.
               "Good morning, friend Jeff! I suppose you have heard the news," said Abe, as he
                  politely offered his neighbor a seat.
               
                  Jeff. Yes, I have heard the news, and sorry I was to hear it. The
                  boys have got at it, at last, and I fear the consequences.
               
                  Abe. And so do I But you and I will not engage in the fight; let us
                  take the storm coolly. Is any body hurt?
               
               
                  Jeff. Yes; Hawkeye is killed—murdered in cold blood—and his widow is
                  with us. What Burtice has done I know not, but I know the man.
               
                  Abe. Where will all this end? "A house divided against itself can
                  not stand. I believe this Union can not endure, permanently, half free and half
                  slave. I do not expect the Union will be dissolved; I do not expect the house to
                  fall; but, I do expect it to cease to be divided. It will all become one thing, or
                  all the other."
               
                  Jeff. Before that takes place the hills will echo with the sound of
                  cannon, the valleys will be desolated, and the rivers run with blood.
               
                  Abe. "I have said a hundred times—and have no desire to take it
                  back—that I believe the Free-State men have no right to go into the slave States
                  and interfere with them at all." I believe in working this thing out in a
                  peaceable way, and according to the Constitution of the United States as our
                  fathers made it.
               
               
                  Jeff. The Constitution guarantees to every State the right to
                  regulate its own internal affairs.
               
                  Abe. The Constitution has been amended, and can be again.
               
                  Jeff. Yes; could be amended, until it would cease to be the same
                  document.
               
                  Abe. Still it would be under the rule of the same majority
                  government.
               
                  Jeff. That rule, though it would not violate the letter, would
                  violate the spirit of the Constitution. I know that you might, by getting a
                  constitutional majority of Free-State men into Congress, amend the Constitution;
                  and, if ratified by three-fourths of the States, you could thus blot out State
                  legislatures, and have uniformity of laws. The house would cease to be divided;
                  but where would be the spirit of the Constitution? Gone, and gone forever! You
                  would have a Union; you would have uniformity of laws. It would not be the uniform
                  of liberty, but of despotism. Our fathers knew, when they framed the Constitution,
                  that the local laws suited to the lumber hills of Maine were not adapted to the
                  rice-fields of South Carolina. That to preserve the union of the States, they must
                  make it a union of nations, and not consolidate the whole into one nation.
               
                  Abe. I am for sticking to the Constitution as it is plainly printed
                  and understood. I care nothing for your spirits or ghosts of the Constitution; I
                  want the document itself, and purpose to go by it, and on no consideration will
                  break its provisions. If a portion of our people are getting scared at the
                  Constitution, because it can be lawfully amended, I can't help it, or find for
                  them a remedy; they must take the consequences.
               
                  Jeff. The consequences fall upon the whole nation; none can escape
                  them.
               
                  Abe. "Suppose the disaffected go to war: they can not fight always;
                  they must make peace—can not friends adjust difficulties better than enemies?—and
                  the same difficulties will still stare them in the face."
               
                  Jeff. Yes; and so long as the Free-State people interfere with
                  slavery—even in an indirect manner—the same difficulties will stare the nation in
                  the face. It is not the slave-driver alone that receives the benefit of slave
                  labor; it is not this nation alone, but the whole civilized world. Destroy slave
                  labor in the Southern States, and you destroy half the prosperity of the nation;
                  and the blow is felt throughout the civilized world. You, in the free States, buy
                  a garment for one dollar. Destroy slave labor, and for the same garment you would
                  have to pay two dollars.
               
                  Abe. Yes; but if we are willing to pay the two dollars to liberate
                  the slave?
               
                  Jeff. Then you would pay your money to do the slave a great
                  harm.
               
                  Abe. You pro-slavery men won't agree to any thing; there is no
                  reason in you.
               
               
                  Jeff. Yes, we will. We will agree to let you alone, if you will let
                  us alone.
               
                  Abe. Yes; but the Constitution! We must stick to that.
               
                  Jeff. Good morning; I must be going.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               "NO! I am not mad. Would to heaven I were! Then the cherished memories of the past
                  would not chase each other through my brain, and wreck upon the center rock the
                  ark of all my hopes. O, the flowers of my childhood, my school-girl days, and
                  early married life! How I have watched and tended, with a loving hand, half
                  covered with your sweet perfumes, and ripe ye stood to strew a mortal path! Ah! a
                  frost—a killing frost—that came between the setting and the rising sun, to nip,
                  with such a bitter tooth, the morning of my dream, and leave poor me to winter and
                  to widowhood!"
               And Mary Hawkeye was aroused from her reverie by the sudden appearance of Rosa and
                  Dolla, clapping their little hands, and exclaiming, "Mamma, uncle is coming, with
                  Big-bobtail Sorrel!"
               "No, uncle," said Mary; "I will sell the horse. Every thing that was my husband's
                  is dear to me; but necessity, that tyrant of our being, will cause me to part with
                  many things that I would delight to keep."
               
               And Mary looked at Rosa and Dolla; something whispered in her heart, "I will part
                  with all but you, and the memories of the past."
               Mary's parents resided in a distant State. She married against their will, and was
                  disinherited. She had not seen, or heard from them for five years; and now, should
                  she go back, humbled and incumbered? Such a stroke to her feelings was worse than
                  death. Willingly would she have taken the fearful leap into that dark abode from
                  whence no glimmer of light returns. But Rosa and Dolla, in their innocent and
                  childish plays, with their ringing and merry laugh, like two guardian angels, bear
                  up the sinking spirit of their mother, and rescue the life that gave them
                  life—proving to the dark miser and cold-blooded bachelor, that children are the
                  dewdrops of heaven. How oft have they nerved a puny arm to strike again, and
                  battle through the war of life! How tenderly have they closed the dying eyes of
                  aged and honored heads! How cheerfully have they passed the winter's eve, and
                  early sought the morning's cares! The childless man knows not the sweets of
                  earth.
               Burtice had taken counsel of Mary, with regard to the best domestic arrangements
                  for her future, and departed.
               Mary was busily arranging her household affairs. Rosa and Dolla sat in solemn
                  council in the back yard.
               "I do wish so much that uncle had brought Little-bobtail Sorrel, and left that
                  hateful old horse. I do n't like him, for he won't let us ride," said Dolla,
                  indignantly.
               "Uncle had to bring any one he could get, and he had a hard time to get any," said
                  Rosa, wisely.
               "Why did he have a hard time?" said Dolla, inquiringly.
               "Because the men were hard to catch," said Rosa pointedly.
               "What did uncle do with the man when he catch him?" said Dolla, leaning
                  forward.
               "Hush!" said Rosa, clapping her little hand on Dolla's mouth. "Uncle
                     whispered that to mother."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVI.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           O THAT estates, degrees, and offices
                           Were not derived corruptly! and that clear honor
                           Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
                           How many then should cover that stand bare;
                           How many be commanded that command;
                           How much low peasantry would then be gleaned
                           From the true seed of honor; and how much honor
                           Picked from the chaff and ruin of the times!
                        
                     
                     SHAKSPEARE.
                  
               
               "O FATHER! do not go, and leave your only child to the cold decrees of fate—to
                  while the tedious nights away, and dream of death and solitude; to grope along, by
                  day, the dark and bushy path of cold suspense! This humble favor let me ask; and
                  hazard not your gray and honored head in deadly strife. Let Fate or Fortune's hand
                  sweep away the land, the servants, and the house; but give me my father!" And Cora
                  clung bewitchingly to the neck of Colonel S——, beseeching him not to go to Kansas
                  with what her keen judgment now readily detected as a war party. Cora had just
                  returned from a visit to some of her father's old friends and relatives in the
                  East; had seen some of the folly and cold-heartedness of the world; and her
                  feelings clung to her father and her home with the tenacity of inspiration.
               Judge Traddings was a wealthy and opulent merchant in an Eastern city; was uncle
                  to Cora, by marriage, and the father of two daughters, named, respectively, Nanny
                  and Kate, who had fanned off the flies for seventeen and nineteen summers. They
                  were the belles of the city, riding in a fine carriage, and spending money in
                  reckless profusion. Let us take a peep into the Judge's parlor, and we see Kate,
                  sitting by the window, making a vain endeavor to write poetry in a scrap-book; and
                  hear her murmur, "There is but one step between the sublime and the ridiculous.' I
                  know if my teacher were to see these lines, she would call them ridiculous." She
                  is interrupted by her sister running into the room, exclaiming:
               "Kate! Kate! have you heard the news?"
               "No; what is it?" said Kate, anxiously.
               "Our little country cousin, from the far West, has come to town, and will pay us a
                  call very soon," said Nanny, triumphantly.
               "Mercy! has any one seen her?" said Kate, eagerly.
               "Yes," said Nanny; "old Aunt Keeneye saw her, Sunday, at church."
               "And how was she dressed?"
               "You know aunt is so droll that one can never get any thing out of her concerning
                  costume: yet she can tell you if the hair is red, yellow, auburn, brown or coal-black; or if the eyes are blue,
                  black, gray or cat-like; or any peculiarity of face or form: but I have no faith
                  in any decision she would make of the color of a bow in a bonnet, whether it was
                  purple or scarlet. This much I learned, however: she was dressed in a plain silk,
                  with only four flounces, and wearing a poor, pitiful ten-dollar pin. Just think of
                  that—and in this city!"
               "O cracky, what a wench! and raised in a slave State, and her father driving so
                  many servants (poor creatures!)"—and, turning to her wardrobe, Kate continued:
                  "Just look at these ruffles! I kept Biddy*
                   up last night until twelve o'clock, ironing them, and now they look like a
                  stake-and-ridered fence. I suppose we will have to dress. Do call Biddy to dust
                  this furniture—no odds if dinner is late. I think papa will dine out to-day." And
                  the fastidious Kate was soon lost in a pile of silks and ribbons; while the
                  maid-of-all-work danced round the parlor with her dusting-brush, leaving her
                  dinner to the care of the kitchen and the house-cat.
                     
                     *Biddy, a German servant-girl.
                  
               "What, in the name of all the gods at once, is Cora doing in the kitchen?" said
                  Preston to his better-half, as he walked into the breakfast-room.
               "She is washing out some of her stockings," said the lady, as she drew up her
                  chair to the table, and continued, with a curl of the lip: "I offered her the
                  services of Bridget,*
                   but she steadily and positively refused, saying that she always washed her
                  own stockings; that when she trusted to others, they were never white. I believe
                  she is just trying to wait on herself, in order to make us believe that she is not
                  waited on by the negroes at home; for I heard her say that her father had six
                  negro women. Just think of that, Preston! What on earth would I do with six women
                  about this house, when I can scarcely keep Bridget as busy as she ought to
                  be."
               
                  
                  *Bridget, an Irish servant-girl.
               
               "The field—the field, madam!" said Preston, vehemently; and, as he tossed the
                  coffee into the saucer, he continued: "They work the women in the field,
                  madam—make them hoe, plow, dig, chop—anything that comes in a busy time. The
                  colored women are almost as stout as the men, and sometimes more profitable to the
                  master than the men."
               Aunt Polly threw herself back in her chair, with her eyes slightly turned toward
                  the upper country, like the spirit of Cleopatra beholding the ghost of Antony, and
                  exclaimed: "Good Lord! what barbarians those Southerners are!"
               "Dear," said Preston, when his wife had a little recovered, "there is an important
                  meeting in town to-day, to consider what is best to be done for our friends in
                  Kansas. There is a bold effort being made on the part of pro-slavery men to extend
                  this barbarism into that territory. Have I any clean linen?"
               
               The lady rubbed her hand across her forehead, and hesitatingly said: "I don't
                  believe you have. Bridget was up last night until nearly twelve, clearing up and
                  dusting the rooms. I hadn't thought of your shirts; didn't think you would be
                  going to any place particularly. Why didn't you speak of it, and I would have had
                  it done, if it had kept her up all night. I don't care if she is talking about her
                  pay, and grumbling; she is as big and strong as you are, Mr. Preston, and
                  abundantly able, if she is not willing; and let her go, if she wants to: she can't
                  find a place but what there is work to do, and plenty of it. I know I am
                  particular, and so is every body getting these days. If she'd move her dratted
                  carcass a little faster in the daytime, I would n't keep her up so late o' nights.
                  You shall have a shirt, if I have to iron it myself. And do get ready; you are
                  always late at important meetings. You know, Preston," continued the lady,
                  softening her voice, "that you are considered one of the most liberal members of
                  the Church. Do not think of money, when it is needed for our friends in Kansas. It
                  would be but the penance of Christians, if we had to live on bread and water, so
                  our money is spent to put a stop to barbarism. But watch Mr. Dodge and Mr.
                  Squibble; they are as well-to-do as we are; I would n't pay more than others. Have
                  your eyes open," said the lady, as Preston left the room. She then settled down in
                  her chair, murmuring to herself: "No odds if Bridget don't get her pay right off;
                  she don't know how to spend it any how; money is as good as thrown away that is
                  paid to h-e-r."
               "Nanny, you never did look well without paint; do call Biddy, to bring my painting
                  sponge; you look as white as a gravestone. Hush! did the hall-bell ring?"
               In a few moments Cora was introduced to the Misses Traddings, and spent the
                  evening. Cora was quite confounded by the numerous questions put to her by the
                  young ladies, concerning the West and the colored servants, all of which she
                  endeavored to answer with dignity and truth; but when they asked her if the
                  colored servants dressed her of a morning, she could contain her dignity no
                  longer, and, laughing immoderately, told them that she had dressed many a one of
                     them—little ones—when their mothers would be busy. Cora's
                  conversation with the old man Traddings concerning the West, its broad and
                  beautiful lands—in fact, her intelligent view of our common country; its wide
                  extent, its variety of soil and climate; its adaptation as a home for all races;
                  its wise and beneficent government, as independent States, fraternized upon the
                  basis of equality upon the common center, with the liberty of variation within
                  their own borders. "While each one attends to his own business and disturbs not
                  his neighbors," said Cora, "there is none to make afraid."
               Judge Traddings thought seriously of sending his daughters abroad, that they might
                  lose some of their butterfly pride, and
                  gain a little wholesome understanding.
               Cora had left home to spend a few months in the East, but, hearing of the Kansas
                  troubles, returned home immediately.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               IN the State of Tennessee lived Shilo, a man well-to-do in the world. His eldest
                  children having grown up, and the soil of Tennessee having become somewhat dear,
                  Shilo concluded to emigrate West, where he could get plenty of land, and that
                  cheap.
               Shilo and two of his sons settled at Timber Point, in Kansas Territory, taking
                  claims of land, or preemption rights. Several other slave-State men also settled
                  in the same neighborhood. This was regarded as a pro-slavery settlement.
               Shilo had a personal difficulty with one of Major Six's men, early after his first
                  settlement in the territory, which had been partly arranged, and all seemed to go
                  right. But an old grudge, like a chronic, festering sore, may heal and grow smooth
                  without; within, a secret, subtle, poisonous matter lies close concealed, till
                  some unlucky, wanton lick breaks the skin: then comes forth the poisonous matter,
                  corroding all the flesh.
               Shilo was an extreme pro-slavery man; and, after the commencement of hostilities,
                  the injured Freesoiler soiler found
                  little difficulty in exciting a mob to march against Shilo. By industry and the
                  means Shilo obtained for his farm and a few slaves, in Tennessee, they had all
                  made very comfortable homes in Kansas. They were all great talkers, and banterers
                  of the anti-slavery party, and had formed the acquaintance of many of the leading
                  pro-slavery men of Missouri.
               Timber Point had become a noted place of rendezvous for the Missourians. Shilo was
                  in high hopes of inaugurating slavery in Kansas; was active and efficient in
                  giving course to the political destiny of the day. He was much troubled with night
                  reflections, after recent occurrences in the territory; for his Missouri friends
                  could not save him when they were in their own State.
               One night, when lying snugly in his bed, halfway between the land of dreams and
                  the latitude of real life, the soft and hollow sound of "Halloo!" danced within
                  his ear. Shilo anticipated a call from some pro-slavery friends that night, and
                  was completely off his guard. Leaving his whole family in the sweet embrace of
                  sleep (save his unsuspecting wife, who thought him with friends), he joined the
                  hailing party. His blood ran cold and faltered in his veins, when he was coolly
                  informed, with firearms pointed at his heart, that silence was the price of his
                  life.
               The party marched slowly away with the unwilling man. The pledges given, or the
                  pledges asked; the crime charged; the testimony of the witnesses; the action of
                  the jury and the judge, are not recorded; and no historian has told the story of
                  the execution. The two sons of Shilo escaped the mob, but not without sufficient
                  evidence that they were pursued.
               When daylight tiptoed on the eastern hills, casting a piercing glance through
                  western vales, these men returned to quiet homes, to silence Rumor's tongue, and
                  talk with doubtful men concerning the fate of Kansas.
               Ned had seen Dutch Bob; and, after a long conversation, had come to the conclusion
                  that the territory was not a healthy country, and made preparations to go back to
                  Kentucky.
               The sudden disappearance of Shilo was a sufficient excuse for his two sons to quit
                  the country. Some said they went back to Tennessee; others, that they went to
                  Missouri, and joined Burtice. Be this as it may, the Free-State men began, about
                  this time, to get hold of the reins of the government of Kansas.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               "THIS is the seventh day that I have labored in the harvest field of Shephard,"
                  said Freelabor to his companion in want, as he lay down a small sack of flour upon
                  his door-step. Then, seating himself by its side, and wiping off the sweat from
                  his face with his shirt-sleeve, continued: "About four o'clock this evening the
                  sun came down like a caravan of heated gas from the burning mountain; and four
                  acres of the golden grain waved before us. My hand trembled like an aspen leaf
                  when I attempted to whet my scythe. We all wished to close the harvest, and
                  receive our pay. I thought of you and the little ones. I asked Tom to whet my
                  scythe, while I bathed my face and arms in cold water; and, as the sun left us, we
                  built the last shock in that whole plantation of a field. When we were all
                  gathered in, Shephard very politely informed us that, having failed to negotiate a
                  bill, he could not pay us for a few days. You know I always had a proud spirit. So
                  I took Shephard to one side, that our wants might reach no man's ear but his, and
                  told him that I was not particular; that he might pay me along as it suited; but I
                  was in great need of a little at the present time. And he said he had n't a
                     five-center in the wide world. I hesitated. I looked all over the
                  farm: the stacks of golden grain met my eye in every direction, and I took
                  courage, and told Shephard that my wife and little children had no supper. He said
                  the best he could do was to give me an order to the store. I said to myself, 'any
                  port in a storm;' then told him I would have to take it. I went to the store, and
                  asked Simpson the price of flour: he said I could have this sack (and Freelabor
                  brought his hand down on the bag with a loud slap) for two dollars; and when I
                  presented the order, said he must shave it ten per cent. And thus it
                  is ever: those who save the grain get the least benefit of it."
               While we leave the good woman preparing supper for the tired man and his children,
                  we will turn and listen to one more conversation between Jeff and Abe, who are now
                  at hand, having heard the conversation of Freelabor.
               
                  Abe. Freelabor sometimes meets with hardships; but the man is free
                  to go and labor for one who will pay him more promptly.
               
                  Jeff. That is very true; but still he has no guarantee against
                  disappointment. It is a poor support that any man makes by labor alone; he must
                  handle his wages with care, and bring a portion of them to bear interest, in some
                  shape; must have something laid up for a rainy day, and manage his labor as
                  skillfully as the capitalist manages his capital, or he can not prosper. You had as well prate about free
                  capital as free labor.
               
                  Abe. P-r-e-c-i-s-e-l-y. I would have both free. Capital is free, and
                  so should labor be.
               
                  Jeff. Then, to put the slave laborer on a level with the free
                  laborer, you must give him the same social position; for, if you deny him that,
                  you cripple his capabilities; deny him the means of making a calculator, and his
                  main dependence is, at last, upon his labor. Consequently he must cheapen it upon
                  the better informed.
               
                  Abe. That to free all men would reduce labor, I can not deny; but,
                  at the same time, it would reduce capital in some localities, and some who now
                  live by capital would have to live by labor.
               
                  Jeff. Then you would reduce the wages, by bringing more hands into
                  the field.
               
                  Abe. Yes; but it would give all an equal chance.
               
                  Jeff. That would be right, if all men were equal.
               
                  Abe. There you go off the handle again. You are eternally upon
                  inequality, or frightened at complexion. I admit that men are not equal in every
                  particular, but hold that, in the great essentials, they are the same. When a man
                  is black, is he not a man, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same
                  medicine? If you humble him, will he not fear? If you praise him, will he not
                  hope? If you feed him, will he not rejoice? If you poison him, will he not die,
                  the same as a white man? You must prove to me that he is not, a man, before I can
                  consent that you have the right to hold him as a slave.
               
                  Jeff. There are many strange things in the world. If I have a
                  prejudice against color, you certainly have a prejudice against the word
                     slave. All men are slaves to something. The laboring classes of
                  all countries, or, at least, a very large portion of them, are slaves of
                  necessity; and, of the higher classes, some are the slaves of idleness—some of
                  intemperance—some of unruly tongues—some of scolding women—and some of the
                  devil.
               
                  Abe. But you have shown no good reason why color should condemn a
                  man to slavery; neither can you support the institution upon any such foundation.
                  It is a known historical fact, that color is but the effect of climate or
                  temperature. Stripped of exterior coverings, there is a common body and a common
                  mind. Inferiority arises from abuse; and there is no excuse for slavery but that
                  of the exercise of political power, which is not justified by reason, religion, or
                  nature.
               
                  Jeff. I am disposed to take the world as I find it. The history of
                  man shows a system of slavery among all nations. It is like every thing else; it
                  is varied in its regulations. The poor are the slaves of the rich; the fools are
                  the slaves of the wise; the sluggards are the slaves of the industrious; the
                  negligent the slaves of the careful. For instance: the rich buy their goods at
                  wholesale prices—the poor, at retail. The poor support the merchant, and an undue
                  portion of every other burden. The wise
                  take advantage of the times; the fool labors hard for his folly; the industrious
                  gather the first fruits of the season; the sluggard labors and slaves out of the
                  thorns and briers a pittance that is but the price of slothfulness. As to any
                  justification by reason, we only see that it is so. Without stopping to examine
                  any principles of religion, we can only say, in the language of the great Teacher,
                  "Render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's"—clearly showing that religion is not
                  political; and, as to its being against nature, we not only see it in all nations
                  of men, but in other fields of nature. Dr. Laycock remarks: "There is hardly a
                  mechanical pursuit in which INSECTS do not excel. They are excellent weavers,
                  house-builders, architects; they make diving-bells, bore galleries, raise vaults,
                  construct bridges; they line their houses with tapestry, clean them, ventilate
                  them, and close them, with admirably-fitted swinging doors; they build and store
                  warehouses, construct traps in the greatest variety, hunt skillfully, rob, and
                  plunder; they poison, saber and stab their enemies; they have social laws, a
                  common language, divisions of labor, and gradations of rank; they
                  maintain armies, go to war, send out scouts, appoint sentinels, carry off
                  prisoners, KEEP SLAVES, and tend domestic animals."
               
                  Abe. Go with me into one of the highly civilized countries of
                  Europe, and witness the coronation of a monarch, on the throne of his ancestors,
                  surrounded by an august assembly of peers, barons, and abbots. Then turn to a
                  hamlet in Negroland, and witness the sable race in the hour of recreation, and
                  dancing to barbarous music. Or, behold the solitary den of the Bushman, where the
                  lean and hungry savage crouches in silence, like a beast of prey, watching, with
                  eager eyes, the creatures which enter his pitfall. Then behold the doctrine: "All
                  men are of a common stock." Can you, then, say to me that we must take things as
                  we find them, and think not of reformation?
               
                  Jeff. Reformation comes as gently as the dew from heaven. If you
                  would reform a man, go not about his angry parts, nor stir the passions of his
                  head, or call him mean, or try to pull him down; touch not his purse, or try to
                  level down his pride; do n't say he owes a lasting debt, as huge as mountains are,
                  to all the world. But touch him in his tender parts, and say, "A beast has
                  feelings." The noble orb of heaven looks down with mercy on the weak, and, lavish
                  with his friendly rays, bids all to rise. Ye noble son, that stands above the mass
                  of slavish, ignorant men, bid all good cheer, and each performs his appointed
                  part; and He that rules the lightnings and the storms will loose our bonds in His
                  own good time. If you would reform a government, break not the strings that stay
                  the noble staff, and with your heated breath blow down its glorious flag. Nor go
                  about with counterfeited salve, to heal the sores on the body politic; but wash
                  with friendly water the sounder parts, and time will make the cure.
               
                  Abe. Such patience is not the lot of men. The name that lives when we are dead stirs up the
                  boldness of the soul to wind the trumpet of our fame, and herald freedom through
                  the land.
               
                  Jeff. And such a blast from mortal horn ne'er rested in the ears of
                  men—a chilling blast, that winters half the continent, and withers all the
                  flowers, sweet blown for eighty years. The martial echo dries up the spring and
                  weather-beats the summer; makes mild men mad, and mad men devils. To blot the
                  cheek of fame with such virtuous blood, the broadest river that flows from crystal
                  fount, through history's vale, will never wash it out.
               
                  Abe. Storms purify the air. Though thunders roll and lightnings
                  gleam, winds upturn, and hailstones pelt the quiet state of man, they are, at
                  last, but a necessary thing. Generations yet unborn will bask in the sunshine that
                  follows this approaching storm.
               
                  Jeff. Civil discord is a woeful thing—the fevered blood that, heated
                  in the veins, beats hard against the skin, then rushing to the heart for force,
                  comes bounding through the scarlet streams, and dries the skin with the swiftness
                  of its gait; add but to the fury of its speed, and soon it runs its course: the
                  man is dead. But, checked with milder means, and softened in its flight, it
                  presses gently to the skin, and mildly fills the heart; the head is cooled by its
                  gentle flood: behold, the man is better.
               
                  Abe. Mildness is at some times good; but doctors now dispute. Some
                  say, to heat a fevered man will sooner make him cool. A middle course we think is
                  best; and doing what we are seeming not to do, will so disguise the course of the
                  disease, and purge out the hotness of the blood, and leave the wasted frame to
                  gather up its wanton strength, and show the world a man that never stood so
                  proud.
               
                  Jeff. You may, with skillful hand, mix up a pill for inward draught,
                  composed of counterparts, and pass it through the body without distort. But mixing
                  physic for the mind muddies up the sight and leaves you groping in the dark,
                  without the friendly aid of day to show you where you stand.
               
                  Abe. A stubborn, set distemper takes harsh and heavy physic, with
                  necromancing hand, to purge the blood of imperfections, or amputate the
                  disaffected parts. We will rid this body of disease, or give it out u-n-t-o the
                  world we are no doctors.
               
                  Jeff. The world still needs no testimony. When many doctors set
                  about a complicated old disease, some urging amputation, others bitter, poisonous
                  drugs—that man's case is dangerous.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIX.
               THE golden rays of the western sun glittered on the muddy waters of the turbulent
                  Missouri. The eastern bank was alive with busy men; drays, horse-carts, and wagons
                  thickly crowded the muddy wharf. The fine passenger packet "Mettlefoot" was moored
                  at the landing; the black smoke was rolling out of her smoke-stacks; the fiery
                  steam from her boilers was singing with a low, deadly hiss, distinctly audible for
                  four hundred yards. The captain stood on the main-deck, with one hand on the large
                  brass bell, while with the other he was pointing to the spring-line, directing a
                  sailor to throw it loose. His eye met in the distance a coachman, urging his
                  horses, almost at full speed, directly toward the boat. "Hold," said the captain,
                  "one moment," as with both hands he rolled over the huge bell in its orbit; and
                  its iron tongue poured forth its notes through the timbered land and up and down
                  the river, as though it said to all concerned, "Hurry up; we will soon be off."
                  The coachman pressed his horses, for in that carriage sat a passenger—a young lady
                  returning to the loved ones at home. The notes of the bell ran through her mind
                  like the darts of Cupid. Did she wish for wings, to fly to the noble steamer? No,
                  she wished, from the depths of her heart, that the wheels would run off the
                  carriage, or something else would detain her at the river for a short time; but
                  prudence compelled her to smother all of those feelings, and Cora was conducted
                  safely into the ladies' saloon of the "Mettlefoot." The noble boat was soon
                  steaming through the dark and muddy waters of the Missouri, Cora, having been
                  introduced to the captain, who was a warm friend of her father's was most
                  interestingly entertained for a short time. The captain was called out, and Cora
                  went into her state-room. Throwing herself down upon the berth, she exclaimed,
                  mentally: "O, my God! could that have been him? 
                     
                        "With noble form and comely limb,
                        With face as fair as break of day,
                        And ruby lips, that ne'er could say
                        A word less sweet than 'Cora, dear!'
                        That brilliant eye that dropped a tear,
                        When last I saw him strive to weep,
                        From shaded brows once more did peep
                        With shooting rays, to wound a heart
                        That loves the piercing of the dart.
                        If 't was not him, 't was his ghost,
                        Bearing human form, straight almost.
                     
                  
               
               "O my God! could that be him in such mean attire, tending sheep? And what a noble
                  look he gave me! In that face I saw the morning sun, that lighted up the day of
                  all my hopes, and moored the night in iron bands, that held my love so long in
                     a prison-house; a momentary day,
                  that came like heaven's gleam, and darted quick away. And Fate rolled on the
                  carriage-wheels with such a barbarous speed, while pale-faced Fear crept o'er my
                  soul, and bade me not to speak. When homeward-bound, with such an aching heart, to
                  woo a father from such a desperate game! And what a plight I'm in, wafting home on
                  a lightning train! Here are my feet, my arms, my voice, too; but where's my heart?
                  "This yonder with a shepherd boy!"
               In the prosperous years of 1858-9, Mr. —— bought sheep in Missouri, to drive to
                  Kansas, Texas, and California. On a certain trip of this kind, Don Partlo
                  accompanied him to Missouri. Mr.—— purchased a large flock of sheep, and had
                  driven them west, and was near the Missouri River, when a carriage passed them in
                  full drive. In that carriage sat Cora, returning home from the East, with the
                  memory of the Misses Traddings fresh in her mind. The thoughts of her father and
                  the loved ones at home were crowding through her mind, when every thing else was
                  all at once upset by the sight of Don Partlo, up to his knees in the dust, tending
                  the sheep.
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               
                  
                     DISCORD is a hateful thing; the apple of a heathen tree, of Grecian shape
                        and golden hue, thrown by the gods among contentious men. Ever since that
                        fatal day has rolled around the world, to ruffle and disturb the quiet state
                        of man—in every age and every clime, in high and low degree, the apple of
                        discord gilds its way and hardens the hearts of men.
                  
               
               "BUT here is Tom Slaver; he will want to know my reasons for leaving the
                  territory." And Ned summed up his best recollections of his sojourn in Kansas.
               "Good morning, Ned! you have lost faith in the Indian country, and come back, with
                  belt, cup, and blanket, to old Kentuck. You look well. I heard that you said the
                  country was unhealthy—what on earth is the matter? I thought that you had one of
                  the most beautiful farms in the whole territory."
               A low, cunning smile hung in the corner of Tom's mouth, while his keen, blue eye
                  looked on Ned as though it would pierce the inmost secrets of his soul.
               "Well, to tell you the plain truth, there are men in Kansas who never owned a
                  slave in the world, who do every thing
                  in their power to afflict that virgin territory with the curse of slavery."
               "Ah! Do they try to compel a man to own a slave against his will?"
               "O, no! but they want the institution in the country."
               "Is there any sin in that? If I choose to work horses on my farm, and you choose
                  to work mules, why should we disagree?"
               "Yes; but you know slavery makes men lazy when they have a negro to send to work:
                  they grow indolent, and their children are not put through; they call the negro
                  for every thing, and let the white family go idle. You know, if you want a thing
                  well done, you must do it yourself. A slave community never prospers like a free
                  community."
               "So some people say, but I can not see it. What right has one man to say to
                  another that he may own some kinds of property, and other kinds he shall not
                  own?"
               "O! I know an individual has no such right; but a State can determine what shall
                  be property in her borders, and what shall not."
               "Well, before a territory becomes a State, why should not all have equal rights?
                  Upon what principle do you wish to exclude Slave-State men from the
                  territories?"
               "Because slavery has already cursed enough territory. I want to stop it where it
                  is, and let it break down with its own weight."
               "Then, what you would not destroy at a single blow, you would destroy by the slow
                  process of time."
               "Exactly!"
               "But, Ned, if you wish to make Kansas a free State, why did you flee from the
                  territory?"
               "Well, I love my own life more than I hate slavery. The Missourians go over there
                  and excite the pro-slavery men, and then slip back to their own State, and leave
                  the poor devils the bag to hold; and the Free-State men are dealing roughly with
                  them. They have got at it on both sides; so, when a man lies down at night, he
                  don't know whether he will get up in the morning or not. Three of the
                  slave-drivers paid the forfeit before I left there, right in my own neighborhood.
                  That, you know, created a great excitement, and the Free-State men gathered at
                  Timber Point, and Burtice, an infernal Missourian, came over with a band of his
                  bloody followers, and rushed upon them, behind some wagon-loads of hay, and
                  dispersed the whole crowd. Then, you see, he slips back to Missouri, and the
                  Free-State men have no show at him. The Missourians interfere with our elections;
                  and the pro-slavery men of Kansas are trying to establish the institution by the
                  sword, and they get no little help from Missouri. The Free-State men can't get at
                  the Missourians; and the pro-slavery men of the territory pay the forfeit."
               "Yes; but Ned, you are not pro-slavery."
               "I know that I am not; but the Free-State men catch it occasionally. I tell you
                  this d——d Burtice will hang an
                  Abolitionist as quick as he would a dog."
               "Yes; but, Ned, I never understood you to be an Abolitionist."
               "Well, you know that a man has to take sides, and as I am a Free-State man, I am
                  reckoned with that party by all such fellows as Burtice."
               "It seems that Burtice is somewhat of a terror to the Abolitionists."
               "Ah! he is a bad man."
               "Why do n't the Abolitionists stop his wind?"
               "Why did n't Jack eat his supper?"
               "Well, Ned, what sort of a country is Kansas?"
               "The larger portion of it is no country at all, unless you call an ocean of
                  prairie a country. There are some good streaks of country about through it.
                  Wherever there is a stream of water, you will find about a mile of country on each
                  side of it. The land is fertile enough, but it rains there by the job. If the
                  weather-king do n't happen to take a job of raining during the cropping-season,
                  you raise nothing."
               "Then there is not much use for the negro in Kansas."
               "No use in the world, sir, if men could only see it. 'T is only those suspicious
                  Missourians; they do n't like to be surrounded by free States."
               "If States to their own affairs would but attend, and leave their neighbors be, no
                  strife or discord would molest the bridal of the nation."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               THE broad acres of a plantation hemmed the southern bank of the beautiful Ohio.
                  The crystal waters of that placid stream washed the pebbles on the border of a
                  Virginia farm. Four hundred yards from the margin of the river stood a
                  story-and-a-half house. A lone shade-tree in the front yard gave the premises a
                  lonesome look, which was contrasted by the merry sports of a dozen negroes, the
                  property of Captain Sturn. It was Saturday, and the sun was low. Captain Sturn was
                  in the habit of tasking his negroes by the week, and their work was almost
                  universally completed by Friday night. Saturday and Sunday were spent by these
                  happy people on the margin of the river, fishing and hunting.
               Three miles from the plantation, in the back room of a coffee-house in a country
                  village, sat two men, by a small, square table, upon which was a bottle of wine;
                  the surface of the table was partly covered with playing-cards. The younger of the
                  two gentlemen was apparently about thirty-five years of age, with a ghostlike
                  complexion and keen, blue eyes; the
                  elder was rather corpulent, with red face and heavy brows. The game is finished.
                  The pale man handed the bottle to the other, as he said, "Captain Sturn, take a
                  little more wine, and you will play a stronger game."
               "I will take the wine," said the Captain, as he tossed the red element into the
                  tumbler, "but I am tired of playing. "He drank the wine with trembling nerve, and
                  buried his face in his hands.
               "You seem sad, Captain; you have lost a dear wife and a son, and your eldest
                  daughter disinherited." After a pause, during which the Captain
                  looked up, the pale-faced man continued: "If, by the providence of God, Mary
                  should be your only heir, would you revoke that disinheritance?"
               "I have set my seal upon it!" and the Captain straightened up as he brought his
                  fist down upon the table, and continued, "and, by the Eternal God——"
               "Stand back!"—"A fight! a fight!" rang through the hall. The Captain and the pale
                  man rushed into the front room.
               Late rains had swollen the bosom of the gentle Ohio, whose waters, near its
                  junction with the Father of waters, met the fine Western steamer "Harvest moon."
                  On that steamer there was a sad, but interesting passenger: it was Mary Hawkeye,
                  returning to the home of her childhood. Recent occurrences in Kansas had prevented
                  Burtice from rendering her necessary aid. The creditors of Hawkeye had taken
                  almost every thing which she had. Mary had been raised by a tender and indulgent
                  mother. Her father was a stern and hard man; but Mary had determined to go once
                  more to that roof from which she had fled, against her father's will and strict
                  command. She said in her heart, "I will act the 'Prodigal Son'—I will go to the
                  feet of my father and say, I have sinned against him and against Heaven! Yes, I
                  will do it, for the sake of my children." And Mary pressed Rosa and Dolla to her
                  bosom, and gave vent to those friendly tears which can only relieve a bruised and
                  lacerated heart. The "Harvest-moon" was crowded with passengers. The state-room
                  which was given to Mary and her little ones was also occupied by a young lady,
                  whose Christian name is Ophelia, and whose father and mother occupied the
                  adjoining room.
               The falls of the Ohio had been passed. Rosa and Dolla were nestled together in the
                  bed, and Mary sat by them with a hopeful smile. Ophelia was near the window,
                  intently poring over the pages of a book. Low groans were distinctly audible in
                  the adjoining room, when Mary was startled by the shrill sound of "Ophelia!
                  Ophelia!" The young girl pays no attention, but continues to ravish the book. Mary
                  opens her Bible and reads from the Prophet Jeremiah—"Man is strange and
                  wonderfully made;" then mentally continued, as she looked at Ophelia, "and woman
                  is the wonder of creation."
               Smothered and low groans again disturbed the silence of the evening. "Ophelia!
                  Ophelia!" in louder tones, again rang
                  through the room. The girl paid no attention. Mary laid her hand upon the young
                  girl's shoulder, saying, "Ophelia, you are called."
               "Yes, ma'am, in a minute," said the girl, continuing to read. The groans
                  continued, and again Ophelia was called.
               Forbearance ceased to be a virtue, and Mary caught the young girl by the
                  shoulders, and, shaking her, said, "Ophelia, you are called; your father is very
                  sick. What on earth are you reading?"
               "The last new novel."
               "And pray what is its title?"
               "'Dead Loads of Love,' by Honeymoon Lockheart, the author of 'Love
                  in a Hail-storm,' etc., etc."
               "My child, your father is very ill. They have called you a dozen times."
               "Yes; just let me finish this chapter;" then saying, mentally, "Let's see how the
                  next one commences," she turns over a leaf—
               "Ophelia!"
               "Well, I do declare, it commences with my name; let's see a little of her
                  character."
               And the girl was soon again lost in the mysteries of the book.
               The Rock Landing was passed. Doctor Solomon had taken passage, and was called to
                  the sick man's room. Mary leaned against the partition, to hear the consultation.
                  Then, starting suddenly, she exclaimed: "O God! Ophelia, your father has the
                  small-pox!"
               Ophelia gave one scream, threw down the book, and rushed into the room.
               The notes of the iron tongue of the great bell danced upon the waters, up and down
                  the river.
               "What does that mean?" said Mary, to one of the cabin-boys, as he passed her
                  door.
               "Sturn's Landing, madam," was the cool reply.
               "O my God!" Said Mary, clasping her hands; "is the trial upon me! and exposed to
                  the small-pox!"
               Something seemed to whisper in Mary's ear—"There is no escape." She hastily
                  prepared herself, with Rosa and Dolla, for the shore.
               "Let me carry this package, madam," said the polite porter, as she left the
                  room.
               The face of day was hiding one check behind a dark cloud that hung in the western
                  horizon; a dozen; a negroes were standing on the brink of the river, anxiously
                  gazing at the boat. Mary and her two children were set upon the pebbly shore. One
                  of the negroes hallooed, in a wild, mellow voice—"Miss Mary! Miss Mary!" The whole
                  crowd rushed upon the trembling woman: one caught up Rosa, another one Dolla; and
                  Old Sue, who had been the nurse of Mary's childhood, caught her up in her arms—and
                  all started toward the house.
               The reader will be interested with a conversation that now took place between an
                  Eastern and Western lady, passengers on the "Harvest-moon:"
               E. I suppose that lady is an advocate, with her father and her people, of emancipation, that those
                  poor creatures are so glad to see her.
               W. You much mistake yourself, madam, if you think so: they never think of
                  emancipation, unless it is handed to them by white people. There appears to be an
                  innate principle in the negro that teaches him his inferiority: he naturally looks
                  to the white man for protection. There is nothing more true than that the negro
                  loves his master.
               E. Merciful heavens! how you talk!
               W. Do not children love their parents—do not wards love their guardians—as a
                  general thing?
               E. Yes; but they sometimes change when they become of age.
               W. Negroes never become of age in this country.
               On the way to the house, Mary learned from the negroes that her mother was dead,
                  and her father was much dissipated; and that he was from home, in the neighboring
                  village—probably intoxicated.
               Rosa and Dolla sat in the chimney-corner, like two little culprits. Mary raised up
                  gracefully as Captain Sturn entered the room: she flew to her father's neck; he
                  pressed her from him.
               "Hear me, O father!"
               The Captain listened. Mary told her story.
               "Killed by the Abolitionists! by G—d! where is my will? By h—ll! you shall be
                  reinstated!"
               And the Captain sent for his lawyer.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXII.
               I WAS at the house of Burtice in the spring of 1861. A temporary peace had been
                  restored between Kansas and Missouri. Burtice had enlarged his farm; his family
                  were industrious and interesting. The exciting season of the presidential election
                  had passed over. Missourians, as a general thing, seemed willing to abide the
                  result, saying that the President had been constitutionally elected.
               Burtice said the spirit of the Constitution had been violated. The people said the
                  South had acted their part in such violation by running John C. Breckinridge.
                  Groups of men were seen in earnest conversation; and Burtice said a new era had
                  dawned upon the political horizon: seven States had withdrawn from the Union, and
                  it became Missouri to determine her political destiny.
               Leaving him to talk with his old friends, of war and desolation, I was again
                  interested in another conversation between Jeff and Abe.
               Jeff, having been absent from the neighborhood for some time, was met by his
                  friend Abe. After the usual salutation,
                  the following conversation ensued:
               
                  Abe. As you are just from the city, I suppose you have heard the
                  news. The traitors have fired the first gun; they have fired upon the flag of the
                  United States; that flag dedicated to the memory of every American heart, by the
                  association of the memories of our ancient struggles for the invigorating name of
                  liberty; the flag that waved o'er the heads of our fathers on the hard-fought
                  fields of the Revolution; the flag that robed the pride of the officer, and
                  gladdened the eyes of the private; that flag that waved in the breeze at the head
                  of victorious columns, to cheer the spirits of the heart-stricken widow, whose
                  husband had fallen beneath its folds, consecrated to the liberty of his country:
                  that flag has been fired upon by traitors. Fort Sumter has fallen!
               
                  Jeff. Shakspeare said a rose would smell as sweet by any other name.
                  A flag is but an emblem of political rule. When politics have undergone a serious,
                  blighting change, their ancient emblem does not fitly represent them. The metal of
                  the past, as pure as gold to every true-made heart, can not be changed for a
                  counterfeit.
               
                  Abe. The President has called upon the loyal States for seventy-five
                  thousand warlike men, to take the bloody path, and bear aloft the Union flag.
                  Governor Fox, of our State, has refused to furnish one. What do you think of
                  that?
               
                  Jeff. The Governor says it is wicked; and he fears the people, for
                  they are against coercion.
               
                  Abe. True; but we must not fight the flag. For policy, in our State,
                  let us arm and stand neutral.
               
                  Jeff. Sooner or later, we must fall upon one or the other side.
                  Better start right at first.
               
                  Abe. To go upon an unknown sea, whose bosom no craft has ever borne,
                  to battle in uncertain waves, and breast a storm of such magnitude that northern
                  winds may force upon us, I think is dangerous. Missouri lies with loyal States.
                  The President talks pro-slavery; I am for the Union. I would not risk the crazy
                  craft of Dixie, with nothing but a sable anchor.
               
                  Jeff. Cotton is king. The world would starve without it, and it can
                  not be produced without the slave. Is there any faith in the government? Is it not
                  abolitionized? Does it not woo Missouri for a cause, and seek her disinthrallment?
                  The President talks pro-slavery; but such an outward pressure bears upon him he
                  can't be trusted.
               
                  Abe. Missouri is a noble State, with a hundred thousand fighting
                  men. Why was she not consulted in this affair? Secession is a sinful thing—to
                  raise an arm against a government that never did us harm; on the contrary, like a
                  fostering mother, has put forth an iron arm for our protection. "How sharper than
                  a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child."
               
                  Jeff. There is a time in the affairs of men most critical. Suppose
                  we take a buffalo-hunt; have thirteen
                  teen in the mess, and, by fair play and good luck, increase our company to
                  thirty-four; we then elect a captain to lead the chase. When fresh recruits are
                  coming in, and our captain gives it out that he wants no more Missourians, then
                  seven of the old thirteen will not go upon the plains under such an imputation.
                  What, then, should that Missourian do that's caught in such a crowd? Follow a
                  leader who wants no more like him—his kindred all behind! I would not venture the
                  trip.
               
                  Abe. When turning back is not permitted, he had better tread in
                  peace the forward track.
               
                  Jeff. Whenever 't is set forth by any set of men, that they want no
                  more of a certain stripe, it portends no good to those they have. I would break
                  their company.
               
                  Abe. There is old Virginia, the glorious Old Dominion, rendered
                  sacred by every line in her history—the mother of statesmen and of States; let her
                  take the lead, and then 't will be time enough for Missouri; and, sooner or later,
                  go where she will, her people will stand divided.
               
                  Jeff. The men who came in early times to settle in Missouri, and
                  make for themselves quiet homes—who beat the brambles and the briers; who chased
                  out the wolf and the wild-cat; who planted schools, and made the State—were
                  pro-slavery men. And now new levies are coming in from foreign States, like
                  beardless boys, to chase gray-headed sires out, and it is thought no sin; while
                  secession is held to be a desperate thing.
               
                  Abe. Stick to the Union then, and all is safe. The negro is not
                  worth much in our State; besides, I think we could sell him to the Government, and
                  then we would swim with every loyal State.
               
                  Jeff. In ancient times, some two it took to make a lasting trade;
                  but now, forsooth, we trade with Circumstances. Where is the Constitution?
               
                  Abe. So great a good could not be done in all the land of freedom;
                  unborn millions yet to come will praise the day that disinthralled their fathers
                  from this sin. The President holds in high respect the border States.
               
                  Jeff. The President is forced to stand with one foot on the
                  Constitution, and the other on party platforms. He puts me in mind of Tom Moore,
                  rafting logs. Now, in the back-water of a certain creek, Tom pushed in a pine and
                  a butternut, then, striding them both, he stood and pushed toward the stream; when
                  to the current he approached, one went south and one went north, and Tom went
                  headlong into the stream, and swam within an inch of life to make the shore. He
                  was then met by a friend, who said, "Which way, Tom?" "Cuss those infernal logs,"
                  Tom said. "If I had 'em I would split 'em into rails; but rafting in such d——d
                  water is a big job."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               DURING the summer of 1861 many citizens of Kansas enlisted in the service of the
                  United States. Major Six received an appointment and a command in the service from
                  a superior officer. He lost no time in organizing a command of such men as he
                  thought partook, with himself, of a certain deadly hatred of Missourians, who were
                  willing to take every advantage of the laws of war to carry out their nefarious
                  designs, and who were willing to run before the President, and carry out such
                  measures as their highly prejudiced minds supposed to be the object of the
                  Government, among which were the confiscation of property and the liberation of
                  slaves belonging to "Secesh." Don Partlo had volunteered, taken the oath, and was
                  a promising young sergeant in the forces of Major Six. It had been loudly given
                  out that the Union men of Missouri were in great need of protection from the
                  insult and abuse of unrelenting "Secesh;" that Confederate flags were flying all
                  over the State, and Union men were being driven from their homes. It was probably
                  thought necessary, by the Government, to send Union soldiers into the State to
                  stop the progress of revolution, and teach the "Secesh" that their neighbors were
                  not to be insulted by the Stars and Bars. Major Six had determined to cross the
                  line with a small force, to give a little instruction by way of taking contraband
                  property and freeing slaves. An old gentleman lived at no great distance from the
                  Kansas line, in Missouri, enjoying a fine farm and driving a fine lot of slaves,
                  and also enjoying the reputation of being a "Secesh." Major Six said it would be
                  well to commence on him. His reputation as a soldier had not departed from the
                  mind of Major Six, since the Missouri raids into Kansas, and more especially the
                  reputation of his fast friend Burtice. It was, therefore, thought best to approach
                  his domicile with great caution, and the Major called around him his most trusty
                  friends in solemn council, to decide the time and manner of attack, and what was
                  to be done. The decision was made; the time was to be in the night; the gentleman
                  was to be arrested, charged with a high crime, thrown into prison, and his slaves
                  set at liberty. This part, however, was known only to the Major and a few of his
                  trusty advisers.
               It was thought necessary to send a reconnoitering party in daylight to pass the
                  residence of this gentleman, for the purpose of observing the situation of
                  affairs. Consequently the Major detailed Don Partlo, in citizen's guise, to pass
                  the aforesaid residence, as a sharp
                  look-out. It was thought necessary to apprise Don of the whole thing—the plan of
                  attack, the intentions of the party, etc., etc.—that his mind should be fully open
                  to the observation of every thing that might retard the onset.
               The shades of evening were slowly marching out from ambush; the shadow of the
                  poplar had traveled to the eastern side of the house, in the yard of Colonel S——.
                  The rose-bush near its base was holding out its leaves in anticipation of the dews
                  of night. Close by it sat Cora, her fingers busily plying her needle, and her
                  sweet lips humming the tune of "Long, long Ago."
               A young man rode leisurely up the road. Cora, by instinct as it were, rose to go
                  to the house, as she thought she was imprudently too near the road. She looked
                  again at the young man, and she could not go. There was something in the outlines
                  of that stranger that paralyzed her nerves. She stood as motionless as marble, a
                  statue of female beauty, as enchanting as the fairies of a lover's dream. Don
                  Partlo, true to his mission, scanned the premises of Colonel S——, until his eye
                  rested upon Cora, and his horse would not pass the stiles. An interview ensued,
                  (which I will not undertake to describe, for the lack of capacity to do so.) One
                  hour after the above occurrence, Don Partlo was riding off in the direction from
                  whence he came, and in mental conversation thus delivers himself: "O, true love is
                  a lasting thing! Like water in the bosom of the earth, it seeks some lone and
                  hidden cavern in which to gather strength, and form a heart to pulsate through
                  some new-found vein, and wet the tongue of thirsty man. A crystal fount, deep
                  hidden in the breast, will live through long and tedious days, pulsing out by
                  minute drops, until some coming storm o'erflows the heart. Those brilliant eyes,
                  like lightning in a thick-set cloud; that soft and mellow voice that thundered in
                  my ears; the crystal drops that stood upon her cheeks, is rain enough to last a
                  hundred years. My heart is full and overflowed; and yet it will hold true love
                  enough to fill a vein with gentle drops, until I grow as gray as frost. Honor is a
                  sacred thing; but robbery is dark enough to break the gates of heaven. To raise a
                  knife and cut my throat, is madness. To spoil this house, and forfeit love, is
                  wretchedness. To do it, or to let it be done, is all the same. Death is the wages
                  of desertion; but to execute is a two-handed game. Don Partlo is a deserter!"
               Cora had told Don Partlo where he would find Burtice. He held a short interview
                  with that gentleman, and then proceeded to the head-quarters of Major Six, and
                  reported all quiet.
               When Don Partlo had left, Cora hastily concealed every thing valuable about the
                  house that could be carried off, and, unknown to the negroes, went to a neighbor's
                  house, about a mile distant, to remain through the night.
               About nine o'clock, Major Six, at the head of thirty nine men, all mounted and
                  armed with musket, saber, and holster, was ready to march on the aforesaid said expedition. Don Partlo was taken
                  suddenly ill, which caused some detention to the party, and a council was held to
                  give up the trip for that night. But after receiving minute directions from him,
                  between the paroxysms of his sufferings, the Major concluded to go forward. When
                  the party were fairly out of sight, Don Partlo grew suddenly better, mounted his
                  charger, and telling the guard that he would overtake them, dashed off at full
                  speed. Long before the party under Major Six arrived at the residence of Colonel
                  S——, Don Partlo was with Burtice, who, by this time, was at the head of a small
                  party, armed with double barreled shot-guns, and posted in a thick cluster of
                  brush near the road, west of the Colonel's house. In a short time Major Six and
                  his party filed slowly along, having dismounted a quarter of a mile from the
                  house, and detailed every fourth man to hold their horses. Burtice and his men
                  permitted the Major to pass; they marched up to the house, surrounding it on all
                  sides. The Major hailed. No answer was returned. Another hail, still louder,
                  received no answer. A rock that lay in the front yard bounced against the door,
                  and broke it open. The noise, by this time, raised the colored population. They
                  came swarming around, and informed the Major that the white folks had happened
                  out, but as to their whereabouts, no one could tell. The Major began to smell a
                  rat. He had no clue to any suspicion; but, evidently, something was wrong. The
                  Colonel's residence was searched from cellar to garret, not so much for contraband
                  of war, as to find some clue to the run of the ropes. Nothing of value could be
                  found; and the men began to whisper one to another, "BURTICE, by G—d!" The Major
                  detested failure; and he determined to take something. Calling the negroes all up,
                  he told them that they were free; but, in order to enjoy their liberty, for the
                  present, they would have to go to Kansas; that he would give them an escort; and
                  to saddle all the horses on the place, as they were entitled to them for their
                  past services; that their master was a rebel, and would be hung. The stable was
                  soon opened, and, behold! no horses were there. "BURTICE!" again ran through the
                  crowd, in almost audible whispers. Nothing now seemed to be left for them to do
                  but to make a cautious retreat. The Major informed the negroes that the young and
                  active ones could go with them; that the aged and very young would have to wait
                  for a more favorable opportunity. The retreat was commenced toward the horses—not
                  down the road, the nearest route, but through an open field. Burtice, discovering
                  the course of the enemy, ordered a charge into the field. For a few moments, the
                  volley of guns broke the stillness of the dark night. The Major's party went on
                  double-quick to their horses—the negroes back to the house, with the exception of
                  an enthusiastic girl, who, being a little in advance of her fellows, when the run
                  commenced, broke straight after the Major's party. Her head was tied up with a
                  white handkerchief, which made, in the dark, a beautiful target for the Missouri shot guns, and
                  the balls went whistling by her ears like a den of rattlesnakes. One passed
                  through her hair, just grazing the skull; and over she tumbled, stunned for a few
                  minutes. When she arose, she arose running. The Major's party were all gone. Her
                  feet, as it were, by instinct, carried her to a neighbor's house, where she
                  supposed Miss Cora was. She made no halt at the door, and burst it in with all her
                  weight. Cora was fortunately in the room, and caught the frightened negro by the
                  arms; her eyes like two moons of a gray night, rolled around the room; her mouth,
                  white with ivory, was closed as tight as the grave.
               "Speak! speak!" said Cora, shaking her violently—when she seemed to come a little
                  to her senses, and said, "All killed! all killed! Missis—eb'ry nigger, and eb'ry
                  ab'lisnist! I was the only one that got away, and I coch a bullet in my har!
                  (clapping her hand on her head, and continuing,) Oh! oh! oh!"
               "Killed! by whom?" demanded Cora, sternly.
               "Don't know, Missis," said the negro, as she brightened up a little; "I spec it
                  was Jeff Davis."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               OAKHEAD and Bob Beabout, young and enthusiastic of Liberty, had been known as
                  members of the Secesh party. Federal soldiers were entering Western Missouri. The
                  writ of habeas corpus had been suspended.
                  Rumor's tongue had circulated the report that the Union soldiers were arresting
                  every Secesh in the country. Hitherto, Oakhead and Bob Beabout had been quiet, and
                  guilty of nothing save the sin of belonging to the so-called Secesh party. An
                  ardent love of liberty, and a dread of trial by a military court, drove them to
                  the bushes, and, finally, from the neighborhood of their own homes.
               Union Missourians lost no time in informing the Federal soldiers that Oakhead and
                  Bob Beabout were on the run—the natural consequence of which was to create the
                  impression that they were desperate rebels. The consequences that followed these
                  impressions may readily be imagined.
               The Federal soldiers were instructed to shoot them wherever seen with arms in
                  their hands. Being apprised of the situation of the times, Oakhead and Bob Beabout
                  were constantly in the brush. They
                  would go in, occasionally, to some lone and solitary house, whose inmates were
                  known to them to be of Southern origin, and ask for food, professing to be working
                  their way to the Southern army.
               An October sun was gilding the eastern hills. Mrs. —— was washing the faces of two
                  little girls, whose father was far away on legitimate business. Rising up from her
                  domestic task, she started back, as Oakhead and Bob Beabout stood before her.
               "Fear not, madam," said Oakhead; "we are Southern men. We are striving to join our
                  company, and are without food. A bit of breakfast, if you please, and we will
                  leave."
               The woman trembled as she informed them that she was alone, and that there were
                  Federal soldiers in the neighborhood—requesting them to leave her house, for God's
                  sake. It was of no use; the men were hungry.
               "Give us some breakfast, madam; and get it as quick as you please. We have eaten
                  nothing for twenty-four hours." And Oakhead set his gun down with an air that said
                  he was not to be refused.
               Pots, kettles, and cups rattled for half an hour, during which time Mrs. ——
                  answered many questions concerning the Federal soldiers, said to be in the
                  immediate vicinity. Breakfast was ready, and Mrs. ——, with the caution of her sex,
                  intimated that they could carry it to some retreat, and eat it at their leisure.
                  Her house stood near the main road; "and soldiers may pass," she said, "before the
                  day is old."
               A smoking breakfast before a hungry man stimulates his bravery. Oakhead and Bob
                  Beabout had just arisen from the table, when three soldiers came dashing down the
                  road, at half speed—finely mounted, and armed with musket and saber. Quick as
                  thought, Oakhead drew up his gun, and whispered to Bob, "They have found us. Let
                  us sell our lives as dearly as possible."
               By this time the foremost soldier was in front of the house. Oakhead took
                  deliberate aim, and he tumbled from his horse. The frightened animal and the two
                  remaining soldiers took the back track, at full speed; for, to them, it was a
                  complete surprise, as no enemy was supposed to be at hand. They said that they
                  were driven in by the pickets of a large force, and the camp was in great
                  commotion.
               Mrs. ——, fearing the consequences of the sad affair, gathered up her children, and
                  fled to a neighbor's house. Oakhead and Bob Beabout gathered up the musket and
                  saber of the fallen man, and fled to the woods. The Rubicon was passed—the ice was
                  broken—Oakhead was a bush whacker.
               The sun was now shining upon all nature and the face of a dead man, lying in the
                  road, whose blood had so lately stimulated him to fight for the Union. An old sow,
                  that had tumbled the rocks in the branch for fourteen summers, came walking
                  leisurely up the road, followed by a dozen half-grown pigs. When opposite the dead
                  man, she hesitated; then, with cautious tread, approached his feet, and playfully
                  shook the leg of his breeches. The shoats stood in the background, with their bristles up. The old sow then ventured to
                  the pale face of the dead man, and the teeth that had murdered a thousand snakes
                  were sunk into his check: the pigs were soon drinking his blood; and Madame Rumor
                  heralded the news through the State, that the hogs were eating Union men within
                  three miles of the Federal camp.
               It was evening: re-enforcements had arrived; the Federals advanced upon the house
                  of Mrs. —— in two columns. No enemy was found. What remained of the poor, fallen
                  soldier was interred; the house of Mrs. —— burned to the ground, and "Secesh"
                  generally threatened.
               Oakwood and Bob Beabout were now far away from the late scene, lurking in lonesome
                  places, driven from home, with little hope of being soon permitted to return, and
                  with no means of support. The musket and saber captured from their first victim
                  was soon parted with for a few dollars, which enabled them to buy from those who
                  would not give them bread. But that would soon be gone; and what then? Why, they
                  must capture more. And how could so weak a party contend with even the picket
                  guard of an army, which never consisted of less than five or six men? Only by
                  lying in wait, under cover of some thick concealment, and taking them by surprise.
                  Thus, they would conceal themselves by the roadside, and when a force sufficiently
                  small would make their appearance, they were certain to be fired upon—generally
                  with fatal effect. In this way they captured many arms and some horses, having
                  gone thus far into the road of highwaymen; yet they would not interrupt a citizen,
                  or take any thing except what they could get from the Federal army. Indeed, they
                  thought themselves honest men, and were unable to see themselves in any other
                  light.
               Don Partlo, as we have seen, was a deserter from the Federal army. Burtice was not
                  prepared to leave his home or any of his men at the time Don Partlo joined them in
                  the attack upon Major Six; consequently, Don had to look out for himself. Burtice
                  offered him concealment. "No," said he, "I will not hide." He had started South,
                  to get out of the immediate neighborhood of the Federal army, where he hoped to
                  encourage followers enough to defend himself. But he was in Federal uniform; as
                  yet he had not taken time or had the means to change his garb. Dashing along the
                  road like a dare-devil, on a fine charger, he entered a thick wood.
               Oakhead said: "Bob, yonder come a fine horse and a brave-looking man; shall we
                  take him off?"
               "Egad! let's hold a parley with him," said Bob.
               "You give him the 'halt!' and I will watch him close. If he shows any sign of
                  fight, he is my meat," said Oakhead, as he cocked his piece and placed himself
                  behind a tree.
               "Halt!" said Bob Beabout, squaring himself in the road in front of Don Partlo.
               "What will you have?" said our hero, coming to a stand.
               
               "That horse!" said Bob.
               "Light, or we will help you down," said Oakhead, now showing himself, with gun
                  presented.
               "Are you robbers, or Southern soldiers?" demanded Don Partlo, in a firm tone.
               The word "robber" rang in the ears of the young men like a death-bell.
               "We are no robbers; we are fighting the jayhawkers. They rob us, and we rob them;
                  so that is the game. Do you understand?"
               "We demand your horse," said Oakhead, in a firm voice.
               "I am no jayhawker; I am fighting them myself," said Don Partlo.
               "You wear the garb. That uniform tells more than you can tell with your tongue,"
                  said Oakhead, sternly.
               "Do you know Burtice?" said Don Partlo.
               "BURTICE!" Oakhead put his hand upon his forehead. "Do you know Burtice?" he
                  continued.
               "Ah! I know him," said Don, confidently.
               "What in the h—ll are you doing in those buttons then?" said Oakhead,
                  doubtingly.
               "Go with me to Burtice, and I will satisfy you," said Don Partlo.
               By this time guns were uncocked, and lengthy conversations ensued. Don Partlo was
                  invited to join his fortunes with Oakhead and Bob Beabout.
               "No," said he, "I intend to fight the enemy fairly; they shall never brand me with
                  the appellation of Bushwhacker!"
               Oakhead and Bob Beabout were led by Don Partlo into a bolder system of
                  warfare.
               When Major Six returned to his camp, on the night of the skirmish with Burtice,
                  and found that Don Partlo had deserted, he swore vengeance against him; yes, "he
                  would hunt him; he would have him, if he had to rake Dixie with a fine-tooth
                  comb." When reflecting upon the cause of his desertion he was sorely puzzled in
                  mind. At last an idea broke through his brain, bright as the eastern hemisphere
                  before the rising moon. It was Cora. "Ah! I will attend to her; she is at the
                  bottom of all this mischief. Traitorous woman!" melted on the tongue
                  of Major Six, as he closed his eyes in slumber the next night after the retreat
                  from the residence of Colonel S——.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXV.
               "AN order is given for six men to be ready in twenty minutes," said Loudfork to
                  his messmates, as they hovered round the camp-fire in the vicinity of the town of
                  ——, in Western Missouri.
               "What's up now? Damn this way of a private's never knowing any thing!" said Jack
                  Jolly, pushing up the coals.
               "Some one is to be arrested, and they say it is a woman," said
                  Loudfork, smiling.
               "A WOMAN!—the h—ll you say!" and Jack Jolly stretched himself up six feet and four
                  inches.
               "Yes, you know what a woman's tongue is; and folks must mind how they talk these
                  times," said Loudfork, exultingly.
               "Talk! h—ll and home-made thunder! I came to Missouri to fight, not to talk," said
                  Jack, rashly.
               "But you know there is policy in war, Jack," said Loudfork, looking at his
                  watch.
               "O! you need n't consult any time about it. If the Major wants any women arrested,
                  I'll be d——d if he may n't do it himself. This boy wars men, not WOMEN. My mother
                  was a woman. She didn't raise me to fight women. By h—ll, I had as soon fight an
                  angel!" And Jack Jolly seated himself by a frying-pan, and commenced pulling out
                  potatoes.
               "Won't go, then?" said Loudfork, looking around on the faces of his comrades. He
                  continued: "This is a military necessity; 't is a hard thing; but these war times
                  it must be done. She will be well treated, only deprived of liberty for a military
                  purpose. The Major will see to all of that. He commands; we execute. The duty of a
                  soldier is to obey. Who will go? I want six men," said Loudfork.
               Some whispering, some swearing, some laughing rang through the camp, for a few
                  minutes. Then six men filed slowly away with Loudfork
               Jack Jolly made no remarks. A dark shade hung upon his brow. Low and inaudible
                  murmurs told only of his secret thoughts.
               The boys said: "Jack is in love; he's thinking of his sweetheart at home. The
                  Federal army never contained a braver man."
               Colonel S—— was on the dodge. He was fearful of being arrested, as this seemed to
                  be the day of retribution. Even if a Missourian had a grudge against his neighbor,
                  he would try to have him arrested; and thus Federal commanders were often misled.
                  Besides, the Colonel knew he had enemies in Kansas. He was, therefore, very
                  cautious; had almost entirely abandoned his home. Thus we find Cora overburdened
                  with cares, and almost constantly on the tramp, to see to her father's business.
                     There were several Union families in
                  the neighborhood, with whom she counseled. She was friendly with every one.
               The golden rays of an autumn sun mantled the vines that Cora's busy fingers had
                  trained in early spring, around the windows of a dear and happy home. Through the
                  dark, falling leaves of those vines, a Federal uniform met the eyes of Cora.
               "O, my God!" she exclaimed, as the door opened, and an officer stood before
                  her.
               "You are my prisoner, madam," said Loudfork, sternly.
               "Your prisoner!—I am no prisoner of yours yet, sir: stand! back!" said Cora,
                  bravely.
               Loudfork retreated to the hall, where he stood, with six others, in battle
                  array.
               Cora saw that resistance was useless. Every negro on the plantation would have
                  fought to the death for her. By a wave of her hand she made them silent, as she
                  said, with her eye gazing in the orbs of Loudfork:
               "Gentlemen, if I am a prisoner, if I must appear at your camp, I will do so. If
                  there is aught against me, I can answer it. I will go to your camp; but place not
                  your hands upon me, at your risk. "Then, turning to a servant, Cora ordered her
                  horse.
               "Better let her have her own way," whispered Tom to Jerry.
               It was not yet dark, when Loudfork and six privates rode up in front of Mr. ——'s
                  tavern, in the town of ——, and demanded a private room for a lady.
               "A guard will be placed at the outer door. No one is to see her except such of
                  your servants as may be required to wait on her with food, etc. She is to have any
                  thing in that line for which she calls, and charge Uncle Sam. Do you understand?"
                  and Loudfork touched the rim of his cap, bowing to the landlord.
               "The prisoner of Major Six shall lack for nothing in the way of comforts," said
                  the landlord, as he turned to observe her enter the room. "Egad! pretty girl
                  that," he whispered to Loudfork, as the door closed behind her.
               Cora found herself alone, at twilight, in the room of a village tavern. The
                  streets were full of soldiers. The low sounds of a distant cannon hummed in the
                  poor girl's ear, like the dying notes of Gabriel's trumpet. Little did she think
                  that this was imprisonment for imprisonment's sake. No; she thought she was
                  accused, and would have a trial. She seated herself, and when thus composed, she
                  tried to remember the past. She thought how ardently she had implored her father
                  to keep him out of the Kansas troubles. She thought of all her idle talk with
                  regard to secession; she thought of all she knew of her father's acts with the
                  Secession party. She had never been on trial in a civil or any other court; but
                  she knew the justice of all trial was predicated upon truth. With closed eyes and
                  heaving breast, she mentally breathed the following prayer:
                  
                     
                        O virtuous truth! on my tongue repose,
                        Like dew from heaven on the blushing rose;
                        A healing balm for every wind that blows;
                        Star of the morning—light of ev'ry age—
                        Prop of the beggar, and pride of the sage—
                        Solace of the weak—glory of the strong—
                        Guide of the critic and the poet's song:
                        Pure as the diamond, as brilliant and bright
                        Tho' covered with falsehood dark as the night,
                        Will harness the mind with a ray of light,
                        Tho' faint as the infant ray of the morn
                        Heralds the news that young day is born.
                        Sure as the heavenly-piercing eye of day,
                        Peeps o'er the hills, to look dark night away,
                        Ungarnished truth will banish falsehood.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               IT was night, and the wind was still. Startled by a heavy crash, I said to a pale
                  face that stood on the sidewalk of the county town, "What's that?"
               "They have cut down the large pole that bore the Confederate flag. Union soldiers
                  are expected here to-night, and 'Secesh' are fleeing. They have taken down the
                  pole to save their enemies the trouble," said my informer, as he passed on.
               The moon had commenced to silver the eastern hills. At the corner of the street
                  sat two men, in earnest conversation. It was Jeff and Abe, Bear with me, kind
                  reader, while I give you the substance of the interview.
               
                  Abe. The right to own a slave is a political power; it is that alone
                  that gives us the right to hold property of any kind. The government determines
                  all these things: we can hold nothing without the consent of the government under
                  which we live. If my government determines that its power shall not be extended to
                  me over certain property, I must forego that right, if I remain loyal to my
                  government. It is not for individuals
                  or communities to set up their peculiar notions of rights and wrongs in a
                  government. If so, a man might claim a right to two wives, or claim children that
                  are not his own, to the prejudice of others.
               
                  Jeff. O yes; it is a political right; but it is a State right, and
                  not a national right, or a national wrong. It is a right under the common law of
                  the State where it exists—a law known to all nations to rest upon the principle of
                  having existed time out of mind. Thus, any principle in the organization of
                  society, having existed time out of mind, is held to be a fixed law, and is the
                  great arbiter in decisions in common law; and the common law can not be set aside
                  without revolution. Slavery existed in the Southern States prior to the
                  Constitution, which also guarantees it to them. They have, then, a double claim to
                  it: that of the Constitution, and that of the common law, neither of which can be
                  set aside without revolution. Suppose you conquer the Southern States, and free
                  their slaves: must you not set aside State rights and the common-law principle, or
                  the Southern people can again adopt the slave system?
               
                  Abe. When any political power is made an element for national
                  destruction, it is a national wrong, and the government has the right, in
                  self-defense, to destroy it. Too many State rights would swallow all the rights of
                  the nation. The government will not break the rights of a State first; but when
                  the States attempt to break the rights of the National Government, what then? I
                  would not break your head; but, if you attempted to break mine, have I not the
                  right, in self-defense, to break yours to save my own? The laws of self-defense
                  are recognized in every court, and in every land. If the States attempt to
                  revolutionize the General Government, and get revolutionized themselves, who is to
                  blame? The British Government, or the British forces, liberated slaves in the
                  slave States, in the war of the Revolution, and in the war of 1812. In war, we
                  must weaken the enemy by every means in our power, or we had better not go to war
                  at all.
               
                  Jeff. The British Government paid to the United States a large sum
                  of money for deported slaves, from the slave States, after the war of 1812. Do you
                  expect to be less generous to your sister States, when the war is over, than was a
                  foreign country?
               
                  Abe. We must preserve the Union; we must have but one nation and one
                  people to dwell upon this continent, and whatever sets up in opposition to it must
                  be leveled down.
               
                  Jeff. The different States form the nation, and the preservation of
                  the whole can never be effected by destruction of the parts. The amputation of an
                  arm will not preserve the entire man. He may still live, but not the same; less
                  powerful in war, less bold in attack; he is a cripple.
               
                  Abe. Ah! I would not break a State, or an arm of the body politic; I
                  would only break a cursed political power that poisons the virtue of a State—that
                  subtle gall that makes a daughter strike her mother.
               
               
                  Jeff. What's gall to some is healing balm to others. But, for the
                  argument, let's call it gall, and worthy of destruction. When you destroy it, it
                  falls not alone, but with it falls the sacred rights of freemen; because the blow
                  that kills this bitter gall kills State rights. Make one State out of thirty-four,
                  and it becomes a monster too huge to live on any common food.
               
                  Abe. Big things can live as well as little ones, only they should be
                  properly organized. All bodies are under the control of the head. In the language
                  of the English poet, 
                     
                        "What if the foot, ordained the dust to tread,
                        Or hand, to toil, aspired to be the head?"
                     
                  
               
               The head must teach unruly members, and bear itself above the whole, or suffer
                  dissolution.
               
                  Jeff. But if the head ordains the hand the dust to tread, or puts
                  foot in pocket, woe betide the man.
               
                  Abe. The head must know the general good, and look to all the parts;
                  instruct the hand and caution give the foot, that, bearing down with pressing
                  heel, no one shall suffer.
               
                  Jeff. Our body politic is complicated. No one dissection serves the
                  cause. It is a whole family, composed of equal frames, each one having arms and
                  head. But for the common good they all have chosen a common head, to rule in
                  certain things.
               
                  Abe. Then this common head is still the superior head, and must rule
                  the rest, or all must go to pieces.
               
                  Jeff. Yes; must rule in foreign fields, direct the combined arm
                  against a foreign foe, or against unruly heads who assume too much at home, but
                  not when to destruction.
               
                  Abe. But when this body is startled by domestic heads at home, and
                  all set together to slay the common head of all, what then? when they press him to
                  the wall, shall he strike in self-defense, or give up the ghost?
               
                  Jeff. A blow, even in self-defense, must be aimed with gracious
                  care, lest, in killing those without, you slay all within.
               
                  Abe. A blow to kill a certain pride, or clip a lock on a rebel head,
                  that does not grow on those within, can scarce affect them.
               
                  Jeff. A lock, though gray, black, or brown, that grows on a rebel
                  head in rightful law, when shorn by an unrelenting hand, will set up a precedent
                  that shaves the heads of all.
               
                  Abe. It is a grievous thing that such a lock should grow, that
                  breeds dissension, engenders strife, makes such a family quarrel, gives no rest or
                  peace at home, but always forebodes danger. Let's clip it, though death to all
                  ensue.
               
                  Jeff. Would you so tarnish the memory of your ancestors, for the
                  slaves carried away by the British in the war of 1812? A majority of the
                  commissioners at Ghent, who obtained the stipulation for indemnity, were Northern
                  men—Adams, Russell, and Gallatin from the free, and Clay and Bayard from the slave
                  States. If the slaves captured in this
                  war are to be paid for, God save the "greenbacks!" If not, God save the memory of
                  Northern statesmen!
               
                  Abe. The Union must be, saved. All that hinder its salvation must be
                  displaced. We have no other guarantee for liberty than the salvation of the Union.
                  The government of our fathers is pressed to the very door of dissolution by
                  traitors, North as well as South. In this crisis we must not stop to inquire a
                  man's creed or his birthplace. If he is not for he is against the government—a
                  patriot or a traitor. When the work is done—when the Union is saved—it will then
                  be the duty of the government to rectify the wrongs that may have been inflicted,
                  especially upon the loyal. Traitors must take the consequences. The government can
                  scarcely interfere with the slaves of loyal men; at least, not without a
                  recompense.
               
                  Jeff. The slaves of loyal men are like Tom Watson's deer: 
                     
                        In joyous early times, and backwoods life,
                        A party went out to hunt, and camped
                        By a certain stream called Little Fork.
                        And with the rising of the morning sun,
                        Hunting deer they went, two by two, save Tom
                        Who went alone, and traversed the woods
                        The livelong day, and with the setting sun
                        Returned to camp. His comrades lively sat,
                        In merry chat, around the burning coals.
                        "Ah! what luck?" said one, as Tom walked up.
                        "Good luck" said Tom, "I've killed a dozen deer."
                        "Where? where? where?" said all of them at once.
                        "Two I hung on Pleasant Hill, hard by the
                        New-built church. Four are left on Roebuck Ridge,
                        Right west of Potter's-field, on chestnut-trees.
                        Five are strung in Greenwood Swamp to elm-trees,
                        And face the east, right on the public road.
                        And one I left on Little Fork, right at
                        The Bailey Ford;" and Tom Watson sat down.
                        "Bob and I straight have come from Pleasant Hill,
                        Passed the new-built church, and saw no deer,"
                        Said Bill. "We, too, have come from Roebuck Ridge,
                        Passed round the Potter's-field, and saw no deer,"
                        Said Joe, "And we have come from Greenwood Swamp,
                        Along the public road, and saw no deer,"
                        Said Sam and G. Tom Watson looked sad,
                        And rising up, he said: "I hunted down,
                        The Little Fork; when near the Bailey Ford,
                        A big buck bounced up. I leveled down
                        My fowling piece and shot him through the head,
                        And hung him on a sweet-gum-tree, right at
                        The Bailey Ford." Just then, George Clifton came,
                        And said: "I have hunted up and down
                        The Little Fork and crossed the Bailey Ford."
                        "Did you see Tom's deer?" said all at once.
                        "No, I saw no game." Then Tom, laughing, said:
                        "I take my boasting back; but, sure as fate,
                        I crossed the creek right at the Bailey Ford,
                        And looked with all my eyes, and in the mud,
                        Hard by the shore, I saw the D——d thing's track."
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               "LA sakes, boy! I don't bleave in no such doins. Dis chile knows white folks; dey
                  ain't gwine to gib yer any ting 'cept some old clothes, done wor'd out. White
                  folks jist de same in de Norf as dey is in de Souf. You heard me!
               "Den dem big fat hogs, what's killed here ebry year; when you go way from here,
                  dem hogs gwine to be to hunt for. You heard me!
               "And den dem soldiers dat come here and take away Miss Cora, wid all dem guns
                  pinting round nuffen but one little woman; la sakes! what do you 'speck ob
                  'em!—whar de principle? No use in talkin'; white folks is white folks. Don't dis
                  chile know plenty ob 'em, dats come here from de Norf, and got niggers, and what
                  ob' em? Is dey any better dan our folks? La sakes! Call nigger up fore day; den
                  tink nigger ought to lib widout meat. You heard me!
               "When niggers gits to be white folks, I gib you my head for a foot-ball. Nigger is
                  nigger, and white folks is white folks; dat's de way to tell it. But you 's goin';
                  I know you 's goin'. No use in talkin'; I can't stay here by myself,' said one of
                  Colonel S——'s colored women to her sable lord, the next day after Cora was
                  arrested.
               The negroes, being left to themselves, and having had the promise of freedom by
                  Major Six, took this as a favorable opportunity to emigrate; and, after
                  appropriating many little things about the premises to their own use, departed for
                  the land of freedom. 
                     
                        The cock rested on his favorite limb;
                        All his pullets sat by the side of him;
                        The watch-dog lay beneath the front door-still,
                        And the pulse of the Colonel's yard was still,
                     
                   when he returned home, after many days' absence, prepared with men and means
                  to take his negroes to Texas.
               The indications about the premises were sufficient evidence of the whereabouts of
                  the negroes. The Colonel said he regretted not the loss of the property, but
                  pitied the poor creatures, for he thought they would be the greater losers. He had
                  previously learned the fate of Cora, and supposed that she had been taken for a
                  ruse to get hold of him; and he departed to parts unknown, with these
                  reflections:
               "Should Christian hands be stained with innocent blood, then the hand of the
                  Border Ruffian will know no mercy! My life is spent—my race is run almost unto the
                  end. But should they harm a lock on that child's head, then I will sell the
                     drooping end of a weary life at a
                  price, in weight of blood, so big that no such bargain has ever yet been made. I
                  can lose my negroes, my land, my house, every thing save my child; but when on her
                  they lay a Vandal hand, no covert ever grew too thick to conceal revenging ball.
                  For the present I will lie low and watch the salvation of the land. I will go to
                  Mingo; he is an old friend. I think he is not identified with these late troubles.
                  In him may I not find some consolation?"
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVIII.
               
                  
                     
                        THE cold, lifeless clay of a father's form,
                        Borne by children's hands through wind and storm,
                        O'er the ashes of his honest labor,
                        To the portals of a faithless neighbor;
                        His limbs laid straight by his wife and daughter,
                        With eyes turned down in rivers of water.
                     
                  
               
               MINGO is the appellation by which we call a child that was born of poor parents,
                  in the State of Indiana, in the good old time of President Monroe's
                  administration. At that time the country was new, and times hard upon the
                  settlers. School-teachers were scarce, and schools, like angels' visits, few and
                  far between. The parents of Mingo failed to educate him; but he grew up in those
                  happy days of our country's prosperity, when the voice of the whole country
                  applauded the government of our fathers, when the apple of discord was yet in the
                  blossom. Mingo was taught in early boyhood that when he met an American, he met a
                  fellow-citizen; whether he hailed from Maine or Georgia, Mingo shook him by the
                  hand as his countryman.
               
               In the administration of Andrew Jackson, Mingo left his country and his home. Like
                  his father, he took his ax upon his shoulder, and went in front of the tide of
                  emigration West, and settled on the western border of Missouri. Uniting his fate
                  and fortune with a Western girl, he, like many others, obtained a title to land by
                  living upon it. Industry and frugality made him a quiet and peaceful home, at
                  which he remained until the gold excitement of 1849-50. Fired by a desire for
                  wealth, he determined to go to California. He became associated with Colonel S——
                  in that enterprise; made the trip, and got more experience than he did gold. He
                  was ever after the firm friend of Colonel S—— and Burtice, though he took no
                  interest in the settlement of Kansas; for he was now a prosperous farmer and
                  father of a large family. His eldest son had left him, and was reported to be with
                  the rebels. Some said that he was with Don Partlo; others that he was a
                  bushwhacker. Mingo remained at home with his wife and seven little daughters. The
                  shades of night covered his peaceful home. Five of his daughters, yet in the
                  summer of childhood, were softly and sweetly sleeping; the two eldest, entering
                  the spring of womanhood, were assisting their mother in the evening's work.
                  Solitary and alone sat Mingo. The burning coal upon his hearth-stone glimmered in
                  the glory of its element. Colonel S—— entered the room, when the following
                  conversation ensued:
               "I hope you are well, old friend," said the Colonel.
               "Yes, I am in health of body, but not of mind. These are terrible times, Colonel,"
                  said Mingo, gravely.
               "These are the times that try men's souls," rejoined the Colonel.
               "I have determined to take no part in the matter from the beginning," said Mingo,
                  seriously.
               "Ah! my old friend, don't you recollect the fable of poor Tray—how he was
                  unmercifully beaten, for no other cause than being found in bad company?" said the
                  Colonel, sharply.
               "I have endeavored not to be found in bad company, that is, what the Feds
                  denominate bad company. You know, just between you and I, in confidence, I
                  associate as much as possible with Union men, and I never talk my sentiments,
                  except to some such person as you. I have been feeding the Doctor, over here, on
                  soft corn, ever since this fuss began. You know he is a strong Union man, and very
                  intimate with the Federal officers," said Mingo, earnestly.
               "Actions speak louder than words,' is an old proverb; and, John, you
                  know when they can't catch the cow, they sometimes take the calf; and when they
                  can't catch the calf, may they not take the cow? My poor daughter is paying the
                  penalty of a father's sin," said the Colonel, gravely.
               "Ah! yes; I did all that I could to persuade John not to go. I told him that he
                  should remember his old father, and his little sisters, and, for our sakes, he had
                  better take no part in this unrighteous
                  quarrel. But John is hot-headed, and has gone. I could not stop him. I am honest
                  in this: I have tried to keep the peace. I have done nothing with my own hands. I
                  wish this thing was settled," said Mingo, sorrowfully.
               "Our enemies are sharp in accusation. They say you must not give aid or comfort.
                  You can not feed a rebel, or his horse, without giving aid and comfort. I know you
                  have done that," said the Colonel, stoutly.
               "Well, then, in the name of God, my own son, and my neighbor boys, that have been
                  used to my house for so many years, to go and come as they please, could I turn
                  them off? I have never turned off a Federal soldier, or a hungry man of any party.
                  If they find fault with me for this, I can't help it. You know I have no learning,
                  and I can't read all of those military orders and proclamations. I get the Doctor
                  to read them for me; and I am trying to do right," said Mingo, earnestly.
               "You intend to stand your ground, then," said the Colonel, slowly.
               "Yes, I will not run. I have never done any thing to run from. The Doctor says
                  that they can not hurt me, under any rule of civilized warfare. The Doctor is a
                  good Union man. He cautions me about the boys coming here. I asked him to tell the
                  Federals to come, and I would treat them with much kindness," said Mingo,
                  exultingly
               "Beware of the Doctor; beware whom you trust these times. I could trust the
                  government. I would not run from the head authorities of the United States; but
                  those Kansas fellows, you know, have an old account to settle with us and think,
                  with United States authority, they can pay up the old score. And, as Shakspeare
                  says, I fear they will better the instruction.' I don't intend them to have a
                  chance at me. True, they have destroyed my property; but, when they get me, they
                  will have to pay for me. Now, tell me where John is?" said the Colonel, softening
                  his voice.
               "Before God! I don't know," said Mingo; and they parted.
               "Turn the soldiers loose," said Loudfork, addressing Major Six, one cold November
                  evening. "It is the only way we can stop this infernal bushwhacking;" and the
                  jobbed the butt of his musket into the mud, as he repeated, "Turn the boys loose,
                  and the bushwhackers will leave here faster than the contrabands go to
                  Kansas."
               A moderate person would think that the Major had turned himself loose long since.
                  But that something might happen to frighten the bushwhackers, the Major said to
                  Loudfork: "Cry havoc! and let slip the dogs of war."
               'T was evening, and the ground was damp. Mingo had fed his stock, and seated
                  himself quietly by his fireside, to take a smoke.
               "La! pa, yonder come soldiers!" exclaimed one of his little girls, as she ran into
                  the house, much frightened.
               
               "Let them come, child," said Mingo, continuing to smoke his pipe, very
                  unconcernedly.
               "Do hide, my dear," said Martha, in a soft and tender voice. "They will not dare
                  to hurt me and the children; but, I fear they will take you away, or harm you in
                  some manner, on John's account." She smiled as she pointed out the secret
                  retreat.
               "No, let 'em come; I am not afraid of 'em," said Mingo, stoutly.
               The conversation was suddenly closed, for the shadow of Loudfork soon darkened the
                  door.
               "Come in, gentlemen, and make yourselves at home," said Mingo, addressing himself,
                  very politely, to "United States uniforms."
               "Yes, I guess we will make ourselves at home, for a short spell," said one of the
                  soldiers.
               "You are my prisoner," said Loudfork, tapping the old man on the shoulder.
               "O! for God' sake," said Martha, clasping her hands; "You shan't."
               "You shan't," said the eldest daughter, thrusting herself between Loudfork and her
                  father.
               "Stand aside, little one," said Loudfork, drawing his sword across the face of the
                  affrighted girl.
               "Be quiet, my children; they will not hurt me," said Mingo.
               "No, we will only take you to head-quarters," said one of the
                  soldiers.
               Mingo was now conducted to the front yard, and made give information of all his
                  stock of cattle and horses. Several soldiers remained in the house.
               "What have you hid here?" Said one of the soldiers to Martha, as he opened a
                  closet-door.
               "Nothing but some tow," said Martha, in anguish.
               "I vill vetch out the devil," said a deluded Dutchman, as he threw a shovelful of
                  burning coals into the closet.
               "O! my God!" said Martha, as the pile of tow blazed up. Seeing no effort made to
                  stop the fire by any of them, Martha said to them, stoutly: "Men, do you intend to
                  burn us up?"
               "No, ve vill burn your house, and leave you for the devil to burn," said the
                  Dutchman.
               The fire was now fast spreading over the room. Martha and her children seized a
                  portion of the furniture and ran into the back yard with it. When the house was in
                  full blast, some of the soldiers threw the furniture back into the flames. The
                  remaining soldiers had, by this time, Collected the stock, both horses and cattle,
                  every hoof on the place, and were preparing to start.
               Having mounted Mingo on his finest horse, Martha now went to Loudfork, and said,
                  imploringly:
               "I hope you will not take my husband far away, or keep him long, as you see my
                  situation, with all these little children in the cold."
               "Dare is a fire; go and warm them," said the Dutchman, as he pointed to the
                  burning house.
               Martha now gave way to tears, and prayed to God for her children.
               The soldiers, with Mingo and his stock, slowly wound over the hill, and were soon
                  lost to view.
                  
                     
                        The rainbow hooped the eastern sky—
                        The melting clouds passed softly by;
                        The sun had sunk behind the trees;
                        Twilight hung on the western breeze.
                        The shades of night were gathering round
                        A dying man, stretched on the ground,
                        Whose blood was sinking in the sand,
                        And leaving cold both foot and hand.
                        No ear to hear his piteous moans,
                        Or witness of his dying groans.
                        His spirit to his God has fled,
                        And left his body cold and dead.
                        Reader, start not; for you must know
                        This murdered man is our Mingo!
                     
                  
               
               "Mother, I had rather freeze than go to that house; you know they have not treated
                  us right," said Mingo's eldest daughter to her mother, when the soldiers were all
                  gone.
               "Yes, my child; but these little ones: what can we do with them?" said Martha,
                  mournfully.
               It was now dark, and Martha and her children still lingered around the burning
                  wreck.
               "The Doctor is an old hypocrite," said one of the girls.
               "Mother, I do n't want to go to sleep," said one of the little ones.
               Martha looked wistfully toward the Doctor's house, and still they lingered around
                  the embers of a once happy home.
               The morning star silvered the old straw-shed—the little ones were closely nestled
                  in the straw. Martha and the two eldest girls sat over them, and talked and cried.
                  The gray light of the morning came; but the little ones were buried from their
                  late fright: the innocent balm of sleep held them from the troubled world.
               "O mother! do not waken them," said one of the girls, softly.
               "Hush! yonder comes the Doctor; probably he has some news," said Martha, starting
                  up.
               "Good morning, madam; you seem quite desolate," said the Doctor, coldly.
               Martha wept aloud.
               "The old man lies just over the hill, madam. I am compelled to be in town, on
                  military business, in half an hour." And the Doctor put the spurs to his
                  horse.
               Nimble feet sped o'er the ground for a few minutes. "O mother! he is dead," said
                  one of the little ones.
               "There is no other chance, mother: the men are all gone. There are none this side
                  of town," said the eldest daughter.
               "If his hand was just loose from that bush," said Martha, as she wept aloud.
               Mingo had been shot through the lungs: he lay on his back; his left hand rested
                  upon his breast; his right held a small shrub with the grasp of death. The girls
                  were resolute and determined; Martha assisted a little, and they carried the body
                  of Mingo to the Doctor's house.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               "HAVE you heard the news?" said Little Ben to the editor of the Platte
                     Country Post. Then, as he dug a hole in the ground with his toe,
                  continued: "Mingo has been killed in cold blood; his house and others burned to
                  the ground, and the devil let loose generally."
               The editor shook his head, and seemed to say mentally, in the language of Solomon,
                  "There is a time to be merry, and a time to be sad; a time to rejoice, and a time
                  to weep; a time to be awake, and a time to sleep; a time to be silent, and a time
                  to speak."
               "Very many reports, my son," said the editor, as he passed on.
               "Halloo, Ben! have you engaged papers for tomorrow?" said a comrade, coming
                  up.
               "Yes."
               "How many?"
               "Same old number."
               "Why do n't you go it strong? To-morrow is a big day."
               "Don't care; can't sell many papers."
               "O! you do n't try hard."
               "No use. These editors put me in mind of Joe Slater hunting old Barns's oxen."
               "How so?"
               "Well, old Barns sent Joe into the woods to hunt a pair of his oxen, and Joe staid
                  a long time; and when he came, old Barns said, 'Did you find the oxen, Joe?' When
                  Joe cleared his throat, he said, 'I found one of them, sir, and drove him up, and
                  put him into the pasture.' 'Well, Joe,' said Barns, 'did you see or hear any thing
                  of the other one?' 'Yes, sir; I found him, too, and drove them both up together,
                  and put them into the pasture.' So, these editors, when they hear any news, tell
                  part of it today, and part to-morrow; and sometimes they do n't tell the other
                  part at all. And when you offer to sell a paper to a man, he looks at you just
                  like he thought you were going to swindle him out of five cents."
               "Ben, I do n't believe you are Union."
               "Yes, I am as good a Union as any boy in St. Jude."
               "Full-blooded?"
               "No; I'm a half-breed; I thought you knew, Mother is a Secesh."
               "Ha! ha! ha! I thought there was a blue streak about you."
               "Blue streak or black streak, I want to sell some papers. I'm going to have a new
                  pair of shoes agin Christmas, if I have to steal 'em."
               
               "Hush! I believe the cars are coming."
               And they sped to the depot.
               "Jist hand me the reins, and I will drive to that county sate in three hours,"
                  said an Irish coachman, as the military authorities were disputing over the proper
                  escort to accompany the United States mail.
               The Blue was crossed; the coach rolled slowly down a long hill into a dense
                  forest, followed by a dozen United States uniforms. "Holy Jasus!" said the
                  Irishman, as a long file of armed men entered the road before him.
               "Throw down your arms, or you are dead men!" said Don Partlo, in a shrill and
                  piercing tone.
               The Federal soldiers obeyed, for they were out numbered two to one.
               Under a thick cover of brush Don Partlo ripped open the mail-bags. In casting his
                  eye over a bundle of letters, one drew his special attention. He said mentally, "I
                  have seen that P made before, in other places, and under other circumstances." He
                  had seen it made in the sand, many years ago, in Kansas, by little Cora. It was as
                  familiar to him as the lover of heaven. The letter was quickly torn open, and
                  proved to be from Cora to her father's friend, Preston, in the East. It gave a
                  short statement of her situation, and requested his assistance with head
                  authorities, for her release. Cora had managed to slip the letter out of her
                  prison by the hand of one of her attendants.
               "Ah!" said Don Partlo, "it will take Preston three days to get a shirt ironed, to
                  attend to any such business as that. I know Aunt Polly too well on that head.
                     By heaven! I will liberate her! I will give them no
                  such trouble, no such gratification. Give me forty men and a dark night, and I
                  will liberate her."
               And Don Partlo looked sadly upon half that number. Then he refolded the letter,
                  directed it as before, and laid it gently in the mail. When he had taken every
                  thing from the mail that suited him, he bade the coachman onward to his
                  destination, paroled the escort, and departed.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXX.
               GENIUS is an aged man, with venerable aspect and silver beard. Unlike the heathen
                  gods, he rules no particular element, but lends a helping hand to all. The poet,
                  author, architect, teacher, navigator, statesman, orator, theologian, general in
                  the field, and all the others, even in the simplest avocations of life, may
                  consult him to advantage. He lives not in a sealed house—he dwells in the open
                  air; he is not found in high places, neither in the schools. 
                     
                        He lives in the wind, and rides on the breeze;
                        Dwells in the forest and tenants the trees.
                     
                  
               
               Thus contemplating, my attention was again called to another conversation between
                  Jeff and Abe. I was substantially as follows:
               
                  Abe. I was on the Oliver plantation, in the Mississippi Valley, in
                  the winter of 1836. I heard it announced that at Christmas there would be some
                  negro weddings. I was somewhat curious to witness the ceremonies, having never
                  seen a negro wedding. Old Oliver had sent to Virginia, that fall, and purchased
                  chased twenty young negroes; ten men and ten women. He told me that he always
                  purchased an equal number of men and women, so each man on the plantation could
                  have a wife, which I thought a very good consideration, but wondered if he ever
                  thought how little choice he gave the poor creatures. But enough of that. There
                  were to be ten weddings on Christmas eve. So I was dying of curiosity to see the
                  ball come off. At the appointed time I repaired to old Oliver's house, where the
                  ceremony was to be performed, the negro quarters being close by. I was sitting in
                  conversation with old Oliver, during which time he informed me that, some four
                  weeks since, twenty young negroes had been brought to the plantation; that he had
                  given them until that night to make their choice among themselves of husband and
                  wife; that he would marry them all in a few minutes, and then they would have a
                  dance. Old Oliver had just concluded his story when a large company of negroes
                  appeared before the door. I sat in amazement. The negroes were all still as death.
                  Old Oliver raised up a little, but still reclined on his sofa. Two young negroes
                  stepped out into the center of the room. Old Oliver said the ceremony, taken in
                  part from the Bible, which I have forgotten; but it was short. They retreated, and
                  two more came up to the altar, and so on until nine couple were united in the
                  solemn bonds of wedlock. There was then a pause. Old Oliver straightened up, and
                  fixing his eye upon a tall negro that stood by the door-side, addressed him as
                  follows:
               
               "Well, Joe, you and Jane are the last. Both d——d ugly—beauty is only skin deep any
                  way—why do n't you come along?"
               "Well, Massa," said Joe, "Jane don't want me, and, 'fore God, I do n't want
                  her."
               "The h—ll you say," continued old Oliver, in an angry tone; then softening his
                  voice, the said, "My money is all spent; I can buy no more negroes this year. I
                  can not afford to give you separate houses; you will have to bundle together; so
                  you had as well come along."
               Joe intimated that they could tenant the same house and not be married. Old Oliver
                  shook his head, and I had some doubts myself, though I pitied the poor creatures
                  from the bottom of my heart.
               Old Oliver straightened himself up and said: "I will not permit such foolishness;
                  come along."
               Joe and Jane slowly assumed their position, and stood, as a monument of the abuse
                  of the slave power.
               
                  Jeff. Money is the root of all evil, said a wise man. Hard cases
                  must and will appear in all ages and among all nations. I often think of Susan
                  Seldom. Bright and beautiful girl! She lived in a Northern village, though the
                  same may happen anywhere. Susan was an only daughter. Her parents had been in good
                  circumstances, but hard-favored fortune had reduced them to a low estate, and a
                  mortgage was hanging over old Seldom's house. The court was at hand, and, without
                  some remedy, the whole family must be turned out upon the cold charities of the
                  world. A wealthy old bachelor fancied Susan. He saw his advantage, and proffered
                  the assistance, but on one condition. Susan detested him. The old people thought
                  it was a childish whim; he had money and was respectable; he had experience and a
                  sober head to guide her in her wayward fancies. 'T was Sunday, and the sun was
                  down. The shades of night were gathering in the corners of old Seldom's parlor. A
                  few books lay scattered over the floor. The old man sat in the center of the room
                  with a melancholy look; by his side sat his helpmate, faithful and true, for
                  five-and-twenty years. In front of them Susan had fallen on her knees; her eyes
                  were flooded with water, and her lips uttered: "O father, I can't!" Old Seldom
                  walked the floor, and Susan buried her face in her mother's lap. Old Seldom passed
                  out of the door, and his wife said: "Poor man! he will never stand this shock." A
                  new idea entered Susan's brain—it was suicide. She saw, in her imagination, her
                  father hanging to a beam. With a wild, hysteric laugh she bounded out of the door
                  and called her father. The wedding-day was set, Susan and the old bachelor were
                  married by a minister of the Gospel, and not as old Oliver married his negroes.
                  Susan said "Yes," with her lips; but, O God, her innocent little heart never made
                  the confession.
               Five years had passed away. Two policemen, of Irish descent, in a distant city,
                  under cover of night, passing a house of bad repute, drew around them their great
                  coats to protect them from the rain.
               
               "What mout that be floundering in the mud, just there?" said Mike.
               "By Jasus, 't is no baste," said Dennis.
               "O God! a drunken woman!" said Mike.
               "And we'll be after taking her to the light," said Dennis.
               The golden rays of the gas-light fell softly on the face of the once beautiful
                  Susan Seldom.
               
                  Abe. Many years ago, in the proud State of Kentucky, I attended
                  church, on a beautiful sunny Sunday, in the golden month of October. It was a
                  meeting of the Baptist persuasion, and a glorious, warm meeting. An elder of
                  deserved reputation had delivered a glowing and eloquent sermon; then came the
                  shaking of hands among the church members. Captain Riverman, and old acquaintance
                  of mine, and a leader in the church, shook my hand with a glowing warmness that
                  seemed to say that he was in love, with all mankind. The meeting was over, and I
                  had an invitation to go with the Captain and his family to dinner. As I dismounted
                  my horse, the Captain and his lady drove up to the yard fence in a fine carriage.
                  We all passed through the front yard and approached his residence at the back
                  door. A negro boy, some fourteen years of age, was seated on the door-step. Both
                  of his arms and one of his legs were fastened together with a large chain, made
                  for drawing logs with oxen. His countenance was cast down, and sadness had settled
                  deep in his heart. I hesitated. The Captain warmly invited me in, and then
                  explained that he intended to send the boy to Arkansas, to a cotton plantation in
                  which he had an interest, and the rascal, finding out his intention, had run off
                  and given him some trouble, and was only chained for the present, until the party
                  was ready to start—and the Captain continued the conversation—that he would be
                  better off, but the rascal did not want to leave his mother, and she could not be
                  spared from his Kentucky farm. I had by this time, lost all faith in the Captain's
                  religion, but passed off the evening as best I could, and departed. My last look
                  at the Captain's beautiful residence was clouded with a black man in darkness and
                  in chains. How sad the reflection.
               
                  Jeff. If I understand the Scriptures, all men are under condemnation
                  from the fall of Adam. Prior to the Christian Era, sacrifices were offered to the
                  living God; but since the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the way has
                  been opened, and a plan set up whereby all men may be saved. Having premised thus
                  far, we venture to affirm that the coming, the death, and resurrection of Christ
                  was to remove the original sin; and, in this sense, we propose to look at the
                  negro; and, as an antediluvian, I affirm I that he is not a man at all, of which
                  we have any account. But if you say the posterity of Adam were preserved in the
                  ark with Noah, then I answer, true; Noah preserved three sons, Shem, Ham, and
                  Japheth, together with the fowls of the air, and all cattle and creeping things
                  upon the whole face of the earth.
               
               Now, Shem had five sons, Japheth had seven, and Ham had four sons.
               When the waters were assuaged, and the land was dry, Noah and his sons went out
                  from the ark; and Noah planted a vineyard, and built a wine-press, and drank of
                  the wine, and was drunken. And Ham regarded not his drunkenness. And Noah awaketh
                  from his wine, and said, "Cursed be Canaan. A servant of servants shall he be unto
                  his brethren." First: Why should Noah curse Canaan, who was innocent of Ham's
                  offense, at least as much so as Cush, or any one of the others of Ham's sons?
                  Second: If that curse turned Canaan black, at the time, why was it not mentioned?
                  And, third, why should Canaan be a servant to Ham's other children? It appears
                  that the curse was put upon Canaan, the fourth son of Ham—or, as I take it, the
                  adopted son of Ham—for it is said that Ham was the father of Canaan. It is nowhere
                  said that Ham is the father of his other children. The word father,
                  in the sense used here, means protector. The practice of adopting children is very
                  ancient. Josephus, the historian of the Jews, says, in his
                  "Antiquities of the Jews," Book first, chapter 7, page 31, "Now Abram, having no
                  son of his own, adopted Lot, his brother Haran's son." But if you say that Canaan
                  could have no other father—that all mankind, save Noah and his sons, were drowned
                  in the flood—then I answer, the same historians, both sacred and profane, who give
                  us an account of the flood, give us the account, also, of another family, diverse
                  to that of Noah, whom they denominate giants. If there was one, why
                  not two? All tribes of the negro have descended from the Canaanites, and to claim
                  that they are men, equally endowed with the Fathers of the Church, is
                  preposterous. The great Teacher said, "Go ye into all the world and preach the
                  Gospel to every creature." This does not mean that you should preach the Gospel to
                  your horse; yet, your horse is a creature. If you reproach me for calling the
                  negro an animal, then, I answer, the proudest emperor that ever graced the throne
                  of an empire, is an animal; at least, he has an animal body and animal
                  propensities; but, I admit, an immortal soul. No reasonable man will contend that
                  an infant is accountable for the sin of Adam, or deny that an infant has an
                  immortal soul. If I deny that Christ died for the negro, I do not deny that the
                  negro has a soul. This I leave to the Judge of all the earth. Neither would I deny
                  to the negro the moral precepts of the Christian religion.
               I will now answer the question "Why should Noah curse Canaan?" Because Canaan was
                  not his natural, but his adopted son; and Noah plainly saw that he was fit for
                  nothing but a servant. Is there any other reason? Canaan was not the eldest or
                  most intelligent son of Ham; that honor is given to Cush, the father of Nimrod.
                  Then I repeat the question, Why curse Canaan, and subject his posterity to
                  servitude for all time to come? and for
                  what reason? Because his father laughed at Noah's drunkenness; an offense most
                  trivial, according to the moralist of the present day; yet that curse turned his
                  skin black, put short wool on his head, and clouded his intellect. If we are to
                  believe that Canaan was the real son of Noah, the curse would have been a miracle,
                  equal to the creation of a man; it is not mentioned in the history of the
                  Patriarchs, so far as regards any change of Canaan's person, and I take it for
                  granted there was no such change. But if you say I have not shown sufficient
                  reasons that Ham is not the sire of Canaan, and still contend that the negro is a
                  descendant of Noah, then, I answer, the curse of Noah entirely changed his
                  organization, and he ceased to be the equal of Noah's other children. He always
                  has been, and ever will be, their servant—a minor, irresponsible both to God and
                  man, in any other capacity than that of a servant. The angel of the Lord appeared
                  unto Abraham, and showed him the seed of the promise could not descend through
                  Ishmael, the son of Hagar, the bondwoman; and sacrifices were offered by the
                  Patriarchs without spot or blemish. The Universalist would save all men. All other
                  denominations would save their respective orders. But the great
                     Teacher said: "My kingdom is not of this world." The wild colt of an ass
                  bore him with gentleness, and the waves of the sea were stilled by his voice. And
                  he has said, "Servants, obey your masters."
               
                  Abe. Your reasoning puts me in mind of an old Indian tradition that
                  I heard far up the Missouri River, many years since. It is as follows:
               "The Great Spirit having formed the water and the land, the fowls of the air, the
                  fishes of the sea, and all animals and creeping things, was mindful that he had
                  not made a man to dwell on the face of the earth. And out of the dust of the earth
                  he made the first man, and laid him in the sun to dry. And when he was fully dry,
                  his color was black, and he loved to dwell in tropical climes, and bask in the
                  sun. This is the negro. And the Great Spirit was not satisfied with him. And out
                  of the dust of the earth he made the second man, and laid him in the shade to dry.
                  And when he was fully dry, his color was red, and he loved to sit in the shade,
                  and roam through the woodland. This is the Indian. And the Great Spirit was still
                  dissatisfied; and out of the dust of the earth he made the third man, and covered
                  all his outer parts with fig-leaves, and laid him in the shade to dry. And when he
                  was fully dry, his color was white. And when the Great Spirit called him, he had
                  made him a garment of fig-leaves. And the Great Spirit told him to go and till the
                  ground. And he made war on the Indian, and took the negro for his lackey-boy. This
                  is the white man."
               We are taught by the Holy Scriptures that we are all the descendants of Adam, And
                  out of Ishmael, the son of the bondwoman, the Lord Promised Abraham to make a
                  nation. The Scriptures abundantly teach us that Christ suffered for all men, and one of his immediate followers,
                  even one of the twelve Apostles, was a Canaanite. Your doctrine bars the negro
                  from the Church. Your idea of his origin is new. How do you account for the origin
                  of the Indian, and other barbarous people?
               
                  Jeff. The Lord promised Abraham to make a nation of Ishmael; but, at
                  the same time, it is clear that the seed of the promise could not descend through
                  Ishmael: not because he lacked nationality—not because he was not the son of
                  Abraham—but because he was the son of Hagar, the bondwoman. Had Hagar committed
                  any offense? The birth of Ishmael was approved by Sarai, Abraham's white wife,*
                   who thought herself barren. But the angel of the Lord wrought a miracle,
                  that the seed of promise might descend without spot or blemish. As to one of the
                  twelve Apostles being a Canaanite, he who spake as never man spake, said: "Twelve
                  have I chosen, and one is a devil." Among the twelve Apostles there were two
                  Simons, distinguished by St. Matthew and St. Mark as Simon Peter, and Simon the
                  Canaanite. St. Luke distinguished the latter by the appellation of Simon the
                  Zelotes, and, according to St. John the Evangelist, he was the father of Judas
                  Iscariot. See John, vi: 71; xii: 4, 5, 6; xiii: 2, 26. Now, it is clear that John
                  alludes to Simon the Canaanite, for he speaks of Simon Peter in drivers other
                  places, and always calls him Simon Peter, or Peter. As to Simon, the father of
                  Judas Iscariot, being a Canaanite, many generations had passed away since the Jews
                  drove the Canaanites out of the land; and although the great body of the
                  Canaanites had been slain or driven out, some remained, and adopted the Jewish
                  customs and religion. When Joshua took Jericho, Rahab turned traitor to her
                  people, and was saved alive, and lived with the Jews. See the book of Joshua,
                  chap, ii and xi: 24, 25. The Gibeonites were also made hewers of wood and drawers
                  of water, and remained among the Israelites. See Joshua, chap. ix. Simon had
                  probably retained the name of the Canaanite, with very little of the blood; it
                  appears, however, there was enough to brand him with the name of thief, and the
                  carrier of the bag. As to the origin of the Indian, and other barbarous people,
                  Solomon said: "Train up your children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."
                  The organization of the human mind is such that the continued neglect of the moral
                  faculties, from generation to generation, suffers them to sink into obscurity;
                  other passions increase, and the features are changed; the knowledge of the living
                  God is lost, and the man is a fit subject for another flood. Jesus has testified
                  that some are past redemption, and says: "Let such be unto thee as a heathen man
                  and a publican." See Matthew, chap. xviii: 15, 16, 17.
               
                  
                  *Many passages of Scripture state that Sarai was very fair.
               
               
                  Abe. Then you would oppose the preaching of the Gospel to the
                  heathen!
               
                  Jeff. It has never come to much.
               
                  Abe. What do you say of the command "Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every
                  creature?
               
                  Jeff. A man would look ridiculous preaching the Gospel to a
                  congregation of monkeys. His time would be thrown away preaching the Gospel to an
                  idiot. When St. Paul was sent to Rome, he was shipwrecked on the island of Melita,
                  and the barbarous people showed him no little kindness; they kindled a fire to
                  shield him from the cold and the rain, and the healed their sick. But if he ever
                  opened his mouth to preach to them the Gospel, it is not recorded. But when he was
                  arraigned before Agrippa, his eloquence moved the stony heart of the
                  unbeliever.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXI.
               
                  
                     WHEN thou art released from thy prison-house, O my soul, then Sorrow, and
                        her sister, Grief, will cease to stalk abroad through my fevered and
                        distracted brain. Then, dark Melancholy, with her lowering brow, lingering
                        on the wave of time, will cease to gaze on me. When this mortal clay to its
                        kindred earth returns, and mingles with the worthless trash of time, to
                        forget and be forgotten, then, O my soul, thou will mount on hope to
                        heaven.
                  
               
               CORA opened her eyes to the light of another day. Three mortal weeks she had been
                  confined in the town of ——, seeing no one but her attendants, two or three of the
                  servants of her landlord. In vain she had looked for a day of trial—in vain she
                  had endeavored to ascertain for what she was imprisoned. The golden rays of an
                  October sun danced against her window, as she looked out upon the broad and
                  beautiful prairies. Something seemed to whisper her that a crisis was at hand. She
                  thought over all her past life; she thought of her father, of the destruction of
                  his property, and of the imminent danger of his life; she thought of Don Partlo;
                  of her early and first acquaintance with him; of his present deportment; of his
                  desperate daring, and the dangers that
                  surrounded him; she thought of her mother's grave, and the blood seemed to hurry
                  through her veins, and the muscles of her frame became like iron; she looked out
                  of the window, and thought of throwing herself headlong to the ground from her
                  prison, which was an upper room, when something seemed to whisper in her ear—"No;
                  I will have revenge!"
               The day had passed almost away. A dark cloud that had hovered in the west was
                  drawing its mantle over the ill-fated town of —— and Cora drew a tattered curtain
                  over her window, to still the sound of the pattering rain. The door of her room
                  turned gently upon its hinges, and, for the first time since her flight with
                  Burtice from Kansas, she beheld the face of her Kansas father. Major Six drew
                  close around him a blue frock-coat, heavily mounted with brass buttons. Cora rose
                  to her feet, and stood like a culprit.
               "Ah! little one, you escaped from me once, but I have you now," said the Major,
                  forcing a smile.
               "So it seems," Cora replied, sadly.
               "You are getting a little tired by this time," continued the Major.
               "I have been ready to answer any charge against me since here I have been," said
                  Cora, firmly.
               "Madam, you can be released upon but one condition," said the Major.
               "Name it," said Cora, stoutly.
               "If you will place your hand upon the Bible, and swear, before high heaven, that
                  you will assist in the capture of Don Partlo, then you can go free." And the Major
                  stood very square before her, with his finger pointed at her face.
               "Is there no other way?" said Cora, in a measured tone.
               "None!" said the Major, stoutly.
               "Then I will rot in prison," said Cora, firmly.
               "That will not be permitted, either," said the Major, reddening up.
               "You make me assist you! No; never! never! NEVER!" And Cora dwelt
                  upon the never with an emphasis that seemed spoken by the heart
                  instead of the lips.
               "You can have your choice of two things," said the Major, pulling out a brace of
                  pistols.
               "Give me one, sir! I dare you," said Cora, pressing forward.
               "No," said the Major; "you must comply, or make up your last account." And he drew
                  back the hammer of the weapon, thinking to frighten the poor girl.
               "Shoot, coward, a defenseless woman!" said Cora, as she bared her
                  bosom, looking steadily in the eyes of the Major.
               The Major's hand trembled, his nerves gave way, his knees shook, and the pistol
                  fell to the floor, discharged by the shock of the fall. At the report, several
                  persons rushed into the room. The Major stood as white as a gravestone; Cora
                  rushed toward the door.
               "Stand back!" said the guard, lowering the bayonet onet on his musket. A strong arm grasped the barrel
                  of the musket and shoved it aside, as Cora fled through the door, like a bird out
                  of a cage. It was the arm of Jack Jolly.
               When Cora gained the street, she went a south course, at full speed.
               "Shoot! Shoot her!" was heard from several quarters. A Dutchman raised his gun,
                  and a lieutenant struck him on the forehead with the back of his sword. Cora
                  gained the woods, and was soon out of the reach of a musket-ball.
               By this time the Major had recovered, and explained how the pistol was fired, the
                  bravery of the girl, and his own lack of nerve—over which the whole camp had a
                  hearty laugh.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXII.
               ON a cold and silent wind the shrill note of the iron horse announced the arrival
                  of the mail, in an opulent Eastern city, at twilight.
               "What is the news, Preston?" said his better-half, as our host threw off his
                  great-coat.
               "Well, nothing of much interest; only they have got our little lady friend, Cora
                  S—— in a military prison, and she has managed to write to me for assistance," said
                  Preston, slowly, as he handed over the letter.
               "You do n't say! I suppose she has been holding and handing things. I always
                  thought she was aristocratic. They will be apt to bring her down a little from
                  where she is stuck up. Mercy! where are my specs? I never can keep any thing in
                  the right place. You paid fifteen dollars for those specs, Preston; and that, too,
                  in good money—none of your 'green-backs,' or notes of discount. And, for the soul
                  of me, I can't make Bridget*
                  do any thing right about this house. I do wish you would
                     
                     *Bridget, an Irish servant-girl.
                   get me a girl that could be managed. Well, let me
                  have your specs; I am so anxious to read this letter. Your specs are entirely too
                  old for me. Is it plainly written? Yes; with a trembling hand—poor creature! Who
                  is that at the back door, Bridget?"
               "A boy for cold wittles, marm," said Bridget, as she left the room.
               "Cold victuals! Preston, why on earth do n't people go to the poor
                  house at once? If you would get a girl that is not to stuck up, one that knew her
                  place, and would eat cold victuals, this house would not be such an everlasting
                  depot for cold victuals."
               "I thought you were going to read the letter, madam," said Preston, warmly.
               "Well, I 'm dying to read the letter; but when I see things going wrong, I can't
                  help talking. A woman has nothing but her tongue; and while I live, I will use
                  mine. But, let's see: 'My dear friends and honored sir'—Well, Preston, that's a
                  good beginning—'I this moment have found the opportunity to send you and Aunt
                  Polly a line, and am oversad to inform you that I am a prisoner of war, in the
                  town of ——. For what offense I am thus held, for I have been here over two weeks,
                  God only knows. I am ready to meet any charge that may be brought against me, but
                  none appears. I was taken from my father's house by an armed band, and brought to
                  this place, and expected some accuser to appear before me; but non appears: nor am
                  I even permitted to see an officer. Now, I can't believe that the government
                  designs to treat a private, unoffending person in this way; and as you reside
                  close to the Capital, I trust you will look into this affair.'—Ah! the writ of
                     habeas corpus is played out, Preston," and
                  Aunt Polly continued: "'You can not have forgotten the kindness of my father in
                  years past. And, however you may differ from us in politics, you will certainly
                  befriend me against gross injustice. I scarcely need tell you that I have no
                  friends here. Most of our true friends have gone South. My father is, at this
                  time, driven away from home, as a Secessionist.'—Ah! yes; resist the devil, and he
                  will flee from you, Preston.—'His property is nearly all destroyed: all his
                  negroes, with many others, have fled to Kansas.'—Poor creatures! they have seen
                  the daybreak of liberty at last. Preston, have these spectacles busted?"
               "No, madam; they are all right," said Preston, leaning foward.
               Aunt Polly rubbed her hand across her forehead, saying, "Dear mercy!" and
                  continued to read: "'Many houses have been burned in our neighborhood. But all
                  this is not so hard as to be deprived of liberty without a cause.'—Without a
                  cause! O dear me! Now, Preston, let me manage this business. But let me read the
                  balance:—'If slavery has to be abolished in Missouri, I trust the white people
                  will be left free.'—Ah! Congress will abolish slavery in Missouri; she need n't
                  fret about that."
               "Congress had as well abolish the back door to our kitchen, madam."
               
               "Why, Preston! I've a great notion to call you a Democrat."
               "It's breaking a principle, madam, breaking a principle. Much as I hate slavery, I
                  would not break a principle of our government to destroy it."
               "Well, if Congress was to abolish the back door to our kitchen, I guess I would be
                  some the wiser of Bridget's tramps."
               "She would go through the window, madam, go through the window. And so the States
                  will go through the window, madam, whenever Congress tries to rule them in local
                  matters."
               "Now, Preston, let me attend to this business, if you please. But let me place
                  this precious document under my pillow. Merciful God! Bridget has put the wrong
                  cases on these pillows; she has no more knowledge of taste than you have of
                  polities, Preston."
               "Tut, tut, tut, madam!"
               "Why, Preston! you know you are a straightforward church-member; and Father Grimes
                  says, 'Religion is one thing and polities is another, but genuine things must
                  harmonize.' Do call Bridget, and I will order supper—or order it yourself—she
                  never cooks any thing to suit me, no how. She is no cook; she can neither cook,
                  wash, nor iron; she is only fit to scrub. 'T is a pity people do n't know their
                  places in this world, Preston. If you would only get me a cook, and leave her to
                  do the drudgery. But, mercy on us, the freed people that have gone to Kansas will
                  have to be supported, and the agent will be calling on us for money; and here we
                  are paying Bridget seventy-five cents a week, and she too much
                  stuck-up to eat cold victuals. What does she know of high-seasoned victuals? To
                  hear her talk, you would think she was raised in some stylish family; and this day
                  she knows no more (except what little I have learned her) of style, than you do of
                  polities, Preston."
               "Tut, tut, tut, madam, I am no politician; but I do n't, like the signs of the
                  times—signs of the times, madam!"
               "You go over to the Democrats! No; never, never, never—while my head is hot! Why,
                  Preston, Preston! there is the Tradings, the Twadels, and the Twineguts, all first
                  men of this city, and I would be ashamed to invite one of them here to tea; and
                  old Father Grimes, poor old soul, he has been our faithful pastor for
                  three-and-twenty years, and perhaps he would refuse to come here and pray. Read
                  your Bible, man; read your Bible, and leave State affairs to the proper
                  persons."
               "The Bible says that men do not gather figs of thorns or grapes of thistles,
                  madam."
               "There you go, off the handle again, into some dark corner of the Scriptures.
                  Judge not, lest you be judged, Preston. And there is plenty for you to see to
                  about this house, without bothering your head with State affairs. For my part, I
                  have no time to look after politics. I am run to death to look after Bridget and
                  the balance of the low trash that you have about the house; and it's always pay,
                     pay, pay, and nothing done right,
                  Preston. It seems to me that you have a knack of getting the meanest, lowlifest,
                  triflingest servants that's going in the country; and it's always pay, pay, pay,
                  and little do they know how to spend money when they get it—and money ought to be
                  saved these times. I tell you, Preston, old Father Grimes says we will be sorely
                  taxed to free this country from the ungodly barbarism of slavery."
               "If ever, madam, if ever."
               "Preston, Preston!" and Aunt Polly raised her specs with her left hand a little,
                  and, looking straight down her nose at the doubtful man, continued: "I tell you
                  what it is, Preston, our party—and when I say our party, I mean the
                  anti-aristocratic, antislavery labor-saving machines of New England—have thrown a
                  cast, and will stand the hazard of the die. They will drive slavery out of this
                  country—or they will drive this country out of slavery—one of the two."
               "People have to be educated against slavery, madam, educated against it."
               "Then I wish school would commence, and I could be a teacher. I would have me a
                  cowhide and a dunce-block, and strict rules, I tell you, Preston. Hush! did the
                  hall-bell ring? Some one is coming in. Bridget! Bridget! Preston, for the Lord's
                  sake, do n't say any thing about politics."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIII.
               "PEACE and Plenty breed cowards. Plenty is the mother, and in her generous womb—a
                  fountain full of new-made eggs—wooes the spreading wing of peace. Chickens from
                  this dung-hill stock will strut and crow, and scratch the ground, and when vermin
                  creep the yard, sneak off to roost. And few we have of any other breed. A generous
                  mother, with the fountains of her breast, has made her children pets, that hug,
                  with selfish squeeze, a little raked-up trash.
               "Upon my soul, if I could raise a hundred men that would not tremble when the
                  thunders roll, or turn aside from white-faced Death, who place on life a value
                  less than wind, that is not the life of freemen—men of such a compass and a soul,
                  like Richard on the battle-field, would give a kingdom for a horse—I would march
                  upon the Federal camp, throw down the battlements and walls of all their bravery,
                  like Joshua did, with old ram's horns, the walls of Jerico.
               "Bravery, like Julius Cæsar's brow, frowns on pale faced Fear, and lives a moment, as it would a
                  thousand years.
               "Hark! is that the sound of horses' feet?" and Don Partlo laid his ear unto the
                  ground, and caught the coming sound of troopers. Then, hastening to his camp, he
                  said, "Brave men, the foe is right upon us, in numbers ten to one! But stay your
                  blood: let not the bounding veins convey it unto your heads, to muddy up your
                  sight and spring your nerves. Think not of home, of friends, the future, or the
                  past; think not" of hearts entwined in yours, or, lingering back within a citadel,
                  in shape of Eden's queen, and, with the lazy wheels of time, beat a pulse high in
                  hope for you; nor the blue eyes they cast on you; nor the, soft voice that said
                  good-bye, but of your guns. See that they are right. Equipped and harnessed with
                  your accouterments, follow me unto the crest of yonder hill; there we will make a
                  stand, as far apart as ground allows, and fire when I wave my hand. Repeat,
                  without an order, until all of us have fallen."
               Then, down a sloping hill, a hundred men, all mounted and uniformed in coats of
                  blue, came dashing forward, marking time; and up the next ascent they rose in
                  double file, until within a short stone's cast of its mortal crest. Don Partlo
                  waved his hand. Bang, bang, bang! the smoke flew up in thickening cloud, and
                  leaden balls went whistling through the ranks, without respect of heads. The
                  scanning of two hundred eyes could see no man. Again, again, the smoke went up.
                  Blue-coats measured on the ground the length of uniforms. 'T was more than flesh
                  and blood could stand. The Federals fly: 
                     
                        Disorder and confusion reigned
                        Until a safe retreat was gained.
                        Then rage and remedies filled the camp;
                        And reinforcements mustered up, with
                        Itching and ambitious ears, to hear the
                        The tale of ev'ry vanquished man, who said,—
                        "Out of the ground the rebels rise!
                        You never get a glimpse of one:
                        They shoot you down before your eyes,
                        And never let you spring your gun!"
                     
                  
               
               Reinforced, and strong with foot and horse, again they reach the hill, surround it
                  with their spreading files, search it up and down, and find nothing save their own
                  dead men, marred by traitors.
               Don Partlo, with his thirteen men, have crossed a hundred hills, and snugly, in
                  some lone retreat, are telling tales of love, of honor, or some old woman's
                  visions of witchcraft. Still, in this rebellious State, a macaroon is found
                  boisterous in the rebel camp, cursing Uncle Sam: then, in the Federal
                  camp, with greasy tongue, as loyal as the best.
               By this means, Don Partlo is found, far from any public way, encamped within a
                  hewn-log house, and with sixty men, or more, surrounded at the break of day, whose
                  captain shouted, in thunder tones, "Surrender up yourselves?"
               Don Partlo said unto his men: "'T is but Death, a necessary end of this eventful
                  life, that, soon or late, must come to every man; and in him there is no dissembling. He never takes the breadth
                  of a hair not his own. In him there is nothing bad; but the manner of his coming
                  is sometimes most horrible. These long and trusty guns, that we have held as sure
                  and steadfast friends, have, by the dint of circumstance, become relentless foes;
                  and, in the front of this log-house, right on the bare ground, of them we make a
                  funeral pile. See! each man has, in each coat-sleeve, a Colt's revolver, carried
                  close concealed; and when I clear my throat, let's slip to yonder friendly wood,
                  firing, as we go, right and left; and if we chance to meet with honest Death, he
                  comes in such a friendly way that leaves the little we have left a name without a
                  spot of tarnish."
               The Federals saw the guns laid down, and thought the rebels vanquished. In humble
                  gait, and with down look, the rebels walked right up to their broad circling foe.
                  Don Partlo cleared his throat, and then it thundered. Great clouds of smoke
                  encircled rebel heads. No Federal ball did take effect upon the retreating brave.
                  This friendly wood had soon concealed the last escaping traitor. Then curses from
                  the Federal ranks, loud and long, were hurled on the time most graciously given
                  for this surrender.
               When Don Partlo and his thirteen men had gained a safe retreat, and all were
                  gathering up around the daring leader, he stood as pale as Death's
                  old horse, and trembled like an aspen leaf.
               "What on earth dost thus affright you?" said all of them at once.
               "When we were in the house, and bayonets stood as thick as hemp, nay, when we came
                  forth and cut our way through that fearful crowd, when bullets whistled on every
                  side, I felt no fear. But when we had gained the friendly woods, the din and sound
                  of mortal strife had died upon my ears. All at once, and like a flash of lightning
                  from the clouds, my last night's dream did glimmer through my brain, and it has
                  almost vanquished me."
               "The dream! the dream!" demanded all of them at once.
               "I slumbered heavy in the latter end of night, and had this woeful dream, out of
                  which the noise of attack awakened me; and, by some strange logic of the brain, it
                  was concealed until we were out of danger.
               "I dreamed that the Federals came, as they have done; surrounded us on every side,
                  demanding base surrender; that we fought them, as we have, and made our victory
                  good. But, a little after that, a lovely maid, more dear to me than all the world,
                  a prisoner now in Federal hands, had made a safe and sure escape; and, by
                  directions from a friend, was coming to this same log-house, to blend her fate
                  with ours, who arrived but just in time to be recaptured by the foe.
               "Dreams are but eddies in the current of the mind; cut off from record's gentle
                  stream, playing strange, fantastic tricks. I have dreamed of hideous, bloody
                  heads; faces awry and wan have danced before my brain; have dreamed of vermin and
                  d——n dens of fleas; cold-blooded snakes have crawled upon my flesh; I have tumbled headlong down from
                  high and rocky cliffs; nay, have dreamed of death, the mattock, and the grave; the
                  worms that eat through dead men's flesh have crawled upon my skin. And I have
                  raised from all of them without a shade of fear; but this one doth affect me."
               Don Partlo wept, and all of them, murmuring, said, "'T is strange to see the
                  bravest man in all this world act the woman."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIV.
               "TRADITION is a hopeful thing, plain as the face of day, and bare of ornament;
                  holds up the deeds of men, long after they are dead, to the gaze of all the world.
                  'T is by tradition that we do know the course of our fathers, who, long before we
                  entered on this mortal stage, played their parts in this hopeful life. And lo!
                  whose tracks are, left, "footprints on the sands of time," to guide us from the
                  shallows and the shoals of all their crossings? But to follow in a beaten path, a
                  road made smooth by him that went before, is bare of honor; and I had rather die a
                  wanderer in fields of doubt, perish in the hills of time, or sink beneath the
                  swamps of fortune, than fail to pluck from hard-handed fate a plume of honor.
               "Hark! Some one comes to interrupt my meditations. Good morning, Jeff. With you I
                  would like another conversation; for still I doubt your moral views of slavery,
                  and now that we are all alone, let's have it.
               
                  Jeff. Proceed.
               
               
                  Abe. You have pressed the doctrine earnestly that the slave is a
                  "minor;" you call a hoary-headed colored man, leaning upon a staff, by the
                  appellation of "boy!" Where is the break in nature that prevents a colored man
                  from passing out of boyhood, or childhood, that can't be found in any other race
                  of men? What I understand by the word "minor," is one under age, one not arrived
                  to manhood. By the word "minor," as applied to other races, I would understand an
                  Indian boy; a German boy, a heathen boy; and would not suppose you to mean an old
                  Indian, an old German, or an old heathen; and how do you say that an old negro is
                  a "minor?"
               
                  Jeff. It is conceded among all nations that parents shall have the
                  control of their offspring; and when they die, their children are their natural
                  heirs. It is a law of nature that the father should conduct the son through his
                  tender years. Through this minority the son is responsible to the father, and the
                  father to his country. In nature, child-hood passes away by the slow process of
                  growth and development. In law, it passes away at the twinkling of an eye, as
                  sudden as the break of day. Our Constitution has determined the time that all
                  heirs of the government shall be men: at twenty-one years of age, heirs of the
                  government are men and citizens. Negroes and Indians are not heirs of the
                  government, and are forever minors to our government.
               
                  Abe. I know the Constitution excludes Indians. If it excludes
                  negroes, I have never been able to find the passage. The word "minor" is not in
                  our Constitution. I know that the qualified electors are determined by every
                  State; and, in some of the states, the negro is held as a "minor." By what rule is
                  he, in no circumstances, an heir to the government? If he is a thief, the
                  government punishes him—if a murderer, does he not hang? If he resembles you in
                  this, why not in other things? A boy that has lost his father and his mother—nay,
                  all his kindred—and does not heir a dollar in the world, is the heir of his
                  government. It is his inheritance, his birthright—he is one of the sons of his
                  native land. And what better claim can one have than his birthright? One born in
                  France is a Frenchman; born in England, is an Englishman; and if born in America,
                  is he not an American? Has the negro no nationality? is he a vagabond upon our
                  continent, without "a local habitation or a name?"
               
                  Jeff. Figuratively speaking, there is a spirit and a body to almost
                  every thing. When we look at compacts or printed parchments, there is a spirit and
                  a letter. The spirit of the Bible is life ever-lasting; the letter is dead in
                  itself. The cold forms of religion are but crumbling clay; the spirit of religion
                  is the embrace of the Lord Jesus. The Constitution of the United States is silent
                  upon many things, all of which are reserved to the States respectively, or to the
                  people. All communities will determine the state of their society. The order of society has not been changed in some of
                  the States since the adoption of the Constitution, and that form of society was
                  guaranteed to them by the spirit of the Constitution, however silent may be the
                  letter. The negro is not without nationality; he is an American bondman. He is not
                  a vagabond: he is heir to his master's care. He is not without a habitation or a
                  name; he is the servant of his master, according to the appointment of God,
                  through the prophet Noah.
               
                  Abe. I know the negro is a servant, and the property of his master,
                  or has been. I know, also, that is the mere effect of a political power. When that
                  power ceases to exist, and he is no more the servant of his master, but a free
                  man, where is his habitation and his name?
               
                  Jeff. You ask me a question that can only be answered by revolution.
                  I can only give you my opinion, and that is, his friends must make him a country,
                  a habitation, and a name. He can not live as an American freeman: any such an
                  attempt will end in his annihilation.
               
                  Abe. Has not the boast of Americans been that this is "The land of
                  the free, and the home of the brave?" Is there an American that is not proud of
                  this republic? Can a government be a republic that does not extend liberty to the
                  people? Is there a man so dead to the spirit of liberty that does not wish all
                  men, everywhere, free?
               
                  Jeff. When freedom is spoken of, every one has an idea of what is
                  meant; for every one has known what it is to live in freedom, and also what it is
                  to live and act under restraint; but, then, it is obvious that different persons
                  feel in freedom according to circumstances. Things which infringe
                  upon the freedom of some, have no such effect upon others. So that in
                  the same situation in which one would feel free, another would feel
                  himself in bondage. Hence, it is evident that though all
                  have a general idea of what freedom is, yet all have not the same idea of it. For,
                  as different persons would not all be free in the same circumstances, it follows
                  that freedom itself is not the same thing to all. Of course, the
                  kinds of freedom are as many and various as the kinds of laws are by which we are
                  all governed. An aged man is free to go to church with an old garment. Force it
                  upon a young man, and he would think himself in bondage. An aged
                  woman is free with her head beneath the covering of a cap; nay, is even proud of
                  it. Force it upon a young woman, and she would be in bondage. A man
                  educated to the law feels free in his library. Force him to the plow, and he would
                  be in bondage. A negro educated as a slave is free at his master's
                  work. Force him to provide for himself, and he is in bondage. Against
                  the negro, as a race, I have no prejudice. If you would make him a free man,
                  educate him for freedom. If you wish to overturn the decrees of Heaven, go at it
                  with rationality.
               
               
                  Abe. I can not believe that Heaven ever designed that one man should
                  be the slave of another. I know the ancients held servants, and bought and sold one another, and that the Jews
                  were four hundred years in slavery, but have ever looked upon it as a relic of
                  barbarism. I think mankind are but one family, and all have the natural right of
                  freedom. Your speculations, in our last conversation, upon the origin of the
                  negro, are not orthodox.
               
                  Jeff. I know not what you call orthodox. I know of no book that I
                  esteem above the Bible; and if we are to take that as true, the negro, as an
                  antediluvian, is not a man at all, of whom we have any historical account; but
                  that he is an antediluvian, I make no question. After Noah's curse upon Canaan, we
                  find him in the capacity of a servant. In that capacity is he a man? He is, to
                  some extent. What constitutes a man? Why, responsibility. One may
                  have the body of a man, but, without the mind, he is not responsible. Has the
                  negro a mind equal with the white man? History answers, no. Is the negro
                  responsible? He may be, to some extent. Is he to be regarded equal with the
                  Fathers of the Church? By no means. Why? Because we believe in the God of Abraham,
                  of Isaac, and of Jacob. In what relation does the negro stand to those Fathers? Go
                  to the history of the Patriarchs, and we will see. If we are to believe the negro
                  the descendant of the Canaanites, you will find that God showed it unto Abraham
                  that the seed of the promise could not descend through a Canaanite.
               "And Abraham was old and well-stricken in age; and the Lord had blest Abraham in
                  all things. And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over
                  all he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh; and I will make thee swear
                  by the Lord God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a
                  wife unto my son (Isaac) of the daughters of the Canaanites." Thus commences the
                  twenty-fourth chapter of the book of Genesis; let the doubtful read the whole
                  chapter. Then turn to the twenty-seventh chapter and forty-sixth verse: "And
                  Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if
                  Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the
                  daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?" Heth is a son of Canaan.
                  See Genesis, x: 15. And you will find, by the commencement of the twenty-eighth
                  chapter of the book of Genesis, that Isaac blessed Jacob, and charged him that he
                  should not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. The prophet Zechariah, in
                  speaking of Messiah's coming, in the fourteenth chapter and
                  twenty-first verse, holds this language: "Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and Judah
                  shall be holiness unto the Lord of hosts; and all they that sacrifice shall come
                  and take of them, and see the therein: and in that day there shall be no more the
                  Canaanite in the house of the Lord of hosts."
               When did the Canaanite grow out of all this reproach? or who hath lifted the
                  weight from his shoulders? Where is the man that striveth against God? 
                     
                        The Ruler of the heavens and earth
                        Knows best our lineage and birth.
                     
                  
               
               
               Any person that will read the ninth chapter of St. Paul's epistle to the
                     Romans, in connection with the history of Abraham, Isaac, and
                  Jacob, in the book of Genesis, will find a ready solution of the following
                  remarkable passages in the ninth chapter of Romans: "For they are not
                  all Israel which are of Israel. Neither, because they
                  are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but in Isaac shall
                  thy seed be called. Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. Shall the thing
                  formed say unto him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Hath
                  not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto
                  honor, and another unto dishonor?"
               It is very clear that the Apostle is here alluding to races, and not to the
                  ungodly of his own race. By reading the history of the Patriarchs, you will find
                  that Abraham had other children, but the promise was in Isaac. You will find that
                  Esau married a Canaanite woman, and sold his birthright to his brother Jacob for a
                  mess of pottage. For the end of Esau, see the book of Obadiah. When we consider
                  the different races of men, how appropriate the language of the Apostle: "Hath not
                  the potter power over the clay," etc., to make two races of men, or one race and
                  an limitation, or master and servant?
               
                  Abe. Do you affirm the doctrine that a negro is not a man at
                  all?
               
                  Jeff. No; only that he is an inferior, subordinate man; that to him
                  less is given and less required.
               
                  Abe. You take him into your churches, baptize him, and teach him
                  that he has a soul.
               
                  Jeff. The moral precepts of the Christian religion should be taught
                  to all.
               
               
                  Abe. Does the Scriptures teach us that there are degrees in
                  heaven?
               
                  Jeff. We know that there are degrees on earth. By keeping the
                  commands of God we have the hope of heaven. When I return from that promised land
                  I will tell you if there be degrees in heaven.
               
                  Abe. I never expect to see you, you dark sinner. I believe you would
                  destroy the best government in the world, and all the hope you have of heaven, to
                  keep the negro in slavery.
               
                  Jeff. I can't see that slavery has any thing to do with the life of
                  the government. Why do n't the Northern people abandon the use of cotton, sugar,
                  rice, and tobacco, the products of slave labor? They wish to put the rebellion
                  down, and some of them to destroy slavery, yet they bid fifty cents per pound for
                  cotton, thus enabling the slave-driver to fight them as hard with one-fourth of a
                  crop as he did in the beginning with a full crop. Besides, you increase the value
                  of the slave's labor, and his master will hold on to him with greater tenacity.
                  Abandon the use of those articles produced by the slave, and he will become as
                  valueless in the South as he is in the North.
               
                  Abe. Ah! yes; but there are other countries that use these articles.
                  Besides, it is the design of the God of the Universe that the products of every country should go into the channels of
                  commerce. We want the cotton, but we want the negro to raise it as a freeman.
               
                  Jeff. Then you will never get your wants, you dark sinner. Every one
                  that knows the negro, knows him to be a thriftless, ambitionless sluggard, who, if
                  left to himself, would not raise cotton enough to cover himself.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXV.
               "O WHISKY! Whisky! thou spirit of friendly corn and sneaking thief of time! How
                  oft you come, with friendly jokes and honest observation, bearing lights of
                  justice in each hand, with shades of wise men's brows, to stir the sleeping, lazy
                  sparks within the storehouse of the brain, to shine as brilliant lights! Amid the
                  light of all this train, with necromancing hand, you steal the noblest gift of God
                  to man. Where are your lean and hungry 'brats,' bereaved of parents
                  and of care, to stalk about the world? Where are your widows, that have watered
                  with their tears the bloated forms you've made? Where are the hearts that are
                  bleeding and have bled beneath your crushing wheels? Where is the man that's bold
                  enough to say you never touched his blood?
               "To the Federal camp—to seas of trouble—to h—ll! but I will not follow whisky."
                  And Tom Steady thrust the butt of a double-barrel shot-gun into the mud; and then
                  continued, addressing his companions:
               
               "Burtice is drunk; the country is overrun with Federal soldiers; we are in hourly
                  danger of capture. Burtice is not only drunk to-day, but he is drunk every day. He
                  that it suits can stay with him—to-morrow's sun will find me in some other
                  quarter. Burtice, through all the Kansas war, was a sober man, brave and skillful.
                  Then I would have followed him to h—ll's dominions; but now his bravery—for that
                  he never lacked—will lead us into trouble."
               The face of day smiled upon the eastern hills, as Burtice rubbed his eyes and
                  said, "Where are the boys?"
               "They have disbanded. Some have gone to the Southern army; some have hidden their
                  guns, and gone home to take the chances; and some have gone to the brush on their
                  own hook," said his faithful lieutenant.
               "Desperate men play desperate games. I tell you what it is: we can raise a troop
                  of minute-men, pitch into the country, and arrest Lord Dunmore. A Union man of
                  such a noted mark doth affect the country. By this daring, noble deed
                  we will gain some reputation."
               "No man that owns so many slaves can long endure the Union. Better let him
                  slide."
               "By red-faced Mars, the bloody god of war! if I can raise the men in all
                  Stumptown, I will have him before yonder eye of day again opes, its lid upon this
                  dirty ball."
               "My lord, you are in an ill humor," said the mistress tress of Dunmore Palace, as
                  the noble lord entered her parlor.
               "Yes; a little fretted. I had some sharp words with Captain Spear and Major Blade;
                  and they threatened to arrest me," said Lord Dunmore, rubbing his hands.
               "Let them dare! Why, arrest you! they had better arrest Abe Lincoln, upon my word.
                  When men get straps on their shoulders, they generally get too big for their
                  breeches. Give yourself no uneasiness, my lord; their threats were but on the spur
                  of the moment. There is the supper-bell. Come; you will feel better." 
                     
                        The shades of night were gathered round
                        A country house, all cottage-bound:
                        The slumbering slave dreamed in his rest
                        That the poor man is the one oppressed.
                     
                  
               
               "Be quiet," said Burtice, "or you will stir those d——d niggers! Some
                  of them are awake all times of night."
               Dunmore Palace was surrounded by the followers of Burtice. A hasty man burst open
                  the door, as Lord Dunmore jumped out of his bed.
               "Ah! you old sinner, we have got you," said Burtice.
               "O Lord! O Lord!" said Lady Dunmore, as she left the room.
               A young and accomplished daughter slept in a distant part of the house. Aroused by
                  this strange noise, she hastily dressed and rushed into her father's room, nothing daunted by the armed and
                  ugly men, exclaiming, in a soft and persuasive voice, "O men! brave men! my father
                  is the best Union man in all Missouri. He sent Major Blade to Stumptown, to drive
                  off the rebels."
               When the keen eye of the old man failed to warn the girl, he said, stoutly, "My
                  daughter, these are Confederate troops."
               The girl rushed into her mother's room, biting her lips, and uttering many long
                  and bitter curses, mentally, upon the heads of those who first inaugurated the
                  arrest of private citizens.
               "Massa, hoss ready," said an imp of Africa, as Burtice and his party left the room
                  with their prisoner.
               A November sun licked the frost of the morning, as Burtice rode up to a country
                  house many miles distant from Dunmore Palace.
               "Huzza! huzza!" rang in merry notes from the mouth of every coming trooper. The
                  inmates of the house rushed out to see the elephant. In double file
                  the troopers marched until Burtice said "Halt!"
               "Dixie! Dixie!" rang along the line. Two half-grown women sat upon the fence, and
                  sang that celebrated song in all its variations.
               
               Lord Dunmore turned down his eyes, and dropped a bitter tear of anguish, for his
                  heart was with the rebels.
               "Do take something," said the lady of the house, addressing herself to Lord
                  Dunmore, at the breakfast-table; and then, with a soft and persuasive voice,
                  continued: "I will insure your life for ten cents. The 'boys' will
                  not hurt a hair upon your head."
               Lord Dunmore grew more cheerful, and whispered in the ear of that
                  lady—"Do send word to my poor distressed family that I am safe."
               "Do with him?" said General Missouri. "Why, I will turn him loose. The arrest of
                  private citizens is like a war on women."
               Burtice was offered a place in the Southern army. The hankering spirit of friendly
                  corn lured him back to Stumptown. The decree had gone forth from head-quarters in
                     Missouri—Death to all bush whackers! Though Burtice did not
                  consider him self a "bushwhacker," yet his dissipation had rendered it impossible
                  for him to get followers, and one of two alternatives were only presented to him.
                  It was, first, to surrender himself to the Federal authorities; or, second, to
                  defend himself as best he could. He chose the latter. Squads of Federal soldiers
                  were passing in almost every direction through this part of the country.
               Burtice found it necessary to lay aside his gun; but he still retained a pair of
                  Colt's revolvers and a Bowie-knife, and resolved that he would not be taken alive.
                  It was difficult for the Federals to know him without information, or recognize
                  him as an enemy at a distance, as his weapons were concealed. Yet it was soon
                  known in camp that Burtice was in the neighborhood, and every means set on foot
                  for his capture. And, upon one occasion, Burtice took the horse of an officer, who had left his noble charger hitched to
                  the fence, and went into a certain house to look for Burtice. And when he made
                  inquiry of the inmates concerning Burtice, a lady, pointing out the window,
                  said:
               "Yonder he goes, riding off your horse."
               The officer was most furious for a few moments; but there was no other horse on
                  the plantation.
               "Where are your horses?" demanded the enraged man.
               "They have been 'pressed' into the service, sir," was the calm reply.
               Finding neither man nor horse, he resolved not to make war on women and children,
                  and quietly submitted to his fate, without swearing, until his comrades coming up
                  shortly after, and learning the particulars, laughed at him immoderately, and he
                  swore most furiously.
               Enlivened by this success, Burtice partook heavily of the "O be joyful!" and, as
                  the same party returned to camp, Burtice followed close behind them, riding up to
                  every house they had passed, and inquired if they had seen any "Feds;" and, on
                  being informed in the affirmative, he would clap the spurs to the officer's noble
                  charger, saying: "By h—ll! I'll catch 'em yet."
               The sun at last rose upon a fatal day to Burtice. He went early in the morning to
                  the town of ——, seven miles from the Federal camp, and commenced drinking in an "O
                  be joyful" house. Here he met many sunshine friends, some of whom were most
                  intimate, and very liberal with the "O be joyful!" Burtice lost his balance. A
                  macaroon sped to the Federal camp. Burtice was telling and hearing of hair-breadth
                  escapes, etc., when the voice of the wind said:
               "The Federals are coming!"
               Burtice rushed to his horse, and quickly loosened him from the post. As he raised
                  his left foot to the stirrup, the right refused to bear his weight. This
                  unexpected failure frightened the horse, who snorted and pranced, for he was a
                  high-mettled animal.
               By this time some thirty Federals were in full view, and several rushed
                  immediately upon Burtice, who, finding that he could not mount his horse, squared
                  himself and drew his pistols. As they rushed upon him, he kept pulling the
                  triggers, but produced no fire. A moment's glance revealed to him that they had
                  been deprived of their caps. A ball from a Federal gun passed through his bowels,
                  and they were still firing close upon him. No time was to be lost. He threw his
                  pistols at the heads of his pursuers, and then, rushing upon them with his
                  Bowie-knife, wounded one severely in the arm, as he threw it up to ward off the
                  blow. But bravery and resolution must fail and fall beneath both treachery and
                  power; and with it Burtice fell, pierced through the body with no less than four
                  musket-balls. He was taken, ruthlessly, to the Federal camp, where he soon after
                  died, cursing his captors with his last breath.
               Old Father Tearful, an aged and pious man, and great-uncle of Susan, the wife of Burtice, was
                  selected by the neighbors as the most suitable person to convey the sad
                  intelligence to the family. Leaning upon his staff, and with a heavy heart, he set
                  out, late in the evening, upon his mission. When he have in sight of the house
                  that sheltered the happy family, his heart faltered, and he paused. The smoke
                  gently rising from the chimney, and curling up toward the heavens, seemed to say,
                  "O, Father! do not disturb me?" A little reflection gave him resolution, and he
                  pressed forward to meet one whom he had often petted upon his knee in
                  childhood.
               The wife of Burtice, very different from him, was as temperate as the mother of
                  Sampson, endeavoring to bring up her children in the nurture and admonition of the
                  Lord. But she loved Burtice, and the old man knew it; and duty alone nerved him to
                  approach her with this sad intelligence.
               Let the reader imagine an old man, trembling with the weight of age, standing
                  before a woman, who, in the summer of her days, crushes and falls beneath the
                  weight of the "still small voice" from the old man's lips.
               Morning had come, and Uncle Tearful returned to the house of Burtice, to warn the
                  family of some arrangements necessary for the last honors due to the dead. The
                  utter derangement of every thing about the house told how sadly and how tearfully
                  the night had been spent. Susan had passed through her river of tears, and was sad
                  and calm. She silently lently listened to all the old man said. The old man's
                  attention was arrested by the loud sobs of a little son of Burtice, about six
                  years of age, who sat upon the corner of the hearth-stone. Uncle Tearful, willing
                  to be a comforter as far as possible, placed his hand upon the little fellow's
                  head, saying:
               "My son, don't weep: we all have got to die."
               "I know it," said the little fellow, rising up; "I am not crying for that: I am
                  crying because I ain't a MAN!"
               "Why, my son, there are five hundred Federals at the camp; and, if you were a man,
                  what could you do?"
               "I reckon I could shoot the man that took the caps off father's pistols."
               "Who told you that? I never——" and the old man looked at Susan.
               "I know you never told me; but you told mother, and I heard her, last night, when
                  she prayed; and she prayed for him: that's the way I know it."
               "My son, you must grow to be a man, and read the good Book that teaches us that we
                  must pray for our enemies, and those that despitefully use us;" and the old man's
                  voice trembled as he spoke.
               "I don't know what I will do when I am big; but I know, if I was
                     big now, I would n't pray for him."
               Susan gathered the child in her arms. The old man left the painful scene, leaning
                  upon his staff; and we will left you do the same.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXVI.
               "O! O! O! O is the first letter that a child learns. O-u-t—out of my
                  prison-house; out of the grasp of my enemies; almost out
                  of breath; out of friends; almost out of my senses; and
                  in the woods." And Cora sat down upon an old mossy log, for rest and
                  reflection.
               "Why did I not grab the fool's pistol? I may as well have had something to defend
                  myself with." And Cora looked all around for pursuers. Nothing met her eye save
                  the dense forest that surrounded her; for she was not pursued.
               And while we leave Major Six in deep conference with his officers, after the
                  escape of Cora, as explained in a preceding chapter, we will follow her.
               "O, you heaven-born infant!" said Cora, as she plucked a flower that came creeping
                  round the mossy side of the old log; "your rainbow colors remind me of the
                  covenant between the God of heaven and Father Noah: that God would restrain his
                  anger, and all the nations of the earth should be blessed."
               And Cora pressed the flower to her bosom; her nerves were relaxed; she no longer
                  thought of blood; she was herself again. But to find refuge. Being rested, she
                  plodded her way through the woods, taking a south-west course. Coming suddenly
                  upon a small neighborhood road, she hesitated. When a wagon hove in sight, being
                  driven by a negro boy some eighteen years of age, in which was seated a young
                  lady, marked with the equipage of fashion and style, Cora grew brave, as she said,
                  mentally, "The women are not persecutors."
               "Whoa! whoa!" said Little Sis to the negro's horses, as the wagon was rolling past
                  Cora. "Will you ride, miss?"
               "O Cora!"—"O Sis!" And the two girls were soon in each other's arms, regardless of
                  muddy wheels.
               Reader! you no doubt remember Cora and Little Sis, at the boarding-school in the
                  city of P——; the writing of compositions by Cora for Little Sis, and otherwise the
                  greatest childish attachment. Hear them patiently.
               "Cora, what in the wide world are you doing here?"
               "Making my escape from the Federal camp."
               "O, my God! you a prisoner; and for what?"
               "God only knows; perhaps 't is Southern blood."
               "O no, no, no; that can not be. Cora, my father is a colonel in the Missouri State
                  militia; but you must go home with me. I will guarantee your safety."
               
               "I appreciate your kindness; but I have escaped in a most singular manner, and
                  must make my retreat sure."
               Here Cora told Little Sis her whole story, and received that of Little Sis, which
                  was—that having paid a visit to a neighbor, her horse had broken loose, and as her
                  father's boy came by with the wagon, she had embraced the opportunity of returning
                  home in it. Now it was settled that, as Cora was afraid to call at the home of
                  Little Sis, the latter should furnish Cora with a horse and saddle, to enable her
                  to reach the house of a friend, some five miles distant, that evening, for the sun
                  was low. Matters being thus arranged, Little Sis held the negro boy's horses at
                  the gate, until he procured the horse, and Cora mounted and sped westward.
               While Little Sis is making some deceitful explanations to her mother and father,
                  we observe the negro boy that drove the wagon in solemn council with old Uncle
                  Ike, a colored fellow-servant.
               "I tell you, Uncle Ike, dat gal ought to be coch. She done got away. I heard her
                  talk to young miss. She mighty fraid de Major coch her. Dat's so!"
               "Well, den, why don't you go tell Massa Jim? He soon have her brought back; he do
                  n't care nothin' 'bout Sis."
               "Massa Jim ain't no Union man; he's just 'tending. I tell you, Uncle Ike, dat
                  blue-button coat have to come off'n him fore nigger gets to be white folks. Dat's
                  so. But yonder comes Sam Careless; he'll do to hitch to. I go tell him. He's going
                  right to de camp, by golly!"
               An interview took place between Careless and the negro boy; and while we leave Sam
                  on his way to camp, we will follow Cora.
               As the sun sank behind the western hills Cora entered the door of an old and
                  valued friend of her father.
               "Do n't stay, child," said Aunt Nancy; "Go into town, and there you will get with
                  the girls. God knows! they may hunt you. And leave the horse here. What if they do
                  find him? he belongs to Colonel Jim, one of their own stripe. God knows! they can
                  search this house until they are tired. That they have done before, often, often.
                  My child, I will tell them you have left here, and they had as well look for the
                  grave of Moses. Trust that to me, and go forward." And Aunt Nancy raised her
                  spectacles upon her forehead, as she continued: "If they fool round me more than a
                  necessary search of this house, I will knock some of them on the head with the
                  shovel."
               In the dusk of the evening Cora departed for the town of ——, where she was kindly
                  received at the house of Mr. —— by two maiden rebels.
               Loudfork had returned to camp from a scout upon which he was absent when Cora
                  escaped, and, placing one hand upon his hip, as he gently pulled his whiskers with
                  the other, said to Major Six: "I have had a conversation with Sam Careless, and he
                  received his information from an intelligent contraband; and, by James the Just, I know the very house to which
                  this mocking-bird has flown."
               "I think we will bring her back, and tell her that we only meant her to have a
                  little exercise," said the Major, gravely.
               "What do you want here?" said Aunt Nancy, as Loudfork presented himself at the
                  door, late in the night, musket in hand.
               "Want to see what's here, madam," said Loudfork, as he entered the room.
               Having searched all the rooms, Loudfork sent men to the stable, who, returning,
                  brought forth the said horse.
               "The person that rode this horse here, madam; we want that person. Those who
                  conceal are equally guilty with those that offend. We will take no excuse."
               "I conceal nothing, sir. You have searched this house—I think this is the ninth
                  time, and you never found the rappings of one's finger yet out of the way. Four or
                  five times you searched for my old man, whom I told you you would never find, and
                  then for guns, and then for contraband of war, as you said, and now you come to
                  search for strangers, and, I suppose, you will next come to search for the grave
                  of Moses; and I will have no more of this searching, and none of your impudence,"
                  said the old lady, as she gathered a large iron shovel, and chased Loudfork out of
                  the house. The party returned, taking Colonel Jim's horse to camp.
               Cora learned from the rebel maidens that Don Partlo was encamped in a hewed-log
                  house, some distance from the town of ——, in an out-of-the-way place; and one of
                  them agreed to accompany her on the following day to see him, as she hoped to
                  learn from him something of her father, and get his assistance in some way to
                  leave the country.
               While the girls were passing off the weary hours of the night in conversation upon
                  the dangers of the enterprise of the morrow, Major Six and Loudfork held a secret
                  and solemn caucus upon the case of Jack Jolly; the latter striving hard to bring
                  him to a court-martial; the former strongly insisting that he should, by some
                  stratagem, be shifted into a Missouri command. But no terms being settled, Jack
                  remained in the company pretty much his own commander. Long before it was light
                  the enthusiastic girls were on the road to the said hewed-log house.
               The morning sun had just unvailed his beaming face, and looked across the broad
                  and beautiful prairie, as Cora and Lue gained the summit of a hill that brought
                  them in sight of the hewed-log house. The curling smoke that arose from its roof
                  threw the girls into amazement. They hesitated. In a few moments they discovered
                  that the house was on fire, and surrounded by Federal soldiers. "O God!" said Lue,
                  grasping Cora by the hand, and they fled to the bushes. The house was soon burned
                  to the ground, and the soldiers, in a merry troop, left the premises. With
                  cautions feet and tearful eyes the
                  girls approached the smoldering ruins. "O God! is that a man's skull?" said Cora;
                  and Lue, with a long pole, turned over one side of a white earthen bowl.
               Having satisfied themselves, from all the appearances, that Don Partlo and his men
                  had either made their escape or were taken off as prisoners by the party that had
                  just left, the girls turned their steps toward home, where they arrived about the
                  middle of the day. Cora was much dejected, and Lue said "she would have a little
                  select party that evening, at which there would be none present but rebel people."
                  Still Cora was sad, and took no delight in the company, and her spirit refused to
                  be cheerful, both for her own commands and those of her comrades. It was now late
                  in the night, and some of the company had dispersed. A stranger entered the room
                  in company with one who was acquainted with the girls. He was recognized by no one
                  in that house save Cora. It was Don Partlo, in disguise. The spirit of our Cora
                  almost burst its prison-house. She trembled, and turned red and white, but managed
                  to conceal herself from the gaze of the company.
               Don Partlo artfully contrived to place in the hand of Cora a hastily-written note,
                  unobserved by the company, and departed.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVII.
               "BY two-faced Janus, the Grecian god, that saw the misty future of the world, and
                  knew the deeds of men before they were performed, if I could ope prophetic eyes,
                  and see that double-headed demi-god, I would invoke him on the spot to shape for
                  me an argument. But yonder comes my pale-faced friend, that holds such a holy
                  horror of color, armed with books containing deeds of men, both ancient and
                  renowned. I will descant from common sense, and own I have not read.
               "Good morning, Jeff. As you have come to close this argument, and, as you know, I
                  am a straight Republican, believing, with our sacred Constitution, that all
                     men are born free and equal, I must put upon you the burden of the proof
                  that could lead us otherwise.
               
                  Jeff. I do deny that men are born at all. I will admit,
                  for the sake of the argument, that children are sometimes born, but neither free
                  nor equal. They are born subject to their parents, and their parents are subject
                  to the laws of the society in which they live. The Declaration of American Independence, for to that, I suppose, you do
                  allude, simply means that no man in this country is born to rule, or born a
                  prince. Our fathers, when about setting up the government, thought it expedient to
                  declare that it should not be a monarchy. Hence the Declaration was appropriate to
                  this country—not to others. As to the all men, they could have only
                  meant those over whom the government had control.
               
                  Abe. That is pretty good logic; yet you can not shut your eyes to
                  the fact that the American Government is the cradle of human liberty; and with the
                  dissolution of this government must perish the noblest hopes of man.
               
                  Jeff. Liberty! O Liberty! In all the bloody revolutions that have
                  ever stained the earth, hast thou not been the watchword? A man has
                  only the liberty to do right.
               
                  Abe. But is it right that one man should hold another in bondage?
                  The Lord of Heaven gave to man dominion over the beasts of the field, the fowls of
                  the air, the fishes of the sea; but did he give him dominion over his fellow man?
                  There is the tug of war.
               
                  Jeff. I must again allude to the origin of the negro, or to our
                  first knowledge of him. Flavius Josephus, the learned historian of the Jews, in
                  Book I, "Antiquities of the Jews," chapter vi, page 31, section 3, holds the
                  following language: "Noah, when, after the deluge, the earth was resettled in its
                  former condition, set about its cultivation; and when he had planted it with
                  vines, and when the fruit was ripe, and he had gathered the grapes in their
                  season, and the wine was ready for use, he offered sacrifice, and feasted, and
                  being drunk, he fell asleep, and lay naked in an unseemly manner. When his
                  youngest son saw this, he came laughing, and showed him to his brethren; but they
                  covered their father's nakedness. And when Noah was made sensible of what had been
                  done, he prayed for posterity to his other sons; but for Ham, he did not curse
                  him, by reason of his nearness in blood, but cursed his posterity.
                  And when the rest of them escaped that curse, God inflicted it on the children of
                  Canaan."
               The laughing at a drunken man at the present day would certainly not be regarded
                  as a criminal offense; yet, in the days of the Patriarchs, drunkenness had not
                  produced the misery in the world that it since has. In the present organization of
                  society, Noah himself would have been the greatest offender. But we must conclude
                  that the crime of Ham was not very great; yet it was an offense.
               We find in the account of this affair, as given by Josephus, some remarkable
                     facts. First: He did not curse Ham because he was his son; for what else
                  is meant by nearness of blood? Second: When the rest of them escaped
                  that curse, (what rest? Cush, Miram, and Put, Ham's sons, we take
                  it,) Josephus gives no reason why they escaped; and what better reason can be
                  given than nearness of blood? God inflicted it upon the children of
                  Canaan. And why? Because they were of a
                  different blood, and only fit for servants. This is my interpretation of the whole
                  matter. Him that is zealous that there is but one family of man, let him hear the
                  same witnesses: Josephus—Book I, "Antiquities of the Jews," chapter iv, page 32,
                  section 1: "These kings laid waste all Syria, and overthrew the offspring of the
                     giants." Again—Book V, chapter ii, page 105, section 3: "There
                  were till then left the race of giants, who had bodies so large, and
                  countenances so entirely different from other men, that they were surprising to
                  the sight and terrible to the hearing. The bones of these men are still shown to
                  this very day, unlike to any credible relations of other men." And in the book of
                  Joshua, the sixth book of the Bible, you find, in chapter xii, verse 4: "And the
                  coast of Og, king of Bashan, which was of the remnants of the giants.
                  Them did Moses, the servant of the Lord, and the children of Israel smite."
                  Therefore, we conclude that the descendants of Adam are not all of
                  the race of men. To the truth of the account given of Adam and Eve, and of their
                  fall, we make no objection, but is that the whole truth, or all of it? 
                     
                        Did God reveal what beings people every star,
                        Or show to Moses what those nightly visions are?
                     
                  
               
               To the testimony of those ancient writers let me add the evidence of Sir Charles
                  Lyell, F. R. S. In his "Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man," chapter xx,
                  page 385, he says: "When speaking, in a former work, of the distinct races of
                  mankind, I remarked that 'if all the leading varieties of the human family sprang
                  originally from a single pair, (a doctrine to which then, as now, I could see no
                  valid objection,) a much greater lapse of time was required for the slow and
                  gradual formation of such races as the Caucasian, Mongolian, and Negro, than was
                  embraced in any of the popular systems of chronology. In confirmation of the high
                  antiquity of two of these, I referred to pictures on the walls of ancient temples
                  in Egypt, in which, a thousand years, or more, before the Christian era, the Negro
                  and Caucasian physiognomies were portrayed as faithfully, and in as strong
                  contrast, as if the like-nesses of these races had been taken yesterday. In
                  relation to the same subject, I dwelt on the slight modification which the negro
                  has undergone, after having been transported from the tropics and settled for more
                  than two centuries in the temperate climate of Virginia. I therefore concluded
                  that, 'if the various races were all descended from a single pair, we must
                     allow for a vast series of antecedent ages, in the course of which the
                  long-continued influence of external circumstances gave rise to peculiarities,
                  increased in many successive generations, and at length fixed by hereditary
                  transmission.'" Upon the evidence of Sir Charles Lyell, shall we assert the Bible
                  false? By no means. We choose to assert that it does not sustain the doctrine that
                  the family of man are descended from a single pair.
               
                  Abe. If the hypothesis that you maintain was correct in theory, the identity of separate races
                  would long since have been lost by amalgamation.
               
                  Jeff. By no means; they won't mix.
               
                  Abe. The contrary of that is of every-day observation.
               
                  Jeff. I know that the white and black will produce the mulatto. But,
                  like the balances, when there is equal weight in each end of the scale, they
                  remain stationary. But throw the half-blood to the original race, and in three
                  generations the mixed blood will all be gone, by the inevitable laws of nature. 
                     
                        "The stronger blood within the fruitful breast,
                        Like Aaron's serpent, swallows up the rest."
                     
                  
               
               
                  Abe. When you make the African a being of an inferior race—created
                  to be the slave of a superior race—every man who believes the Bible, or is at all
                  familiar with the truth of history, regrets the infidel doctrine.
               
                  Jeff. I have been a pretty close reader of the Bible, and I would
                  refer any white man, that believes the Canaanite to be his brother, to the seventh
                  chapter of the book of Deuteronomy. Moses was of the opinion that
                  the Canaanites should be utterly destroyed, but Solomon, the wise king of the
                  Hebrews, and man of God, held them as slaves. Hear Josephus, in the
                  eighth book, "Antiquities of the Jews," sixth chapter, page 172, section 3: "But
                  King Solomon subdued to himself the remnant of the Canaanites, that had not before
                  submitted to him; those I mean that dwell in Mount Lebanon, and as far as the city
                  of Hamath, and ordered them to pay tribute. He also chose out of them every years
                  such as were to serve him in the meanest offices, and to do his domestic work, and
                  to follow husbandry; for none of the Hebrews were servants (in such low
                  employments). He appointed also five hundred and fifty rulers over those
                  Canaanites who were reduced to such domestic slavery." A parallel to
                  this passage in Josephus you may find in Second Chronicles, eighth chapter,
                  seventh, eighth, and ninth verses. The word infidel is of easy
                  manufacture, and is often the port into which theologians sail when hard pressed
                  by any one who may chance to differ from them in their peculiar views of God and
                  the Bible. What constitutes belief in the Bible, if we are to reject its plain
                  passages unless they receive the favor of some sanctified brow? And as to the
                  truth of history—do you mean that there is a nation under the sun clear of the
                  tarnish of slavery? No, not even infidel France. And England! O,
                  virtuous England! Abolition England! Hear the testimony of
                     Shakespeare, who once looked through your bosom: 
                     
                        
                           "You shall mark
                           Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,
                           That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,
                           Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,
                           For naught but provender: and, when he's old,
                           Cashier'd."
                        
                     
                     OTHELLO, Act I.
                  
               
               
                  Abe. Such slavery as that to which you now allude is not
                     involuntary servitude.
               
               
               
                  Jeff. If it is not involuntary, I do not understand the language, or
                  the use of letters. Who would, of his own voluntary choice, be the slave of
                  another?
               
                  Abe. Yes; but those are hired servants. They can serve a master as
                  long as he suits them, and when he don't suit, they can get another.
               
                  Jeff. Yes; but when and where do they change the yoke of bondage for
                  that of a freeman?
               
                  Abe. I only say that their slavery is not involuntary.
               
                  Jeff. I only say that it is. They are born in circumstances that
                  admit of nothing else, only to live and die in bondage. Having no control over
                  their birth, they have no control over the yoke under which they are bound to
                  work. You say they can change masters. The meanest African slave in South Carolina
                  can do the same.
               
                  Abe. But they are often recognized as being of the blood with those
                  whom they serve, and are always treated kindly.
               
                  Jeff. The master of the African has the proud consciousness to know
                  that he does not enslave his own race. As to the kind treatment toward servants,
                  whether European or American, whether North or South, whether white or black, it
                  generally comes a little like a hard winter on the poor. They are not quite frozen
                  by the cold neglect of their superiors; for it is a general law of nature, that
                  the strong live upon the weak. In every department of her various channels, you
                  will find the strong oppressing and overrunning the weak. He that would alter this
                  law must assume divinity. In the language of the English poet: 
                     
                        "Better for us, perhaps, it might appear,
                        Were there all harmony, all virtue here;
                        That never air or ocean felt the wind,
                        That never passion discomposed the mind.
                        But all subsists by elemental strife,
                        And passions are the elements of life."
                     
                  
               
               
                  Abe. You never can convince me that there is no difference between
                  servants that are bought and sold, body and soul, and those that are hired. You
                  have said much in opposition to the freedom of the Canaanites. What evidence have
                  you that the colored people of this country are the descendants of the
                  Canaanites?
               
                  Jeff. I must confess that there is a difference between a bought and
                  a hired servant; but it is merely a matter of taste. All men are servants in some
                  sense. I do not believe the African would do well as a hired servant. Having less
                  of the stamp of the living God, his natural tendency is to barbarism and theft. If
                  we consult the Bible, we find the Prophet Moses, and others that consulted with
                  the living God, were of the opinion that the Canaanites should, in course of time,
                  be utterly destroyed. Their future destiny is in the womb of time. Who can see the
                  fate of that portion of them now in this country, when one portion of their
                  superiors say that they shall be free, and another portion of them say they shall
                  remain slaves? Does not a "still small voice" say that they may not
                  be at all? How many of the poor
                  creatures have felt the oppressing hand, in a northern clime, not of slavery, but
                  of death!
               As to their being the descendants of Canaan, we find in Samuel Maunder's "History
                  of the World," volume I, (Outline Sketch of General History,) chapter xi, page 36,
                  the historian, after assigning different settlements to the sons and grandsons of
                  Noah, continues, in the following language:
               "But Canaan is generally allowed to have settled in Phoenicia, and to have founded
                  those nations which inhabited Judea, and were, for the most part, subsequently
                  exterminated by the Jews."
               Again, (same history,) in the 2d volume, page 409, in the "History of Algiers," in
                  the north of Africa, and blossom of the barbarous tribes of that country, the
                  historian, in speaking of its early settlement, holds this language:
               "There is a variety of opinions respecting the original inhabitants: some
                  contending that they were the Sabians, who plundered the Patriarch Job; others,
                  Canaanites, who were driven out of their country by Joshua."
               The early history of man is shrouded in mystery; but, with the best lights before
                  us, we can come to no other conclusion than that the colored people of this
                  country and of Africa are the descendants of Canaan.
               
                  Abe. There is no use in debating this subject with you; you are h—ll
                  on the nigger. So I must go.
               
                  Jeff. Before you leave, let me sum up what I have said of his origin
                  and destiny. With regard to there being other men after the flood, diverse to the
                  family of Noah, I must again refer you to Josephus, Book I,
                  "Antiquities of the Jews," chapter iv, section 1: "Now the sons of Noah were
                  three, Shem, Japheth, and Ham, born one hundred years before the deluge.
                     These first of all descended from the mountains into the plains
                  and fitted their habitations there, and persuaded others, who were
                  greatly afraid of the lower grounds on account of the flood, and so were very loth
                  to come down from higher places, to venture to follow their examples. "Now, we are
                  informed by Josephus, and also by the Holy Scriptures, that there were but eight
                  persons saved in the ark, namely, Noah and his wife, and his three sons and their
                  wives. The question then naturally arises, What others did Shem,
                  Japheth, and Ham persuade to come down from the mountains? Was it the Patriarch
                  Noah, the man of God, who received the covenant of the rainbow that the world
                  should not again be destroyed by water? Or was it children born to them after the
                  flood, whose eyes never opened upon the deluge, that had to be persuaded by
                  eye-witnesses of that event that there was no danger in coming down? It seems to
                  me, in all soberness, that the original of the giants, and of
                     Canaan, may have by some means escaped the flood. The
                     giants are antediluvian, as you may see by the sixth chapter of
                  the book of Genesis. As to the family of Noah, I believe that they descended from
                  Adam and Eve; the original of the others I leave with the God of the creation. Hence we come to the
                  following inevitable conclusions: First, that the African is an inferior and a
                  different race. Second, that no permanent amalgamation can be effected between the
                  races of blacks and whites, because it is contrary to the laws of nature and the
                  designs of heaven. The mulatto can be produced, but can not be maintained without
                  the constant application of the first means of production; for the blood will run
                  back to the original race. This fact, though it has not been closely observed, is
                  as true as that water will seek its level. I know an African boy whose great
                  grandfather was a white man, yet there is not one trace of that blood in his
                  veins. There can be no mistake in his genealogy, for the white blood is on the
                  maternal side, his grandmother being a mulatto. Yet, any one unacquainted with the
                  circumstances would unhesitatingly pronounce him 
                     
                        "A full-blooded nigger, ob de real old stock;
                        Wid de head and shoulder he can split a hoss-block."
                     
                   Let me again refer you to Sir Charles Lyell's "Geological Evidences of the
                  Antiquity of Man," chapter xxiii, page 456. He says: "It is an acknowledged fact
                  that the color and features of the negro or European are entirely lost in the
                  fourth generation, provided that no fresh infusion of one or other of the two
                  races takes place." Third, if we are to believe the Bible, and take into
                  consideration the history of the past, and raise the mystic vail of the future,
                  and contemplate the fact that the surface of the earth must one day become crowded
                  with the family of man, insomuch that the whole surface of the earth will be
                  necessary, in its strictest economy, for his support, the Canaanite will be
                     exterminated. Josephus, in giving the farewell address of Moses to
                  his people, "Antiquities of the Jews," Book IV, chapter viii, page 96, section 42,
                  gives us this language of the man of God: "When you have beaten your enemies in
                  battle, slay those that fought against you; but preserve others alive, that they
                  may pay you tribute, excepting the nation of the Canaanites; for, as
                  to that people, you must entirely destroy them." A parallel to this passage in
                  Josephus you may find in the twentieth chapter of Deuteronomy, the fifth book of
                  the Bible, verses 16, 17, and 18. But that necessity will not be upon the world
                  for many generations yet to come. I am aware that many will dissent from my views
                  upon this subject, and perhaps make long and prayerful efforts to elevate the
                  Canaanite; and that they will do it honestly, I do not question. From a life
                  experience with that people, in connection with my knowledge of the Bible and of
                  history, I believe, God being my judge, that they will find themselves in a
                     nest of unclean birds. Time proves all things, and I am willing
                  that my views upon this subject shall go down to posterity. At the same time, I am
                  willing to leave all who differ with me upon this subject free to enjoy whatever
                  opinion they may have, and to try whatever experiment may suit them with that people. He that
                  touches the African in any other capacity than that of a servant, and is not
                  tarnished by that touch, will prove something that I have not yet experienced.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVIII.
               "DON'T look down! O God, strengthen my vision toward thee. If you are struggling
                  upon the steep cliff of trial, and only a few jutting rocks intervene between you
                  and the summit of fame, do n't look down. If you are laboring on the
                  cliff of industry, and only a few difficulties intervene between you and fortune,
                     do n't look down. If you feel the pelting of winter storms and
                  summer friends, don't look down into the dark abyss below, lest thy head swim, and
                  you lose thy foothold; for it is written that the soul of man goeth upward.
               "If the devils out of hell rise up against you, and arraign you before the powers
                  that be, do n't look down.
               
               "When pale-faced Death comes to demand of you thy soul, and boldly informs you
                  that your lease upon this life has expired, and that you are, without hesitation,
                  to depart with him to the land from whence no traveler has ever returned, do
                     n't look down.
               
               "Whatever your trials in this friendless world may be, though they are heaped upon you as mountains,
                  do n't look down.
               "The God of heaven created man to walk erect. The tradition of the fathers is that
                  God is above. How early I received this lesson! When crossing a frail bridge made
                  by the trunk of a binding tree, that spanned the shores of a deep and turbulent
                  stream in Kansas, Dart-feather said, as he pressed my trembling hand, in coarse
                  English, 'Do n't look down.'
               "O God! I accepted the omen; and, from that day to this, I have never looked
                     down."
               And Cora remembered that the paper she bad received from Don Partlo, on the night
                  of his disguise, informed her that she could see her father on a certain day, at a
                  certain place and hour. 
                     
                        How slow the iron wheels of Time can turn,
                        When from the hidden future we would learn
                        Some anxious lesson of eventful life!
                        How slow, how deadly slow, and with what strife,
                        They seem to turn upon the road of Time;
                        How harsh upon the ear their sound doth chime!
                        But when the dark-faced future holds in store
                        Some reckoning of a different score—
                        Some fearful lesson that we have to learn—
                        How swift the nimble wheels of Time can turn!
                     
                  
               
               The Colonel had been on the dodge. His age, and the influence of his daughter, had
                  kept him from joining in the fight with deadly weapons. He had numerous friends,
                  from whom he was enabled to learn all passing events, and through whom he had
                  learned many things that had transpired in Virginia and Kentucky.
               Cora tearfully listened to her father's account of the last days of Burtice, as
                  given in a preceding chapter. Also, to that of Oakhead, the bushwhacker, who was
                  captured at the burned bridge by a Dutch company, who, after taking him to the
                  town of ——, hung him on the public square, without even a military trial. Be it
                  said to the honor of their commander, that he tried to prevent the unceremonious
                  procedure, but could not resist or abate the fury of the rank and file. And what
                  is more remarkable, a majority of that company could not speak the English
                  language; and how could they understand the principles of the American
                  Government?
               Bob Beabout had left on his own hook. Some said that he had thrown his gun away,
                  and gone home to take the chances; others, that he had gone South.
               Amid all these gloomy stories, Cora smiled through her tears when the Colonel told
                  her that Mary Hawkeye was restored to her father's love, and had been married to
                  Claudius Fairfield. [This is the pale man to whom the reader was introduced, in a
                  preceding chapter, playing cards with Captain Sturn, in a village tavern.]
               Second marriages are by some condemned, and perhaps very justly. But Mary was in
                  the summer of life. Her mother had been laid in the cold confines of the tomb. Her
                  father, always a stern and cold man, was now too far gone with dissipation to be
                  of any solace to his daughter; but the controlling pivot on which her determination turned was, that
                  Claudius Fairfield was her first love.
               He had been wrested from her, in early life, by a cold, heartless woman, that was
                  Mary's superior in nothing but beauty, who captivated Claudius, and led him away
                  from Mary, only to crush him beneath the cold charities of her affections. But
                  Claudius was a true man, and he forgave Mary for her unfortunate adventure with
                  the Missouri trapper. Many years had passed away since Claudius and Mary spent
                  those happy hours of youth and ardor; but, like the rising of the morning sun,
                  that silvers the eastern hills, they returned.
               The wedding-day was set; and while we leave Mary preparing for her second
                  bridal-day, we will turn and observe Rosa and Dolla in solemn council.
               "Yes; but I reckon you will call him pa," said Rosa, very pointedly.
               "Ma can make me call him pa with my lips," said Dolla, pouting out her mouth.
               "Yes; but he will be your pa, and you will have to call him that,"
                  said Rosa, sternly.
               "My pa is in heaven, and you know it," said little Dolla, as her eyes floated in
                  water.
               Jesus said, "Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of
                  such is the kingdom of heaven."
               Cora clapped her hands in joy when informed that Major Six and Loudfork had been
                  cashiered, and dropped a tear of exultation when she received the news that Jack
                  Jolly had been promoted. It was by the influence of Cora that Colonel S——, with
                  herself and Don Partlo, departed for Texas, leaving the border strife to be
                  carried on by others. Her poetic speech, made to Don Partlo on that occasion,
                  beneath the thick foliage of the forest, is worthy of record. It is as
                  follows:
               "Suicide! ah, 't is suicide, the spilling of homogeneous blood, the relentless
                  stab of nature's soft nurse—bold, ungodly self-destruction! No country has ever
                  adorned the world with men so brave, so noble, and so kind; no battle-field was
                  ever won with men so brave. Mexico, Texas, our own native soil, record, in letters
                  of blood, the character of American arms. Shall the hand that never turned aside
                  from a relentless foe cowardly bleed the parent heart? for suicide is cowardice.
                  Who but a coward will sneak into the secret chambers of his own heart, to steal
                  the gift of God? Who but a coward will refuse to fill the place marked out for him
                  by applauding heaven? Who but a coward will shrink from the storms of human life,
                  and seek refuge in the shades of eternity? None! no, not one! Then this strife is
                  suicide, and suicide is cowardice. 
                     
                        "Dark-mantled Fate, with her bow and quiver,

                        No passage through them has ever been found;
                        The danger is great in passing them round.
                        The midshipmen say they fear she will wreck;
                        The dark-colored men that stand on the deck
                        Obscure the channel that she used to pursue,
                        Mix with the passengers, and challenge the crew.
                        Abram would ship them on another boat,
                        Crowd them together and shove them afloat;
                        But home and nativity dwell in their hearts,
                        And dark-mantled Fate is trimming her darts.
                        A piebald people, like old Jacob's cattle,
                        Will never grow out of the white man's battle.
                        A nation so crimson and mixed in blood
                        Has never been seen since Noah and the flood.
                     
                     
                        "Come, I pray you, to a sacred retreat,
                        While youth and beauty are blooming and sweet;
                        Let soldiers and armies darken the land—
                        You shall possess my heart and my hand."
                     
                  
               
            
            THE END.
