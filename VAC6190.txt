            TO THE MEMORY OF HENRY CLAY,
            Whose lamented death, (shrouding the Nation in mourning, and filling the hearts of
               his countrymen with sorrow and regret,) occurring. while
               these pages were in the hands of the publisher; this Book is dedicated, with
                  heartfelt sorrow, as a small token of admiration of his great
               services in behalf of his country, and more especially of the last great act in the
               drama of his life, (to which it is supposed he fell a martyr,) viz: his noble efforts
               in endeavoring to allay the great agitation on the Slavery question, between the
               North and the South.
            As every thing relating to that great man, 
                  "Whose like we ne'er shall see again,"
                Is deeply interesting, I will here introduce an incident which took place about
               the time he offered his celebrated compromise resolutions to the Senate.
            A word of explanation in regard to the subject will be necessary:
            A few years ago I visited the tomb of Washington, at Mount Vernon, and while
               searching for relics in the old vault, (his
               remains having been removed from it in 1837, to a new vault near by,) I fortunately
               found a fragment of his coffin with parts of the pall attached to it by two brass
               nails, which fragment I presented to Mr. Clay.
            The same morning, whilst speaking before the Senate, he alluded to the subject as
               follows:
            
               
                  
                     
                        "I cannot omit, before I conclude, relating an incident, a
                              thrilling incident which occurred prior to my leaving my
                           lodgings this morning.
                        "A gentleman came to my room—the same at whose instance, a few days ago,
                           I presented a memorial calling upon Congress for the purchase of Mount
                           Vernon for the use of the public—and, without being at all aware of what
                           purpose I entertained in the discharge of my public duty to-day, he said
                           to me, 'Mr. Clay, I heard you make a remark the other day which induces
                           me to suppose that a precious relic in my possession would be acceptable
                           to you.' He then drew from his pocket and presented to me the object
                           which I now hold in my hand. And what, Mr. President, do you suppose it
                           is? It is a fragment of the coffin of Washington—a fragment
                           of that coffin in which now repose in silence, in sleep and speechless,
                           all the earthly remains of the venerated Father of his country. Was it 
                              portentious
                              portentous
                            that it should have been thus presented to me? Was it a sad
                           presage of what might happen to that fabric which Washington's virtue,
                           patriotism and valor established? No, sir, no. It was a warning
                              voice, coming from the grave to the Congress now in Session, to
                           beware, to pause, to reflect before they lend themselves to any purposes
                           which shall destroy that Union which was cemented by his exertions and
                           example. Sir, I hope an impression may be made on your mind, such as that
                           which was made on mine, by the reception of this precious
                              relic."
                        This incident illustrates Mr. Clay's tact and ingenuity in seizing and
                           turning to good account this and like circumstances. Little did I think
                           when presenting that fragment, that two or three hours after, it would
                           be, in the hands of Henry Clay, the means of producing more deep feeling
                           and sensation in the Senate than had been witnessed for years. The
                           Senators ceased talking and writing, and gave their whole attention to
                           the Speaker, while profound silence reigned throughout the crowded
                           galleries. Many were moved to tears.
                        What a subject this would have been for an artist! The venerable and
                           immortal Clay, his commanding form stretched to its full height, and his
                           eagle eye beaming with patriotism, holding in his right hand a part of
                              the coffin of Washington, and conjuring his brother
                           Senators, in the name of that great and good man, to spare that Union
                           which was cemented by his exertions and example.
                        Though Mr. Clay was much engaged at the time I presented him with the
                           relic, the next day I received the following note from him, which has not
                           been given to the public before:
                        "H. Clay, with his respects, presents to Mr. Criswell many thanks for the
                              fragment from the coffin of Washington,
                           which he did him the favor to present to him. It is a precious
                              relic, which Mr. Clay will carefully preserve.
                        
                        "Wishing Mr. Criswell health and happiness, I am truly his friend, and
                           obedient servant,
                        
                           "H. CLAY."
                           Washington, Jan. 30, 1850.
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            As an evidence of the estimate Mr. Clay put upon this relic, he, in his will, ]eft a
               ring containing a part of it, to one of his dearest friends.

            PREFATORIAL.
            The Author in laying this work before the public has but one motive in view, which is
               to contribute his mite in endeavoring to allay the great agitation on the Slavery
               Question between the North and South, which threatens to dissolve our glorious Union;
               and as that talented authoress, Mrs. Stowe, in "Uncle Tom's Cabin," has increased
               that agitation, the author hopes to modify it somewhat, by representing the Planter
               and Slave in a more favorable light.
            Though living in the North, he has travelled extensively through the South, (having
               visited nine of the Southern States,) he therefore flatters himself that he gives a
               fair and impartial statement of both sides of the question.
            Many of the incidents and stories related in the book came under his own observation,
               while others were given him by acquaintances.
            If his motive is realized in the least degree, if the book proves to be one drop of
               oil cast upon the tempestuous sea of agitation, his wishes will be accomplished.

            UNCLE TOM'S CABIN CONTRASTED WITH BUCKINGHAM HALL.
            
               CHAPTER I.
               
                  
                     
                        "There is a Divinity that shapes our ends,
                        "Rough hew them as we will."
                     
                  
               
               Colonel George Buckingham was a wealthy planter, whose residence was near
                  Charleston, South Carolina. His whole establishment exhibited a style and
                  magnificence uncommon in that place. Being descended from some portion of the
                  English nobility, the Colonel made it a point to adopt their manners and customs
                  in his own domain. Therefore, Buckingham Hall, which was situated in the centre of
                  a fine park, adorned with stately forest trees and various kinds of ornamental
                  shrubbery, was a splendid building of the Columbian Order, furnished with almost
                  Oriental magnificence. He never went abroad without four horses to his carriage,
                  and his household servants—all slaves—were, without exception, dressed in
                  livery.
               The Colonel was justly proud of his beautiful villa, from the cupola of which he
                  could enjoy a delightful view of the fine harbor of Charleston, with Fort Moultrie and Castle Pinckney in the
                  distance. In this observatory was fitted up his library, with telescopes and other
                  astronomical instruments, for though not a learned man, in the strict sense of the
                  word, he was fond of literature and science, and employed a good part of his time
                  reading and studying.
               Although a man of sterling worth and good qualities, Colonel Buckingham had his
                  weak points, especially in regard to his ancestral blood, which, he often boasted,
                  had not "Crept through scoundrels ever since the flood," but was pure
                  and aristocratic in its descent. From the researches he had made in the English
                  books of Peerage, he had discovered that his grandfather's grandfather was a
                  brother of one of the Dukes of Buckingham, therefore, he flattered himself that a
                  few drops of noble blood were coursing through his veins; and on this was based
                  the haughtiness and unbending pride of his character. However, to his slaves, he
                  was uniformly kind and humane, and in return they loved him with all the native
                  simplicity of their hearts. Colonel Buckingham had several plantations in Georgia
                  and Alabama, on which were four or five hundred slaves, which he was in the habit
                  of visiting at different periods of the year. All of them, and especially those
                  near his person, were so attached to him, that if offered their freedom they would
                  not accept of it if it would separate them from their master. They would have said
                  that their condition was far better than that of the free negroes around them,
                  that they had all the necessaries of life, and that when illness confined them at
                  home, a physician was never wanting to attend them. Such indeed, is generally the
                  feeling between the slave and a kind master: but alas! there are too many
                  slave-holders whose cruelty makes them hated and feared by the unfortunate objects
                  of their tyranny.
               Colonel Buckingham was a widower, and had two children, a son and daughter. The
                  son, Eugene, was, at the period of his introduction to the writer, about
                  twenty-five years of age, tall, well-proportioned and rather good-looking. In
                  disposition he was open-hearted, frank and generous to a fault; but it must be
                  confessed that he possessed a pretty large share of vanity, which could be seen
                  lurking in every lineament of his countenance. Like his father, he was inclined to
                  boasting on subjects concerning himself; and would occasionally tell of his being
                  at a brilliant party at the Charleston Hotel, given in honor of some foreign
                  literary character; when he was told by a gentleman, that the ladies considered
                  him a perfect resemblance of a certain Capt. S. the handsomest man in the room.
                  There was also a degree of haughtiness in his manners which was far from pleasing;
                  but when he desired to please, he could be as polite and affable as any. Yet, he
                  would never humble himself in the least degree to obtain a favor of any man, there
                  was too much pride and independence in his character for that. On the whole,
                  however, he was much liked by his acquaintance, and his company considered quite
                  an acquisition.
               
               His sister Cora was a tall, graceful girl of nineteen, her hair and eyes were
                  blackness itself; and in the latter was an expression of dreaminess and 
                     langour
                     languor
                   that was very fascinating. She had just returned from school, and was
                  already quite a belle, for though not beautiful, there was a lady-like softness of
                  manner, and a sweet insinuating smile, that were to the enthusiastic Southerners,
                  irresistable. Still, accomplished as she was, her acquirements were merely
                  superficial; she was weak-minded and indolent in character and disposition.
               Eugene Buckingham had attended college in Columbia for several years, his father
                  being determined he should be well educated; and in this he was not disappointed,
                  for the young man graduated with honors. Well satisfied on this point, the Colonel
                  began to think of a wife for the son-and-heir of his possessions. On looking
                  around him, his choice fell upon the daughter of his nearest neighbor, Frederick
                  Jones, Esq. whose plantation joined that of the Colonel, and which was well
                  stocked with valuable slaves. Without consulting the wishes of Eugene, his father
                  proposed the match to Mr. Jones, who received it with great favor, and immediately
                  recommended it to his daughter Susanna, whose pleasure at the idea was extreme. It
                  was all she wished—all she had striven to gain for the last year. She was a large,
                  showy girl, with rather a pretty face, but her manners were brusque and masculine. She was fond of gayety, and was
                  scarcely ever at home; and being a fearless rider, she raced and hunted as well as
                  any of the young men.
               She often visited at Buckingham Hall, although no favorite of Cora's; and as for
                  Eugene, he kept as much as possible out of her way.
               But being informed by his father of the alliance he had formed for him, the anger
                  of the young man was uncontrollable; he did not, indeed, disguise his antipathy
                  and disgust of the proposal, whereat his father was so exasperated that he
                  threatened to disinherit him if he did not obey his commands. But Eugene left his
                  presence without any reply.
               Now, Mr. Jones had no education himself; and consequently considered that his
                  children could do without it as well as he. Therefore he would not send his
                  daughter to school, nor his son to college; for, said he, "I would be a fool to
                  spend five or six hundred a year on their learning, when I can leave them a slave
                  worth that amount for every year they would be there." So, as you may suppose, his
                  sons and daughter grew up about as ignorant as their father.
               Colonel Buckingham urged his son so often and so strenuously to pay his devoirs to
                  Miss Jones, and her father so incessantly attempted to joke with him on the
                  subject, that he became utterly disgusted at the idea of marriage; and inwardly
                  vowed that he would never tie himself to any woman. Neither parents seemed to
                  understand that Susanna was not the woman formed to excite the tender passion in a
                  man of taste and feeling. Love is a delicate plant, that grows spontaneously in its native soil; it
                  cannot be forced by artificial means; and if ever transplanted, it requires
                  skillful and tender cultivation, else it withers and dies.
               Although the Colonel wished the match on account of the young lady's possessions,
                  Eugene was too noble minded to marry for wealth alone; nothing short of mental
                  beauty and a gifted mind could interest a soul like his.
               But at last, wearied out with the persecutions of the two fathers, and the irksome
                  presence of the daughter, who was every day at Buckingham Hall, Eugene resolved to
                  quit his home, and pay a visit to the North, disregarding the repeated threat of
                  his father to disinherit him. Notwithstanding the respect he bore the author of
                  his being, and the love he had for his sister, nothing could induce him to remain
                  where life was to him a torment. Therefore, he suddenly took his departure from
                  Charleston, much to the astonishment and chagrin of Frederick Jones, Esq. and his
                  "very interesting" daughter Susanna, who, however, took the disappointment to
                  heart much less than her father, for he had set his mind on annexing
                  the plantations.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Upon thy heart there is laid a spell,
                           "Holy and precious—oh, guard it well!"
                        
                     
                     —Hemans.
                  
               
               Although Eugene Buckingham, when in a fit of spleen, had vowed he would never
                  marry, he had for more than a year been in love—not with any woman he had ever
                  seen—but with an ideal that lay cradled in his heart. The fact was, a lady of
                  New-York had been contributing for some time to the various periodicals and
                  magazines throughout the States, under the nom de
                     plume of Corinne Sunshine, and Eugene was so 
                     facinated
                     fascinated
                   by her writings, that he, enthusiastic fellow! fell in love with an
                  imaginary being, a creature of perfection, which perhaps if ever found would prove
                  nothing more than a mere mortal, likely enough, either old or ugly. But, although
                  this thought sometimes passed through his brain, he immediately banished it, for
                  the romance was so delightful that he would not suffer it to be dispelled. From
                  the character of the lady's writings, he concluded her character and
                     disposition sition to be as bright and
                  sunshiny as her name, therefore she would be just the woman to please him. It was
                  partly to discover the name and residence of his "soul's idol," that his intended
                  destination was New-York, and it was with a heart full of hope and pleasing
                  anticipations, that he boarded the splendid steamer Crescent City, bound for that
                  port. After a speedy and agreeable voyage he arrived at the "Commercial emporium
                  of the Union," and was soon established at the Astor House. Having with him a
                  letter of introduction from a gentleman of Charleston to Capt. Coleman, that
                  "Prince of Hosts," he received him like an old friend, and their acquaintance soon
                  became a mutual pleasure.
               Eugene spent a fortnight perambulating the city, and visiting the many places of
                  amusement; and then thinking that he might discover his inamorata by seeking N. P.
                  Willis, who is said to know nearly all the literary characters in Christendom; he
                  called upon him, and on our hero's propounding the question, this gentleman
                  promptly told him that the lady who wrote under the signature of Corinne Sunshine,
                  was a Miss Julia Tennyson, daughter of Dr. Tennyson of La Fayette Place; but
                  unfortunately for Eugene, Willis was not personally acquainted with her; so that
                  to gain an introduction was yet an impossibility. But "as hope springs eternal in
                  the human breast," the young man, on his way back to the hotel, endeavored to
                  contrive some mode of obtaining a sight of the lady, that he might know at a
                  glance whether his ideal was embodied in her. At last a thought struck him, and
                  the next day he acted upon it. It was this: he bought at Stewart's an elegantly
                  embroidered pocket handkerchief, and immediately proceeding to La Fayette Place,
                  mounted the steps and rung the bell of No. —. The door was opened, and he inquired
                  of the servant if Miss Tennyson was at home. Replying in the affirmative, she
                  ushered him into an elegant parlor, and on asking his name, he replied that he was
                  a stranger. The girl looked curiously at him for a moment, and then disappeared.
                  Imagine his feelings—in the very house of his ideal—momentarily expecting her
                  appearance, discomposed and agitated; but he felt he must be calm, or how was he
                  to carry out his little piece of deception?
               The long wished for moment arrived. Miss Tennyson stood before him—a creature of
                  such exquisite loveliness that his eyes were dazzled, and for a moment his tongue
                  was paralized. He could only bow, which she returned with stately grace, and
                  asked, in a voice sweeter and softer than ever before dwelt upon his ear, what was
                  the object of his visit.
               Finding at last his utterance, he said, "Pardon my intrusion, but I found this 
                     hankerchief
                     handkerchief
                   with your name upon it in an omnibus, and I could do no less than return
                  it to you."
               The young lady took the article in her hand and replied, "It is indeed my name,
                  but sir, the handkerchief is not mine, it must belong to some other person; it is
                  strange."
               
               "So it is," echoed Eugene, (slightly blushing as his conscience reproved him for
                  his deception,) "I was not aware there could be another lady of the name of her of
                  whom I have heard so much."
               "Perhaps," said Julia, smiling, "it was the other lady of whom you have
                  heard."
               Eugene shook his head—"No! But since it is not yours, excuse my intrusion."
               "Not at all," replied Julia, politely, as the young man bowed himself into the
                  street; and when the door closed he thought darkness had fallen upon the earth,
                  for the vision that enlightened his soul for a few moments wa[s no longer
                  visible.
               Our hero had now gained one object; he had seen his ideal, and found her to
                  surpass his wildest dreams. She was apparently about nineteen, above the medium
                  height, possessed a slender and graceful form, a sweet, soul-breathing
                  countenance, large, liquid brown eyes, and hair of a glossy chestnut, that fell in
                  a profusion of curls around her face and finely formed neck. Her beauty was of
                  that rare kind formed to last for ever; if not in the world, in the hearts of
                  those that bore its impress. It was so with Eugene; for weeks after, wherever he
                  went, that vision of loveliness was before him; it was the theme of his
                  meditations by night and by day.
               One afternoon' in the second week of June, our hero paid a visit to the Academy of
                  Design, that place "where lovers oft do congregate," and while there, was
                  surprised and delighted to meet Miss Tennyson, who was accompanied by an elderly
                  lady. She did not appear to observe him as he stood at a distance, drinking in her
                  beauty with all his soul. Then, as she moved on, he followed, still at a distance;
                  for the time, entirely regardless of the magnificent paintings around him, as his
                  whole mind was absorbed in the living picture. At length she stopped at a design
                  that seemed to please her extremely, and Eugene gradually drew nearer. The
                  painting was called the "Declaration:" it represented a young man standing by the
                  side of a lovely girl and holding her hand; with love, tenderness, and anxiety
                  depicted in his countenance, while she, with downcast eyes, and timid
                  heart-revealing look, showed that his wishes would meet no refusal.
               "Ah!" sighed Eugene to himself, "would that I and the lovely Julia were in the
                  same situation, and that I were as sure of success as that young man."
               Miss Tennyson at length exclaimed, as if unconsciously, "Beautiful!
                  beautiful!"
               "Beautiful, indeed!" echoed young Buckingham.
               The young lady started and turned around. As her eyes fell upon him she seemed
                  embarrassed, but made no sign of recognition.
               "Excuse me, Miss Tennyson, I did not mean to intrude." She made no reply, but
                  bowed and passed on. Eugene remained where he was, and shortly after, saw by a
                  side glance that she was leaving the room. Having now nothing to interest him, he
                  soon retraced his steps to his hotel. On the way he soliloquized as follows:
               
               "Here I have been for a month without making her acquaintance; and how that
                  acquaintance is to be made I do not imagine. She treats me so coolly too—I wish I
                  could obtain an introduction—unfortunately I know no one that is acquainted with
                  her. I regret that I left my home in the 'sunny South' on this Quixotic
                  expedition—I almost despair—but no! I will not! 'Perseverance' is my motto, and I
                  believe in the old adage, that 'the darkest hour is just before day,' therefore I
                  will try again."
               As he entered the Astor he met his friend Capt. Coleman, who addressed him with,
                  "Ah, my young friend, so you have been walking out; I have got something for you."
                  And he handed him a beautifully embossed note, which Eugene took and read as
                  follows:
               "Mr. Buckingham's company will be agreeable this evening at No. ——, La Fayette
                  Place."
               The astonishment and delight of our hero cannot be expressed. He stood and stared
                  at his friend without a word.
               "Ha! ha!" laughed the Captain, "what is the matter?"
               "Is this a hoax?"
               "A hoax? no; what put that in your head?"
               "I am not acquainted with anybody in that quarter."
               "What of that, if they wish to be acquainted with you. The fact is, my dear
                  Buckingham, I have said so much about the 'young Southerner' to Dr. Tennyson son
                  and his beautiful daughter, that they have a great desire to see you. There is no
                  necessity of looking so scared; all you will have to do is to prepare yourself for
                  the party and accompany me. Will you go?"
               "Certainly," replied Eugene. And then, forgetting himself, he said aloud, "she
                  will be surprised."
               "Why?" exclaimed the other, "has she ever seen you?"
               The young man blushed deeply, as he stammered out, "Yes—I—that is—she—I have seen
                  her—I—"
               "Ah, ha! I see, I understand. Well, we start at nine." And the amiable gentleman
                  passed into the street laughing quietly to himself.
               After tea Buckingham visited Cristadora's shaving saloon, under the Astor, and
                  after a short space came forth greatly improved in the upper story. He then
                  repaired to his chamber, and while dressing his thoughts were these:
               "Day is at length beginning to dawn upon me; the clouds that have been hanging
                  over me for weeks are now dispersing, leaving a clear opening in the bright blue
                  sky of my existence. I feel that my presentiment will yet be crowned with success: 
                     
                        'It must be so,
                        'Else, why this longing hope, this fond desire?'
                     
                  
               
               "I hate always been a firm believer in predestination, for, if the 'hairs of our
                  heads are all numbered, and not a sparrow falleth to the ground without His
                  notice,' have we not reason to believe that an event of so much importance as marriage is arranged by
                  Infinite Goodness? If so, might I not as well ascertain from the lovely Julia, to
                  night, whether or not our lot is to be united? But, no; I will not be so abrupt:
                  for if Providence ordains the ends, it also ordains the means by which those ends
                  are accomplished."
               Having finished dressing he took a last look in the mirror, and was quite
                  satisfied with what he saw there,—for the reader will recollect that one of his
                  failings was excessive vanity—and then descended to the ladies' parlor, where he
                  remained making observations on the company, until summoned to the carriage by
                  Captain Coleman.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               
                  
                     
                        "The brightness of her cheek would shame the stars,
                        "As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
                        "Would, through the airy region, stream so bright
                        "That birds would sing and think it were not night."
                     
                  
               
               Eugene Buckingham and his companion said little on their way to the mansion of Dr.
                  Tennyson, for our hero was too absent to converse, and the other had no
                  inclination to interrupt his reverie. At length the carriage stopped before the
                  door and the friends entered the house.
               The large, brilliantly lighted parlors were filled with a goodly representation of
                  the "upper tendom," and as they advanced, Eugene's visual organs
                  scanned the rooms for the star and belle of the evening. He soon discovered her
                  seated on an ottoman surrounded by a circle of gentlemen; and it was not
                  surprising that a pang of jealousy shot with an electric thrill through his heart,
                  "Should she happen to be engaged!" he thought.
               "Come," said Coleman, with a meaning smile, now for the introduction!"
               
               Buckingham's heart leaped at the words, and he actually felt a trembling sensation
                  creep over him, as, taking the arm of his friend, he approached with him the
                  unconscious object of his adoration.
               "Good evening, Miss Tennyson; allow me to present my friend Mr. Buckingham."
               Julia raised her lustrous eyes, and an expression of strong surprise flitted
                  across her countenance; and bowing with some embarrassment, she said, "I am happy
                  to see you, sir."
               Eugene bowed as politely as he knew how, and ventured to ask the honor of her hand
                  for the dance, if not engaged.
               She replied, "I am engaged for this set, but for the next I shall be happy."
               Some of the young exquisites around her let fall their under lips with chagrin,
                  and one or two, acquainted with the Captain, followed him to inquire "who the
                  deuce that proud looking fellow was?"
               On being informed that he was the only son and heir of a rich Southern planter,
                  they begged for a presentation, and endeavored throughout the evening to make
                  themselves as agreeable as possible to young Buckingham.
               It was soon whispered about the room, who our hero was, and he became a
                     lion at once. The young ladies bestowed on him their most
                  fascinating smiles, but in vain; he, like Achilles, was invulnerable, save in one
                  spot, and that, none had discovered but the gentle Julia.
               As Eugene led Miss Tennyson to the dance, he felt, in his pride, full six inches
                  taller, for was she not the most splendid girl in the room, and the "cynosure of
                  all eyes?" She was simply dressed, in rich white embroidered muslin, without a
                  single ornament save a blush rose in her dark hair, yet overshadowed every lady
                  present, as in the dance 
                     "She moved a goddess, and she looked a queen."
                   All indeed acknowledged her superior charms except some over-dressed maiden
                  ladies, whose eyes were blinded by pure envy alone. Our hero himself was in
                  raptures with her beauty and grace, and charmed with the brilliance of her
                  conversation.
               But, "all that's bright must fade" and so thought Eugene, as 
                     
                        "The silent hours stole on,
                        "And flaky darkness broke within the East,"
                     
                   compelling him, with the other guests, to depart. As he wished Julia good
                  morning he begged permission to call on her, which she granted without
                  hesitation.
               Dr. Tennyson was a Scotchman, and a gentleman of the old school, proud, learned,
                  and talented, with many good qualities both in mind and heart. Though not
                  possessed of a fortune, he had an excellent practice, and always lived fully up to
                  his income, so that whoever proposed for the hand of his daughter must take her
                  portionless. This Eugene was fully aware of from the conversation of several
                  persons at the soiree, but it had no
                  effect upon him. She knew he was rich, independent of his father; for his deceased
                  uncle, Fairfield Buckingham, had left him a large plantation in Georgia, with many
                  valuable slaves.
               Our hero, you can easily believe, was a frequent visitor at No. — La Fayette
                  Place, always to Julia a welcome intruder, for she had become much interested in
                  the young Southerner, who soon discovered that her intellect was of the first
                  order, and consequently became every day deeper enthralled. Her father had prided
                  himself on giving her the best education in his power; he would not send her to
                  boarding school, for he believed that the learning usually obtained at such places
                  was merely superficial. So tutors were provided her at home, and she became a
                  model in every respect. This Eugene learned, partly from herself and partly from
                  his own observations, which were generally pretty correct.
               But, however pleased the fair Julia might have been with her lover, Dr. Tennyson
                  evidently disliked his visits, when he found they had an object. As a friend and
                  social companion he thought well of him, but he was determined his daughter should
                  never be united to a slave-holder, and for this reason alone he did not wish her
                  to encourage him.
               Miss Tennyson, among her other accomplishments, included that healthful one of
                  riding on horseback, and certainly was a most fearless and graceful rider; at any
                  rate, so Eugene thought as he accompanied her one fine afternoon to Bloomingdale.
                  She rode on that occasion a beautiful cream-colored pony, with a mane and tail as
                  white as ocean's foam, a spirited animal that cantered along. as if proud of its
                  precious burden. If Eugene thought Julia charming at other times, he considered
                  her perfectly enchanting now, in her elegant riding costume; for he thought as
                  most gentlemen do, that a lady, especially if she be young and well-formed, never
                  appears to such advantage as on horseback, provided she is a graceful rider.
               One morning Buckingham called in a carriage to invite Miss Tennyson to accompany
                  him to Greenwood Cemetery. She accepted and was tripping down stairs to go, when
                  the Doctor called her to him from the back parlor.
               "My child," said he, "where are you going?"
               "To ride in the country with Mr. Buckingham."
               "Julia; I have told you before, not to encourage this young man. I do not wish
                  it—his principles don't suit me. You must give up his society. Will you obey me or
                  not?"
               Julia blushed deeply and held down her head, but replied, "I will not go with him
                  after to-day, father."
               "See that you do not then."
               This conversation was unintentionally overheard by Eugene, who was standing in the
                  street door waiting for Miss Tennyson, and it sent a thrill of disappointment
                  through his heart. At the moment he felt utterly wretched, and as he handed Julia
                  into the carriage and took a seat by her side, he sighed bitterly. She looked at
                  him but said nothing, and there rested a
                  shade of melancholy on her own fair cheek.
               After what had passed, it was not surprising that the young people labored under a
                  mutual embarrassment during the drive to Greenwood; and while they were wandering
                  through its rural labyrynths. As they walked on, admiring the lovely flowers and
                  ornamental trees, and reading the sweet and touching inscriptions on the numerous,
                  chaste, and elegant monuments, Eugene's eyes expressed deep sadness; he sighed
                  frequently, and was evidently so preoccupied, that Julia asked what ailed him. He
                  replied that he felt a little indisposed; but the truth was, he was endeavoring to
                  make up his mind to leave New-York, and banish himself from the charmer at his
                  side, and after a long struggle with himself, decided to do so.
               In the meantime their steps brought them to a spot where several little
                  tomb-stones raised their marble faces from the bright green grass around them.
               "Is not that beautiful?" exclaimed Julia, as she read their simple inscriptions.
                  "'Sweet little Charley'—'our baby'—'dear William'—'our angel boy.' And farther on,
                  'my mother.' Here Julia could not repress her tears, for her own mother had only
                  been dead about two years: and Eugene led her away without speaking, till they
                  came to the most splendid piece of sculpture in the Cemetery. This was a monument
                  built in the form of a church, with a door in front, in which stood the marble
                  figure of a lovely young girl in ball-room attire. "Strange idea!" exclaimed
                  Eugene, "to dress the dead thus."
               "Do not judge too hastily," said Julia; "after you have fully examined the beauty
                  of this elegant mausoleum. I will relate to you the history of the fair girl who
                  is here buried."
               Eugene stood for half an hour in silent contemplation of the tomb of Charlotte
                  Canda. He could not cease to admire the beauty of the structure, the tasteful
                  ornaments surrounding it, the marble flower-pots in which were planted rare
                  flowers, the two angels, large as life, placed in either side of the tomb, as if
                  guarding it from every intruder, and the tasteful manner in which flowers were
                  placed around the inner side of a neat iron railing surrounding the monument.
               In the meantime, Julia had seated herself on a bench beneath the shade of a large
                  oak tree, and Eugene having finished his survey, came and took a seat beside
                  her.
               "Charlotte Canda," began the fair girl, "was the only daughter of a rich French
                  gentleman, who was the superintendant of a large and successful Seminary in
                  New-York. This young lady was mistress of every accomplishment, and the idolized
                  of her parents. Beautiful and wealthy, she was surrounded by suitors, and no ball
                  or party among her acquaintances was considered complete without her presence.
               "It was on her birth-night, when she had attained her seventeenth year, that she
                  spent the evening from home, accompanied by her father, in her rich ball dress;
                  she never looked more beautiful, and her
                  friends remarked that she never was so happy and joyous.
               "It was late when they set out to return home, and as they stopped on the way to
                  leave a lady, Mr. Canda having gone to wait on her to the door, the coachman
                  negligently dropped the lines, and the horses started off on a run. As they turned
                  the corner, Miss Canda fell through the open door upon the side walk, and was so
                  injured that she never spoke after.
               "It was said that the monument was designed by herself for a beloved aunt, who
                  lies with her in the same spot. The grief of her parents none but parents can
                  imagine; and her death cast a gloom upon the whole circle of her
                  acquaintance."
               "A melancholy story, indeed," sighed Eugene, as they rose and walked on. The sun
                  was now declining, and they entered their carriage to return. It was nearly dark
                  when they arrived at her father's dwelling, and on parting with Miss Tennyson,
                  Buckingham pressed her hand while he observed, "I omitted to mention that I am
                  obliged to leave for home to-morrow; as I have received a letter from my father
                  insisting on my immediate return—(this was true,) and I hope when I again visit
                  the city, you will permit me to call on you."
               Julia was both surprised and embarrassed. She became quite pale, and stammered
                  forth—"Is it possible? I—I am sorry—I mean—I regret that you go so soon."
               Then Eugene, much agitated drew from his coat pocket his daguerreotype, saying,
                  "In the meantime, will you condescend to accept this?"
               Julia started, hesitated, and at last replied "Not now." Then after a moment, "but
                  I shall be happy to see you when you return."
               And thus they parted.
               As Buckingham, after leaving his horse at the livery stable, walked slowly down
                  Broadway to the Astor, he mused thus: "'Not now!' that surely means
                  that she will accept it sometime. She evidently regards me favorably—and in time
                  she will consent to be mine. Mine! will that glorious presentiment of
                  my life be ever realized? Yet, she said, 'not now,' and these two
                  short words shall be the talisman upon which my hopes are centred."
               At this moment a hand was laid upon his shoulder, and a voice exclaimed, "I say,
                  Buckingham, what are you thinking about? I have been walking beside you these ten
                  minutes and you never saw me."
               Eugene started from his reverie and colored deeply as Arlington Melville looked
                  closely in his face. "I was thinking," he replied,
               "Of course—but on what subject? So, it is a secret?"
               Our hero to evade the question, replied, "I am going home to-morrow."
               "Oh! To the South. That is a place I have often desired to visit," said the other,
                  "I have heard a great deal about planters
                  and slaves, and should like to make my own observations. I think I will go
                  sometime."
               "Why not now?" quickly exclaimed Eugene. "Come with me, you have nothing to
                  prevent you. I should be most happy to introduce you to my father and sister."
               "Sister, have you a sister? Well, let me see. When do you go?"
               "To-morrow."
               The young man mused for a few moments. Then shaking Eugene by the hand, he
                  exclaimed—"I will go—many thanks for your invitation. Good bye, till to-morrow!"
                  And he ran into the Irving House, leaving his friend to continue his walk
                  alone.
               Arlington Melville was a cousin of Julia's; and had just arrived from England,
                  where his parents still resided. Although Eugene had often met him at Dr.
                  Tennyson's house, where he seemed perfectly at home, he boarded at the Irving.
                  Buckingham liked him much, especially as he saw plainly that he was no rival in
                  the affections of the beautiful Julia, with whom his friendship was only a
                  cousinly regard. Young, handsome and gay, with an educated mind, and heir to a
                  considerable property in England, he was calculated to win admiration and esteem
                  from all his acquaintance. Therefore Eugene was much pleased at the idea of his
                  company on his journey home.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "To die is to be banished from myself;
                           "And Julia is myself; banished from her,
                           "Is self from self, a deadly banishment."
                        
                     
                     —Shakspeare.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "And though the slave be fettered in the flesh,
                           "He doth not feel his chains."
                        
                     
                     —Tupper.
                  
               
               Buckingham and his young friend arrived at the dwelling of the former on the last
                  day of June. They received a warm welcome from the Colonel and the fair Cora, who
                  made a deep impression upon the heart of Melville. Her soft languid eyes, and her
                  gentleness of demeanor, quite fascinated him.
               Eugene had much to tell regarding his adventures in the North, nor was he long
                  silent concerning the lovely Julia. Saying little in regard to his love for her,
                  he related to his father and sister the whole history of his romantic acquaintance
                  with the accomplished Miss Tennyson. After hearing him out, the old gentleman
                  declared that if he had any idea of marrying her, he would banish him both from
                  home and affection. "She is a portionless girl," said he; "besides, Eugene, you are well aware of my justly
                  grounded prejudices against the Northerners, chiefly on account of their
                  abolitionism, and their interference with our slaves. Although many of our
                  neighbors have sent their sons to Northern colleges, I was determined you should
                  not enter one; and if I had known of your projected visit to New-York, I should
                  certainly have prevented it. Therefore, banish any ideas regarding a connection in
                  that quarter, I will never listen to them."
               Eugene, as usual, made no reply, but was just as determined as before to think of
                  none but Julia. Although forbidden to address her, both by her father and his, he
                  had a secret presentiment that she alone was to be his earthly partner, and as, 
                     "Hope springs eternal in the human breast,"
                   he felt for the time being almost content. In the meanwhile, he considered
                  that Julia might become engaged to another during his absence; that he had given
                  her no proof of his affection, although he felt confident that she preferred him;
                  and that it was necessary, perhaps, for the happiness of both, that he should
                  declare his passion. Therefore, on the anniversary of "our Glorious Independence,"
                  he penned her the following delectable epistle:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Buckingham Hall, July 4th, 18—.
                              "DEAR MISS TENNYSON,
                           
                           "I have no doubt you will be surprised on receiving this epistle from
                              me; yet I hope you will pardon the liberty I take, and excuse my
                              presumption in addressing you; which I trust you will, for you know
                              that Cupid has neither patience nor prudence.
                           "This letter is dated on the 'Glorious Fourth,' a day which brings to
                              our remembrance the immortal 'Declaration of Independence,' and I
                              think that it may very appropriately be used for other
                                 declarations; therefore I have decided to make one of these
                              to you, and in the language of one of the illustrious signers of that
                              immortal document, 'sink or swim, survive or perish, live or die,' I
                              give my heart and hand to this
                              declaration.
                           "You will perhaps consider me premature in this matter, but dear
                                 lady! if you know anything of the exquisite pangs of love,
                              you will not think so. I hope you will not sacrifice me
                                 now, when I am just beginning to live. No! you could
                              not be so cruel.
                           "As the wound I have received from the little 'blind archer' has
                              nearly proved mortal, you only can prevent my
                              dissolution. For heaven's sake! dear lady! have pity on
                              me; heal this wound and put me out of misery. The fact is, I can
                              neither read, write, study, or do anything else as I ought, for my
                              mind reverts incessantly to you, you are the theme of my
                              meditations by night and by day.
                           "I confess I am not worthy of your varied charms, but I will endeavor
                              to make myself more so; and may that Great Being, in whose hands are
                              held our destinies, influence you to decide in my favor.
                           
                           "I shall await your answer in anxious suspense. In the meantime I
                              remain,
                           
                              "Yours devotedly,

               In the course of a fortnight he received a reply, indefinite indeed, but which
                  allowed him to hope. In the meanwhile he had written to her father as follows:

                           "As I received, when at your hospitable dwelling many tokens of
                              friendship and esteem from you, I was emboldened, perhaps with too
                              much assurance, to place my affections on your matchless daughter. No,
                              I am wrong, I loved her years ago, before I was allowed
                              the delight of gazing upon her in reality. She has long been my
                                 ideal and my idol, and the one
                                 great presentiment of my life is, and has been, that
                                 we are to be united.
                           "May I hope that you will not scorn my alliance? That you will one day
                              allow me to call you by the endearing name of 'father?' Should you,
                              however, entertain any prejudices against my Southern education, let
                              me know them, and I will endeavor to convince you that they are not
                              well founded.
                           "I will refer you to Gen. P. of Charleston, one of our first men, for

                              "MR. BUCKINGHAM, SIR,
                           
                           "According to your request, I wrote to Gen. P. and have just received
                              his answer. He gives you a fair character, and intimates that your
                              standing is good. He also says that you are quite wealthy, and own a
                              plantation in Georgia, well stocked with slaves.
                           "Now, sir, to be candid with you, I will say, that from what I have
                              seen and heard, I entertain, personally, a high opinion of you; but,
                              sir; I have one great objection to urge against your suit; that is,
                              you are too rich, you own too much stock;
                              and I never can consent to suffer my daughter to marry a
                                 slave-holder, a man who engages in that horrid
                                 traffic of buying and selling human flesh and
                                 blood, and treating his fellow men as brutes.
                           "I have no more to say, you have my answer.

               On reading this epistle Eugene's hopes fell below zero; but on reflection, and
                  remembering that his motto was "Perseverance," he concluded to write again to the
                  Doctor, in order to remove, if he could,
                  some of his unjust opinions of slave-holders. Therefore he penned the
                  following:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "DR. TENNYSON, RESPECTED SIR,
                           
                           "I take the liberty of again addressing you, in order, if possible, to
                              remove some of your erroneous ideas regarding slavery and
                              slave-holders. I find the generality of the Northerners are prejudiced
                              against us, but I suppose one reason of this is, because they have
                              been accustomed to look on the dark side of the question,
                              in every respect. You, yourself, perhaps, have never given the bright
                              side an hour's thought: no doubt you have been much engaged in reading
                              works against slavery, or listening to some free-soiler or
                              abolitionist who exaggerates the evils of it in the highest terms. If
                              you were to visit the South, and travel through it with an
                              unprejudiced mind, your ideas in regard to the 'evils of slavery'
                              would be much changed; you would find that we are not the inhuman
                              monsters the abolitionists represent us to be. You might occasionally
                              come across a hard master, but, as a general thing, the slaves are
                              treated kindly; for if a planter was even disposed to treat them
                              otherwise, public opinion would compel him to use them well.
                           "As for 'treating them like brutes,' I can assure you it is a slander
                              of our enemies—I have not seen a grown slave whipped for years—and as
                              to working them hard: when we task them, they generally get through in
                              half a day, so that they are not obliged to do more than a common
                              day's work in two days. When they get sick they are always allowed a
                              physician, and are much better fed and clothed than any free negroes
                              around them. In fact, they regard the latter with contempt, and say
                              that 'they pity the poor nigger that has no master to take care of
                              him.' I think you would also find them much more contented and happy
                              than many of your Northern colored people.
                           "Some of your States have already passed laws prohibiting
                                 free negroes from settling within their borders; in
                              others, they are not permitted to give evidence in courts of justice,
                              or even to send their children to the same school with the whites, so
                              that where the former are not numerous enough to form a school by
                              themselves, they are obliged to remain in ignorance. You will not, if
                              you can avoid it, even ride in the same conveyance with them; in
                              short, notwithstanding the outcry against slavery, your free blacks
                              are used with more tyranny and contempt than any of our slaves; for
                                 we never send them to poor-houses or suffer them to
                              beg about the streets. On the whole, I think it is a mistake to
                              suppose that slavery has been abolished in the North, as your negroes
                              are subjected to the most humiliating of slaveries, universal tyranny
                              of prejudice; they may be said, indeed, to be as they really are,
                                 masterless slaves.
                           "'See that there be not a beam in thine own eye, before thou
                              attemptest to pull the mote out of thy brother's,' might be applied to
                              some of your philanthropists
                              lanthropists. I have often thought, that if George Thomson, M. P. the
                              celebrated English abolitionist, had devoted as much of his time and
                              energy towards ameliorating the condition of the poor white
                                 slaves of England, as he has in travelling through our
                              country, producing agitation between the North and South, in his vain
                              attempt to cause the emancipation of our slaves, he would
                              have gained more credit for himself and country, and done more good
                              for the cause of suffering humanity. It is a well known
                              fact that in the manufacturing and mining districts of England,
                              (especially the latter,) the poor are obliged to endure more hardships
                              than we can imagine. There are men working in some of the mines who
                              have rarely beheld the light of day, there have they been brought into
                              the world, and there, without education of any kind, have they been
                              obliged to work, some of them harnessed, like dogs, to a cart, and
                              crawling on their hands and feet through the dismal chambers of these
                              damp caverns, till an early death terminates their miserable
                              existence. O shame, where is thy blush? Can it be possible that such
                              things are suffered in the nineteenth century? And by the very people,
                              too, who presume to lecture us on the treatment of our
                              slaves! The two subjects should not be mentioned on the same day—no,
                              not even in the same year.
                           "Did ever a Southerner use his slaves as the ancient Romans are said
                              to have done? which was, to place those who were either superannuated
                              or sickly, upon an Island of the Tiber to starve. It was
                              a professed fessed maxim of the elder Cato to sell his worn-out slaves
                              at any price, rather than maintain what he considered a useless
                              burden. We on the contrary, think that we cannot render
                              too many comforts to our old and faithful servants, whose condition,
                              as Demosthenes said of the Athenian slaves, is far better than that of
                              their free brethren.
                           "If your Northern men were to possess themselves of correct
                              information regarding slavery and slave-holders, they would have a
                              better opinion of us; instead of swallowing down, without digestion,
                              the vile denunciations of ultra-abolitionists and political
                              demagogues, men who have not the good of the colored man at heart, but
                              who make the slavery question their hobby, with the vain
                              expectation of riding into power thereon: agitators, who, to gain
                              their ends, would jeopardise the very
                                 existence of our 'Glorious Union,' that noble
                              structure which has been reared by the most skilful architects, and
                              repaired and preserved by the most finished workmen. Yet these
                              demagogues, like the Ephesian Erostratus, who fired the Temple of
                              Diana solely to acquire fame, would not scruple to apply
                              the sacrilegious torch to our mighty Temple
                              of Liberty, merely to gratify their foolish and criminal love of 
                                 notority
                                 notoriety
                              . Their thirst for power is so great that they
                              would sooner 'rule in Hell than serve in Heaven.' God forbid that they
                              should succeed in their infernal designs, or that our glorious
                              republic should commit suicide.
                           "Is that difficult problem, 'whether man is capable of self government, or can a republic
                              be 
                                 permament

                              that after a fair trial of three-quarters of a century, the republic
                              of the United States was dissolved in bloodshed, anarchy and chaos?
                              Methinks at such a catastrophe the Goddess of Liberty would cover her
                              face with her mantle, and shed tears of blood over the
                              wreck of her model Republic.

                              of these Northern and Southern agitators were carried out.

               To this he received the answer that follows:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "MR. BUCKINGHAM, SIR,
                           
                           "I must confess you have enlightened me on some points in regard to
                              the treatment of slaves; as you judged rightly in supposing that I had
                              never travelled through the South for the purpose of studying the
                              workings of the system; but you have not made a convert of me
                                 yet. I am as confident as ever that the system is
                              wrong in the main, for is it not contrary to scripture, to nature, and
                              to common humanity? The Bible commands us to 'love our neighbor as
                              ourselves,' to 'do unto others as we would have them do unto us;' and
                              how can any man fulfil this scheme of universal benevolence who holds
                              an unfortunate person captive against his will? who brings him down to
                              the most insupportable of human conditions? who considers him his
                              private property, and treats him, not as a fellow being, nor as one of
                              the same common parentage as himself, but as an animal of the brute
                              creation?
                           
                           "Another objection to the system is, that the Scripture assures us of
                              future rewards and punishments—and how can that man be called to an
                              account for his actions when these actions are not at his own
                              disposal? This strikes at the very root of slavery, and shows
                              conclusively that the system is incompatible with the Christian
                              religion. It is also contrary to our civil law; and we acknowledge in
                              almost the first sentence of that immortal document, the Declaration
                              of Independence, 'that all men are born free and equal,'
                              while we have practised a living lie ever since that
                              axiom was given to the world, and how much longer we shall be guilty
                              of it, Heaven only knows. To suit our practice, that part
                              of the Declaration should have read thus: All men are born free and
                                 equal—except negroes.'
                           "The only way we can rid ourselves of the reproach continually cast
                              upon us by other nations, will be for slave-holders to emancipate
                              their slaves and send them to Liberia.
                           "But, I have said enough to convince you that I hold the same
                                 opinions that I did when I first wrote to you.

               To this Eugene again made reply:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "DR. TENNYSON, DEAR SIR,
                           
                           "Your letter has created hopes within me that you are under
                              conviction, but do not want to acknowledge it. It has actuated me to
                              address you again.
                           "I cannot agree with you that slavery is condemned in Scripture—as we
                              find it mentioned in many parts of the sacred volume, without any
                              disapproval.
                           "We read of the existence of slavery soon after the deluge. Abraham
                              obtained the favor of the Lord because he commanded his children and
                              household after him, to do the will of God. Egypt was a market for
                              slaves, (See the history of Joseph,) and Homer mentions Cyprus and
                              Egypt as slave-markets at the time of the Trojan war. Tyre and Sidon
                              were noted for the traffic. Joel, 3: 3, 4, 6. The Scripture also
                              commands servants to obey their masters. Eph. 6: 5, 6, 7, 8. And St.
                              Paul, after converting Onesimus to the Christian faith, sent him back
                              to his master Philemon, from whom he had been a fugitive slave. So
                              that slavery was not formally prohibited by the Bible.
                           "As to the argument concerning future rewards and punishments, that
                              you lay so much stress upon, and say that it 'strikes at the very root
                              of slavery, and shows conclusively that the system is contrary to
                              Scripture;' allow me to say, that this is a palpable sophism; for, as
                              the slave is not a free agent, his master compelling him
                              to act his pleasure, the master, and not the
                              slave, is accountable for those actions.
                           "Paley says, 'a man is said to be obliged, when he is urged by a violent motive
                              resulting from the command of another.' The violent motive with the
                              slave is the command of his master, coupled with the fear of
                              punishment, and with the soldier to obey his commander; hence, it is
                              evident that the master in the one case, and the commander in the
                              other, assumes the responsibility both to God and man, of the actions
                              of the men who are compelled to obey them.
                           "You say that slavery is contrary to civil law—but Justinian remarks,
                              that civil law gives nations the power to make slaves,
                              and Paley tells us that the law of nature allows slavery to arise from
                              three causes—1st. from crimes, 2d. from captivity, 3d. from debt; and
                              we read also in history that the Helots became the slaves of the
                              Spartans merely from the right of conquest.
                           "But, in whatever way slavery may have originated, it was practised
                              almost universally from the earliest ages up to the close of the
                              twelfth century, when it was suppressed in Europe, but about the time
                              of the discovery of the American continent the African slave-trade was
                              commenced again by the Portuguese, and other nations followed their
                              example. The system was continued until the beginning of the present
                              century, when it was abolished by law in America, England and France,
                              and many other of the European nations. At present there are
                              comparatively tively few slaves brought from Africa; and those few are
                              smuggled into Cuba, or some of the South American provinces. This is a
                              concise history of slavery.
                           "No man can be more opposed to the African slave-trade than I; and I
                              also dislike the internal traffic as it is carried on in our Southern
                              States. Slave-dealers there are held in contempt by all honorable men.
                              But this system will continue as long as Virginia, Maryland and North
                              Carolina remain as slave states, as a great portion of those states
                              are worn out, and will not grow cotton, tobacco and other produce.
                              Consequently, the inhabitants find it more profitable to breed slaves
                              to supply the other States, and stock the new slave territory.
                           "But what would you have us do with our slaves? Would you have us
                              emancipate them at once, and throw them upon the tender mercies of the
                              world? This would never do, as most of them know nothing about
                              business, and could never make a living for themselves if they were
                              free; they would only be a nuisance to the country. But do not suppose
                              we all maintain slavery from choice, far from it, as some of us are
                              slave-holders from compulsion, (as you will learn in the sequel,) and
                              would gladly get rid of our slaves if we could, as they cost us more
                              than free labor. Should the crops fail, some of the planters are nearly eaten out of house and
                              home by their numerous slaves.
                           "You mention Colonization: of having them sent to Liberia, but, sir,
                              this is out of the question; for, at the rate the Colonization Society
                              have been shipping them off for the last thirty years, we would never
                              get clear of the system. During that time there have only been about
                              seven thousand colonized. We might as well attempt to clear one of our
                              large forests by cutting down a tree every year, for while we are
                              making the removal, thousands are growing up instead. Yet, should all
                              the slaves be emancipated, the expense of sending so many to such a
                              distance could not be incurred. Still, I am in favor of Colonization,
                              but not on account of its vain endeavors to abolish slavery. I am in
                              favor of it because it spreads the Christian religion and civilization
                              among the millions of ignorant natives in Africa.
                           "It is evident, from the increase of our slave population, that to get
                              rid of the system, we must adopt some more feasible plan than that of
                              Colonizing them in Africa, as it is estimated that at the present
                              ratio of increase, said population would amount to twelve millions at
                              the close of the present century.
                           "My plan to abolish slavery would be for Government to purchase Cuba,
                              or else to appropriate large part of our Southern Territory, either in
                              Utah or New Mexico for the purpose of Colonization. If this plan was
                              carried out, and your Northern fanatics and agitators were to let us
                              alone, in a few years you would hear of one State after another
                              declaring itself free. Had not these men interfered with our
                              institutions, Kentucky and Virginia would have been free states before
                              this time.
                           
                              "Very Respectfully,

               The next letter from Dr. Tennyson concluded the correspondence.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "M. BUCKINGHAM, SIR,
                           
                           "You accuse me in your last letter of advancing sophistical arguments,
                              but, I think that accusation would more appropriately
                              apply to your last epistle. In the first place, you wish to convey the
                              idea that Abraham was commended by the Lord for owning slaves, but,
                              sir, this is a palpable perversion of Scripture; as he was only
                              praised because he commanded his 'children and household after him to
                              keep in the way of the Lord.' You will observe that his children and
                              servants are mentioned in connection; they were treated in many
                              respects alike, they were circumcised alike by the command of the
                              Lord, and they received the same moral and religious training. Could
                              your masters of the present day receive the same commendation for the
                                 moral and religious training you give
                              your slaves? I trow not.
                           "Another scriptural perversion: you say that St. Paul, after
                              converting Onesimus to the Christian faith, sent him back to his
                              master Philemon, from whom he had been a fugitive slave. But, sir, you
                              cannot strain this passage to encourage the restoration of fugitive
                              slaves, as the benevolent Apostle in his letter to Philemon, remarks
                              farther on, 'I send him back to you, but not in his former capacity,
                              not now a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved.' So that
                              Onesimus returned to Philemon not a slave, but a minister of the
                              gospel, and afterwards became Bishop of Ephesus.
                           "It is true that the Scripture did not formally condemn or prohibit
                              slavery, but the reason is obvious—slavery, at the time of the
                              introduction of Christianity, was a part of the civil constitution of
                              most countries; and if Christianity had abruptly declared that the
                              millions of slaves should be made free, it would have been universally
                              rejected as promulgating doctrines that were dangerous, if not
                              destructive, to society; therefore it never meddled, by any positive
                              precept, with the institutions of the times; for though it does not
                              positively say, 'you shall neither buy nor sell, nor possess a slave,'
                              it is evident from the mild diffusion of its light and influence, and
                              from its general tenor, that it militates against the slavery
                              system.
                           "Christianity brought about the abolition of slavery all over Europe
                              about the close of the twelfth century; and through its influence
                              slavery had declined in heroic Greece and papal Rome centuries before.
                              It will also be the main cause of freeing the slave in our own
                              country. God grant that period may soon arrive!
                           "This is the last letter I will address you on this subject, and I do

                        "The master of a well ordered household is kind to his servants, yet he
                           exacteth reverence, and each one feareth at his post."

               During Arlington Melville's stay with his friend, his time was principally
                  employed riding about and visiting the surrounding country, sometimes accompanied
                  by the Colonel; occasionally by Eugene, and oftener by Miss Buckingham, with whom
                  the young Englishman had become almost as much in love as our hero was with Julia.
                  Cora was certainly delighted with his society, and as her father made no
                  objection, they were very often together, riding, walking, or sitting in a vine
                  covered arbour at the farther end of the spacious garden, in the rear of the
                  mansion; where, with books and music their time passed quickly and happily away.
                  But Cora was always attended by Rosa, her favorite slave, who was a pretty light
                  mulatto; and the presence of the girl prevented Melville from saying many tender
                  things by way of declaring his passion. Yet his dark, eloquent eyes spoke plainly
                  what his lips never whispered; and Cora understood, and replied in the same
                  delightful language.
               One day Eugene expressed his intention of visiting his Plantation in Georgia, and
                  invited Melville to accompany him, which he willingly agreed to do. The young men
                  therefore left Charleston in the morning train for Macon, Georgia, near which
                  place was Fairfield Plantation, the domain of our hero. They arrived at Augusta
                  the same evening, and immediately changed cars for Macon. While doing so Melville
                  was much amused, as well as surprised, in watching he removal of a lot of slaves
                  from one train to another. The reader must know that there are always a number of
                  "stock cars" on these Southern railroads, attached to the end of the passenger
                  train, for the purpose of freighting slaves. These cars are perfectly round, like
                  a coal wagon, or looking like a large hogshead on wheels, yet capacious enough to
                  hold near a hundred; and here the poor creatures are huddled together like so many
                  pigs or cattle going to market, and when the weather is warm they suffer intensely
                  from the heat and closeness of the cars.
               Melville observed that there were several lots of slaves in these cars which had
                  been bought in Virginia ginia for the New
                  Orleans market. It was in the dusk of the evening, and each trader or owner went
                  round hunting up his own property, which was rather difficult to do, as he
                  scarcely knew one from another. But the slaves knew their proper owner, and with a
                  grin on their shining ebony faces, called out, "I 'longs to you, massa, I 'longs
                  to you." While others would cry "I no 'longs to you, sir; I 'longs to dat oder man
                  wid de red face and big whiskers."
               At length the slaves were arranged to their masters' satisfaction if not to their
                  own, and the cars started. Soon after, our friends began to doze in their
                  comfortable seats, for the passenger cars were as well furnished as the others
                  were miserable.
               At the break of day some of the passengers were aroused by the car-agent, to look
                  at a curiosity called Stone Mountain, near Atalanta, which was quite a resort for
                  travellers. It rose in the shape of a pyramid, several hundred feet, on an open
                  plain, and was ascended by a winding road. Half way up was situated an elegant
                  hotel, and the top of the mountain was surmounted by a statue.
               They soon left it behind, however, and as they passed onward various amusing and
                  pleasant sights met their inquiring gaze. At length, in the course of the
                  afternoon. Eugene and Arlington arrived at Macon, after which half an hour's ride
                  brought them to Fairfield Plantation, which they had no sooner reached than dozens
                  of slaves young and old ran out of the house, with the greatest appearance of
                  delight, to welcome their young master. Eugene shook hands with many of them, and
                  spoke kindly and frankly to the others.
               After a slight refection, the young men went forth to survey the premises. As they
                  passed along in the rear of the mansion, Melville noticed with much pleasure the
                  neatness of the out-buildings and the rural appearance of the white-washed cabins,
                  in which resided the most of the slaves. They were surrounded by flowers and
                  creeping plants, and in a little garden attached to each were vegetables and
                  herbs. There were plenty of chickens and other poultry running about: and Melville
                  thought that the numerous cabins placed in rows at the rear of the large house,
                  gave the place the appearance of a little town.
               "One would imagine," said he, "that these creatures were happy, with so many
                  little comforts; but I never can believe that a slave can be
                  happy."
               "They are happy," replied his friend. "You see these little gardens and that
                  poultry—well, these negroes, when their daily task is finished, cultivate their
                  vegetables and attend to their poultry until they are fit for market, and then
                  they will sell, for a good price, either to the family of their master or other
                     persons sons, their little stock of
                  produce. The money thus gained is spent by them and their families in purchasing
                  gay clothing and trinkets, of which they are particularly fond. So you see they
                  are allowed many privileges which not only render them more contented with their
                  lot, but naturally cause them to be greatly attached to their master or
                  mistress."
               As the young men walked on, the little woolly headed blacks peeped timidly out at
                  them from behind the garden palings, and as they approached them, would run away
                  giggling and chattering like so many parrots. Melville could not help laughing at
                  the drollery of their looks, half naked as they were, and observed—"These little
                  fellows seem happy enough."
               "Why should they not? They have nothing to do. Children are never tasked until
                  they are ten or twelve years old."
               After they had finished their survey of the habitations, the young men extended
                  their walk to the cotton and rice fields, which were in a high state of
                  cultivation. Here several slaves were yet at work pulling cotton, one of the
                  overseers standing near with a whip in his hand, which however was seldom used in
                  this well-ordered plantation. When the poor creatures saw Eugene their joy was
                  expressed in loud shouts of delight. He spoke to them all, and directed the
                  overseer to let them go home. After they had gone, the friends continued their
                  ramble. They passed along large fields of cotton, tobacco, and rice, all
                  presenting a flourishing aspect, and on their return rested awhile in a lovely
                  grove of palmettos, whose glossy, fan-like leaves hung gracefully down, and were
                  gently swayed to and fro by the evening breeze.
               "I cannot help pitying these poor negroes," said Melville, "although I see that
                  they are kindly treated by their master. Poor, ignorant creatures! they are
                  obliged to work day after day with a whip at their backs, and receive nothing in
                  return but their simple food and scanty supply of clothing."
               "What need have they of any thing else?" rejoined Eugene, "they are clothed warmly
                  enough for the climate, they have enough to eat, and they are as happy as
                  ignorance can be. We use them kindly, and yet we must keep them under our control,
                  we must keep them in fear; for should their natural tiger-like
                  disposition get the upper hand, it would be death to the
                  planter."
               "How can that be?" inquired Melville, "when they evidently love their master with
                  all the simplicity of their nature. Surely they could not harm him.
                  Were he a cruel, hard-hearted man, such as I have several times seen among the
                  Planters in your native State, it would
                  not be surprising that they should wish to rid themselves and the world of a
                  monster. But not a master such as your father and yourself."
               Eugene smiled. "If those Northern abolitionists were to stop their meddling in our
                  concerns, the condition of the slaves would be much improved. They come among us
                  as friends—and while enjoying our hospitality, whisper sedition and conspiracy
                  into the ears of our slaves, and often go so far as to steal them from us. If they
                  were to let us alone, there is no doubt that, in the course of years, not a slave
                  State would be in existence; and for my part I should rejoice to see that time
                  arrive. If I could, I would this moment emancipate every one of my
                     stock, but unfortunately for my happiness, they are all
                  entailed to me and my posterity by my uncle, who died a couple of years
                  since."
               "I am surprised to hear you talk thus, my dear Buckingham. Your
                     happiness? what has that to do with possessing stock, as
                  you call it?"
               Eugene seemed somewhat confused, and did not reply immediately. At last he said,
                  "My dear friend, I might as well confide in you, as you have an interest in the
                  lovely being who is the day star of my existence." Then, as Melville listened,
                  surprise gathering on his handsome countenance, our hero related to him the story
                  of his life, his love and his disappointment. When he had finished there was a
                  long silence between the friends. At length Melville broke through it by
                  exclaiming, "I too have a confession to make. Listen, Eugene! I—my dear friend—I
                  love your sweet sister Cora."
               "You love my sister!" cried the other much surprised, "and does she return your
                  love?"
               "I think so—I believe so—but I am not sure. I have never had an opportunity of
                  declaring myself, because, (and this I consider one of the evils of slavery,) she
                  is eternally attended by a little black girl who watches me continually with a
                  pair of great rolling eyes, as if she had strong suspicions that I intended to
                  steal away her mistress."
               Eugene could not help smiling, but he promised his friend that he should have
                     his countenance in the matter if he was sure that his sister
                  returned the young man's affection. After further conversation they returned to
                  the mansion, where they found an excellent supper prepared for them.
               When they had finished their meal, the young men took their station on a settee
                  out on the veranda, to smoke a segar or two. For a while there was an unbroken
                  silence between them, each being absorbed, in his own reflections. The moon was
                  very bright, although often obscured by fleeting clouds, and the night was a cool
                  and pleasant one.
               
               "Well," observed Melville at last, throwing away what remained of his segar, "must
                  confess I have been greatly edified this day, and very much amused too."
               "I was just thinking," rejoined his companion, puffing out a volume of smoke,
                  "that I could tell you a story to amuse you. Shall I? or are you amused enough?
                  Take another segar?"
               "No. What's the story? Come."
               "It is about a capital joke played off upon one of the Northern abolitionists by
                  some of our Charleston wags."
               "Very well—go on." 
               Eugene leaned back on his seat, took his segar from his mouth, and began: "About
                  two years ago an ultra-abolitionist from Syracuse, New-York, came to the city of
                  Charleston on some business. His name was Harford, and he remained some time in
                  our city. Being very much in awe of Judge Lynch, this man kept his ideas on
                  slavery to himself, except when he chanced to meet with a 'kindred spirit,' and
                  then his denunciations against slavery and slave-holders were frightful indeed.
                  Among other strange whims he declared that he would never speak to, or touch the
                  person of a slave while he stayed in Charleston, and that he would not taste a
                  morsel of bread or any other thing that had, to his knowledge, been made or cooked
                  by a slave.
               "He stayed at the Planter's Hotel, and was in the habit of attending St. Philip's
                  Church near by. The true reason of his devoutness was this: he had been very much
                  taken by a beautiful young lady who was a constant attendant at the church. She
                  was always richly and fashionably dressed, had lovely black eyes and long raven
                  curls, and a form of exquisite symmetry.
               "By inquiry he found that she was a milliner, and resided in the city. One of his
                  Southern acquaintances, a complete wag, by the by, who was well acquainted with
                  her, undertook to introduce the young man to this idol of his affections. It was
                  done; and as Harford was a personable fellow, with a pretty good address, he found
                  that he daily gained favor in her eyes.
               "Several other young men got wind of it, and doing all they could to help the
                  matter onward, soon had the delight of seeing the abolitionist married to the
                     beautiful—slave."
               "Slave!" echoed Melville, "ha! ha ha! a capital joke that. Did the fellow find it
                  out?"
               "You shall hear. As soon as the rogues had them fast married, and in the midst of
                  their honeymoon, they let out the secret, giving him undeniable proof of her being a slave, set up in business by
                  her owners, who resided in the country, to whom her profits were regularly
                  given.
               "The fact is, any body unused to slaves, would be mistaken in some of them; they
                  are so white. The only way to distinguish a slave from a white person, as I should
                  say, to prove the existence of negro blood in the veins, is by examining the
                  finger nails: the white crescent at the root in us, being wanting in them."
               "That's a new idea!" cried Arlington, "if I were not an Englishman I would examine
                  my own, that is, if there was light enough."
               "Do you mean to insinuate, Mr. Melville," said Eugene rather haughtily, "that we
                  Americans are all somewhat tainted?"
               "Excuse me, my dear friend, I had no such intention. But do go on—how did the
                  abolitionist get over his disappointment?"
               "He never got over it. As a marriage with a slave is not legal, he was at liberty
                  to leave her at any moment, yet he was so tormented and crowed over by those who
                  knew his real sentiments, that mortified and crestfallen, he suddenly and
                  privately escaped from the city, never to return."
               As it was growing late, and the young men were weary with their journey, they soon
                  retired to their respective rooms, and in a little while silence reigned over the
                  whole household.
               One pleasant morning the young friends, while strolling over a part of Fairfield
                  Plantation, where the slaves were at work, observed some of them at the other side
                  of a thick hedge; and overhearing their names mentioned, stopped to listen to the
                  conversation.
               "Who dat massa Mervil?" said one big fellow called Jeff.
               "Dun you know?" retorted uncle Pete, an old gray headed negro; "he be de friend o'
                  massa Eugene. Nice young gemmen too—he give ole nigger dollar toder day."
               "What fur he give you dollar, I wan' to know?" cried a mulatto boy at a little
                  distance.
               "Caze I catch him fine large squirrel, all white. He say he want it for hansum
                  missy."
               "How you catch him? 'lucidate dat question! You can't run after a cat," said the
                  boy with a malicious grin.
               Uncle Peter with a contemptuous look replied,—"My dog Jowler catch him, he fust
                  rate at dat, I kin tell you."
               Jeff now called out—"I say Uncle Pete! is you been do what you say?"
               "What dat? I fogit what 'twas."
               
               "Dah now! 'Pears like you fogit eberyting—you be grow so old. Didn't I tell you
                  len' me dat possum dog to night, an' you say yes?"
               "Well, sho' 'nough. But you don't wan' no dog to-night."
               "What fur I don't?"
               "Caze, you goin' to corn shuckin'."
               "No I isn't. Why you say dat? I'se gwine to ketch possum for Polly."
               "You big fool, Jeff!" cried uncle Peter disdainfully, "dun you know Polly aint
                  goin' to hab you arter all you run arter her. She take all you gib her—she wear de
                  nice tings, an' she eat up all de melons an' taters, an' eberyting. You let possum
                  alone. Polly play you trick some ob dese days."
               "How you know dat?" cried Jeff, looking much concerned.
               "Caze, can't I see fur mysef. She too fond o' Car'lina Jake. Polly's a knowin'
                  gal, I tell you."
               "Dah now!' returned the other, "I don't beleibe a word o' dat; caze why, when I
                  gib her bead necklace las' night, she tell me dat she lub me all ober."
               Here there was a general cachinnation among the other slaves around, which our
                  friends could hardly refrain from joining; but as they did not wish to be
                  discovered, they were obliged to control themselves.
               "Well, now," continued uncle Pete, "pears like
                  
                     p. 65. CHORUS—SING, DARKEYS, SING.
                   you haint got no sense. 'Taint no more dan yesterday dat I heard
                  Car'lina Jake ax massa Eugene if he might hab a fam'ly, an' massa ax
                  who 'twas, an' he said it was Polly."
               Jeff's sable countenance fell below zero. "Dah now! aint dat too bad? Arter all I
                  gib her dis whole year. Why, dis mornin' I make her beautiful present ob red
                  hankercher. 'Pears like I neber hab no luck." And poor Jeff walked off with a very
                  disconsolate air.
               Eugene and his friend then continued their walk, laughing at the disappointment of
                  the crestfallen lover, and coming to the conclusion that no station in life was
                  too humble for the spirit of coquetry to flourish in.
               That evening the "corn-shucking" or husking, came off. The corn was piled in large
                  heaps before the row of cabins, and although it was a bright night, being the full
                  of the moon, each little window of the slaves' habitations was illuminated by a
                  couple of tallow candles, so that every object was distinctly visible.
               Around the large corn heaps were seated over two hundred men and women, (many of
                  whom were from the neighboring plantations,) tearing off the husks and throwing
                  the ears into separate piles; and in the midst of their employment all were
                  chattering, laughing, singing and telling stories, much to the amusement of themselves and the young gentlemen,
                  who were seated a little apart observing the proceedings.
               On the top of one of the heaps was mounted uncle Cato, one of the principle
                  slaves, and a great favorite of Eugene's. He was noted for his talent of
                  improvisation. He would sing one or more lines of a song and the chorus would be
                  repeated by all the others. Some of the women had excellent voices, especially the
                  coquet, Miss Polly, a pretty mulatto, who had Caroline Jake beside her, and who
                  wore the identical scarlet handkerchief on her head in the form of a turban,
                  smiling now and then on Jeff, who took no notice, but sat at a distance scowling
                  defiance at his rival.
               One of the songs ran thus:
               
                  
                     "The lubly Moon it shine so bright,
                     We doesn't want no oder light,
                     Chorus: sing darkeys, sing!
                     De man up dare, he look at us,
                     He tink we make a great, big fuss,
                     Chorus: sing, darkeys, sing!
                     Possum-dog he cotch a coon,
                     Nigger skin him pretty soon,
                     Chorus: sing, darkeys, sing!
                     Sold de skin and got de chink,
                     Berry sorry dat I drink.
                     Chorus: sing, darkeys, sing!"
                  
               
               After this, whiskey was handed about by the overseers, and the slaves becoming
                  very merry, began to caper and sing more noisily than before.
               
                  
                     "Massa Eugene hab good whiskey,
                     Makes de niggers bery friskey,
                     Chorus: shucking ob de corn.
                     O, ho! de niggers jolly!
                     See dah, de pretty Polly!
                     Chorus: Shucking ob de corn.
                     Dat ar Jake, he sits beside her,
                     Will she hab dat big black spider?
                     Chorus: shucking ob de corn.
                     Jeff's so mad, he look like tunder—
                     O-o-o-o! who dat hit me wi de corn dah?
                     Chorus: Jeff, he trew dat corn."
                  
               
               By this time the husking was finished, it being quite late, and as the song was
                  concluded they all jumped up and had a regular break-down, exhibiting such
                  ridiculous antics that Melville and Eugene laughed till they could laugh no longer
                  from sheer exhaustion.
               Then Buckingham ordered them to disperse and retire to their cabins; and the
                  friends returning to the house, soon after sought their beds.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VI.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "He says he loves my daughter;
                           "I think so too: for never gazed the moon
                           "Upon the water, as he'll stand and read,
                           "As 'twere, my daughter's eyes."
                        
                     
                     —Shakspeare.
                  
               
               After remaining at Fairfield Plantation about a week, during which time frequent
                  rides and walks were taken by the young men around the adjacent country, Eugene
                  thought it time to be returning home. On their departure the slaves assembled
                  around them with evident regret at their going, and with one voice they cried,
                  "God bless young massa, and soon bring him back."
               They were soon seated in the cars and whizzing rapidly towards home. On the road
                  Melville observed many interesting objects that had before escaped his notice;
                  among other things the Spanish moss, as it is called, a singular production,
                  growing in long waving tresses upon the trees of the forest, and appearing to
                  derive its nourishment from the atmosphere alone, as it sends none of its fibers
                  into the tree for sustenance. A small quantity taken from one tree and hung upon
                  another, instead of dying from being torn from its first hold, will soon spread
                  itself over the entire tree, and sending down from every branch a long waving
                  streamer, as it were, gives the forest a dense and gloomy aspect which must be
                  seen to be realized. This moss, in its prepared state, much resembles hair, is
                  remarkably elastic, and is used in this country and exported to Europe for the
                  manufacture of mattrasses.
               About ten o'clock in the forenoon of the second day of their journey, something in
                  the machinery of the locomotive got out of order, and the train was obliged to
                  stop in the midst of a forest; many of the passengers left the cars, our friends
                  among the rest. Here were about two dozen negroes employed in cutting timber. At
                  least some of them were, and others lay about under the trees lazily enough,
                  chattering, laughing and singing, (apparently perfectly happy,) such scraps as
                  these: 
                     
                        "Ole Virginny, neber tire—
                        Eat hog and hominy, and lie by de fire;"
                     
                   many of them composing their ditties extempore, without regard to rhyme or
                  reason.
               At length the machinery was put in order and the train again started. In the course of the
                  afternoon our friends reached Charleston, and in a little while stood on the
                  veranda of Buckingham Hall, where Cora was the first to meet them, and her brother
                  might easily divine, which he did, by the bright blush on her fair cheek, that her
                  heart was lost to his friend. "Cora," said he, playfully patting her on the head,
                  "you see I have brought him back safe. I suppose you have been lost without him
                  for the past week."
               Cora blushed still more deeply at these words, and looking up, met the speaking
                  eyes of Arlington glowing upon her. Nothing was left her but to escape into the
                  house, which she did with much more expedition than her natural indolence
                  promised. The young men followed, and were soon joined by the Colonel, who
                  inquired concerning the state of his son's plantation; and seemed well pleased
                  with the favorable account Eugene gave of it.
               That evening Cora told her brother that their father had invited F. Jones and his
                  daughter to dine with them. With an exclamation of impatience, Eugene declared he
                  would not stay in the house while the hated object remained there, but Cora
                  assured him he would not be sorry if he yielded to his father's wishes in some
                  respects. "Not that I wish you to marry her," continued the young girl, "but if
                  you only show her a little countenance."
               "A very little countenance, indeed it will be," interrupted her brother; "but to
                  please my father and you, I will consent for once to suffer the martyrdom of her
                  presence."
               Melville, who was near, smiled and observed, "I do not wonder at his dislike to
                  Miss Jones, from what he has told me concerning her. It certainly must be a
                  dreadful thing to be forced to marry one you hate, and be banished from the sweet
                  society of one you love. Do you not think so, fair Cora?" There was a
                  silvery sweetness in his voice. and a soft glow in his dark eyes, that went to the
                  heart of the young girl, and she could but murmur—"I think so."
               Eugene, thinking the time and place very meet for a declaration, and willing to do
                  as he would wish to be done by, rose and left the room, taking with him little
                  Rosa, the slave, on some pretence or other. Arlington looked around and understood
                  his friend's manœuvre. Cora's eyes were bent upon an album in her lap as her lover
                  again spoke in the same sweetly modulated tones. "So you think, fair girl, it is a
                  sad thing to be banished, without a hope, from the side of the being you
                  adore?"
               Cora made no answer, but her head drooped lower over her album. He took her hand,
                  and bending his knee before her like a
                  lover of the olden time, continued—"if you think so, dearest, you cannot banish
                  the suppliant at your feet, for he loves you—adores you!
                  Have you the heart to banish me, sweet Cora?"
               Cora opened her lustrous eyes and softly answered, "No!"
               "Nor I either, I declare! I'm sure I could not!" laughed a voice behind him, as
                  the delighted lover was in the act of raising her hand to his lips. Melville
                  started to his feet, and Cora covered her face with her hands in deep confusion.
                  The Colonel stood quietly in the middle of the room. The young man marched up to
                  him with great resolution and accosted him thus: "Sir, have I your sanction?"
               "You are a pretty fellow indeed'! Is that the way you return my hospitality, by
                  attempting to steal away my only daughter? There is no knowing what would have
                  happened had I not entered the room, perhaps you would have had the audacity to
                  kiss her."
               "I think it very likely I should," boldly answered Melville.
               "I must confess I think you have a good stock of impudence," said the Colonel,
                  half laughing; "however. I forgive you, and as I chance to know something thing of 
                     youself
                     yourself
                   and your relatives, I will not refuse my sanction."
               The young man could scarcely find words to express his thanks, and Eugene, by this
                  time making his appearance, was much gratified to see the course things had taken,
                  yet could not repress a deep sigh at the thought of his own unhappiness.
               The next day at noon, F. Jones, Esq. and his Amazon daughter made their appearance
                  at the Hall. The Colonel gave them a warm reception, and Eugene a cold and stately
                  one. As for Cora and Arlington, they were polite and attentive to the guests
                  without being familiar. Our hero saw that his father's eye was upon him, and he
                  made a desperate attempt to be civil to Miss Susanna Jones.
               Before dinner the guests, accompanied by the Colonel and the rest, took a walk in
                  the garden and grounds. Susanna had with her a little white poodle, of which she
                  was extravagantly fond, and as they strolled along he was continually doing some
                  mischief or other; either chasing the peacocks or running among the flowers and
                  biting them from their stems. Col. Buckingham did not appear to notice him, but
                  Cora, vexed to see her plants destroyed, caught up a switch and struck him;
                  whereat Miss Jones exclaimed with passion, "How dare you strike my dog?"
               
               Cora made no reply, but Arlington observed, "I think he deserves a little
                  correction; Miss Buckingham's flowers are rare."
               Susanna looked around as if surprised. "O, did he hurt the flowers? That was
                  wrong. Here Diana," continued she, addressing her attendant slave, "take him and
                  shut him up in the house, he deserves punishment, but I prefer to correct him
                  myself," with an angry look at Cora, who, however, took no notice of it, but
                  walked on, leaning on the arm of her lover, with her usual languid air.
               This little incident, trifling as it was, indicated a trait in the character of
                  Miss Jones that caused Eugene to dislike her more than ever. "What a wife she
                  would make," he thought, "with her domineering passionate disposition."
               At two in the afternoon dinner was announced. During the meal Eugene was silent
                  and abstracted, while the rest were conversing with much vivacity. Miss Jones,
                  who, by his father's management, was placed beside him, chattered in his ear like
                  a magpie, although he scarcely gave her a word in return, notwithstanding he met
                  the Colonel's angry eye upon him every time he glanced in that direction.
               After dinner they repaired to the parlor, and Colonel Buckingham approaching his
                  son and Susanna na, who were looking over a portfolio of Cora's drawings,
                  observed, "Did my daughter tell you, Miss Jones, of her engagement?"
               "No, she did not," answered that lady with some surprise.
               "There is the gentleman;" pointing to Melville, who was seated with Cora at one of
                  the windows. "And I think," he continued in a jesting tone, "that we ought to have
                     another engagement soon. What say you Eugene?"
               Susanna put her fan before her face, and tried very hard to raise a blush, but she
                  only looked tickled, while the young man, starting as if from a reverie,
                  exclaimed, "Sir!"
               His father gave him a glance that plainly said, "I am not to be trifled with," but
                  Eugene cared not, he only waited to hear him speak.
               "My respectable friend, Mr. Jones, has agreed with me that it would be a meet and
                  advantageous thing for all parties, that the persons and fortunes of our children
                  should be united. Therefore, as Miss Jones is not averse and Eugene can
                     not be, I propose that the wedding come off by the latter end of next
                  month."
               "And I second that proposal," said Jones, advancing.
               This scene would have made an excellent picture. There stood the Colonel, tall and commanding, his
                  arms folded, and his eyes bent sternly on his son—near him was Jones, a small,
                  dark man, of insignificant appearance, looking on with a smirking countenance—his
                  daughter Susanna close to our hero, her head turned aside and her handkerchief
                  before her face, trying to look modest—in the back-ground Cora and Arlington
                  looking up with much surprise on their countenances, and Eugene himself, his tall
                  form drawn up to its full height, his dark eyes flashing, and every lineament of
                  his countenance expressing anger and disdain.
               Full two minutes passed before another word was spoken. Then Eugene, in a voice
                  trembling with subdued passion, ejaculated—"Am I a slave? I
                     will not submit to such tyranny! I will not be forced
                  to marry against my will!" And as he spoke, he broke abruptly from their presence
                  and was seen no more that day.
               Jones sneaked into a corner, looking disappointed and foolish, while the elder
                  Buckingham walked the floor with hasty strides, endeavoring to subdue the rising
                  anger within him; and Susanna, after standing silent awhile, concluded to go into
                  hysterics, and succeeded very well in frightening Cora and the young slaves.
                  Melville, bursting with laughter, ran incontinently tinently but of the house; and
                  after indulging in merriment awhile, commenced singing as a finale to the
                  performance, 
                     "Oh, Susanna, don't you cry for me!"
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VII.
               
                  
                     
                        "The wanderer was alone as heretofore:
                        "The beings which surrounded him were gone,
                        "Or were at war with him; he was a mark
                        "For blight and desolation."
                     
                  
               
               After what had passed, Eugene was resolved again to quit his home, and in two days
                  time found himself on his way to New-York, accompanied by Melville, whose private
                  affairs obliged him to absent himself from his betrothed. Cora was very unhappy at
                  the idea of his leaving her. "Perhaps," she sighed, "You will never return."
               "Cruel girl!" was his reply, to harbor such a doubt.
               Yet, their parting was one of love and regret; and when her brother in his turn,
                  bade her adieu, there was a tear in his eye, which brought a shower to those of
                  Cora. Eugene took no leave of his father, for the Colonel kept purposely aloof:
                  and when the young friends stood together on the deck of the noble steamer, as she
                  proudly sailed out of the beautiful bay of Charleston, there was a silent gloom
                  enveloping the hearts of both.
               The first day of their passage was calm and pleasant; but on the next night the
                  rain fell in torrents and the sea was fearfully wrought; and to add to this, most
                  of the passengers grew sea-sick, and then, as the boat ploughed through the
                  rolling waves, there was some heaving. The Captain appeared to look
                  upon it all as a joke and called it only a salt water breeze; but the
                  passengers learned from him next morning that he had been so much alarmed as to
                  have the boats in readiness, expecting every minute, from the height of the gale,
                  to see the pipes of the engine blow away. In a short time, however, the gale
                  abated considerably, and our friends turned into their berths, resigning
                  themselves to the kind care of Him who sayeth to the sea, "Be still!" and it
                  obeyeth.
               Nothing worthy of note occurred during the rest of the passage, and on arriving at
                  the good city of Gotham the young men put up at the Astor, where Eugene met a warm
                  reception from his former friend and host, Capt. Coleman. Very soon after his
                  arrival, our hero, accompanied by Melville, paid a visit to the lovely Julia, who
                  received them as each wished to be received, and for a short season Eugene felt happy in her presence. After an agreeable
                  conversation, he took his leave; and her cousin then gave her a relation of his
                  own adventures, and the trials and persecutions of his friend. If she was pleased
                  with the first, she was much moved by the latter, and exclaimed several times,
                  while drops glistened in her beautiful eyes, "Poor fellow! poor Eugene!"
               The next day Buckingham called again, and finding his beloved alone, had a long
                  conversation with her, during which he urged her to become his wife, and even
                  ventured to propose an elopement. But Julia would not listen to such a proposal;
                  she loved him, she said, but would not disobey her father.
               "Gain his consent, dear Eugene, and I am yours. Not otherwise." But they parted as
                  engaged lovers: he placed a diamond ring upon her finger, and they exchanged
                  daguerreotypes.
               Before he left the house, Buckingham resolved to press his suit once more with her
                  father. He therefore sought him in his library. The Doctor correctly divined the
                  subject the young man wished to enter upon, and inwardly resolved to be inflexible
                  on the one point. After listening quietly until Eugene had exhausted all his 
                     rhotaric
                     rhetoric
                   in endeavoring to soften his obdurate heart, the old Doctor replied, "If
                  you will prove your love and devotion for my daughter, by emancipating your
                  slaves, I will not refuse to grant my sanction to your mutual wishes—but, not
                  until then."
               "Would to God I could do it!" cried the young man with much emotion, "but it is
                  impossible. They are entailed by the will of my uncle as long as Georgia shall
                  remain a slave State."
               Dr. Tennyson only replied, "Well sir, if that is the case, you have had my mind on
                  the subject long ago. My opinions, like the laws of the Medes and Persians, are
                  unchangeable. As long as you are a slave-holder you cannot marry my daughter with
                  my consent."
               Eugene was greatly affected by this reply. "O, sir!" he cried, "you cannot surely
                  be so cruel as to make two human beings miserable by your prejudices—and one of
                  them your only daughter. You know too, that I have the will but not the power to
                  comply with your request, as I am the involuntary inheritor of this
                  patrimony."
               "Mr. Buckingham," said the Doctor, rising, "enough has been said on this subject.
                  It is useless to waste any more words."
               On this our hero took up his hat and with a formal "Good evening" took his
                  departure, overwhelmed with disappointment and despair.
               As he proceeded down Broadway, Eugene was plunged in melancholy reflections; and
                  it was not until he had been sitting an
                  hour or two in the gentleman's parlor at the Astor, that he recalled to mind his
                  great presentiment—his belief that the destinies of himself and Julia were one day
                  to be united. This thought caused him to shake off his despondency, and he began
                  to form plans for future action, in the midst of which he was accosted by
                  Arlington, who had just come in.
               "Well, Eugene," he cried, taking a seat beside his friend, "how goes it with you
                  now? Have you succeeded with the old gentlemen?"
               "Indeed I have not," replied the other, sadly enough.
               "I am sorry for you, sincerely I am. But what do you intend to do next? Are you
                  going home?"
               "No. To be persecuted again? What happiness, would I find there?"
               "Will you stay here then?"
               "I cannot—I must not. I shall travel. I must find change of scene and excitement.
                  I will start for Niagara to-morrow, and proceed from thence by the lakes through
                  the Western States. Will you accompany me?"
               "I would with pleasure, but just now it is impossible, I have business in New-York
                  that must be attended to. I could not go."
               "I am sorry. Your society would be so acceptable."
               Here the conversation of the young men was interrupted by an acquaintance of
                  Melville's, with whom he had promised to go to the Broadway Theatre to hear
                  Forrest. Arlington introduced him to Eugene, and after some words of ceremony, he
                  joined with Melville in persuading our hero to accompany them.
               The next morning Eugene prepared to leave the city without venturing again to
                  visit La Fayette Place, even to bid farewell to his beautiful idol. The carriage
                  was announced, his baggage secured, and accompanied by Melville, who wished to see
                  him off, he proceeded to the wharf. The boat, which happened to be the Isaac
                  Newton, one of the Hudson's floating palaces, was just ready to start. The friends
                  shook hands warmly. "Remember me to Julia," said Eugene, while Arlington bid him
                  he of good cheer, for he would assist him, with all his power, to attain the
                  cherished wish of his heart.
               It was on the morning of the first of October, 18—, that Eugene found himself
                  rapidly gliding over the waters of one of the most beautiful rivers in America,
                  and one whose scenery is unequalled. It was a day of unclouded splendor; and as
                  our hero stood upon the deck, looking around him, his heart grew saddened, and he
                  became absorbed in contemplation.
               The month of October is calculated to engender melancholy reflections. The
                  evidence of decay which Nature exhibits
                  in the fading and falling of her gorgeous drapery, is calculated to impress us
                  with a sense of our own mortality—that we too, must soon become like the "sere and
                  yellow leaf," and mingle with the clods of the valley—or as the Poet of the
                  Seasons, says— 
                     
                        "Pass some few years—
                        Thy flowery Spring, thy Summer's ardent strength,
                        Thy sober Autumn fading into age,
                        And pale concluding Winter comes at last;
                        And shuts the scene."'
                     
                  
               
               But why should Autumn make us melancholy? If we have improved the bounteous smiles
                  of Heaven, every day may and will have its share of joy.
               Yet neither the picturesqueness of the Palisades, nor the grander beauty of the
                  highlands, nor the elegant villas of the merchant princes of Gotham, built on the
                  bluffs, interested him then, for his mind was continually reverting to the idol of
                  his heart, and he was too unhappy to derive pleasure from surrounding objects.
                  After pacing to and fro on the hurricane deck for some time, Eugene descended to
                  the cabins to take a look at his fellow passengers, and found they numbered over
                  three hundred, all on various errands bent; and they certainly, presented a motley
                  assembly. Almost every State in the Union was represented, and there were also
                  many foreigners. At one end of the cabin stood a band of politicians, discussing
                  the affairs of the nation with as much anxiety as if each had the care of
                  government upon his own shoulders; and at the other, a group of emigrants were
                  talking about their prospects in the "far West." In the ladies saloon, old and
                  young ladies, children and nurses were amusing themselves in different ways; some
                  employed with their needlework, others walking about, many reclining on the
                  elegant softly cushioned sofas and divans, and several employed in reading either
                  magazines, or the last new novel.
               Here Buckingham remained some time, contrasting the beauty of some of the really
                  charming young girls with that of his Julia; and in his eye, none could compete
                  with her.
               The day sped onward—and towards evening the boat arrived at Albany, where Eugene
                  concluded to stop until the next night. In the morning he went abroad to view the
                  city and its environs, and after dinner retired to his room to sleep for a few
                  hours, as he was to travel in the night train for Buffalo. Six o'clock found him
                  in the cars rapidly skimming through green fields, valleys, rocks, and over little
                  streams and great rivers also. Darkness came and still the train sped on,
                  occasionally stopping, at which times our traveller with other passengers would step out to look around him. The
                  night was clear and the stars gleamed—and when he would return to his seat and
                  endeavor to slumber, he found it impossible. The next day he felt so tired and
                  sleepy that he scarcely looked about him, and was rejoiced when the train stopped
                  at Buffalo. Here he remained all night, and in the morning started in the train
                  for Niagara. Towards the middle of the day the hoarse roaring of the
                  mighty cataract sounded upon his ear. His feelings were then changed from
                  melancholy gloom to awe and reverence; and when the cars stopped, he left his
                  baggage to be taken to the Cataract House, and without delay bent his steps
                  towards Iris Island, where, as he stood, the falls beneath him 
                     
                        "Exerting all his soul,
                        "To take the vast idea in, and comprehend the whole;"
                     
                   he could not help exclaiming— 
                     
                        "These are thy works, Parent of good!
                        "Almighty! Thine this universal frame:
                        "Thyself how wondrous then!"
                     
                  
               
               That evening he penned the following for the Fall's Register: 
                     
                        "White-foaming, boiling river,
                        Thy rapids ceaseless roar,
                        For ever, on for ever,
                        Till Time shall be no more.
                     
                     
                        "I hear thee, now I hear thee—
                        At evening's silent hour;
                        Whenever I am near thee
                        I feel thy magic power.
                     
                     
                        "Green be the waters ever
                        Wreathed with a foam of snow,
                        Flow on, majestic river,
                        Unstemm'd, resistless, flow!"
                     
                  
               
               At Niagara our hero remained two days, viewing the Falls at every accessible
                  point. On the eve of his departure for Chicago he retired to his room and wrote to
                  his ever present idol, thus:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "DEAR LADY,
                           
                           "Amid the glorious beauty and grand sublimity of Niagara, I feel
                                 alone. Amid the gay and fashionable throng of visiters here,
                              my mind reverts incessantly to you. Oh! that we could become nearer
                              related! that I could call you by a nearer and dearer name! But, alas!
                              I fear that I am destined to be a wanderer, banished from the
                              endearments of love. However, wherever I am, my heart is
                              always with you. Your image is constantly before me. I often recal to
                              mind the happy hours I have spent in your sweet society—the delightful
                              ramble we took together in Greenwood some time ago, admiring the
                              flowers—my mind being occupied the while by a fairer
                              
                              flower. Oh, that I could obtain that flower to adorn my
                              Southern parterre! You cannot imagine, dearest, with what intensity I
                              love you—with what utter loneliness my heart is filled when I am away
                              from you.
                           "Think of me sometimes in your nightly orisons, and pray for your
                              unhappy
                           
                              "EUGENE."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Our traveller left Buffalo by the Oregon, and here again encountered a severe
                  storm. He had not been long on board before 
                     
                        "The waters darkened, and the rustling sound
                        "Told of the coming gale."
                     
                   Black clouds were driven on in thick array, and big drops of rain along with
                  strong gusts of wind soon ripened into a storm, whose fury became every moment
                  greater. The passengers were much terrified, and at one time the Captain almost
                  despaired of saving the vessel. But, after some hours the tempest gradually
                  abated, and the sun struggling through the dense clouds, shone brightly and clear
                  over that vast inland sea, Lake Erie.
               At length the Oregon arrived at Detroit, at which event, Eugene, as well as many
                  of his fellow passengers, rejoiced, for they had suffered much from the Lake
                  sickness during their trip.
               At this city he remained a short time, and then started for Chicago, which he
                  reached in a couple of days. He was so much pleased with the beauty of this place
                  that he spent several days in its vicinity. He frequently ascended the cupola of
                  the Lake House, and with the aid of a telescope viewed a vast and boundless
                  prairie on one side, and on the other could see for miles over the dark green
                  waters of Lake Michigan. As it was, he enjoyed in a measure the beautiful scenery
                  around him, but would have appreciated it far better had the melancholy which
                  continually preyed upon his mind been removed. Owing to this Eugene became quite
                  unwell, and when he left Chicago, in the stage for Peru, he was not fit to be out
                  of bed, as he was in a high fever. For two nights he got no sleep, and on the
                  second was rendered much worse by being terrified at the sight of a burning
                  prairie, through which their journey lay.
               The night was clear, and, a slight breeze agitated the air. As the stage, drawn by
                  four spirited horses, advanced rapidly through the prairie, a sense of smoke began
                  to be perceived by the passengers, and looking out they saw, apparently several
                  miles in advance of them, a great volume of smoke illuminated by a brilliant,
                  spreading flame, which appeared to be many miles in extent. As they drew
                     gradually dually nearer, all,
                  including our invalid traveller, acknowledged that although a fearful, it was a
                  splendid sight. The beaten track alone remained untouched, which, as far as the
                  eye could see, seemed like a black serpent meandering through the prairie; while
                  on both sides of it vast sheets of flame waved and pointed in the air through the
                  thick black smoke, like so many demons exulting in their terrible career of
                  destruction.
               Still the stage advanced, for it could not go back, and the bright flame came
                  sweeping onward to meet it with frightful vehemence. The driver now urged his
                  frightened horses to a full gallop, fearing, as did the passengers, that the
                  flames might attach themselves to the vehicle as it was, the heat and smoke nearly
                  blinded and almost suffocated them. But onward they went, scathless, for a full
                  mile, and the blaze began to decrease—at last to be extinguished, leaving after it
                  nothing but a black desolation. At length they weary and trembling steeds were
                  suffered to relapse into a trot; and when the escaped travellers looked behind
                  them, they saw in the distance the same bright, awful ocean of flame careering
                  onward with the same devouring fury.
               All were terrified in a more or less degree, but Eugene, from his illness, felt
                  the effects of his fright much more than the others, and has often said, that to
                  the last day of his life he would never forget that night of terror.

                           THE PRAIRIE ON FIRE!
                           BY GEORGE P. MORRIS.*

                           
                              
                              *The following ballad is founded, in part, upon a thrilling story of
                                 the West, related by Mr. Cooper, the novelist.
                           
                           
                              The shades of evening closed around
                              The boundless prairies of the West,
                              As, grouped in sadness on the ground,
                              A band of pilgrims leaned to rest:
                              Upon the tangled weeds were laid,
                              The mother and her youngest born,
                              Who slept, while others watch'd and pray'd,
                              And thus the weary night went on.
                           
                           
                              Thick darkness shrouded earth and sky—
                              When, on the morning winds there came
                              The Teton's shrill and thrilling cry,
                              And heaven was pierced with shafts of flame;
                              The sun seem'd rising through the haze,
                              But with an aspect dread and dire!
                              The very air appeared to blaze!
                              O God! the prairie was on fire!
                           
                           
                              Around the centre of the plain
                              A belt of flame retreat denied.
                              And, like a furnace glowed the train
                              That wall'd them in on every side:
                              
                              And onward rolled the torrent wild—
                              Wreaths of dense smoke obscured the sky!
                              Down knelt the mother and her child,
                              And all—save one—shrieked out "We die!"
                           
                           
                              "Not so!" he cried—"help—clear the sedge!
                              "Strip bare a circle to the land!" 
                              That done, he hastened to its edge,
                              And grasped a rifle in his hand:
                              Dried weeds he held beside the pan,
                              Which kindled at a flash, the mass!
                              Now "fire fight fire!" he said, as ran
                              The forked flames among the grass.
                           
                           
                              On three sides soon the torrent flew,
                              But on the fourth no more it raved!
                              Then large and broad the circle grew,
                              And thus the pilgrim band was saved!
                              The flames receded far and wide,
                              The mother had not prayed in vain!
                              God had the Teton's arts defied!
                              His scythe of fire had swept the plain.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               But, to proceed with our story: on reaching 
                     Pern
                     Peru
                   our traveller took a boat to St. Louis, and from that place another to
                  Nashville, making as little delay as possible on account of his illness. Before he
                  reached the last mentioned place, while walking one morning on the hurricane deck,
                  he suddenly fell down in a swoon. One of his fellow passengers, who happened at
                  heart to be a "good Samaritan," came to his assistance, raised him in his arms,
                  and with the help of one or two others carried him to his berth, where this true
                  friend attended him and procured him medicine until he seemed to grow better;
                  while many of the other passengers, like the "Priest and the Levite," passed by
                  without deigning to notice him.
               How soothing to the sick in a strange land, the welcome attentions of a stranger!
                  'Tis like a dream of home. Eugene felt this, and was deeply grateful.
               After arriving at Nashville he took passage in the stage for Huntsville, Alabama,
                  which started some time before day. There was but one passenger besides himself,
                  and the journey would be a long one.
               And now, sad to relate, since Eugene had left Chicago he had suffered so much both
                  bodily and mentally, that his illness terminated in brain fever, and he became
                  suddenly, helplessly insane.
               But, I will give the account of his derangement in his own words, as related to me
                  after his restoration; for, unlike many of the insane, he perfectly remembered
                  every circumstance that occurred during his unfortunate malady.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VIII.
               
                  
                     "See how the noble mind's o'erthrown."
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        "I know not how the case may be,
                        "I tell the tale as told to me."
                     
                  
               
               "I left Nashville about five o'clock in the morning, for Huntsville, and in the
                  stage was but one passenger beside myself. He was a perfect stranger to me, a
                  gentleman from Kentucky, who was going on by Charleston to one of the eastern
                  cities, in order to embark for Europe. His name was Stanley, his age about thirty,
                  and he possessed a kind and benevolent physiognomy, which accorded well with his
                  actions towards me during my unfortunate malady. I have always looked upon this
                  crisis in my illness as a remarkable special Providence—a blessing from heaven,
                  that this man should have been placed in my way to protect me on my journey
                  home.
               "The morning was rather cool, and I had my buffalo robe wrapped about me; but
                  though I was chilled in body, there was a burning fever in my brain. I had never
                  in my life before felt as I did then, yet for a time I conversed calmly and
                  rationally with my fellow passenger. But, when we had got about thirty miles from
                  Nashville, suddenly I experienced a feeling exactly similar to an electric shock
                  vibrating through every fibre of my frame, and from that moment I was insane.
               "I started up, and throwing off my cap, pulled the buffalo over my head, and began
                  shouting loudly; gesticulated with my arms, and threw myself into all sorts of
                  attitudes. This paroxysm lasted for several minutes, and then subsided slowly. I
                  think I shall never forget the looks of Stanley as he appeared when I became calm
                  enough to observe him. He was crouched into the farthest corner of the stage, his
                  face of an ashy paleness, and his eyes glaring wildly with affright. When I spoke
                  to him he scarcely answered, and seemed to expect every moment would be his
                  last.
               "My intellect was still clouded, and I told him solemnly not to mention the
                  miracle he had just seen performed on me—for I was now a spiritual being. Indeed,
                  my first impression was, that my guardian angel had stood on one side of me and
                     the evil spirit on the other, and that
                  there had been a terrible strife between them as to which should gain possession
                  of me; but as the former became victorious, I was endowed, in some mysterious way,
                  with the powers of a celestial being, and would soon mount to Heaven, like some of
                  the prophets of olden time.
               "However, at intervals I conversed quite rationally with my fellow passenger,
                  whose fears had in some degree subsided; but on reaching Columbia I was attacked
                  with another paroxism, and leaping out of the stage as it stopped, I commenced
                  shouting and running about the streets, attracting the attention of a great number
                  of people.
               "There is a high bridge crossing the Duck river at this place: it is built upon
                  the perpendicular rocks of this rapid stream; and to this bridge I sprang with the
                  intention of leaping from it into the river, imagining that, as I was
                     immortal, there was no danger of being drowned. But as I was in
                  the act of making the fatal plunge, my friend Stanley fortunately reaching the
                  spot in time, seized me, and, assisted by some of the bystanders, carried me off,
                  not without some trouble, to the hotel, where I remained a short time, amusing the
                  persons around me by my actions and conversation, which were wild in the
                  extreme.
               At length, when the stage stopped at the door for us they attempted to get me into
                  it, but in vain; I was determined not to leave the hotel. They caused it to drive
                  away a short distance in hopes that I would change my mind, but in this they were
                  mistaken, and Stanley was obliged to let our baggage go on without us.
               "Towards evening this paroxysm abated, and I ordered my friend to procure me a
                  bath, which he cheerfully attended to, as he knew it was best to comply with my
                  requests if at all reasonable. We were then conducted into a back room, in which
                  there blazed a cheerful fire, but even here I was not secure from impertinent
                  curiosity, for many persons followed us to this retreat. It was very wrong, and I
                  thought so at the time, to allow them admittance.
               "When Stanley took off part of my clothing, preparatory to putting me in the bath,
                  he found a money-belt buckled around my waist. This gave rise to many conjectures,
                  concerning myself and my profession. Some of the bystanders thought me a merchant
                  going to the Eastern cities for goods; others, that I was a drover; but most of
                  them imagined, more correctly, that I was merely travelling for amusement. At
                  length one person seeing my name marked on part of my clothing, inquired, with a
                  great deal of interest, if I was not the son of Col. Buckingham, of Charleston. This man, no doubt, was
                  acquainted with my father, but being very jealous of my dignity, I would not deign
                  to answer him.
               "At last I ordered the room to be cleared, which was no sooner done than I made a
                  rush to the door, stripped as I was, to my under garments, in order, as I said, to
                  make my ascension into the upper regions. However, I was soon brought back by my
                  friend Stanley, and in a short time after bathing I was put to bed. I became
                  calmer after a while, and slept some during the night.
               "The next day being Sunday, I objected to start in the stage for Pulaski, as I
                  considered it very wrong to travel on that holy day, but by much persuasion my
                  kind friend got me in the vehicle. The passengers besides Stanley and myself were
                  two ladies and a gentleman. Before we had proceeded far I again became excited and
                  commenced talking about my aerial ascension, which alarmed the females very much.
                  However, I was not violent just then, and when I ceased talking, I saw they
                  regarded me with a great deal of sympathy, particularly, as during my ravings I
                  had repeatedly called upon my darling Julia. They conversed with
                  Stanley concerning me, and their conjectures were, alas! too true: that I had been
                  disappointed in love, which was the cause of my present deplorable condition. Oh,
                  ye unreasonable and hard hearted parents! what will ye not have to answer for, by
                  thus causing, or being the means of, the greatest affliction that can visit poor
                  human nature.
               "As we proceeded on our journey I became very rude and troublesome, so much so
                  that my companions were obliged to place my buffalo robe between them and me to
                  protect themselves from ny ill conduct. As is generally the case with insane
                  persons, strange as it may seem, I treated my best friend worse than
                  any other person, for I spat in poor Stanley's face, struck him, and called him
                  all manner of hard names whenever he attempted to render me any service.
               "When the stage stopped to change horses, or to give the passengers an opportunity
                  for refreshments, I was generally shut up in the vehicle by myself, which always
                  rendered me very indignant, and I would rave and shout so loud as to draw a crowd
                  around me. Then I would begin to complain of Stanley's wicked behavior, telling
                  those around me that he was Satan himself, to find whom I had travelled all over
                  the world, and having caught him, was now taking him to shut him up in the
                  infernal regions, where he properly belonged. One reason why my insane ideas ran
                  so much on this point, was, because
                  cause I had visited, a short time previous to my illness, a representation, at one
                  of the Western museums, of the place of punishment, which we call Hell. I will
                  give a concise description of it as it exists in my memory.
               "The room in which it is exhibited is at first quite dark, and an unearthly sound,
                  something like distant thunder, strikes upon the ear. In a few moments the place
                  becomes a little lighter, and the curtain rising, the spectator beholds a
                  frightful sight. Near the front of the stage appears in 'bold relief,' Belzebub
                  himself, the commander in chief of those doleful regions. 
                     'Black he stands as night, and shakes a dreadful dart;'
                   While near him stands the great dog Cerberus, with three heads, who guards
                  the gates of Hell. This infernal monster keeps up an awful howling, and springs
                  forward occasionally, as if he intended to devour some of the spectators. On the
                  other side of Satan is an enormous black snake, who is continually coiling and
                  uncoiling his long body in the attempt to reach some hapless mortal, his huge jaws
                  wide open, and his forked tongue trembling therein. Some of the spectators who
                  happen to stand near, start back with fearful apprehension.
               "The room is represented with great rocks hanging ing over it, some of their
                  points nearly touching the floor. At the farther end is a large fire whereon
                     skeletons are roasting. Chains are rattling—demons are
                  howling—mournful cries are resounding through the dismal regions, and the lost
                  spirits are heard calling to one another, inquiring the cause of each other being
                  sent thither. Every one tells a tale of sin, while curses and revilings echo on
                  all sides—and at the same time that unceasing, doleful thundering
                     sound is heard, 
                     
                        'A universal hubbub wild
                        'Of stunning sounds and voices all confused,
                        'Borne through the hollow dark;'
                     
                   while at the same time the olfactories are saluted with a strong sense of
                  brimstone.
               "I never was so glad to escape from any place in my life as I was from this horrid
                  spectacle, and a cold chill runs through my frame yet, when I think of it. I
                  consider it highly improper for authorities of cities to permit such exhibitions
                  in their precincts, as there are many nervous persons who may be affected by the
                  sight for months and years afterwards.
               "To proceed: on arriving at Pulaski I jumped out of the stage and began running
                  about the streets and shouting as I had done at Columbia. I had not proceeded far
                  when I was surrounded by half a dozen men, who, thinking there was danger in
                     leaving me at liberty, secured me,
                  but not before I had knocked down a couple of them. They then bound me with cords
                  and carried me off to jail. On the way I complained of being hurt by the tightness
                  of my bonds, and my captors were lenient enough to stop and loosen them. I kept
                  continually asking these men what I had done to be used thus harshly, but
                  disregarding my inquiries, they hastened to put me in a room of the prison. At
                  this juncture my true friend came to my aid, and after much expostulation I was
                  allowed to be taken to a hotel, where I was bled and put to bed. As Stanley was
                  nearly worn out from attending me, another person was put into my room to take
                  charge of me, but he proved a bad nurse and I suffered very much on account of his
                  inattention. My arm was bandaged so tightly that it threw me into a fever and I
                  became very thirsty, but could not prevail on my attendant either to give me a
                  drink or to loosen my bandage; and thus I remained suffering until the doctor came
                  the next morning."
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "The lunatic, the lover and the poet,
                           "Are of imagination all compact."
                        
                     
                     —Shakspeare.
                  
               
               "Many persons labor under a mistake in regard to the insane, they imagine that
                  they have no physical suffering, whereas, their sensibilities are much more acute
                  than those of the sane. Owing to the raging fever within me, I suffered more from
                  thirst than from anything else during my journey, yet could not make my attendants
                  believe that I wanted to drink almost constantly.
               "In the morning Stanley hired a private carriage to take us to Huntsville,
                  Alabama, as I was too troublesome to the stage passengers. After reaching this
                  place, I was brought on to Whitesville, on the Tennessee River, and there put on
                  board a steamboat bound for Chattanooga, Tennessee. On arriving at this town, they
                  placed me in the cars for Charleston, where we arrived after night. I was taken by
                     the faithful Stanley to my father's
                  house, in a carriage, and the family aroused from their slumbers. You may imagine
                  the grief and consternation of my father and sister when they beheld the
                  unfortunate Eugene brought home to them, a wreck both in body and mind. They were
                  nearly distracted, and the slaves went about weeping for 'poor massa Eugene,' for
                  I had been a general favorite among them, as they were always treated by me with
                  kindness and humanity.
               "When my friend Stanley hinted to my father his suspicions in regard to the cause
                  of my insanity, the old man's heart smote him, and he bitterly repented what he
                  had done; but repentance, as it often does, came too late, and he felt it
                  deeply.
               "When it became known in Charleston that I had been brought home insane, it
                  created a great deal of excitement among my acquaintances. Various were the
                  conjectures as to the cause of my derangement; some thought it was brought on
                  through the excitement of travelling; and others that it was caused by illness;
                  but few knew the true reason; and these few became acquainted with it by being
                  admitted to my presence to assist in taking care of me, at which times they would
                  hear me talking in my delirium of my dear Julia, thus: 'She is dressed in pure
                  white like an angel, and has such a bright, sunny ny countenance that none can
                  look at her without being dazzled, therefore you must all put on glasses if you
                  would see her.'
               "At other times, when I wanted to escape, that I might go to Julia, I would
                  exclaim, 'there is no use in trying to confine me—if I were to exert my strength I
                  would be more powerful than even Samson. If this little world of yours was a ball
                  of solid iron, and I was placed il the centre of it, I would burst it into ten
                  thousand fragments to fly to my Julia; or if this ball of iron was wrought into a
                  great chain, and I fettered with it, I would break it asunder as easily as Samson
                  broke the cords that bound him when told that the Philistines were upon. Such is
                  my strength; but if Julia wished, she could bind me with a single hair of her
                  head; for love is the secret of her power.'
               "The only way my attendants could force me to eat, or to take any kind of
                  refreshment, was by bringing it to me in a white vessel, and telling
                  me it was prepared and sent by Julia; white being my favorite color, because in my
                  imagination she was always dressed in it. If they unthinkingly told me that it was
                  not sent by her, I would dash it on the floor or in their faces.
               "Many of my dearest friends and relatives visited me during the time I remained at
                  home, most of whom were affected to
                  tears when they beheld me in this deplorable condition. Great sympathy was
                  manifested towards me by my acquaintances, and prayer was offered for my
                  restoration in some of the churches.
               "My true friend Stanley, (the good Samaritan,) Heaven's blessings be ever upon
                  him! was obliged to start immediately for New-York, as the steamer was to leave
                  for England in a few days. On taking his departure, the day after my arrival
                  at-home, my father pressed upon him, and obliged him to take, against his
                  inclination, a heavy purse of gold. Although constrained to accept it as well as
                  several presents from my friends, he contended that he had done nothing more than
                  his duty in protecting and assisting a fellow being when in sickness and
                  distress.
               "Several physicians were brought in to see me, and all agreed in advising my
                  friends to take me to the Insane Asylum at Columbia, South Carolina, which, under
                  their directions, was attended to.
               "I arrived at the Asylum in the night, very weak, and so much exhausted that it
                  was with difficulty I could walk or even stand, as I had slept and ate very little
                  since I was first attacked. Soon after my arrival, Dr. Thomson, physician of the
                  establishment, came to examine my case, and made several inquiries of my friends
                  concerning me. After giving me some medicine, I was locked up in a room for the
                  night.
               "The next morning I was let out in the hall among the other patients, and
                  immediately began to imagine myself in the mansion of Dr. Tennyson, at New-York. I
                  thought the persons around me were his servants, and ordered them about as such. I
                  demanded of them why the doctor and Julia did not make their appearance, as I had
                  sent up my card. En passant, I would remark
                  that, I verily believe, had Julia really presented herself before me at this
                  juncture, it would have been the means of my immediate restoration. However, the
                  officers of the Institution encouraged these fancies, talking of the Doctor and
                  enlarging upon the beauty and accomplishments of the lady, until I grew very much
                  pleased with them, and became quite docile.
               "As I frequently heard music in some of the rooms, I concluded it was Julia's
                  piano, and wondered why she used me so cruelly; not deigning to make her
                  appearance.
               "Thus passed several days. At length I began to improve both in body and mind, and
                  was taken out daily by an attendant to promenade in the beautiful garden attached
                  to the Asylum. I was always fond of flowers, and while there their presence had a
                  great influence upon me. It was early spring; and the first timid blossoms were
                  opening to the sun. While wandering around the alleys and flower beds of this favorite resort, a gentle yet
                  sweet melancholy would pervade my whole being, and I would experience a strange
                  sort of happiness that seemed almost unearthly.
               "The greatest trouble my attendants had with me was to make me take my medicine,
                  which was always excessively nauseous. If I could, I would always dash the vessel
                  containing it to the floor, breaking it in a thousand pieces. I shall never forget
                  one time when I threw the bowl containing some bitter ingredient into the face of
                  one of the assistants. Immediately three strong rough men seized me, and throwing
                  me on the floor, forced open my teeth, and poured the medicine down my throat so
                  fast as nearly to strangle me. This was the hardest treatment I received while
                  there; and I have always thought that the kind superintendent was not aware of
                  this circumstance, as my brutal attendants would have been severely rebuked.
               "There is great room for improvement in regard to the character and qualifications
                  of attendants in insane asylums, for in managing a maniac, talents of the same
                  kind are required as in the moral training and education of children, or, as
                  evinced by the kind and sympathysing physician: but, instead of possessing these
                  qualifications, those men are often rough, uneducated, unfeeling wretches, who are
                  not fit to take care of a horse, much less a human being, whose mind is diseased,
                  and who consequently requires the most gentle and considerate treatment.
               "But to return to my own case. After getting good deal better, the Doctor told me
                  where I was, and the reason of my being brought there. This was the first time I
                  had been told that I was insane, which I think should have been made known to me
                  long before, for such persons are generally the last to believe themselves
                  deranged.
               "After being made aware of my infirmity, I took my medicine and baths without much
                  trouble, although the latter were pretty hard to bear, being nearly scalding,
                  while at the same time very cold water was poured upon my head.
               "As I became more improved, I was sent out in a carriage with other patients,
                  accompanied by an attendant, to see the public buildings and grounds about
                  Columbia, such as the State House, the College, the cotton factories on the
                  Congarie River, &c. I was soon taken to better apartments, where I had the
                  liberty of occupying a handsome parlor, containing a piano and other musical
                  instruments, together with a number of books and papers for the use of the
                  patients. I also went to the public table, as heretofore my allowance had always
                  been sent to me. I often attended concerts, and lectures on astronomy and other sciences, given by
                  distinguished professors, in that portion of the building set apart for that
                  purpose. The concerts were attended by the improved of both sexes, and they seemed
                  to enjoy them extremely. I think these amusements were very beneficial to the
                  patients.
               "About six weeks after I had been admitted to the Asylum, I was pronounced
                  perfectly cured, and consequently discharged by the kind Dr. Thomson, who was
                  admirably suited to his profession as superintendant, by his urbanity, kindness of
                  disposition, and benevolence of heart.
               "You may ask whether I suffered much pain, or what was the state of my feelings
                  during my derangement: I can unhesitatingly reply, that with the exception of the
                  rough treatment I received from the ignorant and unfeeling attendants, the few
                  weeks that my reason was dethroned, were to me the happiest of my existence, as I
                  was in extacies most of the time, living in a world of my own creation, a world
                  more bright and beautiful than Arcadian bowers or Elysian fields, having for bosom
                  companions bright fancies and wild imaginations."

                           "And stars shall wane o'er the mirthful part."

               Being apprised by Dr. Thomson of his son's recovery, Col. Buckingham immediately
                  started for Columbia to bring him home. Their meeting was an affecting one, for
                  the grief his father had felt for the unhappy derangement of Eugene was now turned
                  to joy at having him again restored to the bosom of his family.
               They left Columbia in the morning, by railroad, and arrived that evening at
                  Charleston. When they reached Buckingham Hall, they found the slaves, young and
                  old, assembled to welcome their "dear young massa" home. Eugene's heart was so
                  full that tears sprung into his eyes as he beheld their honest joyous faces turned
                  towards him. He shook hands with them all
                  around, while they shouted in unison "God bless young massa Eugene!" The young man
                  was soon obliged to make his escape into the house, for his feelings overcame him.
                  His heart too longed to meet his sister; and as he entered the hall she sprang
                  towards him and fell weeping upon his neck. For several moments neither spoke; and
                  at length Cora exclaimed, "Dear Eugene, how well you look! Thank God! you are home
                  again. But, come in to the dining room, supper is waiting. Come dear father." And
                  they followed her. That evening, to our hero, would have been the happiest of his
                  life, had he then been blest with the presence of his fondly loved Julia; but her
                  name was not mentioned in their conversation;. and when all had retired to rest
                  Eugene lay long awake thinking of her, and mentally praying that the great
                  presentiment of his life might one day be accomplished.
               The next morning Col. Buckingham, in the fulness of his heart, ordered that there
                  should be a holiday given to the slaves, that they might have a general rejoicing
                  on account of Eugene's happy recovery and restoration to his paternal abode.
               "For," said he to his principal overseer, Jerry, in whom he placed great
                  confidence, "Eugene is, in some respects, like the Prodigal Son mentioned in
                  Scripture, 'He was dead and is alive again, he was

                   lost and' is found.' So, 'bring hither the fatted calf and kill it, and
                  let us eat and be merry.'"
               "Yes, sah!" cried Jerry, with a grin of delight, "all dat an' more sal be done
                  dy—recily."
               So away went Jerry to communicate the news of a holiday and festival in honor of
                  their beloved "massa Eugene's" return.
               Shortly, loud shouts of merriment echoed through the little hamlet of the slaves,
                  and as the hours passed away all were dressed in their gayest and their best,
                  dancing, singing and chattering in every part of the shady lawn.
               Col. Buckingham, with his son and daughter, came forth to see the amusements of
                  the slaves; and the better to view them, they ascended a staircase around a large
                  sycamore tree, which staircase terminated in a platform large enough to contain a
                  dozen persons. While they remained seated here, overshadowed by the large thick
                  leaves above and around them, the colored folks below kept up their glee without
                  cessation.
               There were several of the slaves who were tolerable musicians, and these having
                  formed a band, played occasionally in the summer evenings in the lawn before the
                  hall, for the amusement of the family. These were now ranged apart from the rest,
                  near a sparkling fountain between the sycamore and the mansion, and even to the refined ears of the
                  Colonel and his children, "discoursed most elegant music." The leader of the band
                  was Jerry, who sat on top of a hogshead with his legs hanging over the side, doing
                  great execution with his "fiddle and his bow." The others performed on banjoes,
                  bones and other instruments, and were seated around their leader, some on the
                  ground and some on rude benches brought from the cabins.
               The residue of the slaves were either lolling on the grass, or sitting, beneath
                  the trees, or leaning against the trunks of them, or dancing merrily on the soft,
                  green turf; while others were partaking of the "fatted calf" and drinking
                  something that they thought better than water.
               So the day passed in merriment and pleasure, and as the sun began to hide himself
                  behind the clustering trees, the slaves gradually ceased their amusements and
                  commenced clearing the "camp furniture" from the scene of action. Before dark all
                  were again gathered into their cabins, and the Colonel and his family having
                  returned to the Hall, peace and quietness reigned over the scene.
               The next day Col. Buckingham, while conversing with his son, introduced the
                  subject of his passion for Julia. "Eugene," said he, "do you still entertain for
                  Miss Tennyson the regard you once had?"
               The young man seemed startled, and his countenance glowed as he replied, "I shall
                  love her always, sir."
               "My son," then resumed his father, "I feel that I have been to blame in
                  endeavoring to force your inclinations—I feel that I have been partly the cause of
                  your misfortune, and I would fain atone for it. I will not refuse my consent any
                  longer, if you wish to marry her."
               Eugene's delight sprang to his eyes and irradiated his whole countenance. He took
                  his father's hand and raised it to his lips. "Thanks, dear father. I have only to
                  gain the consent of Dr. Tennyson."
               "What! has he withheld his consent?" exclaimed the Colonel, somewhat surprised. "I
                  thought I was the only bar to your union."
               "No sir: Dr. Tennyson, unfortunately, is as much prejudiced against the South and
                  its institutions, as you have been against the North. To convince you of this I
                  will show you his letters to me on the subject."
               There was a pause of a few minutes, when Eugene suddenly exclaimed, "Miserable,
                  that I am! what avails your consent, my father? Think you Julia would wed a man who has been the inmate of a
                     madhouse?" And the bright look faded from his countenance, and a
                  shade of despair occupied its place.
               "Hush! my son; these are strong words. Calm yourself. If Julia is a sensible woman
                  and really loves you, your derangement will have no weight with her.
                  She will consider that it was a dispensation of Providence, and will feel that
                  your sufferings have endeared you to her all the more. Write to her; for she knows
                  all that has befallen you from her cousin, to whom Cora and myself have several
                  times written; write to her, and you will find my words to be correct."
               Eugene took his father's advice, and that very evening wrote a long letter to Miss
                  Tennyson, detailing his unfortunate derangement, and concluded thus:
               "If you think that this misfortune is a sufficient cause for breaking the
                  engagement we entered into before I left you, you are at liberty to act your
                  pleasure in regard to it. Although my regard for you is deeper than words can
                  express, I would not wish to make your future life unhappy with regrets at
                  marrying a man who had been the inmate of a lunatic asylum. Pardon me if I speak
                  too plainly—
               "But, if you have the same affection for me that you once had, and your father
                  does not oppose you, will you accept one who cannot be happy without you? If I
                  have been insane, it has been altogether on your account—and I entreat you to
                  consider this before you decide."
               Julia was much affected when she read his letter, and immediately laid it before
                  her father. He appeared at the time to take little notice of it; but, as weeks
                  flew by, and his daughter's lovely cheek grew paler and paler, like 
                     "The last rose of summer, left drooping alone,"
                   he could not avoid seeing that her health was rapidly declining, and at last
                  he relented. Calling her to him one day he told her, as she stood before him
                  trembling with apprehension of some stern mandate, that if she was so much
                  attached to Eugene, as not to be happy without him, he would withdraw his former
                  prohibition, and that the nuptials should be solemnized whenever the lovers
                  thought proper.
               Joyfully and gladly did Julia hasten to write to the man of her heart, assuring
                  him of her father's consent, and telling him that she never harbored such a
                  selfish idea as that of breaking her engagement on account of his unfortunate
                  aberration of mind.
               
               At the same time Eugene received Julia's letter, his sister got one from Melville,
                  in which he entreated of her, now that her brother was again with his family, that
                  she would no longer delay the day of their union. After consulting with her father
                  and Eugene, she replied to her lover, appointing a day in the month of April,
                  which by this time was not far distant. She also requested of Arlington, at her
                  brother's wish, to persuade the Doctor to accompany him South with his daughter,
                  for nothing would delight her more than to have Julia for her bridesmaid. Eugene,
                  too, wrote again to his beloved, requesting the same favor, and beseeching her to
                  name an early day for their nuptials. In a short time two answers were received,
                  with the tidings that they would all soon be on their way South, Julia telling her
                  lover that she would not appoint their marriage day until after Cora's wedding.
                  With this he was obliged to remain content.
               Eugene now thought himself the happiest mortal upon earth. His long treasured
                  wish, his great presentiment was about to be realized. He was soon to
                  be possessed of a beautiful, talented, and accomplished woman, a model for her
                  sex, and the sole empress of his affections, upon whose throne was placed the
                  thoughts and aspirations of years.
               Cora too had lost some of her former indolence, and was vastly improved in
                  consequence. She was engaged with her dress-makers and milliners, preparing her
                  trousseau for the bridal day. The Colonel himself was happy in the happiness of
                  his children, and now there seemed nothing wanting to constitute earthly
                  felicity.
               Before proceeding any further on this subject, we have to inform the reader that
                  Miss Susanna Jones, after the rebuff she had met with from Eugene, never visited
                  the Hall, although her father and the elder Buckingham still remained friends.
                  Cora called on her two or three times, at the request of her father, but there was
                  only cold civility exchanged between them. Susanna still rode, raced and hunted
                  with the young men who visited her father's mansion, but never could get any
                  farther than a flirtation with any of them. She was destined to remain in a state
                  of single blessedness, for her unladylike and disagreeable qualities rendering her
                  unloved, unrespected, and unapproached.
               The contention between the Northern and Southern families, like the strife between
                  the Montagues and Capulets, was now at an end. Their misunderstandings were all
                  brought to a close, without any of the melancholy events attending the loves of
                  Romeo and Juliet; and the arrival of the expected guests was daily looked for by the anxious hearts in
                  Buckingham Hall.
               At last they came. The meeting of lovers is well understood—I need not describe
                  it. Col. Buckingham received his visitors with the most gentlemanly politeness,
                  and was as much pleased with the Doctor as he was charmed with his lovely
                  daughter.
               That evening the young people strolled out through the garden and shady lawn,
                  leaving the elderly gentlemen to discuss their wine, and smoke their segars on the
                  veranda.
               The four remained together for a short time, but after a while, as the round moon
                  rose from the tops of the forest trees, and silvered the dew-moistened landscape,
                  Eugene passed with his mistress before a glancing fountain, while the others
                  strolled slowly on. And then the young man, with his sweet Julia leaning upon his
                  arm, lingered to breathe into her ear the heart-felt happiness of his being.
               "I could not have lived had you refused me, dearest: yet after my unfortunate
                  derangement I feared——"
               "Eugene! Did you really believe for a moment that your illness would have any
                  weight with me? I look upon what you have undergone as I would upon any other
                  disease. We are not to murmur at the dispensations of Providence. No, Eugene; I
                  feel that I love you better now, for I know that you have suffered for
                     me."
               As she spoke she raised her soft, bright eyes to his, with a look of the most
                  trusting affection. He took her delicate hand and raised it to his lips.
               "Bless you, my own! Dear Julia, forgive me that I have doubted you."
               There was a silence of some moments, and then Eugene said softly, "Do you
                  remember, Julia, that you promised when we met to name the day of our
                  nuptials?"
               "Not till after Cora's wedding, I said," she replied.
               "My sister will be married in a few days—why then delay? Why should you keep me in
                  suspense? Let me have an epoch to hang my hopes upon."
               "Well, to gratify you," replied the lady slowly, "I will name—let me see—yes, the
                  fifth of May, which is my birth day."
               Eugene now folded his arms around her and pressed his first kiss upon
                  her unresisting lips. They then wandered on among the fragrant flowers, the
                  scented shrubbery and the tall, shady trees, until they were summoned from their
                  world of romance to the dull realities of the tea table, where Cora and Melville
                  had arrived before them.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XI.
               
                  
                     
                        "If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been
                           churches and poor men's cottages, princes palaces."
                     
                     —Shakspeare.
                  
               
               After tea the young people gathered around the centre table, while the Colonel and
                  Doctor Tennyson sat apart conversing on different subjects. The evening passed
                  very agreeably to all, especially when the two elderly gentlemen joined in the
                  youthful circle and enlivened it with their pleasant jokes.
               Col. Buckingham was charmed with the beauty and accomplishments of our heroine,
                  and did not at all wonder that Eugene should have been so enslaved by her. He
                  asked her to play and sing, which, as the others joined in the request, she
                  immediately rose to do. Eugene sprang to escort her to the piano, when his father
                  pushing him aside, said gaily, "Out of the way, sir! Do you think I
                  have no claim to this lady? Do you want to monopolize her entirely?" And gallantly
                  offering his arm, he bore off Julia in triumph. They all laughed, of course, and
                  Julia, being seated at the piano, commenced playing. She was a fine performer, and
                  so gratified her hearers that even the slaves assembled outside on the veranda to
                  hear the music, for the negroes are always delighted with the sounds of
                  harmony.
               Julia had sung two or three fashionable songs, when the Colonel begged her to sing
                  something of her own composing, "For," said he, "I am aware that you are a
                  poetess."
               A slight blush clouded her cheek, and hesitating a moment, she unaffectedly
                  complied.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           SONG.
                           
                              I cannot prize the heart that burns
                              For ev'ry form of grace,
                              I cannot love the eye that turns,
                              To ev'ry fair young face.
                              The smile that to the lip doth start,
                              For all, is dear no more;
                              O, give me a devoted heart,
                              That never loved before!
                           
                           
                              When this is found, then I can love
                              With fervor, pure, intense;
                              A love that would unchanging prove,
                              All truth—all innocence.
                              Yet I'll repel young Cupid's dart,
                              And banish him my door,
                              Until I find a faithful heart
                              That never loved before.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
               Eugene stood by the side of his betrothed, and whispered softly, "You have found
                  that 'faithful heart' at last, that heart 'that never loved before,' have you not
                  dear Julia?"
               She smiled, blushed and whispered something in return which was not heard by the
                  others.
               By request of the Colonel Julia played and sung several other original pieces, all
                  of which gave the old gentleman infinite pleasure.
               But the slaves who were assembled on the veranda, now and then taking the liberty
                  of peering from behind the window curtains into the parlor, were scarcely more
                  delighted with the music than they were impressed by the beauty and elegance of
                  the Northern lady.
               Dr. Tennyson was seated on a lounge near one of the windows, and overheard with
                  much amusement the remarks of the sable auditors.
               "Oh!" exclaimed Sam, the coachman, "dat ar song am beautiful, deelightful!"
               "She sing like a nighturngale," said Judith, the cook, "me no wonder massa Eugene
                  fall in lub wid her."
               "He neber could help it," rejoined Drusilla, the old housekeeper, "caze why, she'd
                  sing right trough his heart. 'Pears like massa Buckingham tink so now—look dah! he
                  sits so close to her an' he look at her all de time. I'se 'feared dat he fall in
                  lub wid her his own seff."
               The Doctor now beckoned to Melville, who was sitting near the piano with Cora. As
                  he came, the old gentleman pointed over his shoulder towards the window without
                  speaking. Melville smiled and sat down beside him.
               After a pause Drusilla observed, "what dat massa Eugene say about missy Julia long
                  'go? Some po'try—lem me tink. 
                     
                        'De beauty ob her brow might put out de stars,
                        "An' make de candles burn de brighter.'"
                     
                  
               
               "O sho!" exclaimed Sam, "you talk po'try, haw I haw! dat make me
                  laugh."
               "Why you laugh? What fur, I say? You knows nottin'—you big ig'ramus."
               "Knows more dan you, fur all dat."
               "You go long! Tell me dis den—why ole massa wanter perwent massa Eugene fur to hab
                  dis hansum missy Julia? Why he do dat, an' be de cause ob his drefful c'lamity.
                  Kin you 'lacidate dat ar' question?"
               "You doesn't know it you seff," replied Sam doggedly.
               "Doesn't I!" exclaimed Drusilla. "'Pears like I doesn't. How you 'spects I kin
                  live in dis yere house allers, an' not know de principal 'vents of de fam'ly? Lar sakes! does you tink I's
                  deaf an' blind?"
               "Tell us den—we like to know."
               "Find out fur yourseff den. I shan't condersend fur to hexpose de secrets ob
                     dis fam'ly to nobody."
               "Will you hush!" said Judith, "how kin we hear missy Julia play, an' you 's makin'
                  sich a clatter?"
               "Sho' nough!" rejoined Drusilla, "if nobody listens, she'll be 'wastin' her
                  sweetness on de darkey's ear."
               On this, the two gentlemen laughed outright, which caused the slaves to make their
                  exit to the lower regions in double quick time.
               This little by play being related by the Doctor to the others, caused a
                  considerable degree of merriment.
               
               In the morning, after breakfast, the Colonel offered to show his guest over the
                  mansion and plantation, which offer being much relished by the Doctor, they
                  proceeded first to the observatory, where the latter was much pleased with a fine
                  view of the surrounding country and the bay of Charleston. After glancing at the
                  Colonel's library, which, as I said before, was fitted up in this place, the
                  Doctor and his friend descended to some of the other apartments, which were used
                  as bed-chambers. They were elegantly finished, and furnished with every comfort
                  and luxury, and appeared to be kept in the most perfect order. They then proceeded
                  to the parlors, and withdrawing-rooms on the first floor. These bore the same
                  evidence of taste and elegance—turkey carpets covered the floors, rich damask
                  curtains shaded the windows, and beautiful velvet covered chairs, sofas and
                  ottomans were tastefully arranged through the rooms. The doors were mahogany, with
                  silver hinges and handles, and marble mantles, supported by graceful statues, were
                  surmounted by the rarest of Italian vases and other ornaments of agate and
                  alabaster. One room, especially, the great parlor, as it was called, was
                  ornamented by richly carved and gilded window frames, walls and ceilings painted
                  in fresco; and the furniture was in keeping with the rest.
               The porticos or verandas were spacious and airy, well calculated for promenading
                  or lounging in 
                     pleasent
                     pleasant
                   weather.
               Lastly, the gentlemen descended into the basement, where, without elegance there
                  was neatness and comfort. Everything bore a pleasing and cheerful aspect, even the
                  countenances of the slaves, who were busily employed in divers ways, seemed to
                     indicate dicate perfect contentment.
                  These last, at the entrance of their master and his guest bowed and courtesied
                  respectfully; and two or three little woolly heads creeping up to the Colonel,
                  caught hold of the skirt of his coat, singing out, "Me berry good boy, massa; gim
                  me penny."
               "You see," said Buckingham, throwing some coppers among them, "how I spoil these
                  creatures."
               "Aye," replied the other, "but all masters are not like you."
               "Granted," said the Colonel, as they stepped from the back door into the garden,
                  and proceeded slowly down a gravel walk towards Cora's favorite retreat, the arbor
                  before mentioned, "granted, but I foresee that you will one day admit, in spite of
                  prejudices, that there really are no such barbarians among us as you have always
                  believed there were."
               "Perhaps I may, but I do not feel inclined to do so just at present."
               After remaining a short time in the arbor, they took their way from the garden
                  into the lawn, visited a sparkling fountain, where gold and silver fish abounded,
                  and then mounted a spiral staircase, around a large sycamore tree, which
                  terminated in a platform eight or ten feet square. This was one of the original
                  ideas of the Colonel, and the Doctor thought it a very novel one.
               They proceeded, onward, conversing the while, until they reached the principal
                  gate at the main entrance, where stood the porter's lodges, a couple of small
                  handsome buildings occupied by one of the Colonels overseers and his family. Here
                  they paused awhile, and then went, by a circuitous path, to the rear of the lawn,
                  beyond the flower garden, where stood the cabins of the slaves. As these were
                  pretty much the same as most of the slave-cabins in the South, I need not pause to
                  describe them. There were only a few old women and some small children about them,
                  as the rest were at work in the fields, whither the gentlemen now proceeded.
               As they strolled about, looking at the slaves, who were diligently at work, the
                  Colonel pointed out one in particular, who although he took part in the labor
                  seemed to act as an overseer. He was a strong, large man, and apparently the most
                  active among them.
               "That," said Buckingham, "is one of my best men; but when I bought him of my
                  neighbor Harding, whose house you can see through those beech trees yonder, he was
                  the most lazy worthless fellow you can conceive of. His master was always a cruel
                  man—and notwithstanding poor Jerry was severely whipped almost every day, he did
                  not alter in the least.
               
               "Knowing of his ill treatment, and believing that he could be reclaimed by gentle
                  management, I offered to buy him, out of pity. Harding readily agreed to it and I
                  brought him home. Jerry behaved just the same for a while, but I said nothing.
               "One day in very hot weather I went out in the field and found him asleep, lying
                  with his face to the sun. I took out my handkerchief and laid it over his ebony
                  features. When he awoke and found what I had done. I was told that he was very
                  much ashamed and mortified, saying, 'Massa was too good to such a wicked nigger.'
                  From this there was a decided improvement in him—and he would work with diligence
                  for a few days, until his old habits of laziness would come on, when he would
                  feign sickness. I would then bathe his head with my own hands, and order two other
                  slaves to sit and fan him. He became so much ashamed at last, knowing that he was
                  so unworthy of such kind treatment, that he suddenly left off all his old tricks,
                  and became one of my trustiest and best workmen. So much for the effects of gentle
                  usage."
               While this incident was being related the gentlemen had retraced their steps to
                  the mansion. The young people were sitting in the veranda engaged in lively
                  conversation; and joining them, Buckingham and his guest assisted to pass away the
                  time until dinner.
               Towards evening, Eugene and Melville proposed a ride on horseback to the ladies,
                  which was gleefully accepted by them, on condition that the old gentlemen should
                  accompany them. This was not declined, so they started, a gay cavalcade.
               On their way they passed the mansion and grounds of Harding. "There," said
                  Buckingham to his friend, "is the residence of Jerry's former master. He is a
                  hard, cruel man, but strange to say, he is a Northerner, from the state of Ohio,
                  and once was a strong abolitionist."
               "A planter from the North!" ejaculated the Doctor, "how can that be?"
               "The fact is," replied the Colonel, "the plantation was left to him by a relative
                  of his wife, who is from the same state with her husband; but failing to dispose
                  of it to advantage, as he had desired to do, he at last concluded to come and live
                  on it himself in spite of his prejudices. He has been here nine years, and appears
                  to enjoy his capacity of tyrant, for he abuses his slaves worse than any
                  Southerner I ever heard of. Certainly he was not cruel at first, but being
                  naturally despotic, he loved to exercise power where he found it easy to do so,
                  and therefore it grew on him by degrees till he became what he now is.
               
               "For some time his brother, who still resides in Ohio, corresponded with and
                  visited him occasionally; but becoming disgusted with him as a slave-holder, broke
                  off all communication with Harding and his family, the Northern brother being an
                  abolitionist.
               "This man works his slaves harder than any other planter in the neighborhood, and
                  expects them to do as much in a day as white men; and because they do not he beats
                  and half starves them. His wife, too, is as barbarous as her husband; she is much
                  younger than he, and very gay, goes out a great deal, and often rides on
                  horseback. She owns a beautiful black horse, and is so particular about his
                  keeping, that when he is brought out for her to ride, she always takes a white 
                     hankerchief
                     handkerchief
                   and rubs it over the horse, and if it is the least soiled or dusty, she
                  immediately orders her groom to be whipped.
               "Thus, you see that the Northerners make the hardest masters and mistresses. And
                  that is the reason I have never employed a Northerner as an overseer."
               "Well, but this case is one in a thousand," rejoined Tennyson, "Northerners never
                  come South to become planters; and this man is, according to your own statement,
                  naturally tyrannical."
               "I admit that: but I want to show you how mistaken taken you are in believing that
                  we Southerners are the only tyrannical masters in the Union."
               "From what I have seen so far," replied the Doctor, "I find that good masters do
                  exist here. But all are not so."
               "I do not pretend to say they are. I could point out to you many who are hard and
                  cruel; but as a general thing, the slaves have reason to be, and are, contented
                  with their condition. But you must see something more of our institutions before I
                  ask you to alter your opinion of us."
               As they rode on they came in sight of a fine mansion belonging to a gentleman of
                  the name of Hamilton, and the Colonel observed, "There sir resides a man who
                  represents a large share of our Southerners in his openheartedness and
                  hospitality."
               "I have always understood that the Southerners were noted for these qualities,"
                  said Tennyson.
               "They are so, and justly," replied Buckingham. "This gentleman is hardly ever
                  without guests, and thinks nothing of inviting perfect strangers, and entertaining
                  them for weeks at his house, placing horses and carriages at their disposal. Thus
                  you see there is much truth in the adage that 'warm climates produce warm
                  hearts.'"
               In the course of their conversation these gentlemen had lingered behind their
                  companions, but now, as they were
                  called by the young ladies, they hastened to join them, and the equestrians rode
                  on until the shades of evening darkened the landscape, when they returned to
                  Buckingham Hall.
               
                  
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               
                  
                     
                        "To a far land he came, yet round him clung
                        "The spirit of his own."
                     
                  
               
               The next morning Col. Buckingham ordered the carriage to convey himself and Dr.
                  Tennyson to Charleston, to witness a slave auction that was advertised for that
                  day. They arrived thither a few minutes before ten o'clock, which was the hour
                  specified for the sale, and found many persons sauntering about and making
                  observations on the slaves who were assembled in the slave-market, at the
                  Exchange. This lot had been brought from Virginia.
               The hour arrived, and the auctioneer mounting the platform prepared to commence
                  business. The first called to the stand was a boy about nineteen, named Jim. After
                  enumerating his good qualities, the man of the hammer commenced crying him off.
                  The bidding was spirited, as he was a stout, likely boy, and he was soon knocked
                  down to a planter from Georgia for a field hand, at $550.
               
               The next offered was a large muscular middle aged man, who was immediately bid off
                  at $935, for a sugar plantation in Louisiana; and his sister Hannah, a good
                  looking girl, then mounted the stand with a gay air, laughing and talking with the
                  bystanders. She was gaudily-dressed, and wore, coquettishly, a scarlet turban on
                  her head. She appeared to relish being sold, as she had a hard master, and
                  expected to be bought by a good one in Charleston. When asked what she could do,
                  she replied that she could "Wash and iron a shirt fit for de President; an' as for
                  doin' up chicken fixin's an' oder kinds ob cookin' an' 'fectionaries, she defied
                  any gal in de Carolinas to beat her." A gentleman of Charleston bought her for
                  $625.
               An elderly woman named Maria was then called up. She came forward slowly, and was
                  very critically examined by the spectators. Some asked her if she was sickly, and
                  she replied in the affirmative, when the auctioneer interfered, saying that it was
                  all "D——d nonsense, she was well enough, and only wanted to get clear of being
                  sold for a field hand; but that she was good at housework also." And then he
                  continued, "If she gets lazy give a touch or two with the whip, and I'll engage
                  she'll do your work." He then began some indecent jokes concerning her appearance,
                  observing that whoever bought her, would have an increase of stock before
                  long.
               Col. Buckingham, out of pity for her forlorn condition, made a bid for her, and
                  she was knocked down to him for $365.
               Dr. Tennyson now intimated that he was weary of this scene, so they left and went
                  to the Jail to see a lot of rice field negroes, placed there for sale. These
                  presented a motley appearance, from the sucking child to the gray haired sire.
                  Most of them were assembled in the jail-yard engaged in different ways. Some of
                  the women were cooking meat and other things, in little pots hung over a fire
                  built on the ground, which as soon as cooked were handed out by the females to the
                  crowd around them, who took them as they were given, with their fingers, and ate
                  with apparent satisfaction.
               The Doctor thought it strange their victuals were not cooked and distributed by
                  the keepers, but one of them said that they, the slaves, preferred cooking for
                  themselves.
               In another part of the yard, in a building for the purpose, was placed a
                  tread-mill whereon several negroes were engaged grinding out corn for their own
                  consumption. Most of them looked cheerful and contented, but a few seemed sad and
                  dejected enough, as they trod their weary round.
               At length the Doctor wished to return, and the carriage being in waiting, the gentlemen entered
                  it, and arrived at the Hall just at dinner time.
               
               Three or four days passed quickly away. In the mean time the preparations for
                  Cora's wedding were almost completed, and it only wanted a couple of days to the
                  appointed time. The young people were enjoying themselves extremely, rambling
                  about the country and riding and visiting to and from Charleston.
               One day there were several ladies and gentlemen from that city spending the day at
                  Buckingham Hall, among whom was a gentleman from New Orleans, who had just come to
                  Charleston from Boston where he had been for some time. He was a jovial,
                  communicative person, and an acute observer of "human events." Buckingham had
                  always held him in high esteem.
               These gentlemen, with Dr. Tennyson and some others, sat sipping their wine after
                  dinner, the ladies having retired to the parlor.
               The conversation had been turned by a remark of the Doctor's, upon his favorite
                  topic, the slavery question.
               "By-the-by," cried Bradford: the gentleman just introduced, "have you read the new
                  work by Mrs. Stowe, Uncle Tom's Cabin?"
               Dr. Tennyson replied in the affirmative, and so also did the Colonel.
               "Well Doctor, what do you think of it?" asked Bradford, turning towards him as he
                  laid down his glass.
               "I think," replied Tennyson, slowly, "that Mrs. Stowe evinces great knowledge of
                  human nature. Her book is an excellent one; it shows up the cruelty and
                  hard-heartedness of slave-holders in a style worthy of imitation. There is an
                  apparent truthfulness in her whole book that makes it doubly interesting."
               "I can't agree with you at all!" broke in Col. Buckingham, "she is a talented
                  woman, I confess, and writes well, but some of her stories are too highly colored
                  and much exaggerated. For instance, the escape of Eliza, the quadroon, would have
                  been very well if we could believe that she leaped ten feet across
                  the current in the Ohio river, and scampered over the broken ice like a cat, and
                  all the while with a child in her arms."
               "Such a thing might have been possible," said Doctor Tennyson. "It
                  seems to me that I have heard of such a circumstance before."
               "But, I must say," he continued, "that there is one thing I don't exactly admire;—little Eva is a
                  sweet, angelic creature, yet she is made by the authoress, the companion of a
                  slave, sitting in his lap and embracing him, as if he were a brother.
                  Colonel, did you ever permit your daughter such intimacy with your
                  negroes?"
               Melville started and looked much concerned at the idea, fixing an uneasy gaze upon
                  Buckingham's face, as he replied, "I certainly did not, Doctor, nor
                  do I approve of intimacy such as that."
               Arlington drew a sigh of relief, and the Colonel added, "Kindness without
                  familiarity is sufficient to gain the love of these creatures. Mrs. Stowe has
                  exaggerated this somewhat."
               "Well," suggested Bradford, "the story of Legree is somewhat unnatural. A writer
                  that wishes to convince must not color too highly, or the object
                  aimed at will be overshot."
               "You are right, sir," said Buckingham. "We Planters well know that no such
                  monsters exist as that Legree. To be sure some of them are cruel in beating their
                  slaves——"
               "My good Colonel," interrupted Dr. Tennyson, "You contradict yourself. Was you not
                  telling me the other day of a barbarous Planter near by, a terrible tyrant, one of
                  whose slaves you bought and reclaimed?"
               "My dear Doctor, have you forgotten this man you speak of was a Northern
                     abolitionist, and none of our Southern men?"
               The old gentleman seemed rather taken down, and remained silent. Buckingham
                  continued, "As I said, although some of our Planters are hard masters, they do not
                  beat their slaves to death, or burn them alive, or
                     murder them, as Legree is represented to have done."
               "Such a man could not have lived in our State," said Bradford, "he would have been
                  lynched in no time."
               "I know of no instance where a Planter lives entirely isolated from his
                  neighbors," rejoined the Colonel; "I don't see how such a thing is possible, where
                  people are coming and going continually."
               "But this man lived in Louisiana," observed Tennyson, "in a part where the country
                  is not very thickly settled."
               "I have been in all parts of Louisiana," said Bradford, "and such barbarians as
                  Legree have I never seen; neither do I believe that they exist."
               "Gentlemen," said Buckingham, "allow your glasses to be filled. Doctor, if you
                  please, answer me one question—are you as much prejudiced against our institutions
                  now as you were before you came here?"
               Tennyson hesitated ere he replied, "I allow that my opinions are somewhat changed. From what I have
                  observed personally, I find they are better than I ever supposed them to be; but
                  sir, do not mistake me," added the Doctor, as he observed a smile of triumph on
                  the countenance of his host, "I am not in favor of slavery—I shall always believe
                  that the system is wrong in principle, and will ever remain opposed to it. But
                  that will not interfere with our personal friendship—we have each a right to our
                  different opinions."
               "So be it, then," replied Buckingham. "And now my friend," turning to Bradford,
                  "how did you like your Northern tour?"
               "Extremely," replied that gentleman, "but of that another time. I wish to relate a
                  little incident to Dr. Tennyson, of a Yankee abolitionist, which came to my
                  knowledge a short time since: that is, if he has no objection to hear it."
               "O, not at all," replied the Doctor, "proceed."
               "Mr. Doubleface was a strong abolitionists when at home in the land of steady
                  habits; or, to be more particular, the good city of Boston, where he carried on an
                  extensive mercantile business. I say he was an abolitionist at home, but chameleon
                  like, he could change his colors at pleasure. It so happened, in the course of his
                  mercantile operations, that Mr. Doubleface found it necessary to visit the South,
                  and particularly New Orleans; and when he had proceeded as far as Richmond he came
                  to the conclusion that, as the Scripture says, 'it is not good for man to be
                  alone;' though at the same time he had adopted that maxim years before, for he
                  left a wife and five children in Boston. Recollecting this circumstance, he merely
                  altered the text a little by saying, 'it was not good for man to
                     travel alone,' as he needed some one to take care of his linen,
                  &c. and be a companion to him in his lonely hours; therefore, being at a slave
                  sale in Richmond, he concluded to purchase a beautiful quadroon who charmed him
                  greatly by her liveliness, intelligence and wit. The bargain was made; but as he
                  respected appearances, and did not wish so delicate an affair to be
                  known, he provided the lady with elegant dresses and jewelry, and called her his
                  wife. Things went on very well for a while, as they proceeded to New Orleans; he,
                  however, contriving to keep the pretty Lucinda as much as possible from the sight
                  of his Southern acquaintances, lest they should discover the secret. Arriving at
                  the Crescent city, he put up at the St. Charles' Hotel, and S. S. Doubleface and
                  lady of Boston, was entered on the register.
               "While in New Orleans, this man wrote to his wife in Boston, telling her, among
                  other interesting news, that he had done a great deal of good among the slaves; that he had ameliorated the condition
                  of many, and was daily instilling moral precepts into the minds of
                  all with whom he had communication. He said his pity was excited by the bad usage
                  some of them received, and only wished he had the power to prevent the buying and
                  selling of human flesh and blood.
               "At the time of writing thus, he was representing to his friends in the South, and
                  particularly those with whom he was transacting business, that he was rather in
                  favor of slavery, and intimated that he might at some future time become a planter
                  himself.
               "But a gentleman of his acquaintance, having just arrived in New Orleans from the
                  'Athens of America,' put up at the same hotel, and was much surprised to see 'S.
                  S. Doubleface and lady' on the register, when he knew he had seen Mrs. Doubleface
                  in Boston the day before he left, and she had told him that her husband was then
                  in New Orleans, having just received a letter from him.
               "This gentleman was not long in discovering how matters stood; and disgusted with
                  the vile hypocrisy of Doubleface, threatened to expose him; whereupon the latter
                  suddenly left the city for the North, taking the slave with him.
               "They went up the Mississippi and Ohio, as far as Louisville Kentucky, where,
                  after growing tired of, and abusing his mistress worse than he would a dog, he
                  sold her in that city for half the sum he had given for her. This being the last
                  slave state on his way North, he could not have kept her longer, had he
                  wished."
               "I see," said Dr. Tennyson, laughing, "you are all bent upon making a convert of
                  me with your arguments and stories. One thing however I will admit: I shall not go
                  home as strong an abolitionist as I came hither."
               Well pleased at this concession, the Colonel arose from the table, saying, "I am
                  glad to hear you say that, my friend."
               "And furthermore, I would say that I have carried my prejudices too far in
                  opposing the union of our children," resumed Tennyson, "and have thus been partly
                  the cause of their unhappiness. Colonel, will you not make a like confession?"
               "I will—I do, with all my heart," replied Buckingham.
               "And now, let us join the ladies,—for I perceive some of our young gentlemen have
                  made their escape while we have been talking."
               They all accordingly repaired to the parlor.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIII.
               
                  
                     
                        "Bring flowers, bring flowers, for the bride to wear,
                        "They were born to blush in her shining hair."
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        "They are gone—they are fled—they are parted all;
                        "Alas! the forsaken Hall!"
                     
                  
               
               The morning that was to witness the bridal of Cora and Melville dawned clear and
                  lovely upon them. All preparations had been completed for their departure the next
                  day with Dr. Tennyson and his daughter for New-York, where the nuptials of the
                  latter were to be solemnized.
               At ten o'clock, A. M. a numerous assemblage of the elite of Charleston, together with many of the Colonel's friends
                  from neighboring States, were awaiting the advent of the bridal train in the great
                  parlor of Buckingham Hall.
               At last they entered—the bride looking as interesting as brides always do, arrayed
                  in a splendid white satin, embroidered with silver, and sparkling
                     p. 146.
                  
                   with diamonds—a veil of rich lace falling
                  gracefully from her head, fastened by a wreath of orange flowers.
               Julia, as bridesmaid, was more simply dressed, in white embroidered silk, pearl
                  bracelets on her arms, and a necklace of the same clasped around her graceful
                  neck. Her hair fell in natural ringlets around her head, which was encircled by a
                  wreath of white rosebuds.
               The eyes of all present expressed their undisguised admiration of the beautiful
                  bridesmaid, and many a manly bosom throbbed with envy against Eugene, who alone
                  would possess the brilliant prize.
               The reverend gentleman approached, and in a few minutes the ceremony was
                  concluded. The bride and groom then received the congratulations of the company,
                  after which all repaired to the dining-room, where an elegant entertainment graced
                  the "festive board."
               
               In the afternoon, through the kindness and indulgence of Col. Buckingham, the
                  slaves of the plantation were allowed a festival in honor of the wedding. Several
                  gentlemen in the neighborhood, as well as the guests then at the Hall, permitted
                  their slaves to join in the rejoicings.
               
               In the lawn, near the fountain before mentioned, was a long table well spread with
                  substantial eatables and drinkables, whereat were seated a large number of men,
                  women and children, all enjoying themselves to the utmost.
               The wedding guests who yet remained at the Hall, together with the bridal party,
                  descended into the lawn to witness the rejoicings. When they reached the fountain
                  the slaves all rose and saluted the bride and groom in their rude fashion, with
                  cheers and acclamations that were almost deafening.
               "Holla!" shouted Buckingham, "that will do. Don't frighten the ladies with your
                  roaring."
               They were immediately silent; and as the company walked away to another part of
                  the lawn, the negroes commenced tuning up their fiddles and banjoes, while the
                  women cleared away the remnants of the feast, preparatory to the dance on the
                  green sward.
               In half an hour's time a couple of hundred men and women, dressed in their best
                  attire, were capering and dancing to the music of the fiddles and banjoes beneath
                  the tall trees of the park, while others were lying about the grass in different
                  places, singing with good musical voices all sorts of lively tunes; some
                  improvising as they went along verses in honor of the bride and groom.
               The ladies and gentlemen walked among them much amused at their drollery, both in
                  dancing and singing. Dr. Tennyson, and Julia in particular, who were not
                  accustomed to such scenes, laughed heartily at their strange capers and queer
                  songs.
               Buckingham's principal man, Jerry, who was before mentioned, sat surrounded by a
                  circle of boys and girls, who took up the chorus of his impromptu singing, some of
                  which ran thus:
               
                  
                     O! missy Cora, she go way,
                     She got married dis ere day;
                     When she come back we nebber know,
                     Mighty sorry dat she go.
                     
                        Chorus: O, missy Cora, she go way.
                  
                  
                     Massa Eugene he go too,
                     Wid de gal he lub so true:
                     But he soon come back again,
                     Bring new missy wid him den.
                     
                        Chorus: O, massa Eugene, he go too.
                  
                  
                     Massa Melville nice young coon,
                     Gib ole nigger picayune;
                     Mighty sorry he can't stay,
                     Case he take young missy 'way.
                     
                        Chorus: O, massa Melville nice young coon.
                  
                  
                     Good ole Doctor from de Nort',
                     Treats a nigger as he ort;
                     Wants to make de darkies free,
                     Case he tinks dey orter be.
                     
                        Chorus: O, good ole Doctor from de Nort'.
                  
                  
                  
                     Darkies dey don't wan' be free,
                     Case dey happy as dey be:
                     Massa gibs 'em plenty meat—
                     Berry apt to fo'git de treat.
                     
                        Chorus: O, darkies dey don't wan' be free.
                  
               
               This song was laughed at and applauded by the auditors; and at length, the shadows
                  beginning to lengthen, the wedding guests returned to the mansion, and shortly
                  after departed for their homes.
               Blythe and happy, the slaves retired to their quarters, chattering together about
                  their pleasant holiday; and so closed around them the hours of the evening.
               
               Early the next morning the bridal party were prepared to start. They were to
                  remain in New-York until after Julia's marriage, and then start for a six months'
                  tour in Europe, during which time they were to visit the friends of Melville in
                  England. Col. Buckingham would accompany them as far as New-York to witness his
                  son's nuptials, and then return home. In the meantime the plantation would be left
                  in care of his trusty overseer, and the Hall under the surveillance of the old
                  housekeeper Drusilla, who for years had had the sole control and management of the
                  domestic concerns.
               As they were about to depart the slaves crowded around them expressing much sorrow
                  and regret. Rosa, in particular, the favorite young slave of Cora, wept
                  incessantly when she found she could not accompany her mistress, although told
                  that she would undoubtedly be abducted by the abolitionists if she took her to the
                  North, as others had been when taken thither by Southerners. So, although Cora
                  would have liked her attendance, poor little Rosa was obliged to remain in
                  expectation of her mistress' return.
               Bidding adieu to the Hall, the little party were driven to Charleston, and
                  embarking on board a steamer, were soon launched on their watery way. They had a
                  short and agreeable passage. When they arrived at the great metropolis, they
                  proceeded at once to Dr. Tennyson's mansion.
               
               The fifth of May at length arrived—and two happy hearts at least, welcomed the
                  eventful day. At nine o'clock, A. M. the wedding guests were assembled in Dr.
                  Tennyson's handsome parlors, awaiting the entrance of the bridal party. It was not
                  long before they made their appearance—and never did Julia look so beautiful. She
                  was attired in white crape covered with
                  lace trimming, plain yet elegant. A gauze veil floated from her head, and a single
                  rosebud decorated her hair. She looked lovely without any ornaments—and as the
                  manly bridegroom gazed on her as she stood by his side, he looked as if he thought 
                     "A seraph not more bright."
                  
               
               Her bridesmaid, a young and pretty girl; and a friend of Eugene's, who stood as
                  groomsman, were the only attendants. They were married by an Episcopal Clergyman;
                  and after the ceremony the dining room was thrown open, where a splendid and
                     recherche collation awaited the invited
                  guests.
