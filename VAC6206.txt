               CHAPTER I.
               THE SANDS.
               THE name of "The Sands" was given to a wide stretch of low beach of white sand, that was terminated on the south by a broad, shallow inlet, into which a noisy stream, leaping down from the neighboring hills, poured its clear, sparkling waters.
               On the north, looking from the high, bold cliff which rose, on three sides, well nigh perpendicularly from out the almost mountainous ridge of boulders which the ocean had piled up to mark the limit of its domain, the eye of the careless observer saw little but the horizon.
               The deep blue line was, however, broken at night by the red glare of a beacon light; and, very infrequently, when the sun's earliest beams shot out widely over the sea, it was fancied that the tall windows in the tower of St. Mary's, the sweet, silvery tones of whose bell sometimes fell on the listening ear, could be seen shining as the lamps burned low. One thought, who often turned her sad, wistful eyes towards the north, that the light from the church tower was a no less needed ray, calling to goodness all the day long, as through the hours of the night the beacon had warned against ill.
               Away to the east, just within the limit of vision, was a group of small, rocky islands, two or three of which were inhabited by a few fishermen and their families.
               The men were a set of rough, wild fellows, and some of them, it was said, had not always been engaged in their present peaceful and lawful employment. The women and children, who never went to the mainland, and who seldom had any intercourse whatever with any one outside their little world, were regarded by the few strangers who occasionally went down from the neighboring city to have a picnic or a clam-bake on the rocks of one of the uninhabited islands, as little less than savages.
               On the smallest of these islands, and the one farthest out toward the ocean, which, from its position and the purpose for which it was employed, the fishermen had named the "Convoy," was another light-house.
               The keeper of the light at the period when this narrative commences, was a man of fifty years or more. The last fifteen years of his life, it was generally said, had been passed entirely on the island. A man named Greyson, who was of rather inferior intellect, but strong and active, and much more at home on the water than on the land, though he had a pleasant little cottage near the sea-shore, at no great distance from "The Sands," supplied him with the few necessaries he required in his hermit-like existence.
               With the inhabitants of the adjacent islands, the Commodore, as he was called, though he was so far from being entitled titled to the name that it was not certain that he had ever been a seafaring man, had no intercourse whatever.
               The fishermen manifested no greater desire to be on friendly terms with him than did Mr. Aden—that was the name he was known by on the mainland—with them; and the women and children who, in guiding their little boats for fishing or for sport through the channels which separated the islands, occasionally caught a glimpse of his tall, muscular, but attenuated form, and his white, wan face, around which the thick hair, whose jetty hue was yet scarcely touched by time, closely curled, and which was lighted up by deep-set burning black eyes, always regarded the stranger with a superstitious fear, which deepened into terror as time passed away.
               At his appointment to the post at "The Rocks," which was more than a score of years before, Mr. Aden had seemed disposed to form the acquaintance of the islanders, and to be on friendly terms with them, though they never had encouraged his advances. When, however, the light-keeper's intercourse with the people on the mainland had suddenly ceased, he also restricted himself entirely to his own island; and it was very seldom that any one was disposed to disturb his solitude there.
               Back from "The Sands," lay the village of H——, a quiet, unpretending little town; its inhabitants being far more interested in acquiring for themselves a comfortable livelihood, than in making a show in the great world; gathering the rewards of their industry and frugality from both the ocean and the sandy soil, which about equally contributed to their support.
               
               Halfway between the high cliff and the broad shallow bay were the "fish-houses," which, with two exceptions, were mere sheds, containing only the conveniences for preparing fish for market—sacks of salt, large iron kettles for boiling lobsters, pickling tubs for mackerel, rude tables for dressing the cod, and the "flakes" outside the shed, on which they were spread to dry.
               The work done here was performed principally by young women and girls, the homes of most of whom were within half a mile of "The Sands," and when the fishing season was over the "houses" were unused; but the two families whose buildings were at some distance from each other, and both of them a little apart from the other fish-houses, made these places their permanent abodes. One of these two buildings had been increased in size by the addition of two pleasant, convenient apartments; but the owner of the other had made no improvement in the abode of himself and his daughter beside closing the open side of the shed, making a division of the one large-sized room by running a thin partition across one end of it, hanging a good, firm door, and putting in two small windows.
               These two families, the last referred to being named Du Bois, and the other Maitland, had not always been residents of the neighborhood.
               The Maitlands had come to H—— nearly twenty years before. They were young people then; Mr. Maitland being a little past thirty years of age, and his wife, who brought with her a child of three summers, was fully ten years younger than her husband.
               When they came to the place, they were believed to be in quite affluent circumstances; but they had the appearance of not having been long accustomed to the possession of wealth, and they seemed to have come rather unexpectedly into its enjoyment. In fact, the young woman, though gentle in her manners, and very far from being intentionally ostentatious, frequantly made such thoughtless, ingenuous allusions to her husband's pecuniary affairs, that a people less inclined to mind their own business than were those among whom the Maitlands had come to live, would have had their curiosity excited to an inordinate degree.
               Sometimes the landlady of the little inn where they boarded the greater part of the first three years of their stay at the place, would repeat the young stranger's unguarded remarks to a few female friends she met with at a "quilting party," or "apple bee;" but the comments which they elicited would soon be forgotten in the speculations as to the rise or fall in price of the few commodities the industrious people had for sale, and in comparing their different successes in fishing, in the dairy, or with their poultry.
               It was not until some years after the Maitlands' first arrival there, that "The Sands" began to be the somewhat fashionable watering-place it now is; but even then it was no unusual thing for a family to come down from the city and spend a few summer months by the sea; and consequently the strangers excited less attention than they otherwise would have done; and when Mr. Maitland, on the third year of his coming there—for the winter months were spent elsewhere by the family—began to erect for himself a handsome residence near the foot of the cliff overlooking "The Sands," the people with whom they came in contact had become accustomed to the reserved, silent, haughty demeanor of the man, and the little girlish, ingenuous ways of the simple-hearted woman.
               Mr. and Mrs. Maitland were a remarkably fine-looking couple, but in strong contrast with each other; he, tall, dark and muscular, with an intellectual face, and highly polished manners, but repellant in his cold, glittering black eye, and the firm, measured tones of his deep voice; repellant in his every word and gesture; and she, a little fair, fragile thing, with cheeks and lips of the faintest rose tint, violet eyes, and a face like an April day; with a heart large enough to embrace the whole world, but with a head that held no more wisdom than was needed to be good and true.
               But, evidently, the man had not yet begun to tire of his wife. Perhaps a nature like his can love longest and best such a gentle nature as was hers. And she, glad to be with him, as he rowed his boat over the bright, wavy waters, in the calm summer evening, or following him in the cool, breezy morning, as he sauntered with his fowling-piece in his hand, up the smooth, white beach, or with her little boy playing about her, sitting on the rocks, nestling to his side, as she listened to the tales he told her of the far-off lands he visited before he had seen her, watched the tide coming in, the white crests of the waves jewelled by the light of the crimsoning west, and looked at the green hills, rising like terraces far away, and the mountain stream, hurrying from them like a swift-footed happy child hastening to its mother's arms, on to meet the sea, with a sound like glad music, and ripples like merry smiles—often wondered, while her dilating eyes were swimming with the tears which flowed, she knew not why, as she gazed alternately at the face of her husband, and the distant blue above, and thought of the words she often read:
               "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive"—wondered if it really could be true; if there was, in the wide universe of God, a place so beautiful as the scene about her,—if there could be a life fuller of enjoyment than was her own. Ah! the sky over her was clear, and she could not see that cloud, so frightfully dark, and so surcharged with lightnings and concentrated tempests, which was to break so suddenly upon her.
               The third summer they had passed at "The Sands" was nearly ended, and the new residence would, by mid-autumn, be completed, when one evening, as the young wife was dancing with girlish delight through the spacious rooms which the workmen had cleared lately of their tools and shavings, the fancy seized her of passing the night in the chamber designed for their sleeping apartment, and she requested her husband to have a mattress brought over from their boarding-house.
               The windows and doors of the building were yet without fastenings, but when he talked about intruders, and tried, in an unusually playful manner for him, to frighten her, she only laughed, and finally he yielded to her child-like entreaties.
               But though he was in a sound sleep soon after stretching himself on the mattress, Mrs. Maitland was strangely wakeful. She could not tell whether it was the thought that her child was not near her, as he had been every night before since his birth, which kept her so sleepless, or the moonlight which came in such great white sheets through the uncurtained windows, or the sound of dipping oars she fancied she could hear mingling with the voices of the vast deep, with the grating of a boat against the rocks,—for the tide was coming in,—and the fall of a foot coming up over the ledge, and drawing nearer and nearer to the dwelling, and, at length, faintly echoing through the empty rooms below stairs; though this could not be, she was sure, as such low sounds would be lost in the ocean's roar; or whether it was the remembrance which fastened itself with strange, ever-increasing distinctness, as the hours passed away, of one terrible night in her pleasant life,—she suddenly opened the eyes, which she had persistently kept shut in the vain endeavor to find sleep, and starting up to a sitting posture, put her arms quickly, but so lightly as not to disturb him, around her husband, and bent her head to his; and then she became aware that some one was stooping over them.
               She looked up, and the moonlight was falling full on a face she had seen years before, distorted, then, with an agony worse than that of death, and a hate more terrible still; sinking down into a flame-lighted sea. The hate was yet there, and the merciful darkness which came to her then, at that never-to-be-forgotten moment, was again before her vision; and her eyes closed, and she felt herself falling back without power to arouse her husband.
               When her consciousness returned, though but a brief period had passed, for the moon seemed not to have shifted her place in the heavens, her husband was gone from her side, and from that hour to the present, though fifteen years had—oh, so slowly—since gone by, she had never seen or heard a word from him.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               THE VISION.
               THROUGH the autumn and winter which followed his departure, Mrs. Maitland had lived on the hope of her husband's return.
               His strange absence was not associated in her mind with the appearance of that terrible face she had seen on the night he had left her. In fact, what seemed to her then such a frightful apparition, was afterwards, in her great grief, little dwelt on; for she regarded it only as one of those fearful dreams—if dreams they were, for they seemed always to come between the moments of waking and sleeping—which had visited her at brief intervals for the last four years, ever since that fearful night at sea.
               Her husband had told her that the man she had seen drowning on that night, was found, the morning after, floating upon the water, buoyed up by a life-preserver, but quite lifeless and frightfully charred; and though she felt that there was something in the past which was not revealed to her,—that there was a shadow over him which her eye could not penetrate, she never suspected that he wished to deceive her in the slightest particular; and she loved him all the more, perhaps, for the air of mystery there was about him. Lately she had not spoken to her husband of this phantasm, or whatever it was, which had been presenting itself so unwelcomely to her, so excited had he been by her last reference to it.
               Previously she had always waked him in the night, and tried then to describe to him the scene which had been passing before her closed eyes; but this time it was in broad daylight that she had told him, with her gaze fixed on his face; and she had seen that firmly-built, strong frame tremble as with an ague, those tightly-closed, proud, red lips draw away from each other, convulsed and colorless, while great drops of perspiration came out on the suddenly pallid and furrowed brow.
               And then he had laughed; and his laugh was very frightful, it was so wild and reckless and so spasmodic. But in a moment he was himself again, and very soon he began to talk softly and soothingly to his wife, drawing her head to his bosom; and when, as he told her, she had regained her composure, he explained to her, with many expressions of the deepest and tenderest solicitude, what had given rise to his emotion.
               Sometimes, he said, the terrible fear had come to him that his darling wife was scarcely in the full possession of her reason. Her nervous system had once been so greatly disturbed that it was not strange it should require a long time to regain its former tone. But she must endeavor to banish such thoughts as she had been indulging in, and especially she must never express them when they did come to her; and his love and care, and the quiet life by the sea, would, he believed, soon restore her mental powers to their accustomed vigor.
               She had accepted his explanation. She could not feel that it was really so,—that her reason was, sometimes, almost leaving her;—but then what lunatic ever did believe himself really mad? and her husband was a great deal wiser than herself, and of course he knew. And she did not trouble him any more by speaking of these strange fancies, though, notwithstanding her best endeavors, they would present themselves to her mind no less vividly, till, at length, with open eyes, and in the bright moonlight, she saw that face bending over her.
               And what was the dream, or the vision?
               Mrs. Maitland was the only child of a poor fisherman whose home had been near a little hamlet on the Kentish coast; and her husband was a shipwrecked man whom her father had picked up and carried to his home, and nursed, with the aid of his daughter, through a long and dangerous illness; and when he had recovered his health, the stranger had asked her to become his wife, and her father had given her to him, with his blessing, though she was very young; for she had been motherless for years, and her surviving parent, who was her only relative, and beside whom there was no one to care for her, was so infirm that he had lived scarcely a year after his daughter's marriage.
               During that year, and the two which had succeeded it, Mr. Maitland found employment in the village on the outskirts of which was their humble home; and he had labored very industriously, for his business was far from being a lucrative one; and his young wife had managed her little domestic affairs with great prudence and economy, so that a sum of money might be laid aside sufficient to take them across the ocean—beyond which, her husband had told her, his former home had been—and to enable them to commence housekeeping there in an unpretending way. At length with their son, now two years of age, they had embarked on an ill-fated ship for their voyage over the sea.
               The passage was not quite half completed, when, one day, just as the sun was going down, Mrs. Maitland, almost fainting, and well nigh frantic with grief and terror, but clasping her little boy closely in her arms, felt herself guided, with swift firm hands, into a boat already well-filled; though the occupants had called out to the two men, one of whom was her husband, and the other a pale, delicate-looking man, apparently in ill-health, who, rather supported by, than sustaining, the beautiful woman by his side, was gazing with fixed eyes up to heaven, while words in a foreign language were coming in agonized tones from his lips,—the occupants of the boat had called out:
               "Room for the women and children!"
               The French woman had a babe in her arms as well as Mrs. Maitland,—a little, peacefully-slumbering thing, not more than three months old.
               "Room for the women and children! The men must wait for the other boat."
               Mrs. Maitland saw her husband glance around him. There were no people on that part of the burning ship beside themselves and the two foreigners, who did not immediately comprehend the meaning of the words; but when Mr. Maitland began quickly to guide his wife to the ship's side, the stranger saw what was meant, and a smile almost gloriously beautiful in its deep thankfulness, came over his suddenly-flushed face, and with a glance of paternal affection at the unconscious infant, an instant's firm clasping of his arms about his wife, and a look of unutterable love, he put her, after placing a small casket into her hand, resolutely from him; for with her disengaged arm she was clinging to her husband with a firmness which implied that death would be preferable to separation.
               Mrs. Maitland had observed all this. Notwithstanding the almost maddening realization of her own, her husband's, and her child's danger, the scene which passed before her had fastened itself with the most wonderful clearness on her mind; and the countenances of the two strangers had such a fascination for her, that her memory never after suffered one of their features to lose a portion of its distinctness.
               She knew that the man would not trust his own trembling hands to guide his wife to the boat. Mr. Maitland would do that. How firm and steady his hold on herself was! But, oh! though she had reached the boat in safety, and her little boy was by her side, her husband was again on the deck of the burning ship.
               Some one said that the other boat was far less safe than this. Perhaps she would never again feel the clasp of his arms about her; perhaps she was forever separated from his side. She struggled from the hands of those who were placing her upon a seat, and rose to her feet, stretching out her arms in a wild, mute agony towards him, and looking after him, through the hot smoke, which a sudden, swift breeze swept in such a dense volume down the ship's side as to blind all eyes but those despairing ones, which had better have been darkened forever than to have seen what was passing within the folds of that cloud.
               And what did she see?
               Assuredly nothing! No one in the boat with her saw anything wrong. There was a shriek from a woman in the water, and the low wail of a young child; but there were many cries, and wild prayers, and fierce oaths mingling with the war of the fire. The boat was pulled away from the ship, for the flames, in the rising breeze, flared widely out. There was no time to look for the drowning woman. Every one must think only of his own safety; and, beside, the boat was now full.
               Mrs. Maitland had sunk down, she afterwards thought, in a swoon; but when consciousness returned, her husband was by her side, and his arm was about her, though his face was turned away, and he was not speaking to her; neither could she address him, for the fancy—it could be nothing else—which had come to her as she was falling into that swoon, and which had followed her ever since in her dreams, seemed then so like a horrible reality that the power of speech had forsaken her. She only sought her husband's eyes.
               They were fixed with a sort of fascination upon the water, which a light flame, suddenly leaping up through the cloud of smoke, seemed to change to a sea of fire. Mrs. Maitland looked too, and away, coming out of the shadow which that brightness made so deep, though the light was more frightful than the shade, she saw the figure of a man struggling through the water, making almost superhuman efforts to reach the boat, which was yet but a short distance from the burning ship.
               The red glare fell on his uplifted face, and she distinguished the countenance as that of the Frenchman; but what a change had passed over those features, whose expression, as he neared the boat, was almost as clearly defined as if the light of noonday was falling upon it! The agony of grief, of deepest hate and of vengeful purpose seemed striving for the mastery in that countenance; and words, which were uttered in the bitterest tone, came fast from his lips, though she could not understand them; and, perhaps, they were not fully comprehended by any one on board the boat. But stern faces began to be turned towards Mr. Maitland, and some one threw a life-preserver to the sinking man, for his strength was now exhausted. He made a feeble clutch at it, but whether he reached it or not she could not tell, for as that face disappeared beneath the water, Mrs. Maitland sank insensible at her husband's feet.
               And what had she fancied that she saw when he was standing on the deck of the ship, when she, with such acute vision, was looking through the dense smoke which blinded all other eyes?
               He had stretched out his hands towards the young French woman, to whose countenance there seemed to come, as her eyes met his, a look of recognition; and lifted her over the ship's side, apparently with care and gentleness; and then—then his fingers let go their hold on hers; and she lost her footing, and went down, with the babe in her arms; but the casket remained in Mr. Maitland's hand!
               
               Years had passed since that terrible evening; the night of Mr. Maitland's strange disappearance was almost its fourth anniversary; and time had glided by, like a summer day, to the young wife. The change in her husband's pecuniary affairs, which had become very apparent to her immediately after their arrival in America, was explained by him to his wife in a manner which would have been satisfactory to a more inquiring mind than was hers.
               To another woman, it might have seemed strange that he did not take her to his native city, after being so long absent from it as he had been, and introduce her to some of his former acquaintances; (his near relatives, he had told his wife, were all dead,) and not many wives whose husbands are in such affluent circumstances as Mr. Maitland appeared to be, would be quite satisfied to remain, for a length of time, so completely shut out from society as she was; for though the winter months had, thus far, been spent in the city, and Mr. Maitland had intended to use his dwelling near "The Sands," only as a summer residence, her situation there had been almost as isolated as it was by the sea-shore; an occasional visit to some public place of amusement, a few rides, and now and then a little shopping expedition, were all the variations in her monotonous boarding-house life.
               But the gentle, loving wife and mother never thought she had cause for complaint. She was perfectly satisfied with everything about her. The society and affection of her husband and her child were all that she desired, and consequently when he had left her, all but her child was gone.
               In the wide world there was not one more than another to whom she could look for assistance or advice.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               HOLY THURSDAY.
               THE finishing of the new house did not go on for more than a week or two after Mr. Maitland's disappearance. The materials for its construction had, most of them, been paid for; but the workmen employed on it had received no compensation for their labor, and the deserted wife, while certain that her husband had means enough at his command, knew not where to find a dollar except by the sale of her clothing, or her inexpensive jewelry; and though the Maitlands had always paid their landlady in advance, the quarter was now within a few days of its expiration.
               The people among whom she was, were as kind and considerate as one could expect them to be; but before winter came, the unfinished house was sold, the purchaser promising that, if her husband should return within six months after his disappearance, the building might be redeemed for the price paid for it.
               Fortunately it brought enough, even in the forced sale, to pay all the debts, to defray the moderate expenses of herself self and her now six-year-old boy, through the winter, and to leave her a trifle at the opening of spring. She had refused to receive a dollar more than was left after the debts were paid.
               While the winter months had been passing away, her hopes of her husband's return were becoming fainter and fainter. They quite died out when the bright spring came, and the anniversary of the day returned when she and her husband had first walked over "The Sands" together.
               The carpenters had resumed their work on the dwelling which was to have been her home. There were changes to be made in the original design, for it was the intention of its present owner to make a fine hotel of it; and Mrs. Maitland would sit for hours together at the window of her boarding-house, looking out through her fast-dropping tears, watching the progress of the work, every blow of the hammer falling on her ear with a knell-like sound.
               One night, it was a mild evening late in May, and the soft land-breeze, passing over "The Sands," was filled with the breath of spring, the aroma from the fresh, fragrant grasses, and the sweet-scented blossoms of the fruit trees, from the ferns and mosses, and swelling buds, and bursting flowers in the wooded hills rising up far away. One year since, on such a day as this had been, she had wandered by her husband's side, seeking the sweet spring flowers, some of which were new to her, which were forcing their way up through the thick matting that autumn had spread over the ground, or timidly shrinking away with their little modest faces bent to the earth, in the sheltered nooks among the rocks, and gathering the young, spicy leaves of the wintergreen, and sweet red berries, which looked, in the cunning little moss baskets her fingers had so deftly fashioned, like beautiful precious things.
               She remembered the thoughts which had come to her then; simple, child-like thoughts they were, but they seemed very pleasant to her,—how, through the long winter, the wind, the cold, the snow, through the short, sunless days, and the dreary lengthened nights, when everything appeared so inert and lifeless, those little flower-buds, hidden away among the withered leaves, had trustingly waited for the dawning of their morning; and those sweet, red berries, nestling close to each other, were busily dyeing their blood-red covering, while their little unchilled heads were growing pure and white.
               Patiently waiting, and patiently working! and at length their hour of reward had come.
               Mrs. Maitland wrapped her shawl about her, her little boy was sleeping, and stepping out into the open air, took her way up the cliff.
               The sound of the workmen's tools had ceased within the new building, and she paused a moment as she passed the windows, for the carpenters had left for their homes, and looked in; and then, with a quickened pace pursued her way up the cliff, almost dropping to the earth as she reached its brow. She had not been there before since her husband left her, though this had formerly been a favorite walk of hers. Almost daily, when the weather was pleasant, she had come here to look out on the sea as the sun was going down.
               Beside her, her head was resting on it now, was the round white stone Mr. Maitland had, one day, spent hours in rolling ing up here, and partially imbedded in the earth, that it might serve as a seat for her; and there were the handfuls of white pebbles and sea-shells, scattered about in the short, scanty grass, with which he and his little boy had often playfully pelted at each other.
               Would they ever meet again, the father and his son?
               The desolate woman did not think, now, that she should ever again see her husband. She believed that her life was passing away, for as the spring advanced her health seemed to fail, and she did not even for her child's sake wish it to be prolonged. She hoped that the people among whom she expected to leave him, would be kind to her boy when she was gone from him forever.
               The sun had some moments since disappeared from the horizon, its last lingering ray had faded even from the summit of the cliff, and here and there a twinkling eye was faintly peeping down from the deep blue heaven. The tide was in, and the low monotone of the ocean sounded like a soothing lullaby. The fishing-boats were going out that night; they had, some time since, pushed off from the shore, and the cheerful tones which, not long before, had come up from the fish-houses, were hushed now, and not a human sound was heard, or living thing but herself seen anywhere near.
               Mrs. Maitland lifted her head.
               Yes, there was some one in the dress of a fisherman, walking up and down the beach just below the cliff, stopping now and then and looking out over the water, as if waiting and watching for something; and following him, clad in a little dark frock, was a child, not more than three or four years of age, who was striving, but for the most of the time ineffectually, its companion made such long and rapid strides, to keep by his side; sometimes falling down on the wet sand when the man walked near the water's edge, but picking up its little self as best it could, for its mishaps seemed not to be observed by its companion, and trying to wipe the salt, bitter sand from its face with its short, scanty dress.
               Mrs. Maitland watched the two for some time. She knew, by sight, at least, all the fishermen in the neighborhood, and their children; but though they were at such a distance from her, that their features could not be distinguished, she thought they must be strangers. For a few moments, while looking at them, she forgot her own sorrows, and her heart was filled with pity for the little one. The child stooped down to the ground, digging its little fingers into the sand, apparently to unearth some fancied treasure, and then tried, though it seemed to be growing weary, to run fast to overtake its companion, turning its face up to his when he at length stopped, and reaching out the small hand which held the treasure; but he put away the little creature so rudely that it fell to the ground; and the tears came to the woman's eyes as she gazed and wondered if the man could be the child's father, and if it had a mother living.
               She watched them till they walked away; the child, as if discouraged by its repulse, following the man at a short distance, and at length they passed beyond her sight; but she thought they had entered one of the fish-houses, the most distant one, and that which was situated farthest apart from the others.
               
               She began to think of her own child, then, and to ask herself if it was not very selfish and wicked in her to be unwilling to bear the burden which was laid upon her, and cheerfully too, for his sake; and the thoughts she had been dwelling upon half an hour before, came back to her mind.
               Patiently waiting, and patiently watching; and at length the hour of reward had come!
               And then through the silent air,—silent but for the ocean's soft lullaby as it seemed rocking itself to rest,—there came to her ear the sound of a distant bell; very faint at first, but growing more and more distant, as she listened with hushed breath.
               This was the first time she had ever, from this spot, caught the sound, though she had been told that one of the bells at "The Port," was sometimes heard at "The Sands;" and she suddenly remembered that this was Holy Thursday.
               "Who is the King of Glory?"
               And fuller of silvery sweetness, and of happy rejoicing, St. Mary's bell seemed to ring out the refrain: 
                     
                        "Who is the King of glory?"
                        "The Lord strong and mighty,
                        Even the Lord of hosts—
                        He is the King of glory!"
                     
                  
               
               "The Lord of hosts!"—were the words borne to her by the undulating air? Did they come up from the depths of the ocean? Did her memory take utterance and whisper them in her ear? or was it the still, small Voice, which came after the wind, the earthquake, and the fire,—the Voice, at whose sound the prophet "wrapped his face in his mantle, and stood at the entering in of the cave"?
               "Thy Maker is thy husband; the Lord of hosts is his name.—In a little wrath I hid my face from thee; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord, thy Redeemer."
               And she cast down her burden at His feet, and with quivering lips answered in the words of the Psalm she had read that day,—in her loneliness and despair,—almost without thought, but which came to her now in all their comforting significance:
               "Thou art my defence and my shield, and my trust is in thy word!"
               The next morning Mrs. Maitland rose from her bed some time before the sun was up, combed out her long, fair curls, and bound them in close braids, and with flying fingers made for herself a long wide apron, and put a deep tuck in the skirt of her plainest dress; and when, to the great astonishment of her landlady, she had arrayed herself in these garments, and tied a handkerchief about her head, she walked with ungloved hands down to the fish-houses on "The Sands" to seek employment.
               Her father was a fisherman, and had often been in such ill-health that he had needed her assistance in all the details of his business, so she could do anything which might be required of her by an employer.
               This she said very simply to the pleasant-faced young woman to whom she offered her services; and her offer was accepted, though the little thin hands, long unused to labor now, did not look as if they could ever earn for her and her child their daily bread; and many times, during the first day's labor, the young fish-woman left her own work to give a helping hand to Mrs. Maitland.
               But after a week had passed, strength began to come to her; a faint color returned to the pale face, and her step was firmer; and though her words were very few now, the tones of her voice expressed patience and resignation. So changed was she that her thrifty landlady, who, while she had felt very sorry for her, did not understand how Mrs. Maitland could have sat, as she had been doing, all through those months which had followed her husband's departure, with her hands lying idly on her lap, and her eyes almost blinded with tears, thus making herself thinner and paler every day; and prophesied that before a year had passed, her child and she, too, unless she mourned herself to death before that time, would be dependent on public charity for support—now declared it her belief that there was more in the young woman than any one could have supposed.
               With a little encouragement, Mrs. Brown thought, and the assistance which her boy would very soon render her, for he was very strong and active for his age, she would soon be able to take care of herself and him quite comfortably.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               THE LIGHT-HOUSE KEEPER.
               HALF an hour after sunset on the night of Mr. Maitland's desertion of his wife and child, two people were walking slowly up and down the weedy and grass-grown gravel walk that led from a broken, hingeless gate, to an old dilapidated dwelling nearly a mile distant from that part of N—— designated by the residents at "The Sands," as "The Port."
               It was something unusual that there should be more than one walking there, and she, a young woman of nineteen or twenty years, was not often visible in front of the house; though many times during the day, and in all sorts of weather, she might be observed far back in the wide, almost entirely neglected garden, sometimes busying herself in a little vegetable patch, or gathering the fruits which would grow without care; but usually wandering idly about with a sad and listless air.
               Her countenance, as she walked beside her companion, who was a tall, fine-looking man, a dozen or more years her senior, was as dejected as ever, though it was now sufficiently animated in expression; and her words, for she seemed to be the principal speaker, came in low and soft, but very rapid tones, from her thin white lips.
               Thin and white; and the cheeks were pale, and the hands, which would have been fair, though they were accustomed to labor, were far too delicate to be beautiful.
               Near by them sat one whom a careless observer might have called a very aged man, but whom a second glance showed to be infirm before his time. He was sitting in an old, uncushioned, straight-backed chair, which had been drawn out to a safe place on the veranda, much of the flooring of which, rotted by time and neglect, was crumbling away; his poor, bent body lying heavily against the arm of the chair, and his feet, which occasionally moved as if from pain, resting on an uncomfortably high wooden stool.
               He was very poorly clad, but everything about him was scrupulously clean. Not a speck of dust was upon his clothing, and every thread of the yet slightly silvered hair lay smoothly on his bowed head.
               His eyes, which were so bright and piercing that one might have fancied they had drawn to themselves all the vitality of the whole body, followed the two who walked-up and down the gravel path, but not scrutinizingly; the few words which he occasionally addressed to them were kind and pleasant, and the answers which were returned, not in a heightened tone, though the speakers drew near him when they replied, were so loving and respectful that they always brought a smile to the old man's face.
               "He is so very good, and tries to be so kind to me, that I do not like to reply fully to your questions, George!" said the girl.
               She and her companion were turning again down the path, after exchanging a few words with their friend. The tears had come into her eyes as she was speaking.
               "But you come here so seldom now, that I may not have another opportunity for telling you."
               "You know why I do not come here oftener, Rachel!" her companion replied, earnestly and inquiringly.
               Perhaps she might have known, but she did not say so; and after a moment she continued:
               "He tries,—as he has always done, ever since he brought me, a poor little friendless orphan to his home,—to make me happy: only he does not know how to render me so. He does not see that a few dollars spent now for things absolutely necessary for his comfort as well as my own, would do me much more good than to hear so often of the many thousands which he intends, by-and-by, shall be mine; especially as I know I can never be his heir, for I shall not live."
               "Rachel!"
               "It is true, George! I cannot live if I remain here. Life is a burden to me, not only from the weariness and uselessness of my existence—yes, uselessness, for some one with more energy and strength of mind than I possess, would soon make such a change in everything about him, that he would be far more comfortable and happy than he is with me;—not only from weariness and the conscious uselessness of my existence, but from actual want.
               "We have no books, no society: there is no employment but what is too laborious for me to perform;—nothing to occupy my thoughts, nothing interesting to busy my hands; and, besides, we are often in need of proper food, to say nothing of suitable clothing; and Mr. Hall is continually becoming more penurious.
               "Every night, when I go to bed,"—the girl was laughing now, but she was still sadly in earnest—"every night when I go to bed I am afraid the old house will tumble down upon us before morning.
               "But what distresses me more than anything else, just now," she continued, "is a fact that I learned yesterday, by accident, from an old friend of my guardian. He came here to talk with Mr. Hall about his sister, whose husband had lately died, leaving her and a family of young, interesting girls in very indigent circumstances, and to entreat him to concern himself with her affairs; and his reply was that he had promised to give Rachel all his property, and consequently could do nothing for any one else, not even his only sister.
               "I rushed into his room the moment the old gentleman left the house," the girl went on, hurriedly, "and threw myself at his feet, and tried to thank him for what he had done, and for what he intended to do for me; and then I prayed him to make a comfortable home for his sister and her daughters, and hereafter to live with them, and let them know they were to be his heirs: and that I—may I tell you what more I said to him, George?"
               "Yes, Rachel, and I hope you told him what I wished you to months ago!" said the young man, earnestly.
               "I began to," she replied, dropping her eyes. "I said, 'There is a young man whom you and every one else who knows him, highly respects, who will, with your consent, ask me to be his wife, and will provide for me.' But he interrupted me there, and with such hard, cruel words that I could only rise to my feet, and stand trembling before him. Strangely enough, he thought it was young Captain Singleton to whom I referred, and I did not undeceive him, for I could not have heard him apply those opprobrious epithets to you, George, which he bestowed on him; though cousin Edgar is as deserving of respect as yourself.
               "I am glad his ship is to sail in the morning, for I think Mr. Hall, who has been greatly discomposed, until within the past hour, ever since I so spoke to him, is now comforting himself with the determination of sending to Captain Singleton to-morrow, and forbidding his coming here again; and that would distress me very much, Edgar has been so kind to me since he learned I was his cousin."
               They walked on for some moments in silence, when she had ceased speaking, and then the young man said, in an altered tone:
               "And so your cousin's fine new ship is to sail in the morning; and the physician whom I consulted, a few days since, says that a sea voyage would, most likely, be very beneficial to your health. Rachel, does it not surprise you, that loving you as you know I do, and seeing how miserable you are here, suffering an almost daily death, I do not ask you, without waiting for any one's consent, to leave this old man, whose heart was always good, but whose intellect, aside from his business capacity, was rather feeble, and is most surprisingly so now, and whose wealth, even if he had no relations to care for his comfort, would secure for him all the service he needs—that I do not ask you to go with me, to become my cherished, happy wife?"
               The girl did not reply otherwise than by the tears which now dropped fast from the downcast eyes, and after a brief pause, he continued; speaking at first with an effort, but afterwards proceeding rapidly.
               "Eighteen years ago, as you probably are aware, Mr. Hall was engaged in business in a distant southern city. He was then a very active and energetic man. One could hardly suppose it possible that, unless he had been visited by some severe and protracted disease, so short a period of time could produce such a change in him as I, better than you, Rachel, can see; for I was then, and had been, for a twelvemonth, in his employ."
               "You?"
               "Yes! he would not be likely to tell you that; I and my brother, whom I believe to be now dead, as I have not heard from him for more than a dozen years. I was then but fifteen, and though we had not the same father, there was less than two years difference in our ages. Neither of us resembled his father, but both inherited our mother's looks, and from the time, which was in early childhood, when I had attained to his stature and size, through boyhood and youth, until the day when we were parted forever, as I think, we were so strikingly alike, that some of our most intimate associates could only, by some article of our clothing, distinguish one of us from the other. Indeed very few, beside our mother, who died soon after we came into Mr. Hall's employ, could tell, for a certainty, which was Philip and which was George.
               "Our employer never knew one from the other, as my brother, after we entered his establishment, always insisted on dressing precisely as I did; and on the night—I am telling you, Rachel, what probably no one in the world but our old friend yonder, and myself, know,—on the night when at an unusual hour he went into his counting-room, he found one of us in the very act of abstracting a large sum of money from his safe, he could not tell, I have often thought as unfortunately for the one as for the other, which of the two was before him.
               "He has not known, for a certainty, to this day, which it was; for when he called us, next morning, before him, the guilty one, who had eluded his grasp when he was discovered, though he made no attempt to escape farther than to his boarding-house—stood boldly erect, with a countenance which expressed only astonishment and grief, while the other was trembling with fear and shame—the very personification of guilt.
               "But neither of us denied, or confessed the attempted theft. Mr. Hall had, for years before we came into his employ, been very kind to us—our invalid mother, and her two fatherless sons; and he was still a true friend to us, though he told us that this was not the first time one of us had sought to rob him of money.
               "He asked no questions after saying this, for one of the boys had sunk on the floor at his feet; but he remarked that we must be separated very widely from each other, and he hoped we should never meet again.
               
               "One of us, he said, was a true, noble-hearted boy—he would not criminate his brother; but the other must have been born a villain. Time, and the experience of this hour, might, though he hoped it would not, change the character of the former; and when we became men, it would be well for us, if, in the accidents of life, my brother and I should never jostle each other. We must be separated. Philip, he would send to a business partner of his in Italy; and George might remain with him.
               "My brother went, and a good account of him was frequently sent back to Mr. Hall, until the business connection between the two houses was dissolved. Since that time I have never heard from him, and my frequent attempts to gain intelligence of him have resulted in the conviction that he is no longer living.
               "I remained with my employer until he gave up business, and when he came north he requested me to accompany him, in order that—
               "Rachel, when you told Mr. Hall that the man who wished you to become his wife was one whom he highly respected, it was not strange that his thoughts did not turn to me; for when he requested me to accompany him on his return to the north, it was because he wished, still, to keep me under his surveillance; for he has always been disposed to think it was I who attempted to rob him.
               "Without my knowledge, he procured the appointment at The Rocks for me; and as the retirement suited my disposition and my taste for study, I gladly accepted it. He thought I should be out of the reach of temptation there; and he is well pleased that I make my visits to the mainland as infrequent as I do, though that is not the reason why I come here no oftener.
               "The reason is because it is so hard to look on you, so lonely and wretched here, and refrain from asking you to go away with me to the pleasant home I could hope to make for you. And you now know why I am compelled to be silent.
               "Good-night, Rachel!"
               They had turned from the gravel walk as he began to speak, and had wandered away through the garden, the grounds of which ran down to the water's edge, where, at the foot of the steep, ledgy bank, down whose side nice, broad steps had been cut into the solid rock, waited the little boat in which Mr. Aden had come over from The Rocks.
               They were standing on the topmost of this flight of steps, when he said, "Good-night, Rachel!" and as she did not reply, he turned and looked in her face.
               It was lifted up to the sky, and a sharp pain went through his heart, when he saw the expression of her countenance. How brief, even with the tenderest care, that young life would most likely be!
               She was the last of a large family, all of whose members had died of consumption; and the withering touch of the destroyer seemed already to have been laid upon her.
               After a little pause, she echoed his simple leave-taking, and was moving away without farther word, when he detained her.
               "Rachel!" he said, slowly and solemnly, "you shall suffer no longer; neither will I. It is not right that we should. We both love that old man and he merits our affection, and we would do much to make him happy. But we will not give him our lives, especially when there are others who can take better care of him than you can possibly do. I will spend this night in thought, and in prayer to Heaven. Perhaps a way will open before me. Come down here in the morning, at daybreak, and I will tell you what is the result of my reflections, or the answer to my prayers."
               The girl returned with quick steps to the house, and her companion, after her form had disappeared from his view, walked slowly down to the water's edge, and re-entered his boat, which a lively breeze soon bore over the smooth sea to the little inlet at the base of the light-house, where the fisherman, young Greyson, was patiently waiting his return; or rather, impatiently, for there was a subject of great moment weighing on his mind that night.
               The Commodore—it was from young Greyson he had received that cognomen on his first arrival at The Rocks, when the then half-grown lad who had come over early to offer his services to the new keeper, in a fit of greater stupidity and familiarity than usual, had splashed some drops of salt water in Mr. Aden's face—the Commodore knew what was in the fisherman's thoughts. It was a subject which he himself had suggested to the young fellow, who had been making him, for the last three months, his confidant in his love affairs.
               Mr. Aden was becoming rather weary of his mode of life, and he had lately told Greyson, greatly to the young man's delight, that if he should marry Miss Jones, who was a notable housekeeper, he might come over to the island and occupy the cabin belonging to the light-house, rent free, and should be paid liberally for his, Mr. Aden's board; and it was to discuss this matter that he had waited, after discharging the duties entrusted to him, during the keeper's few hours' absence to the mainland, for the return of the boat.
               "And what about Miss Sally to-night, Jerry?" he asked pleasantly, as he stepped on shore.
               Young Greyson transferred his forefinger from the corner of his mouth to the long, straggling lock of yellow hair that dangled over his eyes, and giving it a twist and a pull, replied that he had told Miss Jones what they had been talking about; but she had not fully decided yet what she would do, at least she had not made known her decision to him. If the Commodore would invite her over to the island, however, and she liked the appearance of things there, she might make up her mind very soon.
               Mr. Aden, not knowing what decision he should himself arrive at, in relation to his own affairs, made answer that Jerry might call at the island next day, and he should, very likely, have the note of invitation ready for him.
               But this, accompanied, as it was, with the bit of silver for "keeping the light-house" in the Commodore's absence, made the perfectly honest and trustworthy, though very miserly young fellow, entirely happy; and he jumped into his boat and rowed off briskly towards the mainland.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER V.
               THE BROTHERS.
               MR. ADEN, after securing his boat, went up into the light-house.
               His home was there.
               There was another building—it has already been referred to—on the little rocky island, fitted up comfortably for the residence of a family; but he seldom occupied it.
               To the broad floor at the foot of that long, weary flight of stairs, he had taken various articles appertaining to a very primitive housekeeping; and high up the ascent he had carried a mattress, his books, telescopes and maps, and here the greater part of his solitary life was spent.
               The hours of the night were passing away, but they were not employed this evening, as they very frequently were, in making astronomical observations.
               Mr. Aden was looking away over the stretch of water his boat had just crossed, and trying to devise some way in which he could make poor Rachel Ross and himself happy, without being branded by the old man whom he loved and wished to honor, as an ingrate and a thief, which he was sure Mr. Hall would do if he sought to make her his wife; and thinking of the past which the recital he had just made to Rachel had brought so vividly to his mind.
               He was feeling particularly grateful to Mr. Hall to-night, that he had been separated early from his brother; and he hoped that they would never meet again until earthly passions should have no more power over them.
               There had been many times in the long, weary past, when the hard, cold man, as he was often called, had repeated audibly to himself, and with a simple, child-like faith, the words which his mother had taught him in his earliest youth:
               "Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in Him—and He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light."
               And he had felt, at those moments, that should he ever meet his brother again, he would try to forgive him, and trust himself and his cause in the hand of God.
               But this was not one of those moments.
               It was one of those other seasons which came more frequently; usually after lengthened, absorbing thought on some subject of deepest interest.
               Sometimes the face of his brother would come up suddenly before him, rising out of the sea, as his boat was gliding over the waves, maddening him with that look of innocent astonishment and grief which Philip knew so well how to assume; sometimes the bold, erect figure would stand within range of his fowling-piece, as his eye was sweeping the horizon, in search of some aquatic bird; and again, the calm, fearless eyes had met his, looking up out of the darkness, as he had been, in the silent night, walking over those long winding stairs. And he had brought his oar down into the water with a violence which had almost upset his boat, and then, darting swiftly away, listened to catch the cry which he thought would have been a welcome sound—the cry of a drowning man; he had discharged his gun, and stood still, waiting for a death-shriek to meet his ear; he had struck out his clenched hand into the darkness, and bent forward to hear a heavy body falling down, step after step, over that lengthened stairway, the low moans becoming fainter and fainter, till, at length, all should be dread silence again.
               Pursued as if he had not only intentionally but really been guilty, and so pertinaciously, by those evil thoughts, that he sometimes fancied he was a criminal hiding from justice—when his brain was again unfrenzied, he thought how much he needed Rachel's gentle companionship to rescue him from the power which seemed urging him on to madness;—even more than she needed his strong arm to lean upon. Near her he could trust in heaven.
               He had just told her that he would spend the night in calm reflection and in prayer for Divine guidance; and now,—he was busying himself with his lamps,—if he turned his head, his overwrought imagination would conjure up that hateful—yes, hated figure, he felt very sure now that he had not forgiven his brother, and his hand, nerved to iron, would be ready to strike out into that phantom face, whose dark, fearless eyes were so calmly triumphant in their expression.
               Suddenly there fell on his quick ear the sound of a footstep, softly echoing up the spiral stairway. It was a quick, even, but very peculiar tread. How like to the tread of that foot, after the ankle joint had been partially stiffened!
               His hands trembled so that the oil spilled over the lamps, but the teeth were set firmly together, and there was a look of settled determination on that face as it turned to the visitor, who, in a wonderfully brief space of time had ascended that long flight of steps, and now stood on the topmost stair, glaring so wildly into the room that the figure might well have been taken for a supernatural one.
               But Mr. Aden's wild imaginings all left him at the instant he recognized that face—left him to return no more forever; for as he gazed on that countenance, he looked, too, into his own heart, and read the deeply-engraven record there, which he had failed before to render aright.
               He had forgiven his brother, the disturber of his peace, ever since his earliest childhood, long ago.
               "Philip, my brother!" he said, taking the new comer's hand in both his own, and drawing him forward away from the steps, and seating him upon a bench at some distance from the stairway, down which it had seemed for a moment, notwithstanding the agility he had manifested in his ascent, he was ready to tumble.
               The visitor was indeed his half-brother, who Mr. Aden thought had died many years before in a foreign land.
               He had very willingly been led to a seat, but he did not speak immediately, or return the pressure of the hands which were clinging so closely to his.
               He seemed quite incapable of doing so, but sat gazing into Mr. Aden's face with the most earnest scrutiny, though cowering beneath the glance which met his, kindly as it was; and after a moment's pause, the younger brother spoke again, pleasantly, but with a slightly troubled tone.
               
               "Philip, I am glad to see you, though I perceive your purpose in coming here is other than a mere friendly visit. What do you wish to ask of me, my brother?"
               "Not your forgiveness," was the reply, which no one at "The Sands" would have believed could be that of Mr. Maitland, though the stranger was he, the slow, cold, measured tones were so hasty and eager now, and sometimes so nearly incoherent, "not that, for I perceive it is already mine.
               "I have not come to tell you, either, how well I appreciate, now, the sacrifice you made for me so long ago, when, at the time of our separation, you could so easily have cleared yourself from suspicion—not even to thank you for it, because what I have come here to ask you to do for me now, is so much greater than anything you have done before.
               "I have come to ask you now not only to take upon yourself the burden of my crime—it is crime, now, George, real and terrible, though I dare not tell you what is its nature, or you would not aid me,—not simply to take upon yourself the burden of my crime, but to let me remain here in your place, and flee yourself, like the wretch which I am, before the man, maddened by my deeds, who is pursuing me.
               "A slight thing to ask, is it not?" he laughed, wildly. "The man will not harm you. If he finds you, you have but to show him your fair right arm, which"—his voice sank now to a trembling whisper, "which has never been lifted, but for the performance of a duty, or in an act of kindness. He has seen this!"
               Mr. Maitland rolled back his sleeve and displayed a large blood-red spot just above his wrist.
               "You know this will not disappear, except by amputation of the arm. But do not let him find you. Let him think he is on my track, but do not let him find you. Here is gold; you must hasten. Why, you are not hesitating, George!"
               At first Mr. Aden seemed struck dumb with astonishment and grief; and when he could have found speech, for the remembrance of Rachel Ross suddenly returned to him, if he had made answer to his brother, he would have said that so far from going into hiding himself, Philip, even, should not leave the neighborhood until he went to Mr. Hall, confessed the crimes of his youth, and placed him, George Aden, in a right light before their old employer. For Rachel's sake, Philip should do this.
               "You surely are not hesitating, George?" Mr. Maitland repeated, in an agonized tone, as his brother retreated from him some steps, and held back the hands, which Philip, almost sinking at his feet, sought now so eagerly to grasp. "For her sake, George," he plead, "my wife's."
               His wife! So Philip was married, George Aden thought, and he was the Mr. Maitland living at "The Sands," whom young Greyson had often spoken of to him; and the woman whom Jerry thought was so much like what an angel must be, was the wife of the confessed guilty man.
               "For her sake, George!" he repeated. "I was a wild, bad, dying man; but her love and tender care brought me back from the grave and from perdition. I thought for years after I met her that she would, at length, lead me to heaven, but in a moment of frenzy, for I have often fancied that I inherit from my maternal grandfather a tendency to insanity, though I do not say this in excuse for the committal of that deed—a terrible crime was perpetrated. Only one, beside my wife, who will see it all plainly enough now, only one beside her, the wronged man, knows of the deed, and he cannot prove it; but he will kill me if he finds me.
               "The way of escape from him, is, of course, as open to me as it is to you; but I cannot take my wife and her child with me; and I would not, if I could; and I cannot go away from her. I should slay myself, if I attempted to do so.
               "She saved me, to-night, from his hand. He could not touch me, though he stood over me with uplifted arm, and knew I was defenceless, and thought that I was sleeping, while her arms were around me, even though her eyes were closed, and she lay insensible, fainting at the sight of his face.
               "He drew back to the door of my chamber and waited for me till I should have waked and gone out in search of aid to arouse my wife; but I dropped from the window and came here to you, having learned lately that you were here, instead of being in the distant southern city where I had supposed you to be.
               "I thought you would save me, and you must do so, George, for her sake. I will confine myself to the island as closely as you wish me to. No one, not even she, shall know the exchange which is made here.
               "I wish to hide from every human being, as I would hide from him; only I must be near her!
               "A merchantman goes over the Bar this morning. You will have time to reach the ship while this man I am speaking of will be seeking me at The Rocks."
               Yes; Captain Singleton, Rachel's cousin, was to sail that morning for an Italian port.
               Mr. Aden started and changed countenance.
               The temptation, if it was such, was too strong to be resisted. It all passed before him in a moment; how the affair could be managed, what happiness it would bring to Rachel, and what real benefit might result to Mr. Hall, should he comply with his brother's request.
               He would make her his wife early in the approaching morning, and they would immediately go on board the ship of Captain Singleton, whom Mr. Hall would believe Rachel had married. She should write him a few lines after they had gone over the Bar and send them back by the pilot, saying she was with her husband, on board the Essex.
               Her guardian would be very angry at first, but his thoughts would soon turn to his fatherless neices and to his sister, who was a good, sensible woman, far better calculated to make the feeble, eccentric old man happy, and to devise proper means to restore him, in some measure, at least, to the health which inactivity and deprivation of the comforts of life had undermined, than was this gentle, yielding girl. And Rachel, who had been born in a southern home, and who, a skilful physician had said, might not live through another winter at the North, perhaps, in her happiness in being with him, might find renewed vigor in the land to which he would take her.
               And for himself? It was Heaven which had formed the relationship between him and his brother. The tie which bound them together would end with life; and life, at the best, is brief. It might be his duty to shield him; and though he shrank from the deception, perhaps, this time, the consequence to himself would be only liberty and happiness; for with the eye of Mr. Hall always upon him, he had seemed to himself little less than a prisoner.
               The result of his compliance with Philip's wish, might, with equal probability, for he did not fully rely on his brother's words, be fatal to him,—might be assassination by the hand of the man whom Mr. Maitland had wronged, or, at least, the involving of himself in some great danger. But for that he must trust in Providence and in his own ingenuity.
               "I will go, Philip!" he said, after the momentary pause, "but," he added solemnly, "if you ever seek me again, to shield you from merited disgrace, or deserved punishment, may Heaven help us both!"
               Half an hour after, when Mr. Aden had made his brother acquainted with the simple duties which devolved upon him as keeper of the light-house, and how he could bring young Greyson to him whenever he needed assistance, and had seen Mr. Maitland use the razor about the thickly bearded face till it was as smooth as his own, and the likeness to himself came out on the broadly shaven visage, almost as wonderfully as it had done on the fair countenance of boyhood; the two men exchanged their clothing, and parted from each other.
               One, as he emerged from the light-house, looked up to the stars, to see how soon the earliest morning light would fall on the spire of St. Mary's, and thinking of the glad smile which would meet his gaze, and the gentle words ready to fall on his ear as he rowed up to the stone steps, where he had parted with Rachel, jumped into the light boat which had, not long before, brought Mr. Maitland over from The Sands, and pushed off from the island, happy in the happiness he was going to carry to one little desponding heart.
               The other was looking down from an aperture high up in that gloomy building, down, he thought, into the very depths of those dark waters, which, as he gazed, seemed heaping themselves up about him, hemming him in now from all human companionship.
               For a moment he was forgetful of his wife and child, terrible as was the thought of separation from them, and well nigh maddening as was the conviction that now his crimes and his falsehoods would all be known to the simple, but pure-minded, trusting woman.
               He was forgetful, too, of the danger he had just escaped, but which he might every moment fear, as long as two lives lasted, from the hand which would never again be checked till its vengeance was complete.
               He wondered if, should he fling himself from the height, among those ever rolling, ever requiem-chanting waves, away from whose neighborhood he had, for the last four years, never been able for any length of time to tear himself, though the billows, to him, were always so voiceful with accusations and threatenings of impending doom—if among those dark waters he would meet the close embrace of an arm he had once released from his grasp.
               Would he be clutched by those long white fingers which had then striven in vain to fasten themselves on his—grappling, in his death-struggle, with a skeleton form, and dragged down to a depth to which her unappeased spirit had not yet descended; down—down—to the music of a mother's agonized shrieks, and a dying infant's feeble wail?
               In the cast of mind, as well as in the physical conformation of the two brothers, there was a very great similarity; but the darkness was passing away from the life of the one, wanderer though he was to become, as he looked up to Heaven, and guided his boat by its sure light with an arm which, it had truly been said, had never been lifted but in the discharge of a duty, or in the performance of an act of kindness, strengthened now that a sweet burden was so soon to be laid upon it. And, bound by affection, for all was not wrong in Mr. Maitland, the love for his wife shining out like a never-setting star, in his dark character—bound by affection and by fear, firmly as was Prometheus to his rock, around the other in his living grave, safe as if he had been in a tomb, from his wronged pursuer, though he knew it not, the shadow of despair, and the gloom as of death, were falling.
               Safe as in a tomb from his pursuer!
               Mr. Aden's boat had nearly passed out of sight when another had silently glided into the little inlet among the rocks at the base of the light-house, and a man who seemed to have trodden the way before, leaped upon shore, and entered the building, for the door was still unlocked; Mr. Aden always kept it so.
               The stranger halted for an instant and listened, and then he went up over the many steps with a cat-like tread but with almost winged swiftness, pausing as he reached the highest turning, and gazing with his eagle eyes, himself unseen, for an instant on Mr. Maitland, whose profile, as he looked through the aperture, out upon the ocean, was brought, by a brightly-burning lamp, into full relief. And then the intruder, dropping back, still with perfect noiselessness, over the steps, gained his boat and rowed towards The Sands: repeating again and again to himself, and audibly as soon as he was at a distance from the island, as if not quite convinced of the truth of his words:
               "Not he—not the man I am looking for! Strangely like him, however. The smoothness of the face proves nothing; but thrice, within the sennight, I have looked on his right arm, and it was fair. I should have made myself sure of it again to-night, but time is passing; and besides," he added, looking back to the Convoy light as he neared The Sands—"it might not have been safe for me to approach him to-night; and I must never trust myself there again. That face is too like his. There are moments when I might fling that man down his long stairway for the resemblance he bears to the murderer of my wife—the destroyer of myself!" He struck his brow fiercely as he spoke.
               The gray dawn was just appearing in the east as the stranger drew near the mainland, at the point where the fishermen usually brought in their boats.
               He had not been deceived in his survey of the spot some hours before, though it was only by the light of the setting moon he had counted the boats, and most likely, his ear had not deceived him. One was gone, a little light pleasure-boat, undoubtedly now, for the wind was fair, up at the Port.
               The stranger had been to the "anchorage" at The Rocks, but the boats were all out, all but that of the light-house keeper, and that was safe at the inlet; and he again, but now weariedly, plied his oars, inwardly cursing himself that he had suffered that fair face to come between him and his intended victim, when he—the man who had so injured him, and whom he had for years past sought, was so completely in his power. And though he would sometimes check his half audible, half incoherent ravings, with the thought that it was a woman and a wife, as good and as loving as his own beautiful lost one had been, who had stayed his uplifted hand, he would whisper fearfully:
               "But it will be well for her and for me, too, if I never see her face again!"
               And yet, the next spring, on the eve of Holy Thursday, the same boat came down again to The Sands.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               BRENDICE.
               THE name of the other family whose permanent home was in one of the little fish-houses on The Sands, was, it has already been said, Du Bois.
               It consisted of but two persons.
               They had come to the neighborhood on the fourth year after the Maitlands had first arrived at The Sands; the spring following Mr. Maitland's mysterious disappearance.
               They were a man of from twenty-eight to thirty years of age, though a careless observer might have called him twenty years older, and a child of three or four.
               The man was not only a stranger in the vicinity, but, it was conjectured, had very recently arrived in the country, though nothing definite could be ascertained respecting him. He seemed in feeble health, and, judging from the dress and habits of himself and child, was in such destitute circumstances, that Mrs. Brown—the hostess of the Beach House, whose husband was one of the "selectmen" of the town—had scarcely got Mrs. Maitland and her little boy off her mind, before she began to fear that it would soon be necessary to take the new comers to the almshouse.
               She was as much mistaken, however, in this case, as she had been in that of her boarders, for the stranger had rejected some slight offer of assistance which had been made him on his first arrival in the neighborhood, in such a manner that it was not repeated; and he very soon showed that he was abundantly able to take care of himself.
               The symptoms of physical weakness which he manifested, were, it was observed, after a time, only apparent in his moments, or rather hours of mental abstraction.
               Then the tall and delicate, but full-chested and very erect figure was bowed and sunken, and the shoulders stood out prominently as the hands folded themselves weakly over the breast; a pallor as from long-endured suffering was seen on the browned cheek; the face was elongated, and the dark, keen, restless eyes had almost the fixedness and glassiness of death.
               But no fisherman in the neighborhood handled an oar or managed a boat with such strength and dexterity as did he, and it was astonishing how soon he learned where the best fishing grounds were, and what good luck he had, both in the taking and in the disposal of his fish. Neither his success, however, nor his manner, which was exceedingly brusque and unsocial, prejudiced the people into whose neighborhood he had come, against him, as they most likely would have done, but for an event which occurred soon after his arrival there.
               This was the fortunate rescue of an old fisherman and his grandson from drowning, at the imminent peril of his own life, the fracture of an arm, and the loss of his boat, the purchase of which had just been made; and though the sum paid for it had taken every cent which the man had at his command, he yet positively refused to accept even the free loan of another until he was able to buy again.
               But Du Bois was not liked in the little community, especially by the female portion of it, on account of his apparent want of affection for and his neglect of his child, the little creature seeming to be almost entirely uncared for by him; and for the manner in which their earnest and persistent efforts to do something for her, were rejected by her father.
               He had taken up his residence at The Sands, immediately on his arrival there, having hired, for the season, the little fish-house, which he afterwards purchased. Here the child, whose name was Brendice, would be left, for long hours together, and frequently for the whole night, alone; hiding herself in the dwelling when she saw any stranger approaching it; and, when no one was near, climbing with bare feet to the top of the highest boulder of the ledge and standing there quite motionless, with the little hands clasped tightly on her breast, would look away out on the ocean.
               A queer, elfish-looking, little thing she was, as she stood there, her figure in full relief against the sky; the black woollen dress, which was all the wardrobe she possessed, clinging closely about her, and leaving the sun-burnt neck and shoulders, and the slim arms and ankles quite bare. Sometimes a strip of bright scarlet cloth would be wound about her head, but usually it was covered only by its mass of dark, tangled hair, from out of which looked great brown eyes, pitifully wise and solemn in their expression.
               Her features were finely-cut and regular. There was a promise of great beauty, which would surely come to her with womanhood, in her countenance; but the poor little face was dingy and brown from constant exposure to sun and wind, and it did not look, in its patient thoughtfulness, as if the smiles or tears of childhood had ever passed over it. One would scarcely have known whether to smile or weep,—most likely one would have felt inclined to do both,—while gazing at the quaint little face and figure.
               It was Mrs. Maitland who first learned her name, and she, more than any other in the neighborhood, had wished she was able to do something for the little girl, even after that night when she had seen her and her father walking up and down the beach; for Du Bois and his child were the strangers whom her eye had followed on that holy evening in May, when she was listening to the joyous peal of St. Mary's sweet-toned bell.
               She was yet in no situation to ask the man to let her have the child, for she and her little boy were still at Mrs. Brown's. A part of the time, when she could get employment at the fish-houses, they were boarders there, and a part of the time, they were servants; for Luke was a robust little fellow, somewhat inclined to be mischievous, but good-hearted, very active and industrious, and understanding remarkably well, for one of his age, how much his industry could aid his mother, to whom he was greatly attached.
               Mrs. Maitland was planning, however, all through the summer months, if her husband did not return, to get a house for herself and her boy, in the autumn. Her desire to do so was strengthened by the hope that Du Bois, who, most likely, would leave the neighborhood after the fishing season was over, would give her the child, for whom he seemed to cherish no affection.
               She was secretly glad that no one had yet been allowed to do anything for her, or had succeeded in making the little creature's acquaintance. She had never seen her near enough to distinguish her features, though often, in walking to and from her work, she had paused to watch the child, as, with swift, fearless tread, she clambered over the loose rocks, or stood, poised on some high boulder, looking away into the sea.
               Du Bois she had not chanced to obtain a glimpse of since the night following that on which he came to The Sands.
               One evening,—it was at the close of a very sultry day, late in August,—Mrs. Maitland walked over to the dwelling of the strangers. She had heard the fishermen say that Du Bois' boat had not come in.
               Just after the sun went down the weather had suddenly changed. A brisk wind was coming up from the ocean, driving before it a cold, white fog, so dense as to be almost suffocating, and wetting one through almost as quickly as would a moderate shower. It had very soon obscured the light of the stars and of the rising moon, and the beacon-lights burned more and more faintly, until they, too, seemed to go out.
               The fishermen said that the sea was running high, and the wind would be likely to increase, and one remarked that Du Bois must have taken his boat up to the Port, and that it was not probable he would attempt to return before morning.
               Mrs. Maitland thought of the lonely little girl, and wrapping a thick shawl closely about her, she stepped out unseen by any one, into the damp darkness.
               At first she feared that she would be unable to find the house she was in search of; but she groped her way determinedly along, getting more than one fall, even with her best endeavors to keep on her feet, over the wet pebbles; and was so much exhausted, when she, at length, reached the dwelling, that she waited to rest a moment before entering it.
               The door was partially open, and a faint light, made by the burning of a little strip of cloth in a dish of fish oil, was trying to send its rays over the apartment; but so feebly, that Mrs. Maitland, as she glanced into the room, failed to distinguish a single object. She could only see that a partition of rough boards had been put up within the building, cutting off about a third part of it, and from the second room, thus formed, she heard a little voice.
               She drew back quickly, and gathering her shawl up about her, began hurriedly to retrace her steps. Most likely Du Bois had returned, she supposed, or some other thoughtful person had come there, before herself, to look after the child. She had not gone the distance of two rods from the hut, however, before the same voice again reached her ear, and there was no answering tone.
               Perhaps it was only the little girl talking in her sleep, and she crept back to the door again and listened. It was only the child who was speaking, but the sound of the voice told that she was wide awake.
               "Brendice Du Bois," she was saying, with as much sternness and authority as the little creature could throw into her tones, "Brendice Du Bois, you are one bad child! Shut your eyes, and go to sleep this minute, or you will be punished severely!"
               After a moment's silence there was a little laughable attempt at a snore; and then, in a gentle, soothing, singsong tone, she uttered some French words which the listener, of course, could not understand, but which might have been a translation of—"Rockaby, baby, all on the tree top!"
               Mrs. Maitland stepped softly into the outer room, but there she paused, and her face grew white and rigid as marble, as the child, after another brief silence, again went on, now in a low and pleading, but very weary and hopeless tone:
               "Mamma, far away in the sea, when will you come for your little Brendie? She has looked for you many—very many days, dear mamma; and sometimes she sees your pretty eyes shining up out of the water, when the sun is looking down on it; and once, when the wind was coming up over the sea, she heard you whispering softly to her; but, oh! you spoke so low she could not tell what you meant.
               "It is cold and dark here, and little Brendie is all alone. She wants to be with you, sweet mamma! Oh, why did you not hold your little baby more tightly in your arms, when you went down into the deep water?"
               Mrs. Maitland heard no more. She staggered to the doorway and sank down upon the earth as soon as she had crossed the threshold. The tide was still coming in, and she knew, by the sound of the waters, that they had already overleaped their usual bounds; and a sudden wild wish passed through her mind, that a mighty wave would roll up over the ledge, and sweep her away forever from human sight.
               Whose child was that little lonely creature? and how had she been made motherless?
               The agonized woman did not consider that there was no reason why that terrible conviction which had seized her, should so fasten itself on her mind—for a conviction it was—a belief without the shadow of a doubt. She did not understand why the idea, that she had at times, during the last few years, been laboring under some mental hallucination—that the scenes which had presented themselves to her mind at the moment when the bodily eyes were closing to the objects about them, and the mental vision was waking to keener perceptions, might not be the simple, vivid recollection of real events then passed away from her mind forever. Such, however, was the fact.
               The darkness deepened over the sea, and the thick fog, though it could scarcely find its way through the many folds of the closely-woven shawl in which she had wrapped herself, soaked her straw hat through and through, bathed her colorless face, and poured heavy drops of water on her hair.
               She crept along over the ledge, so far as to be beyond the reach of that little voice, and then she crouched down, unintentionally, for her own safety and comfort were the subjects farthest from her thoughts, beside a large boulder which sheltered her completely from the chilling wind.
               Hours passed away. She did not know how they came and went. She was thinking of the petition she had uttered so many times that day, with an earnestness, she thought, she had never felt before.
               "Let Thy merciful ear, O Lord, be open to the prayers of Thy humble servants!"
               And her prayer had been that her husband might return to her and his child; for the idea that he was not still living, singularly enough, had never occurred to Mrs. Maitland; and that she soon might have charge of that little neglected girl.
               "And that they may obtain their petitions, make them to ask such things as shall please Thee!"
               Things pleasing to the God of justice! to Him who had said, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth!" and "The sins of the fathers shall be visited on the children."
               And then, through the dark waves of agony which were rolling over her, came the plea, "Through Jesus Christ, our Lord!"
               She felt herself leaning against the rock, and she thought of the sweet, comforting words:
               "A place of refuge, and a covert from storm and wind!"—"The shadow of a great rock in a weary land!"
               But they allayed not, for a single moment, the fury of the storm which was sweeping over her. The burden she felt upon her now, she dared not lay at the feet of the Lord; for Mrs. Maitland had so dearly loved her husband, so one with him had she considered herself, that his wrong doings seemed to be her own. His desertion of her and her child, she had felt to be as disgraceful to herself as it was to him; and as she sat there, in her agony, she thought that the poor hands which were so twisting about, and torturing each other, had been as guilty in lifting themselves up in anguished supplication to her husband, while he stood on the deck of the burning ship, as were his, when they let go their hold on that beautiful woman who had entrusted herself and her child to his care.
               But nature was at length exhausted, and Mrs. Maitland's head sank upon her breast, and sleep stole over her, though the roar of the ocean, sounding in her ears, was, in her dreams, the awful thunders of Sinai, and the Voice at which the mountain shook.
               When she was aroused, which was some hours after her eyes had closed in sleep, it was by a sudden, firm grasp upon her wrist, a quick lifting of the hat which partially concealed her face, and the sound of some low, muttered words, whose meaning she did not, for the first brief instant, fully comprehend.
               They were understood well enough, however, when Du Bois, for it was he, the Frenchman, whom, for the first time she had seen on the deck of the burning ship, whose face, so frightfully distorted with an agony of grief and hate, she had seen going down into the flame-lighted sea, he who had bent over her couch on the night of her husband's disappearance, lifted her to her feet, and led her swiftly away over the loose rocks, and the wide stretch of sand between them and the ocean, for the tide was now going out, not stopping even when he had reached the water's edge, but walking on, straight down into the sea.
               It was morning now. The fogs had fled away before the wind, and that was quieting itself before the approach of the sun, whose crimson beams were already shooting up from the horizon, for every breath that came up over the sea fanned more and more lightly the cold, dewy face that was turned towards it.
               "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth!"
               No doubt it was just; and the wish for death had come to her more than once, during the terrible hours of the past night; but to die there, in that bright, sweet morning, to close the eyes forever, just at the moment when all nature was looking up and waiting for the rising sun, to be struggling and gasping for breath down in those smiling waters, now rocking themselves to rest, to be crowned cold and still with those wreaths of shining, white foam!
               To die thus, and for such a cause!
               She lifted her eyes to the countenance of Du Bois.
               He was looking directly before him, far out into the sea. His face was as colorless as her own, and a cold perspiration was standing in drops on his brow. The hat had fallen from his head, and the long dark hair was hanging in thickly matted locks over his temples.
               An appeal for mercy had risen to her lips when she lifted her eyes to his countenance; but it was not uttered, for it seemed to her that a marble face could as soon relax the stern coldness of its expression as his. Yet he seemed not to be thinking particularly of the terrible deed he was just ready to commit; there was another and deeper thought than that in his mind.
               Mrs. Maitland glanced back over the beach.
               No living thing was to be seen there. It was the dawn of the Sabbath. The fishermen would not come down to their boats to-day, and the women, who usually indulged themselves in an extra half hour of sleep on Sunday morning, would eat their breakfast before opening the fish-houses, and spreading the half-dried cod upon the flakes.
               She looked away up to the hills rising in the distance in quiet, serene grandeur, and thought how fixed and secure they were—as secure in their repose as was the ocean, which was deepening around her, in its unrest.
               She glanced at the white and brown dwellings scattered over the rising grounds, here in little clusters, and there widely apart. In one of them, most likely just beginning to open his blue eyes, and brush the hair away from his face, wondering where his mother had gone, was her own little boy. He would never, she thought, see her again; and neither little Luke, nor any one else but he who was holding her wrist in that vice-like grasp, would ever know her fate.
               And then she looked back to the hut upon the rocks, where that little neglected, lonely child was so plaintively calling to the mother who would never come to her. Back over the white beach and the stretch of water which now lay between her and the dry sand, and then again up to that unchanging face which was still looking steadily far away into the sea.
               She had lately been led on slowly, but the water was now high about her. The last wave, though the step of Du Bois was still firm, towering, as he did, head and shoulders above her, had well nigh lifted her from her feet, and still he moved on; and as she looked into his face, the idea occurred to her which would have come sooner to a wiser person, that the man who had her so completely in his power, was, for the time being, at least, a maniac.
               But, with the certainty of her fate, which flashed over her as if she had not before been so terribly sure of her doom, came, in that moment of death-like agony, the withering thought that the hand which had suffered this man's fair young wife to perish, and which had robbed him of his wealth, was the hand of one in full possession of his reason.
               A wave had just dashed its spray over her face!
               Another was coming;—a great, darkly-green, mountain ridge, it seemed to her, rising higher and higher, till it quite shut out the heaven from her view.
               But not the Heaven where God abides; for all at once she began to feel strangely calm. The great distress and fear were all gone; and her stony-cold lips shaped themselves to a song of deliverance, though they gave utterance to no audible sound:
               "Thy right hand and Thy arm, and the light of Thy countenance!"
               Deliverance from death or from despair, she knew not, at first, from which it was; but soon she opened her eyes again to the blue sky above her, and then looked away towards the west, where, in the distant horizon, suddenly gleamed out a bright light—the reflection of the sun's rays just coming up over the waters—from the tall windows of St. Mary's; and the thought first came to her then, which so often occurred to her afterwards, as her eyes fell on the distant light.
               Calling all the day long to goodness, as through the hours of the night, the beacon had warned against ill.
               
               At the moment when that strange calmness came to her, she had heard a low, distant cry, and then near her a sound of bitterest cursing; and she felt herself suddenly lifted in strong arms, and they were carrying her back swiftly beyond the reach of the waves.
               Carrying her back to life! Her senses seemed forsaking her, but they were stayed, for a moment, by the repetition of that sound ringing out over the water.
               It was the clear glad cry of a happy child; and Brendice Du Bois, with her long hair flying about her head, and her little arms stretched out towards her, was struggling through the waves, exclaiming:
               "Mamma, sweet mamma! coming to your little Brendice, who has waited for you so long, mamma!"
               Mrs. Maitland felt that the hands were loosening their firm hold on her, but they did not quite relinquish their grasp; for when she next opened her eyes she was lying on her bed in her boarding-house, with her fingers clasped in the chubby hands of her little boy.
               Mrs. Brown was busied in applying restoratives to the exhausted woman, and in saying:
               "Yes, it is about a year, now, since her husband deserted her, poor thing! and I had hoped she was getting nicely over it. You don't suppose she really intended to drown herself, do you, Mr. Du Bois? How fortunate it was that you were just coming in; this is the third life you have saved since you came here! You think there is no doubt about her speedy recovery, do you?"
               Mrs. Maitland opened her eyes and looked up into those which were staring down at her, returning their earnest gaze; and in a low, beseeching tone she murmured the words:
               "And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us!"
               A gleam as of lightning flashed out from the man's eyes, though there was no look of insanity in his countenance now; and she heard his teeth grinding together.
               "The woman has not yet recovered her senses!" he said, in a very slow, measured tone.
               Mrs. Maitland knew what he meant, and her eyes closed again, as he passed out of the room.
               She never, for one brief moment, after, looked into that face.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VII.
               REVANCHE.
               SHE never had looked into that face again, though the years were passing, and though neither Du Bois nor herself had, for two days at a time, been absent from The Sands.
               The thought had frequently come to her, while the years were going by, of seeking for herself and her boy a home distant from the neighborhood, even after she and Luke had nicely fitted up for their abode the little fish-house which she had purchased the second spring after her husband's disappearance. But the fear that the Frenchman would follow her, wherever she might go, had always prevented her from doing so.
               That Du Bois had some other reason for remaining at The Sands than simply to gather from the sea the means for a livelihood for himself and his daughter, she did not doubt; and she had, sometimes, while her heart almost ceased to beat, for the terrible fear which came over her, heard the fishermen asking each other what kept that stranger—for so he was always regarded—at The Sands, when such a man as he was could find employment almost anywhere, and much lighter and far more profitable than his present pursuit.
               She had but little knowledge of human nature, and it required but little to convince her that revenge would be very unlikely to die out in the heart which exhibited its emotions in such expressions as she had seen on that countenance. His one great object in life, she was sure, was to find Mr. Maitland; and she felt that his eye was always on her, with no intent, perhaps, after that Sabbath morning when he had led her down into the sea, to injure her; but to ascertain if her husband ever sought to hold any communications with her or her son.
               Feeling that she could not escape from him, she had at length concluded to remain where she was; for her boy's sake bearing her burden, the crushing weight of which he yet knew nothing, though ten years had passed since Mr. Maitland left them, as patiently as she could; quiet, industrious, and sometimes cheerful, but with all hope, and all the freshness of life gone forever.
               Even for her son she asked nothing from Heaven but that the knowledge of his father's crime might never be revealed to him, that he might grow up to be a good man, and contented with his lot in life.
               Luke had never manifested any inclination to go away from his mother, or to seek any other employment than that to which she was bringing him up.
               Of his absent parent, memory of whom seemed to have faded away very quickly from his mind, though he was six years old when his father had left The Sands, he had not questioned his mother for several years past, for he had learned, very early, that such inquiries annoyed her, and Luke was a loving, tender son. He was sixteen now, but he had heard very little of his father; and he was as ignorant of what his mother was acquainted with respecting Du Bois and his daughter, as were any of his young companions, who occasionally tried to make themselves merry at the expense of the little Brendice.
               The girl was now in her fourteenth year, but she was so small in stature that those of her own age were accustomed to regard her as some years younger.
               The ten years which had elapsed since her coming to The Sands had produced very little change in her appearance. It was, in the extreme, ludicrous or pitiful still, as in her queer, scanty dress, she ran, with fleet, firm feet, over the rocks, or stood poised upon a high boulder, looking away into the sea.
               Mischievous, as he naturally was, Luke had never joined his mates in their attempts to annoy the child.
               His mother's strict command that he should never have anything to do with the Frenchman and his daughter, that he should never go to their dwelling, never suffer his boat, while out upon the water, to approach that of Du Bois, and never to speak to him unless he was first addressed, had been laid upon him at a very early age; and he had disobeyed her in that no more than he had in any other respect.
               But at a distance, the boy would sometimes watch the movements, and listen to the voices of the thoughtless children, when a dozen or more of them came down to the beach after their hot dusty walk from school, in their bathing dresses, for a splash in the water; or collected together when the young girls' work in the fish-houses was ended for the day, as they attempted to have some fun with the little French girl; and his laugh often rang out loud and clear at the complete discomfiture of the whole party.
               The showers of sand and sea-shells, and sometimes handfuls of pebbles, when the children would get angry at their want of success in attempting to "scare the little crow from her perch," as Miss Emma Brown, usually the leader in the sport, called it, fell around her, apparently as unheeded as did the salt spray which the waves tossed to her feet. Their jeers and hootings never moved her from the spot where she stood, or directed her gaze to the noisy little crew; and the fleetest among them always failed to overtake her when she was bounding over the rocks.
               Nor had Luke ever joined them in their endeavors, which were very infrequent, and alike disregarded by her, to be on friendly terms with the girl, any more than he had in their attempts to annoy the friendless child, though he was usually the ringleader in all their little affairs. Many a time, however, when their play had become too serious, had the boys returned with tingling ears, and the girls, particularly Miss Emma Brown, with red eyes and inflamed cheeks, to their homes; for young Maitland's arm was swift and strong, and his pleasant voice could utter very bitter and cutting words.
               But although Luke's mother seemed to be so very averse to holding any intercourse with the Frenchman and his daughter, the wish was always with her that she could do something for the girl.
               At her first identification of Du Bois and his child with those whom her husband had so fearfully wronged, the desire passed from her mind. She then only wished that she could put the universe between herself and them. After a time, however, she began to feel that there was a distinction between herself and her husband; that his guilt could not attach itself to her; and then the desire to do something for Brendice came back again, and with such strength that many and many a time, as she had looked upon the girl, uncared for, apparently, by any human being, for as she had grown older it seemed just as much the wish of Brendice as it did that of her father, to hold no intercourse with the people among whom they had come to live, she thought she must try to break the terrible barrier which separated her from this friendless girl, and take her to her heart, and care for her, as never a mother cared for her own child.
               Perhaps even at the risk of the revelation by Du Bois of his father's crime, to Luke, she would have done so when she saw that Brendice's youth was likely to be as much neglected as her childhood had been, but for an event which happened when the girl was in her fourteenth year; an event which Mrs. Maitland would have thought might partially close up the wide gulf between the two families, but which, instead of narrowing the chasm between them, seemed to render it entirely bottomless.
               This was the rescue of the young girl from a watery grave, by Luke Maitland.
               It had been a sweet, cool day in early autumn, but a very sad and lonely one to the girl; for Brendice Du Bois had not readily and willingly accepted her bitter lot. When a very little child, she had striven, instinctively, to win her father's affection by sweet smiles, by loving words, and attempted caresses. Later, she had endeavored to overcome his repugnance to herself by a swift obedience to all his requirements; and, finally, she had sought to gain his respect.
               All her attempts, however, had been alike unsuccessful; and that day, in early autumn, she had knelt before him, and with clasped hands and streaming eyes had asked him if their existence must always be what it then was, if there might not be for them a better life than that they were now enduring?
               She had been standing upon the rocks, looking away into the sea, her eyes filled with tears at the conviction, which reason, years before, had forced upon her—that the mother for whose return to her she had so long watched and waited, could never come, though the habit of watching there would not be broken, and she daily tried to cheat herself into the belief that she was watching and waiting still.
               As she stood on the rocks looking out upon the water, seeing the shadows of the cliff and the ledge stretching out farther and farther over the in-coming waves, she heard glad voices and merry laughter coming down the beach, and soon two young children, sweet, blue-eyed, cherry-cheeked and golden-haired little girls, very simply but prettily attired, came bounding over the sands, breathless in their eagerness to find the white shells along the beach, and roguishly seeking to despoil each other of the gathered treasures.
               Following them at a little distance was a man approaching middle life, who apparently enjoyed their sport as much as if he were still himself a child; now clapping his hands to hasten the flying feet, now joining in the triumphant laugh, and now flinging to the despoiled and lagging one such a strange and bright-hued shell, probably tossed up by the waves on a far distant shore, that the little eyes grew round with wonder and delight.
               Suddenly the children's voices were hushed, and they paused in their play, and each turned her face towards the north, whence, faintly stealing through the quiet air, came the sound of a distant bell; no doubt to them a very familiar sound, but strangely sweet and holy it seemed, heard here.
               Perhaps it reminded the children of the color of the ribbon with which their little frocks were trimmed, and the wide band about their father's hat; and they walked towards him, each putting a hand in his, and lifting a rosy, but sobered little mouth for a loving kiss; and then the three walked slowly along the beach below the ledge where Brendice had now dropped down.
               A stray breeze, filled with lingering summer sweets, came over from the green wooded hills, and away in the east a bright rainbow was spanning the horizon.
               While listening to the distant bell, feeling the soft air upon her cheek, and gazing alternately on those advancing figures, and that bow of promise, seemingly so like an angel of peace, that sought to gather the whole world into its loving embrace, emotions such as she had never experienced before filled the soul of the poor girl, as she crouched there upon the ledge; and the strange thoughts deepened as the words of the children and their father fell on her ear.
               He was saying: "It is St. Michael and All Angels' day, my darlings; and there is service at church. A very sweet day for us! Do you know the collect, Ellen?"
               "Yes, dear, papa!" one little voice replied; and the child drew her fingers from her father's clasp, and folding her hands and bowing her head, said, very reverently:
               "Oh, everlasting God! who hast ordained and constituted the services of Angels and men in a wonderful order, mercifully grant that as Thy holy Angels always do Thee service in Heaven, so, by Thy appointment, they may succor and defend us on earth, through Jesus Christ our Lord!"
               And then the other child asked quickly:
               "Does 'succor and defend' mean just the same as take care of, father?"
               "Yes, my dear!"
               "Well, mamma is an angel now, is she not? And can she not take care of us, just as she used to, only more and better care now, because she sees and knows more—you said, father—than when she was alive? And if Ellen and I say the collect every day, and try very hard to be good, wont she always be near to succor and defend us?"
               "I think it is not wrong for us to believe so," said her father, solemnly; and then they passed on.
               When the strangers, who were boarders at the hotel, had gone to a little distance, Brendice rose up from the ledge and hastened over the rocks, down to her home, which her father had just entered; and then she knelt before him, and asked him, as he had given her life, to bless that life with his kindness and his love.
               And he had only laughed! and such a bitter, mocking laugh it was, that for a moment the girl seemed half maddened. She rushed back to the ledge, and though the tide was now coming in, ran to the extreme point of a low rock which jutted far out upon the beach, and flung herself down there, weeping as she had never, in her life, wept before.
               Exhausted by her sense of loneliness and her grief, and unobservant of the rising tide, she at length fell into a most profound sleep, and when she awoke again, the water was so high about her that in a few minutes more that unblest life would have been ended forever.
               But two young lads, nearing the shore with their fishing-boat, had seen her peril; and Luke Maitland, leaving the boat to his companion's care, sprang into the water, and catching the fainting girl just as the wave swept her from her footing, bore her safely to land, and carried her in his arms, for he was a strong, active boy, and she a little, light thing, to her father's dwelling.
               Du Bois was standing in his doorway as Luke came up with the exhausted girl, and the boy observed that he drew back a step at his approach, as if to make room for him to enter the hut. But what happened afterwards, he never described to his mother.
               He would have found it difficult to do so, fully, for the words which passed between the man and his daughter, whose energies suddenly returned to her when she caught sight of her father's face, had, with the exception of a single unfinished sentence uttered by Du Bois, been in French; and besides, he was not disposed, he could not himself really understand why, to speak of what he did comprehend.
               The generous-hearted boy, attaching no value, as far as he was concerned, to what he had done, had never felt so happy in his life as at the moment when he perceived the girl's half-closed eyes opening wide, a faint color coming into the thin, white cheek, and strength returning to that nerveless form. And when, to his consternation, he saw Du Bois spring towards his daughter as her feet touched the floor, and uttering that one sentence in English, strike at her with the heavy stick he had caught up, Luke rushed between them, and received the sharp blow intended for her, on his uncovered arms.
               "Wretch!" the father had said to his child, "you came between me and your mother's life; and this is the second time you have thrust yourself"——
               And then he added some words in a language unknown to the boy, but with great vehemence, and so rapidly that it seemed strange to him any one could understand them. The girl, however, who had appeared surprised at his attempted violence, but not at his anger, knew what he meant, and when he had ceased speaking, she several times repeated, very slowly and distinctly, one word he had most emphatically uttered.
               Luke never forgot that word, "Revanche!" and when Brendice turned and looked on the countenance of her deliverer, the expression of her features revealed, plainly enough, its bitter meaning.
               He did not smile then, nor did he do so afterwards—it was too pitiful a sight for ridicule,—when he remembered how the burning hate and the strong desire for revenge came out on that little pinched face, still wet with the salt water dripping from her hair; and how the little, puny arm, lately so lifeless, was held out menacingly towards him.
               Luke did not tell his mother this. He knew there was something wrong between the two families, but had never asked what it was. She was certain, however, that more than the saving of a life had happened, when her son returned to her, and young Jones, who had been his companion in the fishing-boat, and had come up to the door just as Luke entered it, was describing to Mrs. Maitland what he had intended entirely to conceal; but she forbore asking him any questions in relation to the affair.
               She did not even inquire how those ridges, which it was strange were not fractures, came on his arms—he had made no reply when his companion asked about them—for question on her part might lead to inquiries on his. She thought those blows must have been accidentally inflicted, or he would not be standing there, with two pairs of eyes upon him, so quietly bathing his arms in water, for Luke always swiftly repaid, and with heavy interest, any kindness or injury done him, and he was neither glad nor repentant, now.
               Something had happened, she was certain; for after young Jones had gone out, the lad made some remark, more to himself than to his mother, however, and not rightly understood by her, which convinced her, though mistakenly, that if all other impediments to the execution of her cherished plan in regard to Brendice Du Bois could be removed, the opposition of her son could never be overcome. And so the hope of ever being able to do anything for the girl, died in her heart, at the hour when Luke had saved her life.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               ON THE CLIFF.
               UPON Mrs. Maitland's dead hope no earth, however, had yet fallen, and her grief over it was kept fresh by the secretly dropping tears, till the wish was again brought back to life.
               It was resuscitated by the bitter, heavy dews which have fallen on so many parched, stony and thorny places, where the hand of the great Sower has seemed to the dim, human vision, to have scattered His good seed again and again in vain; and the wilderness and the solitary places have, at length, been glad for them, and the desert has rejoiced and blossomed like the rose. Those bitter dews which in the darkness have germinated the seeds, forced asunder the flinty rocks that the roots might strike out wide and deep, and though weighing so heavily upon the feeble plume that it could hardly release the struggling leaflet from its embrace, yet imparting, themselves, the strength they seemed to be taking away;—the bitter dews of tribulation which have ripened to golden plenteousness, the richest fruits gathered into the garner of our God!
               
               By what seemed good for food, and was pleasant to the eyes, and to be desired to make one wise, "came death into the world, and all our woes;" but through a sorrow which man has beheld, and saw that there was no sorrow like unto it, our great redemption came.
               One summer afternoon five years after the occurrence of the event recounted in the preceding chapter, Mrs. Maitland was walking slowly up the cliff near whose summit there was now a well of pure fresh water. The well had been dug by the present proprietor of the Ocean House—the building she had once supposed was to be her home.
               With the addition which had been made to it, it was a fine hotel now, and was so well patronized, that though it was still early, the rooms were all engaged for the season, and some of them already occupied; and pleasure parties were coming in from the adjacent towns very frequently to spend the day.
               A party had come down to The Sands that morning. Young gentlemen and ladies, the most of them were, though one gentleman was quite advanced in life.
               Their destination had been The Rocks; but the day did not prove to be very fine, and the pleasure boats they had expected from the Port, from which place some members of the party had come, did not make their appearance; and all of the ladies and most of the men were very willing to remain where they were. A few of the young men, however, hired a fishing-boat, and went over to the islands.
               The boat belonged to Du Bois. It was a large, nice one, and he had lately purchased it. He was just pushing off from the shore with it himself, for the first time, when the young men in search of a boat came down to the beach. The other fishermen had all gone out, earlier in the morning, and no other boat was to be had.
               It seemed at first quite impossible to hire this, for the Frenchman had made up his mind that he would go out with it, though he had been quite ill for some days past. Even now, he was so unwell that his daughter, looking after him, as he went silently out of the house, and walked down the beach, and began to loosen the boat from the fastenings, wished that he would remain on shore that day, or that there was some one to go with him. She herself understood very well how to manage a boat, but she did not offer to accompany her father.
               She knew by repeated experiences how such an offer would be regarded by him, for not only was the strange man always savagely averse to receiving assistance in any of his labors from his daughter, but even her presence, usually, seemed well nigh intolerable to him. But he was all that Brendice had in the world, and though, since her earliest recollection, she had received from him only the coldest and most neglectful treatment, the glimpse of a better life than her present hard and comfortless one, having flashed across her mind only to fade like a meteor in the evening sky, there was never an unfilial feeling in her heart towards him; though perhaps the emotions of pleasure and pain, experienced on his account, were not so exquisite as that outwardly unimpassioned nature was capable of suffering and enjoying.
               As she looked after him from the cabin doorway, she perceived that, at the close of a long parley with the strangers who had come down the beach, her father quitted his boat and allowed the young men to step into it, and push it off from the shore; and she checked the half sigh which would have escaped her at the prospect of having him at home all day. He had been unusually severe towards her for a week or two past, and her household cares would keep her within doors through many hot, wearying hours; but she resolutely, or rather hopelessly, checked the rising sigh, and resumed her employment.
               Du Bois, however, did not return to the dwelling.
               An hour passed away, and then another, but he did not come in to take up his unfinished work, still lying upon the floor where he had left it—the mending of some fishing tackle.
               Brendice was listening, momentarily, for the sound of his footfall; but at length, while wondering at his prolonged absence, a thought suddenly flashed through her mind, and she dropped her work and ran swiftly to the spot where he always kept his boat.
               Her fears were realized.
               The old boat was gone, and the fishing-tackle too, which had been thrown out of the new boat when the young strangers had persuaded Du Bois to give them the use of it for the day. She climbed up the ledge, and looked away to the east, where several little white specks were shining in the checkering sunlight.
               Neither of them was her father's old boat, for he had taken the sail out of it, as it was not suitable for further use. The old boat had been in a bad condition for some time, quite beyond repair; and he had lost his fish, and well nigh his life, the last time he had gone out in it.
               His efforts to save himself and the boat had caused the sickness from which he had been suffering the past few days, and from which he was not yet entirely restored; and the right arm which was fractured some years before, in the successful attempt to save two human lives, had not recovered from the severe strain it had just now received.
               If that arm had been well, Brendice would have had no fear for his safety, for her father was an uncommonly expert swimmer; but now she looked anxiously over the water, very glad to see so many sails dotting its surface, and trying to believe that he would not venture far from the shore.
               It was some hours later—in fact the day was near its close—when, as has been already remarked, Mrs. Maitland, carrying a small pail on her arm, was slowly walking up the cliff in the direction of the well near its summit.
               She was not very strong now. Her strength had seemed to be failing in proportion as the necessity for exertion diminished.
               As she walked along, very conscious of her feebleness, she thought that Luke would need her but a little longer now; and chided herself that she was not more thankful to Heaven for the blessing of his love and care, and for the assurance, which was strong within her, that he would never leave her as long as she lived.
               He was an active and expert fisherman now. He had begun to handle an oar at an early age; and he had grown up, seemingly perfectly satisfied with his occupation.
               Before a long time had passed, his mother thought,—for Luke had just completed his twenty-first year,—he would marry Miss Emma Brown, the daughter of Mrs. Maitland's former landlady.
               He and Emma had been good friends from early childhood, notwithstanding the many severe reproofs she had received from him. The young girl would come into possession of some little property when she was married, and Luke would have nothing aside from his mother's home but his boat, his fine form, his pleasant, frank, sun-burnt face, and strong, sinewy arms. The Browns would have no objection to the match, however; at least, one of them, most decidedly, would not.
               Everybody liked Luke Maitland.
               And when he and Emma were settled down together in life, his mother thought she would feel that there was nothing more for her to ask of Heaven, than that she might pass away quietly and peacefully from earth.
               Luke had gone out early that morning, and it was time now that the boats were in; and she had come up the cliff for a pail of fresh water that a cup of tea might be ready for him as soon as his fish were on shore.
               She set her pail down beside the well, and looked down over the beach. The boats had come in, and the fishermen were unloading them.
               The young women and girls at the houses who had been hurrying to get their half-dried fish under the shelter of the roofs, had run down to assist the men, for there were dark clouds, heavily overlapping each other, here and there streaked with white drifts, coming up slowly from the south, though the wind was blowing from another quarter of the heavens, in little fitful gusts.
               It was a pleasant sight which met her eyes as she looked down on the shore, up which, higher and higher, came the foamy waters, and sweet, mirthful sounds fell on her ear. The sounds came from the boats which were now nearly empted of the fish; from the groups of handsomely dressed people scattered about over the beach, the young girls, many of them, in snowy white frocks and pretty broad-brimmed hats with long, bright-colored ribbons, busily gathering bunches of dried alga, to which the white sand was clinging,—to be shaped, by-and-by, into pretty ornaments,—and searching among the rocks for shells and variously tinted pebbles; from the inmates of the carriages rolling over the hard sand just above the water's edge; and mingling with the voices and the laughter and the sounds of the ocean, came from one of the upper windows of the hotel, as an accompaniment, a sweet, soft strain, from a rich-toned instrument, touched by a skilful hand.
               The coaches which had brought down the people to The Sands that morning had driven around to the front of the hotel. The horses were impatiently pawing the ground, and champing their bits; and the people, desirous of hastening their departure a little in consequence of the clouds in the south, were anxiously waiting the return of their companions who had gone over to The Rocks.
               They had promised to be back at an earlier hour than this; but they were coming now. The white sail neared the shore, yet the young men did not return the merry greetings which reached them.
               Mrs. Maitland recognized Du Bois' new boat.
               One of the fish-women had told her, a few hours before, that the Frenchman had lent his boat to some young men from the hotel, and had, very foolishly, gone out fishing, himself, in his old one.
               The woman did not believe he could keep the boat afloat. It had not been repaired since he came so near losing his life in it.
               She drew a small glass from her pocket, one which she frequently took with her up the cliff when Luke was out on the water, and looked down to the boats.
               Du Bois had not come in, and Luke's boat was not there, either; and she wondered why, when the young men, who had been over to The Rocks, stepped on shore, the fishermen had left their work and collected about them. Brendice Du Bois was walking hastily towards them too, and the fishermen were moving away as she approached.
               Poor Brendice! It was easy enough, even at the distance, to see that it was she, and not one of the other fish-girls. It was not strange she was there. She had gone down, in the absence of her father, to see that the boat was properly secured, and to receive the pay for its use.
               Mrs. Maitland hoped nothing had happened to Du Bois, and she turned her glass to the water to look for him.
               Nothing was to be seen there, only away on the horizon, a large ship, outward-bound, with her canvass all spread, and a fishing schooner anchored near The Rocks; but then her glass was a small one, and the sea was not very smooth. He might be near, although she did not perceive his boat. Most likely he would soon be in.
               As for Luke, she remembered now that he had been talking, for some days past, of going up to The Port, for what purpose he had not told her. Most likely, she thought, it was to purchase something for her.
               Undoubtedly he had gone that day, and without telling her, in order that the surprise in store for her might be the greater; for Luke, manly enough in his intercourse with other people, and very far from being rude and awkward, was, to his mother, nothing but a great boy still.
               Had he merely been out fishing, she reasoned, he would have returned before this time, for Luke's boat always touched the beach before that of any other fisherman; and she looked away towards the north, now, to watch for his coming.
               The young men had gone up to the hotel and joined their party, and now the coaches were driving rapidly away. One of the party had remained behind—the old gentleman before referred to.
               He had not come down to The Sands that morning with the intention of stopping there; but the sad and surprising intelligence brought up by the young men, from the water' caused him to change his plans.
               The strangers had all left the beach, for the supper hour at the Ocean House had arrived.
               The fish had been brought up to the sheds, to be cared for by the women, and the men, all but two, had gone to their houses. The two who remained behind were William Jones and one of the Browns.
               Young Brown had run up to his father's house, and brought down a good-sized spy-glass, and now the young men stood on the ledge, and looked out over the sea. That was not strange, however, as the boy was very proud of his glass, and was always handling it.
               If Brendice Du Bois had been there, too, on the ledge, looking oceanward, it might have been supposed some anxiety was felt for her father's safety; but the girl, after seeing that the new boat was in a place of safety, had walked directly to her home, and no one but the two young fishermen were in sight; and now they put up their glass, and turned away, with seeming reluctance, from the rocks.
               Luke's boat must be in sight very soon, his mother thought, for the sun was now almost down.
               He would be sure to leave N—— early enough to reach home before it was quite nightfall, for the evening would be a moonless one, and the sky had been all day partially obscured by clouds.
               There was another reason why the young fisherman should have hastened his return, which his mother, though she had always lived by the sea, did not perceive.
               The coming night would be a very wild and fearful one, for a terrible tempest had wrapped itself up in that dark sheet that stretched along the southern horizon.
               It was, slowly enough now, opening its heavy folds, but the wind would soon shake out its plaitings, and hang it like a dark pall over the sky. The wind was from the north now, gusty, but not veering.
               Luke's light boat would glide swiftly over the water.
               When he came near the cliff, he would be sure to turn his pleasant face upward to see if his mother was watching for him, and she was glad she had happened to put on, that afternoon, the dress he liked best.
               A very plain and inexpensive one it was; but the pretty delicate purple muslin, with the little frilling of the same material about the neck and wrists, was very becoming to the fragile form, and the all too fair face. And well suited to the heavy braids of golden brown hair,—for she had laid aside her simple bonnet now that the sun was down, and the strangers had all gone to the beach,—was the dainty little white lace cap, trimmed with pale pink ribbons, which Luke had brought home to her on the day he was twenty-one.
               She was an old woman now, he had told her, and he placed her before their little mirror, and stood beside her, that she might see what an ancient face it was, compared with his; and then he had laughed and kissed her, and said that no one could be made to believe she was not his younger sister.
               He never dreamed what made his mother, sometimes, so strangely fair, nor why that deep rose tint came to the usually pale face. She did not tell him of the dark shadow which was always following her, sometimes with slower, and sometimes with more rapid strides, but ever drawing nearer and nearer.
               She was silent only for his sake, however. The great change would not be an unwelcome one to her. She was so weary; only thirty-eight yet, but oh, so very weary!
               Dear Luke! she wished he would come. It was a little strange that his boat was not in sight yet, but of course he would be there soon. She would watch a few minutes longer, and then go home and prepare supper.
               How cheerful her room should look when he came in; as if it did not always look so! the clean floor scattered over with white sand, the fire-place filled with fresh balsamic spruce boughs and sweet ferns, which Luke had gone among the hills to bring home to his mother; the windows curtained with blossoming rose trees, and dark-leaved, hardy vines, growing in the boxes of earth placed beneath them; and the sea-shells, arranged upon the mantle shelf, filled with soft mosses.
               The table was already spread; nothing was to be done but place upon it the viands she had cooked exactly to his liking, and to make a cup of tea for him.
               She picked up her bonnet and rose to go.
               How very still it was!
               The wind had ceased. The tide was washing the ledge now, but the water whispered in strangely soft, melancholy cadences;—how like that whispering seemed to a smothered wail! And what was that sound vibrating through the still air, that fell so sweetly upon the ear, and yet told of tears dropping upon the face of the dead, and of farewells murmured above the closing grave? One, two, three!
               
               Was St. Mary's bell counting the years of a life just ended?
               Mrs. Maitland found herself numbering the throbs which seemed to her so like the beatings of an anguished human heart.
               
                  Twenty-one!
               
               Her own heart stood still when that distant tolling ceased, and a low cry of agony rose to her lips; but it was not uttered, for her strength failed her, and she sank down upon the earth.
               She did not faint, however, for at that instant a swift breeze swept over her; a vivid flash of lightning gleamed into her eyes; and what aroused her more than these, was the sound of a deep-drawn breath close beside her. She had heard it some time before, but had given it no thought, it was so like a whispering of the wind, and she had been thinking so earnestly about Luke, and looking into the north for his coming. That momentary weakness passed away; but, from a strange, undefined fear which came with returning strength, she hesitated at once to lift her head.
               Who could have come up the sandy and pebbly cliff so lightly that she had not heard the footfall? and why had he loitered there so long without addressing her? for shy and reserved as Mrs. Maitland had always been, ever since the great grief had fallen upon her, avoiding all intercourse, even with her nearest neighbors, except at those times—years ago they were now—when she had sought employment from them, she was very kindly and pleasantly regarded by all who knew her.
               The desertion of her husband was made to account for the great change which had taken place in the formerly light-hearted, happy woman; and there was not a person at The Sands, with the exception of Du Bois and his daughter, between whom and herself there was a mutual avoidance, who ever failed to meet her with a friendly smile, and a word of cordial greeting.
               Perhaps it was some stranger from the Ocean House. But how could he have come there, without attracting her attention? And how singular it was that any one should have remained beside her in silence for so long a time as she knew the person must have been there!
               
               She thought of her husband; but it could not be he, for surely Heaven must have heard that prayer which had, so many times, been on her lips, which had always been in her heart since the certainty of his crime had been impressed upon her. He would not return!
               Had Du Bois crept up there behind her, softly, with murder in his heart, waiting for the coming darkness, and the rising tide, to fling her from the height down into the ocean?
               She smiled at herself for her fear, and wondered, too, how she could have been so disturbed by the sound of that distant bell; and turned to see who it was so near her that the deep-drawn breathings fell so plainly on her ear.
               Brendice Du Bois!
               The bare feet had come up lightly over the pebbles and the dry, crisp grass; and so absorbed did the girl seem to be with her own thoughts, as she stood there beside the wellcurb, but not leaning against it, that though within three yards of the spot where Mrs. Maitland sat, she might have been supposed to be unaware of the woman's presence.
               Also watching! but not looking towards the north.
               Her eyes alternately ran along the waters rising higher and higher up the ledge, and fastened themselves on the thick cloud which, urged on by the now increasing wind, was moving heavily up from the south; and sometimes glanced oceanward to the line along the horizon where the Convoy light was burning brightly against the dark sky.
               But for that labored breathing, the motion of the eyes, and the slight turning of the head, the girl might have been taken for a statue.
               Mrs. Maitland's hands were clasped closely against her heart, for it began to beat wildly, as she gazed on that face and figure. She had never been so near the girl before, never near enough to distinguish plainly her features, though numberless times she had watched her as she had stood, in the same attitude, in the same clothes in which she was now standing.
               The short, scanty dress clinging closely to the body; the right foot advanced, and the left resting on the naked toes; the bare arms pressed tightly to her sides, and the hands clutching each other; the head and shoulders thrown forward, and the eyes gazing so fixedly and untiringly out upon the ocean.
               Mrs. Maitland, as she gazed at her features, perceived that there was a wonderful likeness between them and those of the beautiful woman she had seen on the deck of the burning ship, on that terrible night, nineteen years ago.
               Here was the same full, broad forehead, and arching eyebrows, the straight, handsome nose, and rounded chin, and the intellectual cast of the whole face. But this countenance wore an immobility which that could never assume.
               Even the dark eyes, in whose depths one might have thought the fiercest passions were but lightly slumbering, had in them only a look of wearied hopelessness, and the fine teeth, from habit alone, held the nether lip imprisoned between them.
               It was sad to look on that young face, which really was very beautiful now, and observe how little the girl cared for her appearance.
               The dress was ragged, as well as soiled, and the face and hands as dingy as they were sun-burnt, and the thick, wavy locks, though the style of dressing the hair, at the time, was to brush it smoothly over the temples and ears, and gather it into twists or braids low in the neck, had been, unaided, it would seem, by a comb, drawn back tightly from her brow, and piled upon the top of her head, a single little knot on either side of the forehead, being rolled up closely to the roots of the hair, and fastened with a brass pin.
               Poor Brendice! She was no longer now ridiculed as before. The indifference which she had always manifested,—but which the keenly sensitive girl had never felt, for the treatment she often experienced,—had wearied those who sought to annoy her; and they who gave her most thought now (two only excepted) regarded her with but a careless pity, thinking that nature had done so little for her, it was not strange her father wished to keep her, as he appeared to do, from all companionship.
               Even Mrs. Maitland, who, strangely enough, did not entertain the same opinion of Brendice that the other neighbors did, and feeling, as she had glanced into her countenance, that the girl, instead of being possessed of feeble intellect, had capacities of no common order—even she, as she sat there upon the cliff, knowing that Brendice was looking for the father who might never return, only felt very sorry for her, and wished that she had moved away from the spot before the coming of the girl.
               Luke would return, very soon, now, certainly; and his supper must be ready; but somehow she did not feel as if she could walk away towards her pleasant home, followed by the eyes of her who so much resembled the beautiful woman on the ill-fated ship; and she crouched still lower to the earth.
               The night was now rapidly setting in, hastened by the coming storm. The waves tossed their spray far up over the rocks, and the roll of the distant thunder blended with the deepening voice of the ocean.
               She was looking away, again, towards the north, but now nothing could be seen distinctly, except when the vivid lightning flashed across the sky. But she would know when he was coming, for Luke, who had a very deep, sonorous voice, often sang some merry boat song when he was handling his oars.
               He must have taken down his sail before now, for the wind was blowing very furiously, and—
               There was a sound of voices coming up from the water's edge, at the instant, and the grating of a boat against the rocks, and those who were hauling it in were saying that it was the old boat belonging to the Frenchman, who had gone out with it, just before noonday.
               Mrs. Maitland turned her eyes towards the spot where Brendice had been standing, and waited for the lightning. It came very soon, and, with a crash which seemed to shake the earth, more brightly than before, and sporting longer among the dark, rolling clouds, which changed, as if by a magic touch, into tossing billows of brightest flame.
               The girl had altered her position, and was kneeling, now, close to the sharp edge of the precipitous cliff, with her arms crossed upon her breast. Her head was bent forward, as if to listen, and her eyes—there was no lack of expression in them now—were lifted towards Heaven, but less in supplication, Mrs. Maitland thought, than in defiant despair.
               But prayer did arise from that spot, from moving, though noiseless lips; such entreating prayer, as would, one might have thought, have set the gates of heaven ajar.
               "We beseech Thee mercifully to hear us; and grant that we—may, by Thy mighty aid, be defended and comforted in all dangers and adversities!"
               The agonized woman thought not of herself nor her son, though Luke's voice was not among those coming up from the water's edge, and though the men were coupling his name with that of Du Bois; but of that poor girl now, doubtless, orphaned.
               The louder peal of thunder ceased, and the voices of the fishermen were more distinctly heard; and at length words fell on her ear which recalled her thoughts to herself and her son, and the moving lips seemed changed to ice, and she wondered if there was a heaven above, and a God of mercy there. This was what she heard in disjointed sentences:
               The young men who went out in Du Bois' boat had carried too much wine with them; and some of them, those who knew best how to manage a boat, had partaken of it so freely that their companions were afraid to trust it to their care, and therefore they had hired Luke Maitland, with whom one of them had a slight acquaintance, and who had been fishing near the islands, to take it back.
               He had seemed very unwilling to do so, because it belonged to Du Bois. He and the Frenchman, who also had been over to The Rocks that day, had had some difficulty, though it was not known what the trouble was.
               As Du Bois, however, had been gone some hours, and the young men were so very anxious to return to their friends at the hotel, he had finally consented to go with them, taking his own boat in tow.
               Half the distance to The Sands, or less, had been made, when they came upon Du Bois, in his old crazy boat, which he was, with the greatest difficulty, just managing to keep afloat. The young men shouted to him to come on board with themselves, and Luke ran alongside as if to take him in, but when the Frenchman, who seemed very willing to do so, and was rising to his feet, perceived that young Maitland was on board, he drew back suddenly, and fell on the side of the boat, striking his arm so heavily, that when he sought to raise himself, it hung powerless by his side, and the next instant he was struggling in the water.
               Luke had run too near, they thought, at the moment, purposely so; and they were convinced that such was the fact soon after the affair was over.
               A fishing-boat, with three young men from The Rocks, had been at no great distance. The scene was witnessed by them, and when they had come up with the party from The Sands they all agreed that Maitland had meant mischief to the old man.
               One of them declared that he had heard him, two hours before, threaten to take Du Bois' life. But it seemed—the islander said very fortunately for him,—that he too had lost his own life in the attempt, for when he saw the Frenchman's danger, perhaps repenting of his intended crime, or thinking there were too many witnesses of the deed, he leaped into the water and seized the helpless, drowning man firmly by the collar of his jacket; but to the horror of the spectators, Du Bois suddenly twisted himself from the young man's fingers, and with his left hand clutched at Luke's throat; and then the water had closed over both.
               The young men had made an endeavor to save them, but a sudden flaw of wind and an awkward attempt to lower their sail, had well nigh upset their own boat, and two of them were thrown out into the water, one of them narrowly escaping death; and when their boat was righted again, and they had got their half-drowned companion on board, neither Du Bois nor Maitland were to be seen; and both their boats—though Luke's had been secured by himself—were drifting away.
               The speakers moved slowly away from the ledge now, calculating, as they went, the chances of escape from drowning for Du Bois and young Maitland, and concluding that there was not one in ten thousand that they were either still alive, or that their bodies would be washed ashore.
               The Brown boys, whose voices rose, at times, above those of the other fishermen, were very sorry for Luke; but they wished it had been his boat, instead of that old thing of Du Bois, which had drifted on shore; for undoubtedly they would have bought it of Mrs. Maitland for half its price. She would not have known its value.
               They would like to get hold of Du Bois' new boat; and one of the older men laughed and told them they had better go up and see Brendice about buying it.
               And then some one began to speak about the Frenchman and his daughter; the former, the men believed, had been insane half his time, and the latter, though one would hardly judge so by her countenance, must be of inferior intellect, though not quite the idiot she had once been called; and to express his wonder why Luke Maitland, who everybody knew was a good fellow, should want to interfere with Du Bois, as he had, undoubtedly, done, or those who had been over to The Rocks would not have thought so. The man and his daughter were not very desirable neighbors, to be sure; but then they had never troubled anybody. On the contrary, when occasion required, he had been as ready to do a good turn for any one as if he had been brought up among them.
               Another added—the speaker was the fisherman whose life the Frenchman had saved when he first came to The Sands—that Maitland, with all his good qualities, was a hot-headed fellow, and that, if he had quarrelled with Du Bois without reason, he had got no more than he deserved. But the girl would not be able to take care of herself, some one said, and he wondered what Du Bois had done with the money he must have saved during the fifteen years he had been at The Sands.
               Most likely he had invested it in the city;—no! it was interrupted, he always kept it about him, even when he went out with his boat. Then, of course, the girl would become the town's charge, poor thing!
               They rather thought Mrs. Maitland would have enough to carry her through. She would not be likely to hold up long, after this blow had fallen on her. No one, it was hoped, would tell her of the sad affair to-night.
               And then they began to talk of the approaching storm, which, though it did not promise to be long, would most likely be the heaviest that had swept over the coast for years; and wondered if the ship which had sailed out of port that day, would put back into the harbor, or attempt to keep on her course.
               Mrs. Maitland listened very attentively to all of this. Even when the fishermen had gone to such a distance that she could only hear fragmentary sentences, and then simply disjointed words, she was still listening, and conjecturing what they were yet talking about; and when the voices failed entirely to reach her ear, in thought she followed each of them to his home. They were familiar voices, and she had known who they all were.
               The young Browns had gone home to their parents and their sister; Jones, to his maiden aunt; this man to his motherless children, and that to his young wife and her babe; all to pleasant, happy homes!
               She had been looking before her, when a flash of lightning came, and she saw that Brendice Du Bois had disappeared, and she wondered, in a listless way, if the girl had gone to her home, too; or if she had fallen down the precipice, dangerously near the edge of which she had been kneeling when Mrs. Maitland looked in that direction shortly before.
               She began to feel very tired then, and thought she would rest her head, for a few moments, on the earth, and sleep. After an instant or an hour, she did not know which it was, some one came to her and raised her head, and took hold of her hand, and trying to lift her to her feet, said kindly, but very firmly:
               "Come, you must go home!"
               Mrs. Maitland asked, dreamily, but doing the best she could to raise herself from the earth, "Is it you, Emma? You are very kind. Yes, I will go home!"
               And then the two walked away silently, the woman with her aching eyes tightly closed, suffering herself to be guided entirely by her companion, who, when they had reached the dwelling, almost lifted her over the threshold, which she seemed entirely incapable herself of crossing, and fumbling about the room till she had found a couch, placed Mrs. Maitland upon it, and then went out, closing the door behind her.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IX.
               THE MIDNIGHT VISITOR.
               IT was not Miss Emma Brown who had led Mrs. Maitland home, and left her lying upon her bed alone, though she retired to no great distance from her, and occasionally returned to her side, and placed a cold, wet hand, softly on the burning brow.
               That young lady was in her chamber, soundly sleeping, except when an unusually loud peal of thunder disturbed her. Then she would arouse herself, and have another brief, but hearty fit of crying at the thought that poor Luke Maitland was dead, Luke whose wife she had expected she should become.
               He had never said anything about it, yet, to be sure; but then there was no knowing how soon he might, if he had lived. Emma was certain everybody considered her the handsomest girl in the neighborhood, and she and Luke had always been the best of friends.
               Next Sunday she was going to church, and meant to wear that pretty blue muslin, and he would not be there to see it!
               This thought brought a fresh burst of tears. Then she began to wonder how young Jones would like her new dress. Not that she cared a straw about his seeing it, for he had told her once that his maiden aunt would be an honored inmate of his house as long as she remained unmarried, and Emma was sure she would never live in the same family with old Sally Jones.
               Mrs. Maitland was very different from Sally, and Emma liked her, she thought, quite well; but she felt glad that her mother had not sent her over to spend the night with Mrs. Maitland, as she, at one time, was ready to do, satisfying herself with what the boys, who had gone past the fish-houses, on their return home from the cliff, had said, that no light was to be seen at the dwelling.
               Most likely Luke's mother had heard nothing yet about her son, but was accounting for his absence by the belief that he had gone up to the Port, as he had been talking of doing for some days past, and would remain there till the storm was over, and so had contentedly retired for the night. And then Emma put her hands over her ears, to deaden the thunder peals, and was asleep again.
               But the stricken woman thought Emma was near her, and through the long hours of that night, which was as wild and fearful as it had threatened to be, the young girl, who, partially protected from the storm by the wide projecting shelf which Luke had joined to the window-sill, for the little pots of rose-trees he had the past spring bought for his mother, had crowded down upon the open window beside which Mrs. Maitland was lying, and was listening to the words which came disconnectedly, and often incoherently, from her lips; sometimes giving them no thought, so absorbed was she in her own reflections, and sometimes receiving from them impressions which were never afterwards effaced.
               The mother did not refer to her son, all through those wretched hours, either because the fear, engendered by the words of the fishermen, when they spoke of his probable death, the fear that Luke himself had been the cause of the disaster which had happened to him and Du Bois, closed her lips to his name, as the knowledge of his father's crime had seemed, though only seemed, to efface his image from her heart, and silenced her lips forever to the mention of him; or else the blow which had fallen on her with such suddeness, had wounded her so deeply that she was unaware where it had taken effect; conscious only, that, so far as earthly things were concerned, there was nothing about her but darkness and desolation.
               It had been but a brief moment, however, that she had asked herself was there a Heaven still above her, and a God of mercy there? Faith had triumphed, in that moment of agony, even when reason was well nigh overcome; and, now and then, from out that mental chaos came a better idea than her brain had ever before conceived.
               "The waters are coming up over the rocks, are they, Emma? Well, they cannot overwhelm us; for He, the Lord, hath 'set the bounds of the sea by an everlasting decree.'
               "How the winds are struggling together! I think they are lifting the waves up out of the ocean, and dropping them down upon us; but if our feet are resting upon the Rock of Ages, we shall never be moved!
               "The winds and the tides may bear everything else away from us, but never everlasting Love; and when there is nothing beside for us to gaze at, and the heavens as the earth disappear from our view, then our sight grows clearer, and through the utter void comes out, one by one, the features of our Father; and without a distorting medium, with nothing to intervene but redeeming love, we look upon the face of God, and looking there, we see all beauty and all joy.
               "The battle with unbelief will have to be fought, and the victory struggled for, again and again; but the eyes which once have had a glimpse of that Face, can never be blinded more by the sight of human woe!"
               One by one comes out the features of the Father!
               Brendice Du Bois sat crouching beneath the window.
               The air within the dwelling, cool and fresh as it was, and faintly odorous with the perfume of spruce boughs, and ferns, and blossoming roses, had seemed to her close and suffocating. The walls of that room were not wide enough apart, she thought, to contain her and the woman whose cherished ones had brought such misery to herself.
               She was crouching there to watch over that woman, beside whom no one, out of the many in the neighborhood who called themselves Mrs. Maitland's friends, had come to sit beside her in her first hours of grief and desolation, excusing themselves with the supposition that she had not learned the terrible tale which was told of her son.
               Brendice looked up to the sky, shrouded in deepest gloom, save when that horrid gleam shot across it.
               She saw nothing there that shaped itself into a form to be knelt before and worshipped—not one feature of the Father— not even that one attribute of Jehovah, first revealed to guilty man—that to which poor human vision, prone ever to be most fascinated by what most pains the eye to gaze upon, looks—Brendice could not even see justice there—Justice!
               What had she done to merit the bitter return she always had, and always seemed likely to receive?
               She had been cursed by her father, because, when a babe of only three months, she had come between him and her drowning mother, whom he, angered well nigh to insanity, and with his strength almost exhausted, was struggling to save; the long clothing in which the babe was wrapped dragging so heavily through the water that he thought it was his wife whom he had seized and was bearing towards the approaching boat, fainting before it reached him and his burden; and learning, only after long weeks had elapsed, that it was the infant whose life was preserved.
               She had been cursed again, because the little eyes of four years, looking out upon the ocean, beneath whose waters, the child had been told, her mother was sleeping, and from whose bed she had not learned that mother could not rouse herself and come to the call of her little daughter,—had seen her father far down among the waves, holding a young woman in his grasp, and with a glad cry prevented the commission of a deed, which, though conceived in a fit of insanity, would never have caused him a moment of regret.
               And cursed again, and this time with a bitterness which had made all her father's previous harsh words seem to her like blessings, with attempted blows, and far worse than all, with the revelation of facts, before carefully concealed from her, but a knowledge of which had, for a brief period, made of her—a child of fourteen—the demon he had himself become. This time cursed for the sole reason that she had suffered her life to be saved by the young lad so hated for his father's sake.
               She had always been friendless and alone.
               There had never been a being whom she could look to but her unkind, neglectful father,—neglectful in all things but one,—careless of her health and her comfort, and utterly regardless of her personal appearance, seeming even to grudge her the miserable, scanty attire which he occasionally brought home for her, and treating her in such a manner that the people at The Sands had lost all the interest they had felt in her when her father first came into the neighborhood, regarding her as almost an idiot, and considering her a fit object for public charity.
               One would have been surprised at the expression which came over the girl's face, even while those bitter thoughts were surging through her brain, when the remembrance of the fisherman's words returned to her.
               Never had her father, for once in his life, directed her thoughts to the heaven he had, in his youth, believed in and trusted; but the existence of which with his lips, and in his heart, he denied, when his bitter bereavement came.
               And now he was gone!
               Mrs. Maitland had been talking quite incoherently for some time, but her words were again clear and distinct.
               Brendice, however, did not catch their import.
               She heard only the roar of the ocean, and thought that both her parents were there now, tossed about by the waves, and asked herself:
               
               Would the spirits which had been so closely united on the earth seek out and love each other again, through that long eternity, in the existence of which she would like to believe? Would there be an individuality of existence in that eternity, and would the employments of the second life be like the labors of this,—of choice and rejection,—only that there nothing would be unattainable, that unlimited duration would be allowed for action, and all needed help afforded?
               Would not the good, earnest, but misguided and hindered effort here, instead of being frustrated forever, because the exertion, though strenuous, has been useless, gather new strength and deeper wisdom from failure and defeat, and, undaunted, re-commence there a life of noble activity—no niches there, ready-built for the statues to occupy, but every one carving out a place for himself?
               While these thoughts were passing through her mind, the girl, as if inaction had suddenly become intolerable to her, went, once or twice, when the rain fell less heavily, down upon the rocks, from which the swollen waves were now reluctantly retreating; and, after a time, guided by the frequent flashes of lightning, she extended her walk to the summit of the cliff, where she stood and looked away toward the Convoy light.
               While her eyes rested upon it, she suddenly remembered a strange story she had years ago heard an old fish-woman, with hushed breath, relate respecting that singular man—the lighthouse keeper.
               Could the story be true? The woman's companions had only ridiculed it. She had said that the Commodore, on such dark, stormy nights as no fisherman would venture out in, though it was not known he had gone over to the Port for several years, would take a boat and row towards the shore. There was no conceivable motive for his doing so, the woman admitted. The man had resided at the Port several months before he became the keeper of the Convoy light, was known to many of the inhabitants, and there could be no doubt in regard to his sanity. At least, he had discharged the duties of his post faithfully, ever since he had been there.
               The woman strongly averred, however, that on one stormy night which she was passing with a female friend at The Rocks, she had herself seen him put out his boat to sea, and, at the imminent danger of being swallowed up at any moment by the waves, guide it toward The Sands.
               The story had not circulated in the neighborhood, for, as has been before remarked, the inhabitants of H—— were not a gossiping people. It recurred to Brendice to-night, for the first time, since she had overheard it; and she found herself wondering if it were true.
               Only for a moment, however; for her thoughts came back speedily to herself, and her dreary past. Strive as she might, her thoughts would not anticipate the future. Dark as that might be, she believed no more misery could be in store for her than had been crowded into the years gone by; and the question arose again in her mind, as she returned to resume her watch over Mrs. Maitland:
               "What have I done to deserve all this?"
               Words came, at length, through the open window, softly and whisperingly, as if in reply to her:
               "What thou knowest not now, thou shalt know hereafter."
               
               The lips closed with the words upon them, and the wearied woman fell asleep.
               The rest would restore her to consciousness, Brendice thought. The storm was less violent now, the fierce wind occasionally hushing itself into a gentle breeze. If nothing disturbed her, she would probably sleep till morning.
               The girl rose to return to her own home, parting the vines which the wind had not yet entirely torn from the windows, and leaning so far forward that her face was quite within the room, to assure herself, before going, that Mrs. Maitland's repose was quiet and profound.
               As she listened to catch the sound of the breathing, which was very feeble for healthful slumber, she fancied she heard a faint footfall within the apartment. Only fancied it, of course; for who could come there, at that hour?
               Perhaps Luke had escaped death and had returned; but most likely the sound was only the sweeping of the vines against the window opposite that through which she was looking.
               She was about to move away, when a flash of lightning filled the apartment with noonday brightness, for the door which opened from the south, and which Brendice was sure she had firmly closed to keep out the furious wind, was now swung widely open; and her eyes, lifted in the direction of the couch on which Mrs. Maitland was lying, though half blinded by the sudden brilliancy, took in the figure of a man. He was leaning over the sleeping woman, though his face was turned towards the window where she stood.
               The form was not Luke Maitland's, neither was it that of any one she had ever seen before.
               She dashed the rose trees from the window-sill and flung herself into the room, feeling something rush past her, towards the open door, as she sprang forward to the bedside. She did not look after the retreating figure; she would have learned nothing of it had she done so, for the night was still impenetrably dark, save when those lightning flashes shot across the sky.
               She did not care to know who it was; though, most likely, she thought, it was some one from the hotel. The fishermen had said, when down on the ledge, that one of the pleasure party at the Ocean House, the preceding day—an old gentleman—had remained behind when his companions returned to their homes. Perhaps he was feeling some anxiety in relation to the mother whose son had lost his life while in the employment of his friends. Perhaps the intruder had come to the grief-stricken woman with some pleasant news.
               But whoever he might be, or whatever was his business there, Brendice knew that Mrs. Maitland must have quiet sleep, now, till morning.
               Fortunately, the slight noises near her had failed to disturb her repose, and not until the faint streaks of returning light came out in the now clear, eastern sky, did Brendice quit her post, which, for the last three hours, was close beside the sleeping woman.
               Then she rose with a low, weary sigh, and walked out of the room, down over the ledge, along the white beach, very slowly, and looking away, out over the sea, to a little dark line along the horizon, beyond which the sun would soon rise.
               That low line was The Rocks, and the Convoy light was still burning, though faintly now, in the morning's lessening twilight. Somewhere between that beacon-light and the spot where she stood, Brendice thought her father had sunk down in death beneath the waves.
               She had heard the old fisherman, whose life he had saved, many times say, that at the moment he had supposed would be the last of his earthly existence, all the events of his long life had passed in rapid succession before him. She wondered if her father thought of her in that last moment of agony, and with any emotion of sorrow for her comfortless youth, and pity for her hopeless womanhood.
               Perhaps, at the very last, he ceased to regard as crime, what he had so long blamed her for; or had forgiven her, as she now, with the tears which were beginning to fall, for the first time since she had heard the fisherman hauling up his empty boat over the ledge, was forgiving him.
               The tears did Brendice good; as much good as her watch through the long night, over Mrs. Maitland, had done, and as her slow walk along the silent beach, was doing her. And the dark thought, so like a phantom, which had cast its gloomy shadow over her, more than once during the past night, fled away, forever, as if terrified by the light of that soft, sweet morning. Perhaps it was exorcised by the remembrance of those words Mrs. Maitland had uttered, and which seemed to be voiced by everything about her: "What thou knowest not now, thou shalt know hereafter!"
               Besides, if there is a life after this is ended—and that even her father had believed, for he could not relinquish the hope that she, whom he had loved so much, was not lost to him forever—if there is a life to come, Brendice asked herself. what preparation for the enlarged duties of a nobler existenece is he making, who shrinks from the performance of his tasks in this? What work shall be entrusted to that hand which has let go its hold on labors, which, though hard, will soon be ended; to open, itself, the gates of Eternity, and take up an employment which shall never be completed?
            
            
               
               CHAPTER X.
               AT THE ROCKS.
               BRENDICE had reached her home, and for a moment she stood before the closed door, resting her hand on the latch and asking herself if the burden of her past life, heavier in some respects than before, and now without a seeming help at hand, dreary in its hopelessness, must be lifted again.
               Hopelessness as far as human life was concerned—for the hereafter which might reveal to her what she knew not now, she did not believe could be an earthly future.
               Should the burden of her past life be lifted again, or should she walk away forever from the sea, and try to forget all that was buried there, and with it the wish for, and purpose of revenge?
               The young men who had hired her father's boat yesterday, had paid very liberally for its use. The money, she thought, would buy for her a decent dress and a pair of shoes, and then she would go away, and seek some employment elsewhere.
               The new life might be very difficult for her to enter upon at first. The tasks she might be compelled to perform, would be perhaps as wearying to body and mind as the old burden had been, she was so unused to the ways of the world; but the door of its great work-shop stood open as wide for her as for another. She would, at length, effect an entrance there.
               Strength, physical or mental, should find her a place somewhere, among the world's most skilful, and busiest artizans.
               She would leave everything about the house just as her father had left it. Perhaps he might return. She did not think there was the least probability that he would do so, but if he should come back, nothing would be changed; only she would be gone, and doubtless he would be glad of that.
               Yes; she must go away.
               Once more—a long last look on the sea, and then she would walk away from it, up, over the hills, and come back to it no more forever!—unless he should return. She could easily enough ascertain if he did, and wished to have her again with him.
               She turned, and went down, with a step which was beginning to be weary now, close to the water's edge, and looked away into the sea—wistfully, grievedly, as a child might look on the picture of a dead mother's face.
               The sun came up as she gazed, and on the broad bosom before her there was but one spot which was not sparkling with the reflected light.
               To that one little spot her face turned, and a change came over her features, as, shading her eyes with her hands, she fixed her gaze on that point of The Rocks, only a speck in the distance, which ran out farthest oceanward; and that one dark spot suddenly blotted out all the light which was beginning to dawn upon her soul.
               With her best glass she knew she could see nothing there but huge granite boulders, piled high, one above another, with clean white sand sifted in between; the snug little dwelling erected for the keeper's use, but which it was said was never occupied now; and the lighthouse rising up, seemingly so cold and defiant, against the warm, yielding sky. But her thoughts were very busy gathering up events, scattered widely apart, some of them events of the long past, and at first glance showing no relation to each other; and arranging them, at length, into a picture, the sight of which so fascinated her eyes that nothing could come between it and her vision.
               The purpose she had just formed passed away, entirely, from her mind, and her feet felt no weariness now, as they moved, impatiently, up and down the beach, waiting till a certain boat should appear upon the water. The boat she was looking for was Greyson's. Simple as he really was, of all the fishermen on the coast, Jerry knew best when it was safe to take out a boat, and especially when it was safe to start for The Rocks; and well he might, for he had been over there very many times within the last score of years.
               "Measure for measure; pressed down and running over!"
               Brendice did not remember where she had read those words, but they came to her some hours later, when she was steering her boat over the yet rough waters to The Rocks.
               She had never been to the islands before; her father had strictly forbidden her doing so; and it was without expectation of learning anything respecting his fate, that she was going there now; or intention, particularly, of making inquiries concerning the quarrel which, it was said, had arisen between him and young Maitland, while they were there together the preceding day.
               It was to ascertain, if possible, why her father had gone to The Rocks, which, she had many times wondered why, he had never visited; never to her knowledge, and in fact where he never had before been, since the night of Mr. Maitland's disappearance.
               Even the waters in their vicinity, which at particular seasons of the year yielded the greatest abundance of the most marketable fish of any grounds in the neighborhood, were always avoided by him; a locality twice the distance from The Sands, and not very easy to reach, except at certain heights of the tide, being always preferred by him.
               She had learned, years ago, that her father's thoughts were often directed towards the keeper of the Convoy light, and she had sometimes seen the quick flash of the eyes, and the sudden nervous twitching of the fingers, when, as she was aiding him in some out-of-doors employment, (no one ever came into their dwelling,) a fisherman chanced to make some allusion to Mr. Aden, or the Commodore, as he was most frequently called.
               And she had often thought it very strange, for she learned, five years before, why her father remained at The Sands, year after year; that he so pertinaciously clung to the belief that he should some time encounter Mr. Maitland there.
               Had he gone over to the islands the day before to see the lighthouse keeper? She inferred so from some remarks made by the young men who had hired his boat, when their companions came down from the hotel to meet the loiterers on their arrival. They were talking, those who had spent the day at The Sands, and those who had been over to The Rocks, when she drew near them, and one of the latter, not observing her, had said, referring to Du Bois:
               "It was not for the purpose of fishing that he went out, though he had some of his apparatus with him, I saw; for we promised him twice the amount of money for the use of his boat that the best haul could possibly bring him."
               "Well, it cannot be helped now, another added, "but if we had not spoken of our wish to see the lighthouse keeper, we should have failed to get the boat, or, at least, he would not have followed us."
               No one asked why, and the question did not occur to Brendice then, for there was something in the faces of the men, as they recognized her, which caused her, for the time, to pay little attention to the remark.
               She remembered it now, and asked the question of herself, as she stood, looking away into the sea; and with that question came others, strange, startling ones they were.
               The most deeply absorbing one, to her, was this:
               Who was that man she had seen standing by Mrs. Maitland's bed on the previous night? and would she recognize him, if she should see him again?
               Greyson's boat did not pass into the Convoy inlet.
               The swollen waters would have dashed it against the rocks, had the fisherman attempted to guide its course in that direction. There was a little bay, much safer, when the sea was rough, extending into another of the islands, and into this the man ran his boat.
               Brendice followed, not far behind him, for he had lost time in examining the waters near the inlet.
               Apparently he was very desirous of going directly up to the lighthouse, but found he could not do so.
               When he had made his boat safe he came to the assistance of Brendice, who, quite unacquainted with the locality, and not understanding the gestures or the jargon of the little half-nude urchins who were down at the water's edge, gathering the broken pieces of a boat which had been dashed against the rocks during the night, came very near making a wreck of her own boat.
               Greyson recognized the girl as he pointed out a safe landing. He had heard of the accident of the previous day. In fact his business at the islands that morning was to ascertain if anything had yet been learned of Du Bois or young Maitland. What use he intended to make of the information he hoped to acquire, was best known to himself, for the fisherman very seldom manifested any interest in the affairs of others, even when life or death was involved, unless there was some prospect of pecuniary profit to himself.
               But he seemed now not only very willing to render assistance to another, but extremely anxious to do so, while he strove to make his remarks as interesting to Brendice, as his ready assistance was useful.
               Greyson would like to see any other girl on the coast 'tempt to do what Mam'selle had done that morning, 'specially young Miss Brown, who was so stuck up and thought she was too smart to speak to any of the fishermen 'cept Luke Maitland—poor fellow! But Luke had known what's what, as well as anybody did.
               
               It was a pity, Greyson thought, that Luke and Brendice's father had always been such bad friends.
               He was speaking in a slow tone, lengthened now to a drawl, and looking out from under the lids of those pale blue eyes of his, which always seemed to observe nothing.
               But Brendice, who was returning his gaze, perceived that he was eagerly and cunningly watching the expression of her countenance, to ascertain if his words produced any effect on her.
               His watch was in vain, however. Her features were perfectly under her control. They did not change, neither was there the least tremor in her voice, when, without noticing the latter part of his remark, she said:
               "Why, you do not consider it a great affair to bring a boat over here this morning, do you, when some one crossed the waters between The Sands and the islands twice last night, in the darkness and the storm? It went to pieces, though, I see, against the rocks, on its return!"
               She pointed to the broken planks which the children were industriously and fearlessly, though one would have thought at the imminent peril of their lives, collecting from out the crevices of the rocks, and carrying up through the surf, beyond the reach of the waves.
               Greyson did not immediately reply, he was so entirely unprepared for the question; but stood with his eyes distended now, and his mouth wide open, staring into her face.
               "Wall, I wouldn't ha' tried it, no how!" he managed to say, at length, and apparently from feeling a necessity for making some reply,—"no, not for five dollars, cash in hand! Who d'ye think it was, Mam'selle?"
               But Brendice was not anxious to prolong the conversation. She had learned all she had hoped to, from Greyson; and thanking him for directing her how to steer her boat, she turned, and walked away towards the children. They had been joined in their labors by some older persons, one a grown-up girl, apparently a year or two younger than Brendice, and as coarsely and scantily attired as was she; and the other, a woman of fifty, the mother of the children.
               The women had glanced at her, as she first stepped on shore, with some distrust; but as she drew nearer, they were apparently better satisfied with her appearance; and when she mentioned her name, and they understood that she was the daughter of the fisherman whom they had seen the day before at the islands, and who was drowned while returning to The Sands—for the news of the accident had reached The Rocks—they left their work, and came forward to meet her.
               The girl's eyes filled with tears, which she awkwardly tried to rub away with the back of her hand. Her own father's boat, not many months before, was found, one fair, bright morning, which had followed a stormy night, lying high up upon the beach without an occupant.
               The elder woman was no less inclined to manifest her sympathy, though in a different way, for the young stranger. She greeted her with a great flow of words, very few of which, however, could Brendice understand, as she knew nothing of English but the pure, chaste language which her father had taught her; and the vernacular at The Rocks, particularly that spoken by the female portion of the little community, was little other than a mere jumble of nautical terms and local phrases.
               
               But the pleasant animated voice put her quite at her ease, and she endeavored to ascertain the facts she was desirous of learning.
               For a long time, however—she remained several hours at The Rocks—this was with little prospect of success. The women knew nothing about the quarrel between Du Bois and young Maitland. Two men, whose homes were on the island, though they were now on board the fishing schooner that was anchored the day before off The Rocks, and which had sailed before the storm came on, had witnessed the dispute. They had referred to it, and one of them said that the life of the old fisherman—meaning Du Bois—would not, to use his own language, be worth a rotten herring, if he ever put himself in the way of that young fellow again.
               In the hurry to get off, however, as they wished to run up to the Port before the storm was upon them, they did not explain, so far as the woman had heard, the cause of the difficulty.
               This Brendice did not care about.
               She could not believe that Luke Maitland had really been blameworthy in the affair. She thought she had very good and sufficient reasons for disbelieving it.
               She had decided, in her own mind, the preceding evening, when she heard the fishermen talking at the foot of the cliff, as they were hauling in her father's empty boat, that the drowning of the two men had been simply accidental. She wished to think so, and would have been very unwilling to find proof to the contrary.
               Her father, she believed, would rather lose his life than owe it to Luke Maitland, and he had torn himself away from the young man's grasp, lest it should save him. Neither could she think he really intended to injure Luke. It was only in a fit of partial insanity, she always felt sure, that he had attempted to destroy Mrs. Maitland's life.
               If he had wished to harm her son, he would have found opportunity for doing so before this time.
               In his death-struggle, perhaps, he had flung out his arm, and his fingers had fastened themselves on something, he knew not what, and the two men went down together. But however it might have been, between them, the affair was now, undoubtedly, ended forever. If one had sought to injure the other, she thought, he had met with a speedy punishment.
               What Brendice wished to learn was, why her father had gone over to The Rocks. But when she spoke of the lighthouse keeper, the woman became suddenly silent; and looking nervously down to the ledge where her children were playing in the surf, and waiting till the receding waven should allow them to reach the broken plank that was tightly wedged in between two high boulders, beckoned them very peremptorily from, as has been before remarked, their seemingly very perilous situation, though the almost amphibious little creatures were, half the time when their eyes were open, apparently exposed to well nigh the same danger.
               They did not seem particularly in haste to obey the signal, and she hastened towards them to compel obedience. The children scampered away, and the woman followed them; but the girl, whom her companion called Ives, and who had not spoken before, drew a step nearer Brendice and inquired, pointing up to the lighthouse, if it was he she wished to ask about.
               Yes! Did the young men who had come over to The Rocks the day before, or her father, go over to the Convoy to see him?
               After considerable difficulty in finding out what the girl wished to say, though she spoke more intelligibly than the woman, Brendice ascertained that Ives had gone over to the spot where the young men were to make their chowder—she and her brother, in the hope of selling them some choice fish for the purpose.
               The spot they had selected was on an island, lying between that on which Brendice had landed, and the Convoy; and one of the men had borrowed the girl's boat, and gone over to the lighthouse to invite the Commodore to join their party.
               The man had brought some one back with him in the boat. It was not Mr. Aden, however, but a stranger from the mainland, who was over in the neighborhood of the lighthouse, in quest of sea-fowl.
               Mr. Aden, it was said, had declined the invitation, on the plea of illness. And he did look ill, the gentleman who had sought him, said, and he had wonderfully changed, during the last fifteen years, previous to which time he had had some acquaintance with him.
               Their old friend, over at the hotel, he added, who was so anxious to hear particularly from Mr. Aden, would be sorry to learn what he would be obliged to tell him.
               The stranger, who very gladly accepted the invitation extended to him, was a tall, fine-looking man; his personal appearance, when viewed at a distance, being not very unlike that of the lighthouse keeper, whom the girl had frequently seen.
               The party sat down to their refreshments as soon as he had joined them; and the girl and her brother were just stepping into their boat, when they perceived Brendice's father coming over the sand-hill below which the young men had spread their repast.
               The girl had never seen Du Bois before, but her brother, to whom he was well known by sight, remarked on the strangeness of his appearance, as, after a brief survey of the party, none of whom seemed to take any notice of him, he turned slowly back by the way he had come, and disappeared beyond the hill.
               This, the girl thought, was previous to his meeting with Luke Maitland; and she had not seen him after, or heard anything about him, until news had come that young Maitland had upset his boat, and that he was drowned.
               She drew nearer Brendice, and added, in a whisper, that she had learned this from the son of the woman who had just been talking with her.
               He was out on the water when the affair took place, and had told her, when he returned, that it was no accident which had happened. Luke Maitland had purposely caused Du Bois' death; and if he escaped drowning himself, he, young Hobart, would bring him to the gallows.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XI.
               AT LAST.
               THE sun was shining brightly through Mrs. Maitland's window, for the dark-leaved, blossoming vines were trailing over the white sand, and the pots of sweet tea-roses lay overturned upon the earth; the former torn away by the rough wind, and the latter put swiftly aside by Brendice, to make way for her quick ingress to the apartment, when the stranger stood at the bedside of the sleeping woman.
               The light fell across the pale, peaceful face, and she opened her eyes. Very mercifully, the remembrance of her great grief came to her in a subdued form, in her waking dream.
               She fancied herself standing on what she thought to be the confines of the earth, and looking away, over the narrow cleft—for it seemed to her that this, and the better world, had once been united; and perhaps, sometime, by the power of the wondrous cross, all the sin and sorrow here might pass away forever, and Heaven and earth again become as one—looking away over the narrow cleft, she had seen her son, on the other side, reaching out his strong arms towards her.
               Then the scene changed. It was she herself who had crossed the dark and narrow way, and was standing now, surrounded with ineffable light, and supremely blest, stretching one hand out to Luke, over whom many tides of time had seemed to roll since she had last looked upon his face, though he was her boy still; and with the other pointing up—up, and far away, to a brightness before which the archangel veiled his face, and a beauty which the redeemed only can look upon, and they only through that intervening veil—the exceeding grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
               She awoke then, and found it was only the natural sun which was enveloping her in its brightness; and the weight of her grief fell upon her, but not with crushing force.
               All through that long summer day, when the neighbors, and several beyond the immediate neighborhood, were, in mistaken kindness, coming and going, with words of intended comfort and advice, and offers of assistance; and through many days and weeks which succeeded, the influence of that dream,—which she chose to regard as a vision, and too holy to be mentioned but to one, and then only in her dying moments,—followed her, assuredly leading her nearer and nearer to that cleft, but by a smooth, heaven-lighted pathway.
               Very bitter, however, was one remembrance, and it came to her often, poisoning the cup which, but for that, she thought might cheerfully have been drank.
               The remembrance of what the fishermen had said, how Luke had commenced the quarrel with Du Bois at The Rocks, and how he afterwards intentionally had upset his boat; and subsequent inquiry, which she had not doubted would show these suspicions to have been groundless, to all appearance proved them to be too well founded.
               Not however to the mother, who understood her son better than did any one else. She was sure he had not commenced the quarrel with the Frenchman, and that he must have been excited almost to madness by some word or act of Du Bois, if he had intended to injure him on the water.
               She knew what no one else did, unless it was the Frenchman's daughter, how hard to be borne, by a proud young man, might be some words which Du Bois, if he were disposed to do so, could utter, and with truth, to Luke. She was very glad to remember that he had speedily conquered his passion, and was trying to save Du Bois when death came to himself. She did not, however, attempt to exonerate him from blame to others.
               She only received patiently the condolences offered her by her neighbors, the poor heart swelling a little when those who knew and liked him best, remarked that, with all his faults, Luke was a good, clever fellow, and the lips slightly trembling, but keeping quite silent. Very hard was all this to bear!
               What troubled Mrs. Maitland most in regard to the stories circulating among the people, was the fear that Brendice Du Bois would believe Luke really and intentionally guilty of her father's death.
               She had heard, while on the cliff that night, all that Mrs. Maitland had listened to; and the next day, it was said, she had taken her boat, though the sea was still very rough, and gone over to The Rocks, where she would most likely be told whether it was true or false,—for Luke frequently fished off the islands, and consequently was not very well liked there, Du Bois, on the contrary, never going there, and therefore having the good-will of the fishermen, some of whom had met with him at the Port,—that the young man had commenced the dispute, and doubtless was wholly to blame for its result.
               During the course of the day, Mrs. Maitland learned that it was not Miss Emma Brown who had kindly spent the night near her; for that young lady made a brief call on her dearest friend, with profuse apologies for not coming to her the previous evening.
               Emma was very sorry for poor Luke, and it was too bad for his mother to remain there all alone in the house. She thought, likely as not, Mrs. Maitland could get Sally Jones to stay with her; and Sally was as clever an old soul as ever lived.
               Who could it have been then that had led her, with such a firm, gentle hand, to her home, and remained with her all through the gloomy night, and but for whom she must have perished on the cliff?
               Could it be Brendice Du Bois? she asked herself,—the friendless, neglected, and despised girl, made destitute and orphaned by the crimes of those who had been so near and dear to herself that their wrong-doings, she thought, must seem to others, as they had once done to her, to be her own acts?—Brendice who, knowing what she most likely knew, had, heedless of her wrongs and her own grief, laid her cool hand so tenderly, the past night, on Mrs. Maitland's throbbing temples, as her head dropped upon the pillow, that the words had suddenly come to her—the first heavenly help which had been given her in that hour of overpowering agony:
               "Who knoweth not, in all these, the hand of the Lord hath wrought this?"
               The idea that her companion of the past night must have been the French girl, occurred to her as she was sitting alone, towards the close of the day, after the neighbors had offered their condolences, and returned to their homes. She was feeling weary—oh, so very weary, as she listened to the sound of the in-coming tide, mechanically counting in her old, childish way, the white-crested waves as they successively rolled in, and fancying that each tenth billow struck with heavier force upon the shore, and sent its waters out wider over the sand than had its predecessors; while in her deeper thought she wondered how many times the tide would ebb and flow, before she listened to the welcome voice of another sea, thanking heaven for the precious promise:
               "When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee."
               Then another thought had come: How many and many times during the first summer of Du Bois' residence at The Sands, before she had learned who he was, had she wished that the stranger's child might be entrusted to her care: how that wish had become a prayer from the morning when she had expected death from the Frenchman's hands, notwithstanding the avoidance of each other on the part of both families; hopelessly, but daily, uttered, even when she believed that Du Bois would be no more opposed to the receiving, by his daughter, of any kindness from herself, than Luke would be to any manifestation, on the part of his mother, of interest in the girl.
               She had been unable, herself, even to plan a way in which she might seek to benefit Brendice.
               With heaven all things were possible, she had tried to strengthen herself by thinking. Perhaps it would find a way for her. But she had little dreamed through what a billowy sea of agony, though the waters had parted beneath her feet,—through what a waste, howling wilderness, though bread had come to her from heaven, and water was dripping from the rock,—that path would, at length, be marked out.
               Marked out, plainly enough it was, now, to her!
               After a prayer for wisdom to guide, and strength to sustain her—for she thought that both vigor of body and determination of purpose might desert her, when she stood in the presence of that girl so terribly wronged—she rose from her seat, drew her little tea-table out into the centre of the room, and with many tears, made it again ready for two persons.
               More than once while doing so, the tears were suddenly checked, and the shadow of a smile crossed her face, and she paused for a moment in her work and listened for a sound she was never to hear again.
               It was too strange for belief!
               Luke, whom, not once in her life, she had thought of losing, could not now be gone from her forever!
               The sound of his footsteps upon the rocks, a merry laugh or a snatch of the boat-song of which he was so fond, would soon fall upon her ear, and wake her from that terrible nightmare.
               Nothing came but the voice of the ocean, and the fall of the vine leaves against the window panes. In the course of the day she had tenderly gathered them up, and fastened them again where Luke had nailed them.
               The repast was ready and the tea-kettle singing in the little stone fireplace which her son had made for her, a few steps from the dwelling. Mrs. Maitland, moving as if she had been in a dream, walked away from her door, down over the ledge and along the beach towards the abode she had entered on that dark, stormy night, almost fifteen years before, to hear the voice of that little lonely child calling, in such piteous tones, on her long-lost mother, and to wake to the conviction of her husband's fearful crime.
               How would she find Brendice Du Bois to-night? And what terrible revelation might be made to her!
               As she passed slowly along the sand, she kept her eyes on the line of rocks above her, hoping that the girl she sought would be out on the ledge, as she very often was after the fish-houses were closed, and the strangers had all left the beach, whatever the state of the weather might be; for Mrs. Maitland felt very reluctant to enter the dwelling which had been the home of Du Bois.
               Brendice was, however, nowhere to be seen, until her visitor stood at the threshold of the fisherman's cabin.
               The door, which was on the west side of the building, stood widely ajar, and the warm, red light of the setting sun shone into the room, as the visitor stood there and glanced tremblingly into the apartment.
               It was a very comfortless looking place, falling just short, in its appearance, of filthiness and disorder.
               On one side of the room were arranged piles of fish in different ferent stages of drying; and fishing-tackle, some of which seemed to be just undergoing repairs, not yet quite completed, was, with the tools and materials required in mending, lying scattered about on the floor. The other side was occupied by a rude couch, on which had been carelessly thrown some articles of Du Bois' clothing, apparently just as he had left them when he went out the day before; a small table at which Brendice was now sitting; a couple of stools, and a large sea-chest, the lid of which was partially raised, and filled, so far as could be seen, with books and maps, and two or three telescopes of different sizes.
               The inner room, the door of which was also open, revealed nothing to the eye which turned towards it, but a sleeping cot made up upon the floor, a painter's easel, with the canvas towards the wall, and a newspaper, yellow with age, pinned over the window.
               There were no curtains of any kind over the two small windows of the larger apartment, and the walls of both rooms were unfinished. The rough boards had once been whitewashed; but the coloring had well nigh disappeared under the dripping of the wet fish often hung against it.
               Brendice was sitting at the table, and her evening repast was before her. It consisted of a bit of boiled fish, cooked probably the previous evening for her father's supper, some fragments of dry corn bread, and water in a tin cup.
               Nothing had passed the girl's lips for the last twenty-four hours, and she thought not of the coarseness of the food; for the supper was no more uninviting than had been many a meal she had eaten with good relish, but yet she was not trying to eat.
               
               Her arms lay crossed upon the table, and her head was bent so low over them that Mrs. Maitland, as she looked eagerly towards her, thought the girl might be sleeping, and she stepped softly over the threshold.
               But the first touch of her foot upon the sanded floor aroused her, and Brendice Du Bois started up.
               A few minutes before, a boat which had come in later than the rest, touched the landing, and the voices of two fishermen came up from the beach.
               Mrs. Maitland thought, as she regarded that changing countenance turned towards her, that perhaps when the footfall was heard upon the floor, the girl might have fancied, for the briefest instant, it was that of her father; and she shrank away, as if withered, before the expression which the disappointment brought to that bronzed face.
               But it was not wholly disappointment which produced that change in the girl's appearance; for after an instant's wild stare at her visitor's countenance, she drew back until she had placed the table between herself and Mrs. Maitland, and then stood, motionless, in her usual attitude; her fingers clutched tightly together, and her head thrown forward; but her lip was held now, sufferingly between her teeth, and her eyes,—her visitor could not look upon them, for if eyes ever flashed fire, those dark orbs emitted sparks of light.
               The past night, in the darkness and the storm, her new bereavement not yet quite certain, and a poor, feeble woman who had been somebody's mother, needing to be watched over,—the spirt of her gentler parent had moved the hands, and softened the heart of Brendice Du Bois.
               In the fresh, bracing air of the early morning, when the heavens and the ocean were tranquillizing themselves with the passing of the clouds, and the low, deep moan, Brendice had grown strong by weeping, and felt ready to labor and to wait, to stand apart from all help and from all companionship, as she had always done, for the idea that any one would come to her in her desolate and destitute orphanage, with kind and comforting words, and with a hand willingly stretched forth to aid her, had not occurred to her. It would not have been a welcome thought.
               She would not have desired expressions of sympathy from the people about her who knew nothing of her real wrongs and sufferings, any more than she wished for the pauper's dole.
               She would labor with a might which must bring reward, on whatever work should be placed before her, and wait till a stronger hand than her own would shape the events of her future.
               But now, in the full light of the setting sun, falling so bright and warm upon the ocean, which during many hours of that day she had been looking down into, as if it had been the open mouth of a sepulchre, ready to reveal what it had already swallowed up, and gaping wide for another victim, all her father's hate and thirst for vengeance looked from her eyes, and fired her soul.
               Fearful of herself, she had drawn back till the table stood between her and the feeble being her fingers were trembling to hold in a deadly gripe.
               Mrs. Maitland's hand rested on the door frame, for a momentary weakness passed over her.
               
               "The girl knows all; and I am again completely in the power of a maniac!" she thought.
               But she would not shrink from her purpose, though the manner of its execution must be different from what she had intended it should be.
               She pressed her hands tightly over her heart, for there was a very strange feeling upon her, though she did not know how that singular sensation was revealed on her countenance,—what terrible words it was writing there, as she stepped to the side of the girl; but she was, herself, startled by the tone in which she said, when a fearful moment had passed:
               "I perceive you know who I am!"
               But Brendice saw and understood that something almost like the shadow of Death was near; and perhaps she was as much surprised by the sound of her own voice, as Mrs. Maitland had been, when, after an instant's silence, and while the better spirit, striving so hard for the mastery, and strengthened as if by the breath of the dread Presence she thought was so near, and which seemed to be cooling and purifying the atmosphere about her, at length triumphed,—she replied:
               "Yes, I know who you are!—the mother of the lad who once saved my life."
               She paused for an instant, and then repeated:
               "Who once saved my life!" adding, as if speaking to herself alone, "it was a valueless thing, though; not half worth the saving!"
               A faint color came to Mrs. Maitland's face. Her hands dropped to her side, and she sank down, dizzied with joy and thankfulness, upon a seat; but she caught the girl's idea.
               "Brendice," she said, after a moment, and speaking in a very calm, even tone, "do not call your life valueless. It will be worth more to me than all I have lost, the husband whom I had believed was so good and true, the wealth I had considered so rightly our own, the hold on earthly existence I had thought was so secure, and—and my boy! more than all but my hope in Heaven. And I will bless the Power which has taken my earthly all away, if that Power will but give me you!
               "I should have perished last night upon the cliff, if you had not cared for me like a tender child. Let me call you my child while I live; it will be but for a little while that any earthly good can be mine; and when I die,"—a serenity and beauty which seemed not of the world came to the strangely fair face—"when I die I will give you into the keeping of One whose love is stronger than death; One who will never leave nor forsake you!"
               Her voice had not trembled once while she spoke. New strength came to it, with each word she uttered.
               Brendice did not reply, but she was busily thinking. Her wrongs had not come through this woman. The countenance before her, she could plainly see, was the index of a gentle, loving heart; and Mrs. Maitland had but for a brief space of time enjoyed the wealth of which her husband had so wickedly become possessed.
               And, besides, here was an opportunity for discharging that obligation which had weighed so heavily on her father and herself—that for which he had so cursed her; and for which she had felt herself so guilty: the saving of her life by Luke Maitland.
               His mother now needed to be watched over. Very soon she would require the tenderest care.
               If Brendice should devote herself to the task, would not that debt be paid?
               And then, when Mr. Maitland was at length found—Du Bois had never doubted but the man would, sometime, be in his power, and now that her father was gone, she thought that the work he had so longed to execute, was left for her to do—when he should be found, her hands would be free from the galling chains she had feared would never be broken.
               Then she would mete out to the author of all her wrongs a "Measure, pressed down and running over!"
               A power beyond her own, she thought—and a faint smile came to her lips—was already beginning to shape events for her.
               Mrs. Maitland widely mistook the meaning of that smile; and anxious to leave the dwelling, she rose feebly from her seat, and put her arm within the girl's.
               "I am sure you will go with me!" she said. "Neither you nor I have a friend in the world, but each other."
               She thought of the Browns, whom she had considered most friendly to her, and especially of Emma, whom she had regarded as her future daughter-in-law. Even Mrs. Maitland had understood why that young lady was so interested in finding a companion for her.
               "Come, my child!" and she strove, gently, to lead the girl away.
               Brendice did not resist, but walked out of the dwelling with her, and along the beach; when they had reached the ledge drawing her companion's arm closer within her own and moving more slowly, for the woman's strength was now well nigh exhausted; feeling an emotion of sorrow for her, but, on the whole, glad that Mrs. Maitland seemed to need assistance so much, that the work she had before her—the discharge of her obligation—might be immeadiately commenced.
               As she walked along, tenderly supporting her companion, and all through the coming night, as she sat by the open window, alternately looking out upon, and dreaming of the sea, for she could not so soon persuade herself to occupy the bed which Mrs. Maitland had given up to her use—resting her own poor little head on the pillow which Luke's healthful, rosy cheek so many times had pressed,—she answered the vengeful, clamorous thoughts each time they rose within her, by the words: "Measure, pressed down, and running over!"
               Alas, poor Brendice Du Bois!
               In all her father's teachings, and they had been many, for in point of intellectual training he had not neglected his daughter—the girl on account of her perfect disregard of personal appearance, and the eccentricity of her habits, regarded by the fishermen and their families as scarcely possessed of a common share of intellect, being a woman of the finest mental organization, and highly educated,—in all his teachings, much of which had been, however, 
                     "The knowledge which harms the soul to know,"
                   he had impressed upon her only this from the Bible:
               
               "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth!" and "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed!"
               That had been the first lesson the child was taught, and on the day in which Luke Maitland saved her life, when she would have turned her eyes gratefully on the youth, and spoken her deep thanks, the reason why that lesson had been so many times repeated, was given in words which seemed to freeze it into the blood in her veins.
               The lesson never after needed repetition.
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               THE FAITHFUL DEPARTED.
               EVERYBODY at The Sands, except, perhaps, Miss Emma Brown, thought it a very excellent plan for Mrs. Maitland to take that poor girl home and look after her. No doubt Luke had been to blame for her father's death, and it was his mother's duty to do something for her, and keep her "off the town" so long as she could afford to.
               But it soon became apparent to those who felt any interest in the matter, that Brendice Du Bois was in no degree indebted to the woman with whom she found a home, for her maintenance.
               On the morning after going to the dwelling, and every succeeding day, until the season was over, when the weather was favorable for fishing, and Mrs. Maitland was well enough to be left alone, for her health began more rapidly to decline after Luke's disappearance, the girl had taken her father's boat, which she managed with great dexterity, and had gone out on the sea, returning, usually, with as much fish as the men brought in.
               
               At first Mrs. Maitland tried, gently, to dissuade her from doing this; and sought to interest her in some feminine employment, puzzling her head with plans for Brendice's future.
               She could support her in a comfortable manner as long as she herself, probably, would live; but there would be little left for the girl after she was gone.
               She very soon learned, however, that Brendice was not a person to receive a favor from any one, least of all from herself; that not even for her companionship had the girl consented to come to her home.
               Yet she showed this so kindly, that Mrs. Maitland's feelings were never wounded; though so firmly that all attempts at persuasion were soon abandoned.
               Every refusal to receive a favor from Mrs. Maitland would be followed on the part of Brendice by a quick compliance with some request in which her friend's pleasure only was concerned. In this way, many of her old habits, particularly that of personal untidiness, were gradually dropped.
               At first she gave more attention to her attire, simply for the gratification of her to whom she would have thought the debt she was trying to liquidate, illy paid, unless in addition to the labor which she performed for her, she sought so far as possible to please her; and the interest which she manifested in herself, she perceived, gave her friend more pleasure than anything else afforded.
               But after a remark which Mrs. Maitland made to her one evening, as they were sitting together in the dim twilight, Brendice began to think, herself, of her personal appearance.
               The mother had not put on mourning for her son.
               On the contrary, every afternoon of that summer had seen her with the pale rose-colored ribbons which Luke had bought for her, in her fair hair, and dressed in the pretty hlac muslin he liked so well.
               Brendice always found her thus attired, when she came in from her fishing, sitting by the vine-wreathed window, looking out, and watching for her return.
               Sometimes, when she felt more than usually well and strong, she walked down to meet the girl at the time the boats would be likely to come in, as she had, so many times, gone out to meet her boy; and with the same gentle, loving words on her lips with which he had been greeted. If the tears would come into her eyes, and her voice was low and broken, she would say, in her simple, earnest manner:
               "They are tears of thankfulness as much as they are tears of grief, dear Brendice!—joy that I have you, sorrow that I must wait longer before I see him again."
               And then she would sit down upon the ledge, murmuring half audibly to herself, as her thoughts went on, while she waited for Brendice to take care of her fish, or dispose of it to her customers.
               The proprietor of the Ocean House, who was a very kind, good man, and several others residing near the neighborhood, seeing how industriously the poor orphaned girl was toiling, that she might not be dependent on others, and that, instead of receiving benefits from Mrs. Maitland, she was conferring on her great kindness, rendering her gratuitously the assistance which her frequent returns of feebleness required, made it a point to relieve the young fishwoman of the product of her day's labor, and to pay her a good price for it, so soon as the boat reached the beach.
               
               As she sat upon the ledge, waiting for Brendice's arm to lean upon, when she returned to her dwelling, Mrs. Maitland compelled her poor heart to be satisfied with the thought that she had not asked Heaven to conduct her by a smooth and easy pathway. If it would but lead her to the heart of that girl, she would not weep over the roughness of the way, though her foot should bleed at every step she took.
               Brendice had intended, when she could get a sum of money sufficient for the purpose, to purchase for herself a simple suit of mourning.
               Her father, for aught she had ever been told, was all the relative she had in the world; and notwithstanding his harshness to her, she had loved him.
               She saw how much she had loved him, more and more plainly as the weeks passed. She had always known it, though often it had seemed very strange to her, how she clung to him.
               She had thought of it with wonder, as she clambered over the ledge, through whose crevices, filled with the fine white sand worn away from the rocks, wetted so often with the bitter, salt spray, and so heated with the noonday sun as almost to burn the fingers which touched it, some little tough hardy plant sturdily forced its way, throwing out its arms with their red veins, as if a deeper life were given to it—blood from a throbbing heart—when nature withheld the nourishment it should have bestowed. The little, hardy, determined thing seemed to Brendice very much like herself; and she had loved it far more than the pretty, sweet-scented, fragile blossoms she had found in her infrequent rambles among the neighboring hills.
               She had never sheltered a fainting plant from the burning sun, or brought a drop of water to quench its thirst; but she had watched, day after day, over it, to see if it would gather strength to itself, or droop and die, and laughed or cried, as it grew strong again or withered. And, thinking of her own hard, unloved, uncared-for life, she wondered where the strong affection within her found its nutriment.
               In summing up the miseries of her life, as, in those hours when she was alone in her boat upon the sea, she was very apt to do, she began daily to drop out, here and there, or try to cancel, something she had considered, and rightly too, a grievous wrong; though this was only so far as her father was considered.
               She did not like to think that he should pass away from the world, and leave no trace behind him; that the tide of time should close as quickly over his memory, as the parted wave had met again, over his sinking form. It would be pleasant to reflect, hereafter, that she had paid him what little tribute of respect she had been able to do.
               She would buy her a simple mourning suit, and, when she had saved another little sum of money, she would ask Mr. Brown if there would be any impropriety in placing in the graveyard a stone bearing her father's name, and telling when he died, and if she would be permitted to use a little spot for that purpose, under one of those low, wide-spreading evergreens halfway up the hillside, and overlooking the sea—his deep grave!
               She had not quite decided whether she would ask Mr. Brown this, or whether she would, with her own hands, carve her father's name on that high rock that jutted out into the sea, where she had stood, so many times, looking and waiting for the long-lost mother, and watching for the boat which had, at last, returned without its owner.
               But Brendice did not buy her suit of mourning.
               The pretty dresses which Mrs. Maitland had tried, so hard, to persuade her to accept, were of bright colors, and nicely trimmed. They were some she had worn, herself, in her sunny youth, but which had been laid aside when the great grief came.
               While refusing the garments, Brendice would not wound her feelings by the purchase of one very much unlike what her friend thought suitable for her; and, consequently, one day, when she had saved a sum of money sufficient for the purpose, she went up to the store and bought material for a plain green dress, with simple jet ornaments for trimming. The garment was fashioned by the skilful fingers of Miss Sally Jones, who was the dressmaker at The Sands.
               It looked very nicely as Mrs. Maitland arranged it about Brendice, one evening after she returned from her fishing. Mrs. Maitland had been very feeble that day, and Brendice reproached herself when she returned at night-fall, and saw how thin and white was the face which was watching so earnestly for her coming, that she had left her for so many hours alone.
               Unknown to herself, the work she had taken up as an obligation was beginning to be regarded by Brendice as a privilege; and when, after arranging the new dress, Mrs. Maitland drew her into a chair, and began to take down and comb out her long thick hair, laying it smoothly over the temples, and gathering it into heavy braids low in her neck, the girl made no resistance. It was the first time since her remembrance that a hand had been placed tenderly upon her head, and the habitual hard, cold expression of her features softened a little beneath the gentle touch.
               As the toilet was completed, she rose and turned her face towards Mrs. Maitland.
               The pretty dress set off to good advantage her very fine form, and the change in the arrangement of the hair, and the gentler expression on the features—especially the look of gratitude which she had never suffered her countenance to wear before—though the emotion had often found its way into her heart, since coming to her new home—for the kindness, which the girl regarded as undeserved, so far had she been at first from being governed by any friendly feeling towards Luke's mother—the new attire, the style of dressing the hair, and the change on the features, produced a wonderful transformation in Brendice's whole appearance.
               As Mrs. Maitland lifted her eyes, for Brendice, properly dressed, seemed to have shot up some inches in height, and looked into that face—not fully, in the gathering twilight, revealed to her view—a deep flush, succeeded with lightning swiftness by a death-like pallor, and a violent contortion of muscle, passed over her countenance.
               The parted lips could not give utterance to the cry which rose to them, and she sank down to the floor, not fainting, but seemingly paralyzed with terror; completely paralyzed, only the eyes saw with strange clearness and strength, and there was an agony of fear in their gaze.
               The girl stood quite still for a moment, returning the look of those dilated eyes; and then she put back the hair from her temples, and the old expression of sternness and defiance settled back on her features. She took Mrs. Maitland up from the floor, and led her to her bed, and then turned away and went out of the house, down towards the beach.
               How full of sweet, pleasant sound the ocean was!
               It seemed like the gentle call of a mother, wooing her child to her breast; and she felt that the tender pressure of an arm, whose clasp could not be broken, would be very pleasant to her.
               But not yet, not yet!
               More clear and distinct than ever came out that one purpose before her mind:
               Revenge on him whose crimes had blasted her young life!
               And this woman, to whom her appearance seemed suddenly to have become so abhorrent!
               Should she go back to her, and watch over her for the few weeks or months that she might still live? or should she immediately enter upon the accomplishment of that purpose with the execution of which she was charged?
               She sat down on the ledge, and her gaze was fastened on the spot along the eastern horizon where the Convoy light suddenly streamed up brightly against the darkening sky; so immovably that one might have thought that beacon-light was the eye of a living Medusa, and that Brendice had so regarded it ever since the morning which followed that night when the old boat had returned empty to the beach—that morning when she had gone over to The Rocks, and talked with the girl Ives!
               She had heard since nothing more than she had learned that day. The old gentleman, still at the Ocean House, who had been so anxious that his friend should see Mr. Aden on the day they went over to the islands, had not been able to visit him himself. He had had great trouble lately. It was said that a woman, whom he had very dearly loved, and her young child, were lost in the ship which had foundered on the Bar during the fierce gale of that night after Luke Maitland and Brendice's father were drowned. She had not been over there since; nor, until to-night, had she fixed her eyes on the Convoy light.
               But the suspicion which had fastened itself on her mind was still there. She could not make it seem a groundless one; and she looked at the light now with set teeth and clenched hands, and wished it was a dark, stormy night, and that there was a sound of dipping oars coming up from the sea.
               More than an hour passed away.
               The twilight had faded into night, and the round white moon and the bright stars were looking down from a serene sky; and some one came and sat down beside her, and a voice, low and gentle, and full of tears, asked, tremblingly, while an arm was put about her waist:
               "Brendice, did you ever see a likeness of your mother? Did your father ever describe her to you?"
               "No, never!" she replied, softly, though earnestly, "but I would give half my life, to look on a face resembling hers!"
               "Then look on your own countenance, dear Brendice!" said Mrs. Maitland. "Your mother was very beautiful; by far the most beautiful woman I ever saw; and I know she must have been very good and gentle, too; and to-night you looked so strangely like her, as I saw her on that terrible night when—when"—
               "Do not distress yourself, dear madam!" said the girl, pressing close to the form which was shrinking away from her. "Only tell me that I resemble my mother, and I shall half forget"—
               Brendice paused. She could not say "how she died," but she added—"I will bless you, forever!"
               "You looked so strangely like her to-night," was the reply, "that, for a moment, in my weakness, I thought those sweet bright eyes were resting again on me."
               They were silent for a long time, but the tears were falling fast over the faces of both, and though they never referred again to Brendice's mother, each knew that she was very often in the other's thoughts.
               After that, Brendice began to care very much for her personal appearance; hastening to complete her labors for the day, that she might put on the pretty green dress, coming unbidden to sit at Mrs. Maitland's feet, and throwing the long hair over her shoulders that it might be smoothed upon her brow, and woven into close braids; and then watching anxiously for the quick glance of sorrowful pleasure that would tell her when her countenance wore the look which so much resembled her mother's.
               But unobservant as Mrs. Maitland was, she saw that the great change which was passing over Brendice was only an external one; at best that her heart was only momentarily softened. Her influence was not subduing, not elevating, that proud, revengeful nature. With her best endeavor, she could not find her way to the girl's heart. She was exciting her pity and gaining her respect; but she could not win her love.
               In her struggles—that quiet, patient, but earnest, unremitting attempt could be called nothing but one long struggle—to lift her thoughts to Heaven, there was only this reward for Mrs. Maitland:—
               The meek folding of the arms upon the breast, and the unuttered words: "God's time is the best time! and though it tarry," wait for it; it will surely come, for "in my distress I cried unto the Lord," and "He will fulfil the desire of them that fear Him!"
               She had not found the way to Brendice's heart, pleasant and kind as the girl always was to her. She saw this more and more plainly as the nearer approach of death made her vision clearer; for the feeble lamp of life burned low as the sunlight of a soft Indian summer day disappeared from the horizon; fainter and fainter as the twilight deepened, and so gently going out, that the only watcher at the bedside knew not when the earthly life ended, nor when the heavenly began.
               Only for a week or two had she seemed more feeble; but Brendice knew that the time was near, the time when that worn, weary spirit should enter into its eternal rest, the time when the obligation which had so weighed upon her, would be discharged; and the most loving daughter could not have smoothed more tenderly than did she the earthly pathway for those trembling feet.
               Mrs. Maitland did not, herself, fully realize that the great change was so soon to come.
               She had been feeling very free from the slight pain which had troubled her for some time past, and the remembrance of her griefs was fading away with it. Even her most absorbing thought—anxiety for Brendice—was quite forgotten in the pleasure of having the girl constantly near her. She never now for a moment left Mrs. Maitland, who was not satisfied to have any one but her at her bedside, and who listened to her voice, which to the ear of the dying had become low and strangely sweet, as if it was a strain of far-off music; and gazed upon her countenance with an earnest, uncertain look.
               Sometimes she seemed to be in doubt whether it was a living face, or a beautiful painting she beheld, though often there swept over those features, when the eyes suddenly encountered the fixed untiring gaze of Mrs. Maitland, a tide of such conflicting emotions as she believed a painter might, in vain, seek to transfer to his canvas.
               It was only within a few hours of her death, as she roused herself from what she thought was a quiet, peaceful sleep, and opened her eyes to find Brendice kneeling at her bedside, with a face pale and distorted with agony, that the idea came to her that the end might be near, and that this the girl knew. But the startled look which came over her countenance passed quickly away, and, very far from understanding the cause of Brendice's emotion, she said, quietly:
               "Am I dying, dear? And are you sorry for me?"
               "No!" Brendice said, "not sorry for you, for death must be gain to such as you are!"
               "Then you are sorry for yourself, my child," Mrs. Maitland went on, very tenderly and lovingly, as she stretched out the feeble hand, and rested it on the girl's head. "That pleases me more than anything else could do, for it assures me that you have, at length, begun to love me a little, and will think of me after I am gone, and will remember the promise I wish you to make me, before I go."
               "No, madam," replied Brendice, firmly, "I will not deceive you, even to make you happy in this solemn hour. I am not sorry for myself, although you have been so kind to me. Our ways in life would have been widely apart, only that I knew this hour must soon come; and in all time, our lives could never have been bound together. And you must not seek to extract that promise from me, you have so often wished I would make. It assuredly will never be spoken. I will not utter the prayer, 'And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.'"
               And though her eyes were fixed on the face of the dying, and she knew it was so, she rose to her feet, and her head was held firmly erect: "'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.' 'Good measure, pressed down, and running over.'"
               Mrs. Maitland closed her eyes.
               "God's time is the best time!" she said, faintly and resignedly. "When that time arrives, do not be sorry that it has not come sooner, Brendice, for who can tell that I may not know when your thoughts will turn to me? My mother died at my birth, and I never had a sister or a daughter, or any very dear female friend, and our lives, your earthly and my heavenly one, I am very sure something, sometime, will bind together! But what is it, my child?"
               She again lifted her eyes to see Brendice bending low over her, with that look of agony, intenser than before, overspreading her face.
               
               "What is it, my child? What do you wish to say to me?"
               The girl's lips parted more than once before the words came, but when she did speak, it was with as much earnestness as distinctness, though the first sentence she uttered seemed to be addressed to herself, rather than her companion.
               "My work will not be well finished, the obligation will not all be discharged, unless this is done."
               And then to Mrs. Maitland:
               "You have said, many times, that my face is the object on which you would look your last, and that my voice is the sound you would listen to. Think again! Your son, for aught I know, is dead. I have no doubt but he and my father perished together. But there is another! would you see him? The tide is just turning, and I think there is yet some hours before you. Shall I go for him? If I do, good-by, forever!" And Brendice took Mrs. Maitland's hands gently in her own, and bending lower over her, touched her lips, for the first time, to the pale brow.
               "I will go! Adieu, forever!"
               But the fingers of the dying woman, for she seemed to know all that Brendice meant, fastened tightly on the hands that held them, when the kiss was pressed on the brow, and a contented, happy smile came to her face, as she murmured:
               "Do not leave me, my child! You are my best beloved, either of the living or of the dead. Let me look on your face, let me listen to your voice, to the last!"
               And then she whispered for some moments longer—till the quiet sleep came again, though Brendice caught only these words: "My Maker is my husband; the Lord of hosts is His name."
               The hours were passing away, and the tide was rising higher and higher on the beach, each dash of the waves sounding in Brendice's ears like a knell, tolling ever more deeply and mournfully. The girl had been greatly moved by the last words spoken to her.
               Mrs. Brown stepped into the dwelling, but seeing that the sick woman, whom no one, but Brendice, imagined was so near her death, appeared very comfortable, and that everything about her was clean and well-ordered, went quietly away without disturbing her; telling Brendice, who, she observed, was not as calm and self-possessed as she had before found her, that Mrs. Maitland was very much better, and that Emma should come in and spend the night with her.
               The time passed on. The daylight was fading, and, at length—
               A darkness came before Brendice's eyes. She lifted her head to the window which opened towards the sea, and a confused murmur of all discordant and strange noises rung in her ears.
               But the darkness could not obscure the white crest of the wave, as it came, with awful majesty, slowly rolling on; and those confused noises could not shut out the sound of that dash against the rocks.
               The tide was in! And with its ebb a life would pass away!
               Brendice sank down on her knees upon the floor, writhing in silent but bitter agony. She was thinking, however, of herself.
               Her work was done. Mrs. Maitland needed no more care; and then all at once it flashed upon the mind of the girl, that she had not discharged the obligation she was under to him who had saved her life.
               After the first few days of conflicting feelings, she saw now, it had been no self-sacrifice to serve Mrs. Maitland. On the contrary it had been a privilege and a pleasure to do so, because she was so gentle and so good; and because she had been a mother. She had only been actuated by pity and respect, in her conduct towards her. And she would have loved her very much, before this, but for the memory of that terrible crime, committed so long ago.
               The fetters of that deep obligation were on her hands still.
               "My child, are you here? It is becoming very dark!"
               The eyes were dimming with death, now!
               "I cannot see you, Brendice! Put your hands in mine, and sing to me!" said Mrs. Maitland.
               "I heard you sing once;—it must have been very many years ago. We were walking along the beach, late at night,—Luke and I. Oh, no! not so very long ago; only the night before he was drowned. How strange it should have happened to be that night! The remembrance of your song has come to me many times since, in my sleep, and I always dream it is an angel who is chanting it. The words must be, I think, a Litany for the dead.
               "Perhaps the prayers of the living will not aid us, after we are gone, Brendice! yet it would be pleasant to think, when we are dying, that our image will not pass away from the heart, nor our name from the lips of those we have loved, but will come up to their remembrance in the most solemn hour, and will be breathed into the ear of God. The prayers for the dead, I am sure, must bring down a blessing on the living, though I have been taught to believe they will not profit the departed!"
               Brendice laid her trembling hands on Mrs. Maitland's open palms, and stifling her emotion as well as she was able, sang in imperfect rhymes, and broken measure, fragments of the simple lines she had translated months before, from an old French Litany, one of the last lessons assigned her by her father: 
                     
                        "Mary, whose griefs with thy life were all ended,
                        Angels, most blest, for ye never offended,
                        Patriarchs, released from your dark, dreary prison,
                        Prophets, consoled by the glorious Vision,
                        
                           Pray, Pray!
                        
                        Pray for the souls of the Faithful Departed!"
                     
                  
               
               "Sing on! It is very dark, I cannot see you; but I hear your voice," said Mrs. Maitland, "and it is most sweet to me! Did not some one say, Amen?
               
               "There is a footstep on the beach—it is my son's! He is living. It is I who shall be on the other side, waiting for him; and listening for your voice, Brendice!
               "My memory seems to be leaving me! What is that song which the Redeemed shall sing, my child?"
               The waves were not washing the rocks now; and with the sound of the retreating tide, came up, from far away over the water, the call of a solitary sea-bird. And then from the north, on the still night air, floated down another sound.
               It came from the tall tower of St. Mary's. And Brendice, without thought, and as if moved by a will independent of her own, blended her voice,—so strangely sweet and solemn that it was not strange the dying woman thought it truly the voice of the Redeemed,—with that silvery tone:
                  
                     
                        "Hallelujah!
                        
                        "Blessing, and honor,
                        "And glory, and power,
                        "To Him,—on the Throne
                        "Forever and ever!"
                     
                  
               
               And then, again, she took up the chant, for the overpowering sensation would not be shaken off, and the gripe upon her hands was firmer; the white lips would never part again! 
                     
                        "Ye whose steps were undefiled,
                        Following the Meek and Mild;
                        Ye who passed through bloody seas,
                        Ye who scorned earth's vanities;
                        Ye who watched in garments white,
                        With the Life-lamp burning bright;
                        Ye, who freed from earthly sin,
                        'To the joy' have entered in;
                        
                           Pray, Pray!
                        
                        Pray for the souls of the Faithful Departed!"
                     
                  
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               BACK TO THE OLD HOME.
               THAT strange sensation would not immediately pass away.
               What kept her there, for more than an hour, kneeling silently beside that bed, with her hands still lying in the clasp which was now stiffening about them, with no paralyzing emotion of fear or dread upon her, and not without vigor of thought and her usual strength of body, but with a feeling of solemn calmness and repose, as welcome to the mental as to the physical system, and so welcome to both that it seemed the lapse of time could not diminish the pleasure,—she could not tell.
               Brendice wondered if that calmness and repose was not such as may rest upon the dead, while they are waiting till ages shall pass away, and the end of all earthly things shall come.
               It was a soft, still night. There were many clouds in the sky; some very thin and vapory, and some, though they presaged no immediate storm, were so heavy, that, in sweeping ing over the crescent moon, they quite shut out the silvery light, for many minutes together.
               One of these thick clouds was just slowly passing, and through a rift, for a brief space of time, the moonlight gleamed.
               Brendice had thought she caught the sound of footsteps. It was a heavy tread, though the person tried to walk lightly. She lifted her head at the instant that the rift passed over the face of the moon, and taking her hands gently from the cold clasp about them, drew back into the shadow, as the light, now almost unobscured, fell on the white face which lay upon the pillow.
               Hours before, Brendice had drawn Mrs. Maitland's bed out near the windows which opened to the south and east. She would not have the dying woman's last look at nature to be on the dry, withered grass, the naked fields, and the distant hills, so sadly gay with autumn's sickly bloom, and all speaking so forcibly of dissolution and decay; but on the ever vigorous, ever active, eternal sea!
               Very fair lay that white face in the soft moonlight. A calm, pleasant smile was on the features, and the eyes were closed as in sleep.
               Again she heard that tread! and there, standing but a few feet from the window, furtively peering through the vines whose clustering green leaves were yet but slightly touched by the frost, was the face of a man. He was holding something in his arms, carefully and tenderly; and, as he drew a step nearer, she perceived that his burden was a slumbering child.
               The countenance of the dead, which looked so like the face of peaceful sleep, was fully revealed to those eager, questioning eyes; but Brendice, crouching on the floor at the foot of the bed, and where the shadow fell about her form, could not be plainly observed; the outlines of her figure, and a portion of her dress, only, being discernible.
               The form and countenance of the man were clearly enough seen by her, however, though for a moment she could scarcely believe that she was not dreaming; for that man was Luke Maitland!
               Apparently assured that the occupant of the bed was soundly sleeping, and knowing that his mother's slumbers were never very easily disturbed, he drew nearer to the window and spoke softly.
               The rift had passed over the moon now, and between it and the horizon was a great sea of billowy clouds, each broader and denser than its predecessor.
               "Emma,—Emma Brown, is that you?" he asked; "don't be frightened! It is I,—Luke! Come around to the door; I wish to talk with you. But mother must not know I am here, and no one but you, Emma! I went down to your father's house to see if I could find you without being observed by any one else, for I had learned the boys were all out with their boats to-night; and I heard some saying, as I stood near the open window, that you were here. Your mother was telling some stranger that Mrs. Maitland had been sick, though she was much better now, and that you had gone over to pass the night with her. But come around to the door!"
               Brendice had risen to her feet.
               She looked up to the sky, and unknowing why, saw, with satisfaction, that for half an hour, most likely, the moon would not look out again from its thick veil of clouds; and then she went to the open door before which Luke was standing.
               "I am glad you are not frightened, Emma!" he said, trying to find her hand, and, failing to do so, placing his fingers upon her shoulder. "I was afraid you would be, for I suppose that you and every one else about here thought I was dead. I do not wish to undeceive any one now, least of all, my mother.
               "I am going away again. Two hours hence I hope to be on ship-board, and she would have over again all the old grief of a separation from me, with far deeper bitterness than before.
               "I have only come here to bring this child to her; and you must tell her, Emma, that one to whom she is very dear, wishes her to care for it.
               "She will not trouble you with questions, and no one else will be aware that you know anything about him.
               "Tell my mother that the little fellow's parentage is respectable. She will find his baptismal name, and that of his mother, on a slip of paper I have fastened to his dress, not knowing that I should have opportunity to put him in your arms. Tell her that he who trusts him to her, holds the child's kind treatment and careful training as the first thing in life.
               "You will not betray me, Emma! It is said I have been guilty of a great crime," continued the young man, now with much emotion. "I know my mother does not believe it, though it would kill her, if I had a public trial. I hope you do not; but my life might be in danger, if it were known that I was in the neighborhood. Promise me no one shall know it, through yourself!"
               Those calm and solemn feelings, so strange and so sweet, which had been pervading her soul for the last two hours, and which she had wished might forever remain, had all fled, as quickly as the lightest feather is blown away by the breeze, at the sound of that voice; and Brendice's heart was so bounding with joy, that she feared her emotion would betray her.
               His life was then, perhaps, in her hand!
               The question did not come up in that moment: What crime had he been guilty of? She thought only this: Now that debt can be paid!
               She conquered her emotion, and whispered so softly that the young man scarcely caught her words—so softly that he did not suspect it could be any one but Emma Brown who uttered them:
               "I promise!" and she stretched out her hands and took the sleeping child.
               The little creature partially awoke and threw up his arms, burying one chubby fist and fat wrist in Brendice's loosened hair, and twining the other about her neck, breathing a little short bird note of intense satisfaction; and then he was again in a sound sleep.
               Brendice had taken advantage of Luke's sudden retreat from the door, when he thought the child was waking, and stepped back quickly into the room, sitting down beside the dead woman; and the young man, seeing, indistinctly, the outlines of her figure against the window, and fearful of disturbing his mother, remained silent at the doorway, wondering why Emma had left him so suddenly; but rather glad that she had done so.
               Had she remained longer, gratitude for the promise she had so readily, and without questioning him, made, might have led him to speak words which he had never intended to utter, for Mrs. Maitland had been altogether mistaken in supposing that her son had any other than brotherly affection for the sprightly little girl who had been his playmate from their childhood.
               Luke waited but for the briefest instant near the door, to see if the girl intended to return to him, and then he walked lightly and rapidly away; not directly to the spot where he had left his boat, however, but down along the beach, past the fish-houses, until he reached the most distant—that which stood a little apart from the others.
               There he paused; looking up, through the darkness, to the dwelling, thinking of the voice he heard the last night he had stood there, with his mother leaning on his arm; and wondering why, though the questions were on his lips all the time he was talking as he supposed to Emma Brown, he had asked her nothing about Brendice Du Bois.
               All was silent about the dwelling; and the little faint, flickering light, he had always before, at all hours of the night—and how many times his eyes had sought it!—seen there, had disappeared now; and Luke turned and walked away, without looking behind him.
               When the moonbeams again shone out upon the sea, his boat, guided by the beacon light, was half-way up to the Port, from which a ship was to sail, the next morning, for an Italian city.
               Only one thought, as has been said, had passed through Brendice's mind, while listening to Luke.
               After the sound of his footsteps had ceased to reach her ear, however, she remembered with satisfaction that the desire might be fulfilled which Mrs. Maitland had expressed, almost with her latest breath, when the idea occurred to her that her son was still living. Luke would not learn, most likely, for some time, that his mother was dead. When he had spoken of returning to the ship, he made some remark which she did not fully understand, but which she thought had reference to an anticipated long absence from the neighborhood.
               But the next thought which came to her was a far less agreeable one. What was she to do with that child whose little head was now pillowed upon her shoulder, and whose soft curls, so pale that the moonlight which now came brightly shining through the window, was changing them to shining silver, were mingling with her own dark hair, while the warm, sweet breath fell upon her cheek; and who only clung to her more closely as she gently attempted to remove the encircling arm from her neck, in order to place him upon her bed?
               Why had she taken him at all in her arms, and what was she now to do with him?
               She looked for the slip of paper which Luke had said was fastened to his dress. It was not to be found; but a slight rent in the soft fabric showed where it might have been torn away.
               
               It was easy enough to decide, however, what she should do with him. Emma Brown would soon be in.
               The night was not far advanced. It was very little past nine o'clock yet. She had just stepped in a moment, on her way to Mrs. Maitland's, Brendice rightly conjectured, to see if Miss Jones was quite well, and if she was not rather lonely to-night, as William was out on the water with his boat; and her minute had stretched out beyond an hour.
               When she came in, Brendice would tell her that some one, not far from the time Mrs. Maitland died, had left the child at the door.
               She had heard footsteps, but saw no one going away from the dwelling. She could not conjecture whose child it was, but then she knew very few people in the neighborhood. Did Emma recognize it? And when she returned home to inform her mother that Mrs. Maitland was dead, would she ask her father what should be done with the child?
               That was what she would say to Emma, and no one could compel her to tell more.
               It could not be expected that she would be very observant of anything besides Mrs. Maitland, when the woman was dying, and Brendice was there alone with her; and if there should be a little confusion in her story, no one would think strange of it, at such a time as that solemn hour.
               The child, of course, would not be recognized by Miss Brown, nor by any one else; and Emma's father could send the babe to the almshouse, or to the Asylum at N——.
               This little creature, whose arm was around her neck,—whose kind treatment and careful training Luke Maitland, who, when he was a boy of sixteen, had saved her own life, had said was the first thing, on earth, to him—this child would have been so tenderly cared for by that gentle being lying there so white and still! For aught Brendice knew, the pure spirit was now hovering over her with a patience which freedom from its earthly tenement could hardly bring nearer to perfection; and a faith which often filled the girl with fear, so undermining did it seem to be to that purpose she tried to establish, immovably, in her heart,—waiting with patience and faith for the good to triumph.
               Then she began to think of her own unloved, uncared for childhood. But this did not soften her heart with respect to the little one.
               She felt very bitterly towards the world.
               The people at The Sands were beginning to be kind to her, and were as friendly as she would allow them to be; but how long had it been since they had regarded her as half an idiot, and had talked of sending her to the almshouse? No one but Mrs. Maitland had showed her kindness, or tried to assist her (Brendice did not know how many had gone with pitying hearts and willing hands to her door on the day she went over to The Rocks) when she found herself all alone in the world, until it had become very apparent that she was entirely competent to take care of herself.
               The old gentleman still at the Ocean House had, a few days after the event happened, sent a kind note to Mrs. Maitland and herself, inquiring if he could do anything for those who, it was supposed, had been made childless and fatherless by the sad affair in which his young friends had been indirectly interested. And somebody had told her that when her father had first arrived in the neighborhood, fifteen years before, there was more than one woman who would willingly have received her into her family.
               Whoever had wished to do so, might manifest her unexercised benevolence now, by taking care of this child; or Mr. Brown might send him to the almshouse.
               With a firmer hand she released her hair from his clinging fingers, and removed his arm from her neck, preparatory to laying him upon a bed, resolutely turning her face from him, though low half-smothered sobs were bursting from his lips.
               There was a work before her far different from the rearing of a little innocent babe. She owed nothing to any one, now that debt to Luke Maitland was discharged. If her silence ensured his safety—
               Safety from what?
               Brendice was standing by the doorway, looking out to see if Miss Brown was coming, as the question arose in her mind: If he had been innocent, as she had not doubted he was, of the crime of which it was supposed he was guilty, why had he not, when referring to it, denied the commission of the deed?
               She laid the child down, where she stood, so gentle, however, as not entirely to wake it from its slumbers, and then she staggered back into the room and sank down, without strength, beside the bed of the dead woman, not fainting, but well nigh paralyzed.
               It was thus she was found by Emma Brown and Miss Sally Jones, whom the suddenly timid and thoughtful girl had persuaded to accompany her to Mrs. Maitland's dwelling, as she did not like to be out so late alone, offering to return, after they should have stopped a few minutes with the sick woman, and pass the night with Miss Sally, she would be so lonely, in William's absence.
               As Miss Jones, who, on looking through the open window, saw only the two women, whose positions told her plainly enough what had happened, stepped directly to the bedside, and lifted Brendice from the floor, supposing the cause of her extreme physical weakness and mental agitation to be only induced by the presence of death in the apartment, and the loneliness of her situation, and thinking of nothing but soothing her, with kind and gentle words,—it was Emma who discovered the child, and whose account of the affair went through the neighborhood. The girl had a very vivid imagination, and the story lost nothing by circulation.
               Brendice Du Bois was not troubled with questions concerning the child, for no one supposed that she knew anything about him.
               Not even when the funeral,—which took place the next day, was over, and Mr. Brown returned to the dwelling to tell her that Mrs. Maitland had bequeathed to her all the little property she possessed, and to take the child away, as she expected he would, to send it to the almshouse—were any questions asked of her; but the girl said the little one might remain with her, for the present, at least, for if Mrs. Maitland was alive she undoubtedly would try to take care of the child, as he had been found at her door; and if she, Brendice, accepted what was given to her, it would be solely for the purpose of assisting her in his support.
               The neighbors only said the poor friendless girl wanted some object in the world to love and care for; though they were very sure she would soon find that the trouble and expense of the child far more than counterbalanced the pleasure which the presence of the little fellow, pretty and interesting as he was, could possibly afford her.
               Whatever Brendice thought of that, however, he remained with her, though his support was not, in any measure, derived from the little bequest made her by Mrs. Maitland.
               On the morning after the funeral, the girl rose very early from the couch where she had passed a sleepless night, and rolling together the few simple, but pretty articles of clothing she had purchased with the avails of her labor while she was with Mrs. Maitland, and attiring herself in her worn, scanty fishing-dress, brushing her hair back from her face, and carelessly knotting it in the old unbecoming way, and lifting the child almost savagely in her arms, went out from the house. She locked the door behind her, and then walked down over the ledge and along the white sand towards her old home.
               The Indian summer had passed away on the night Mrs. Maitland died. This morning, a cold, damp wind was blowing briskly from the north-east, each gust which swept over the hills bearing away such showers of the bright-hued leaves, fast changing now, that the forest seemed fading before the gray morning as quickly as the gorgeously-tinted sunset sky at the swift coming of night.
               Brendice turned her face, which had grown thin and pale during the past few days, up towards the hill-side. Under the shelter of some tall, white pines, a spot she herself had selected, was the grave, beside which she was standing yesterday as chief mourner. She would have walked up there this morning, and replaced the sods upon the yellow sand with her own hands, only the air was so cold and damp that the child must not be exposed to it for such a length of time as the long walk, and the sad task to be performed, would require.
               He was nestling very close to her now, and the little cheeks looked blue and pinched in the chilly air, and Brendice, as she glanced down into the face, as the lips attempted to syllable a name he had many times tried to utter, but, fortunately, in such an indistinct manner that no one but herself conjectured upon whom he was calling—thought how much better it would be if the little fragile flower was lying beneath the coffin lid on that still, white breast, than struggling to find life in the cold, hard soil into which it had been so strangely transplanted.
               No tender emotion for the child, she believed, could ever enter her heart. No dawning love for the sweet young face and little winning ways, or pity for the utter friendlessness which, but for her, he might very soon learn was the portion of his childhood, induced Brendice to take charge of the boy.
               Not these, but that another item could be set down in her account against those whose crimes had so embittered her life.
               There were two of them now!
               She looked back from the little face, up again towards the distant hills which the deepening mist was fast shutting out from her sight.
               When the long cold storm, now just coming on, should have passed away, only the clustering pines, whose tall branches seemed guiding the thoughts up to heaven, and whose low, sweet, unbroken song was so full of words of hope and faith—fit monuments for the gentle sleeper resting there, in her white robes, made ready, waiting till the marriage of the Lamb shall come; only the denuded branches of the wide forest, the brown, leaf-strown earth, and here and there a clump of the sombre evergreens could be seen.
               And she thought how quickly the pale, bright beauty of the one green spot in the desert of her existence had worse than withered.
               She would have fed the fountain which leaped up from that solitary oasis with the springs of her life; she would have deepened its verdure with her blood; but suddenly, in a night, a deadlier growth than the fabled upastree had sprung up in that unnatural soil, and beneath the pendant leaves, dripping with poisonous dews, she must forever stand.
               Luke Maitland had referred to the now wide-spread suspicion that he was guilty of her father's death; and without uttering a word of self-justification, or saying he could give the best proof that the suspicion was not well founded, had only whispered, "You will promise not to betray me?"
               And Brendice, knowing he believed that he was addressing another, yet speaking for herself, had answered:
               "I promise!" thus severing the right arm of her revenge.
               "No, no!" she murmured, quickly and audibly, as the thought had come to her; and she turned her eyes oceanward to where a deeper haze seemed settling down upon the horizon. I am bound by no promise there; and my arm shall be as strong and firm, when once it is raised to strike, as his hand was awkward and unequal to sustain, when the lives of my mother and her babe were entrusted to his care."
               The belief was continually fastening itself more firmly on her mind, though there seemed no reason why it should be so, that the lighthouse keeper was the man whom her father, for so many years, had been waiting to find.
               She hoped it was so, and now, very soon, she would know; for the purpose of speedy revenge had been settling upon her all through the past night, as the long tedious hours dragged on. She was lying upon her pillow; but many times she had put away from her with a firm hand the little curly head that tried to nestle so closely to her side; and her eyes had been fixed on that Medusa-like beacon-light, flaming up brightly against the cold blue sky.
               Brendice had drawn near her home.
               She had been walking very slowly, pausing often to look away up to the hills on the one hand and the ocean on the other, and the cool, damp air was chilling her through. The shawl she had wrapped about her was very soon taken off her shoulders, and folded about the child. Her thoughts were so busy, however, that she had not heeded the cold, or the weight of the little boy upon her arm; nor did she heed the footsteps which had been hesitatingly echoing hers for many minutes, until some one was close beside her, and a frank, pleasant, but now slightly nervous voice, pronounced her name.
               The voice had said "Brendice!" and the repetition of the name, coupled with another word—an expletive which would have been uttered very softly, was on the speaker's lips. But when she turned her head, and looked into the face which sought hers, the young man started with surprise, and called her Miss Du Bois.
               William Jones was, however, not to be so easily moved from the purpose he had, for months past, been cherishing, in relation to the girl; and, besides, as he glanced at that countenance a second time, he saw there was an expression on the features which astonishment and displeasure at the suddenness and familiarity of his address had not called there.
               "My aunt went over to your house an hour since, Miss Du Bois," he said, "but the door was locked. She thought you would be lonely there, and she wished to ask you to come and stay with us, you and the little boy.
               "As she could not find you, I came out for that purpose, and to repeat what she wished to say, and to speak to you on my own account, too: to tell you what I have been wishing to say ever since—ever since your father was drowned; only I could not ask you to leave Mrs. Maitland. Will you come to our house, and make it, henceforth, your home?
               "It shall be a nice, pleasant home to you, and this that I see you have returned to, is very dreary and destitute.
               "Will you go with me, Brendice, and be a daughter to my kind aunt, who, these two months past, has been learning to think more of you than she does of any girl at The Sands? And—let me take the little boy, and put your arm in mine, dear Brendice—you are very cold and weary—and walk away home with me, to become the cherished wife of one who has known, for a long time, how much superior in good"—
               "Hush, William!" she said, holding the child which he was trying to take from her, firmly in her arms.
               "You know not what you are saying! You and your aunt are sorry for me, and I thank you both. But I need no pity!" And though a tear was trembling in her eye, the calm, stony expression on her features deepened.
               "I need no pity; and the words of affection I can never listen to from any one! They are not for such an unwomanly nature as mine is now, and must always be. But if you will, you can, perhaps, do me a great and invaluable service, William Jones!"
               She was gazing, abstractedly now, away over to The Rocks, and he did not see her face.
               "What is it, Brendice?" he asked, eagerly, convinced that, for the present, at least, he must relinquish the plan he had been so long cherishing.
               William Jones was high-minded and honorable, simple fisherman though he was.
               His strong feelings, and the purposes to which they gave rise, quite too earnest, sometimes, for his peace of mind, he never suffered to interfere with his sense of justice; and so knowing what he supposed no third person did, and, perhaps, made more keen-sighted by his own emotions, seeing how patiently another was waiting for the time to come when he could seek the acquaintance of the French girl, he had himself kept silent, till he fancied all obstacles were removed.
               Years later, after his aunt had, of her own free choice, found another home, William had his reward for his self-abnegation, in the love of a warm-hearted, sensible girl, far better suited to him than she would have been whom he had first chosen; or the little frivolous Emma Brown, who had never been his choice.
               
               Brendice was looking towards The Rocks, quite shut out, now, from view, by the thickening mist.
               "If you will, you can, perhaps, render me a great service, William!" she had said.
               And he replied, with a question asked so earnestly that it was a promise to follow her bidding, whatever that might be: "What is it, Brendice?"
               She did not immediately answer, for she was replying to another question, silently asked of herself:
               Should she suffer any one, in the remotest degree, to aid her in the work she was contemplating?
               And then she remembered that lately, many times, when she had been looking out over the waters to the Convoy light, a film had crept over her eyes.
               Perhaps it was only imaginary; for when she glanced up to the red light away to the north, her vision had never failed; though, sometimes, as she looked there, it was through dropping tears; for then the sweet tones of St. Mary's bell would softly fall on her ear, and she remembered that mild, bright afternoon in early autumn—St. Michael's day it was, five years ago:
               That day on which she had tried to cast off the heavy burden that always rested on her shoulders, and in seeking to rid herself of which, she had drawn down a mountain of woe upon her head.
               Yes, she would let him aid her, in this!
               "Do you often look over there—to the islands? I mean, over to the lighthouse, when the lamps are burning?"
               "Yes!" he said, at a loss to conjecture what possible connection his doing so could have with what she might require of him. And as Brendice waited for a moment, after he had spoken, he repeated his affirmative, and continued:
               "Very often, and I always think of the keeper there, living in such a lonely way, and feel very sorry for him.
               "He has not been over to the mainland, now, for fifteen years. I used to see him occasionally before that time, and he had always a pleasant word even for such a little chap as I was then. It is said he was always somewhat eccentric; but after that young lady—Miss Rachel, they called her, who lived with the old miser at the place the fishermen know as The Stairs, because there is a flight of nice stone steps running down from the old man's grounds into the water—I suppose you have not seen them, as you have never been up to the Port—after the morning when the young lady who, no doubt, had had a hard time of it with her guardian, went down the steps and away in the boat with her lover, young Captain Singleton, whom she married and accompanied on his voyage to Italy, the Commodore never went to N—— again. It was said, after she had gone, that Mr. Aden was in love with the girl himself, though no one had suspected it; and took her elopement much more to heart than the old man did; for he, though he was very angry at first, was soon ready to admit that it was the best thing the girl could do, to marry the man who loved her."
               William said this with considerable feeling.
               "The old gentleman went away soon after the lady was married, to reside with his relatives; but his sister is dead, and her daughters have husbands now, and he has returned to his place here again, looking ten years younger then he did when he quitted it, my aunt thinks."
               
               The young man had said this, because Brendice was not yet ready to answer his question, but stood, looking away into the sea, in her old abstracted manner; but when he added, still simply, for the sake of saying something:
               "Mr. Aden has never been over to the mainland since, though I have heard that Mr. Hall, that is the old gentleman's name, and it is he who has been stopping at the Ocean House this season, and is there still, is determined that the keeper shall give up his post at the Convoy, and come over and live with him. He has built him a nice residence this summer, and"—
               Brendice turned and looked in his face so suddenly and earnestly that the young man paused abruptly.
               "Is he—the keeper, going to resign his post?" she asked.
               Jones had heard that he would not leave his post unless he was discharged; and he would not be likely to receive a dismissal, after performing the duties so faithfully as he had done. And he had never been a politician.
               "That light never dims, does it?" said Brendice, looking away again, oceanward.
               "I have never seen it burning dimly but once!"
               "And that was on the night"—
               Her face was still averted.
               "On the night after the accident!" he said.
               "When my father's boat came back with the tide, empty!"—She was looking at him now, earnestly.
               "And Luke's did not return at all!"
               Brendice did not observe how attentively he was watching the expression of her countenance as he said this. Her thoughts, at the moment, were widely different from his. She made an effort to speak calmly, and he did not perceive there was a tremulousness in her tone.
               "Did the light go out that night?" she inquired.
               "Yes, Brendice! I have denied it before, because I have always felt friendly towards the Commodore, and I would not say anything to injure him. But it is true.
               "After the fog had cleared away, for at one time, just past midnight, I believe it was, when the wind suddenly lulled, it hung heavily over the sea,—I was thinking too much, that night, to sleep,—I saw the light growing paler and paler, and two hours before daybreak it went out. It was while the fog lasted that the Essex struck the sand-bar. The pilot admitted that he saw both the lights after she had struck—the Convoy light and the red light at the Port.
               "Greyson denies that the lamps went out earlier than an hour before sunrise; but they had been relighted then. He says that the Commodore's boat was fretting against the rocks, and that in trying to haul it higher on shore, he not only lost his boat, but injured himself so much, that he was unable to return immediately to the lighthouse.
               "Very likely that was the case, for the boat was dashed to pieces on one of the other islands, though the accident happened earlier in the morning.
               "But what can I do for you, Brendice? You must remain here no longer. You are becoming wet and cold."
               "Only this!"—she said, in a half whisper, though no human being but the now sleeping child was within sight.—"If you ever see that light burning dimly again, come and tell me!"
               She opened the door as she spoke, and stepped into the miserable dwelling, looking back, for a moment, to add, "That is all!" in such a tone, and with such a look on her countenance, that the young man checked the words which were rising to his lips.
               After a moment of silent hesitation, he turned away and walked slowly up the beach, pondering on the strangeness of the request Brendice had made.
               What interest could she possibly have in Mr. Aden, or the manner in which he discharged the duties of his post? Her boat was very seldom on the water in the night, and he did not believe there was any one now among the fishermen on the coast whose safety she particularly cared for.
               If her father were living it might be imagined she was thinking the place over at the Convoy would be a very good one for him; but he who had tried so hard a few months before to have the present keeper discharged, in order to obtain the situation himself, must be a stranger to her.
               Mr. Aden she most likely had never seen, unless from a distance in her boat. He had never been over to The Sands, as Jones had heard, and it was before her father had come to the neighborhood that he had made his final visit to the Port.
               William had not been more than eight or nine years of age when, it was said, the keeper went for the last time to the mainland. He remembered the time well enough, though, for it had been impressed on his mind the succeeding day by what he then considered a very great disappointment, and which was so regarded, secretly, however, by one more interested than himself.
               He had run a long way up the beach to meet Greyson, as his boat came to the landing.
               Jerry was then a frequent visitor at the house of William's father, and his aunt Sally had managed to make the boy coax her to let him go out, at the time the fisherman's boat would return from The Rocks, and invite him down to supper.
               The next time Greyson went over to the islands Miss Jones and William were to go with him.
               He had been there on purpose that day to ask the Commodore when he should bring Sally to the Convoy to see how she liked the nice, comfortable dwelling-house, over which he hoped to see her installed, before long, as mistress.
               But Greyson did not go home with William Jones that night, to drink tea with his aunt.
               The young man remembered, now, how the poor fellow looked when he inquired how soon they were going over to The Rocks, and he had said, with a great sob, "Never!"
               And then he began to jabber in such a way, to himself, that the little boy was almost afraid of him, though he could not forget some words which Greyson had uttered. Among other things, he said that people might call him a fool as much as they pleased, for no doubt he was one; but he had wit enough to know whom he had been priest and sponsor for; and who it was, that, if he had received any christening at all, had the rite performed by a gentleman Greyson did not like to mention until he had got his things safe in the boat-house.
               For a long time after, months, at least, Jerry had never called the keeper of the lighthouse either Mr. Aden, or the Commodore; but had said simply he, or had referred to him only by pointing with his finger over towards The Rocks.
               
               He had never explained to any one why he did not go over to the Convoy to make his home there. He might have made some explanation to Miss Sally, when he next visited her, which was not until two or three weeks after the evening when William had run up the beach to invite him down to take supper; but she received him in such a manner that he had made a hasty exit from the house, and though fifteen years had since passed, had never re-entered it again.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               ALL SAINTS' DAY.
               IT was on a Holy Sabbath morning—the Feast of All Saints—that Brendice Du Bois, bearing in her arms the new burden she had voluntarily taken up, returned to her old home, which she had entered but a few times, and then solely for the purpose of looking after her fish, since the evening, months ago, on which she had walked away from it with Mrs. Maitland.
               A faint, sickening sensation passed over her as she closed the door against her companion, who would so gladly have taken her to his own comfortable home, either as his wife, or as a companion for his aunt.
               She felt no regret that she had silenced him so suddenly, though, sinking down upon a seat by the window, she sat following with her eyes his retreating form, till it passed, through the thick mist, beyond her sight. Neither did she think, just then, how lonely and desolate her situation was, especially at this season of the year, when the long, cold winter was just coming on; to say nothing of the dreariness and discomfort of her abode, of her poverty, and the wants of herself and the child.
               She thought only of what William Jones had said of the man at the Convoy,—how confidently he had spoken of the lighthouse keeper as a gentleman he had once well known, and concerning whose identity with Mr. Aden, it might be inferred, there had never been with any one the least question.
               The young man had not expressed to her the thoughts which were now passing through his mind; and, in fact, the words he had heard Greyson utter long ago had not occurred to him until after he parted with the girl.
               Brendice was thinking of what he had said, and more intently now than when she was listening to him, debating with herself, as she was then, whether she should accept the assistance of another in the accomplishment of the purpose she had so much at heart.
               Now she was summing up what she had used as proof that the lighthouse keeper was the Mr. Maitland who, her father had told her, was the murderer of her mother.
               The longer she reflected, the less weighty these proofs appeared to her, and a faint, sickening feeling came over her, as she thought, perhaps, she had as yet found no clue which would lead to the discovery of the guilty man.
               The child moved uneasily in her arms, and, without opening the sweet brown eyes, tried to speak the name: "Luke—Luke!"—and to say that he was cold and hungry; and when he had waked, and stared about the strange, uncomfortable-looking apartment, the little lips began to quiver with fear, and tears rolled down his cheeks.
               An hour after, however, the child was playing, contentedly, on the sanded floor.
               Brendice had torn away a loosened plank from the old boat, split it into pieces, and made a comfortable fire, and prepared for herself and the child some coarse but palatable food; and then had gone out into the rain, which was falling fast now, while the weather had become so cold that the ground was beginning to be iced over, and gathered handfuls of pebbles and sea-shells as playthings for L'Enfant.
               
               That was the name she had given the boy, to the great amusement of Miss Emma Brown, until Sally Jones had said, in her determined way, that Brendice certainly had the right to call him by whatever name she pleased, if she was going to take charge of him; and that Lang was as good a name as any other.
               When the child had been cared for, entirely to the little creature's satisfaction, for the old room was ringing with his peals of merry laughter, Brendice began to busy herself about the apartment. She felt that she could no longer, that day, continue the train of thought she had been following, when the waking of the child disturbed her.
               Then she remembered that this was the Sabbath. She had scarcely thought of it before. And one of the Church's holy-days.
               Mrs. Maitland had referred to it the past Sunday, as she sat, propped up in her bed, little thinking that it was her last earthly Sabbath.
               She had told Brendice, with her peaceful smile, that she had made up her mind to be sick that day, and be waited upon, and to be read to; and that a portion of the reading must be the Visitation of the Sick; for as she had never been really ill in her life, that service had never been read to her.
               "The next Lord's day," she said, folding her thin, white hands above her head, and looking away through the open window, up to the vapory eastern sky—"which is All Saints' Day, we will read together about the Blessed, who are sealed in their foreheads—the servants of our God—that great multitude whom no man can number, but whom our Saviour will know, each one by name.
               "Brendice, I have sometimes thought, when we are born again—born to the Life Eternal, that we shall be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord shall name. Those who have been termed Forsaken, and their inheritance Desolate, shall be called Hephzi-bah, and their portion Beulah;—no more Jacob, the Supplanter, but, for his earnest wrestling to obtain the blessing,—Israel, a prince, prevailing with God!
               "That innumerable multitude, clothed in white robes, with palms in their hands, standing about the Throne—the Throne of God and the Lamb, and singing, for evermore, the song of the Redeemed. Those who will see God, are the pure in heart, and it is the peacemakers who will be called His children.
               "Brendice, we will pray together on that holy-day—the next Sabbath; will we not? you will not go out any more, to walk alone upon the beach, and look so grievedly and hopelessly into the sea, as you have always yet done, when I sat down to read the Service of the Church!" she added, pleadingly, as she removed one trembling hand from her brow, and laid it on the girls arm. "We will together utter this prayer which the Church's thousands will breathe on the coming Sabbath:
               "'Grant us grace to follow Thy blessed Saints in all virtuous and godly living, that we may come to those unspeakable joys which Thou hast prepared for those who unfeignedly love Thee.'
               "You will promise me this, dear Brendice!
               "It has grieved me, very much, these months past, to think there was no voice to mingle with mine, when I read the beautiful and solemn Service of the Church; but henceforth, while I live, there will be two of us to engage in it, will there not? And I have been praying, Brendice, that when I am gone, the Lord will send some one to you, whom you will love, as I am loving you."
               She had been silent for a moment, and then had repeated the request:
               "Henceforth, while I live, you will read the service with me."
               It was not much to promise, for the girl was thinking that the last earthly Sabbath for that gentle being, if not already arrived, must come very soon, and she replied by returning the soft pressure upon her fingers; and then she had taken a low stool and sat down by the bedside, and read in a solemn, sweetly-modulated voice, the Service for the Sick, until she came to the beautiful words of blessing. The blessing which the Hebrew leader, at the command of God, instructed the high-priest and his sons to pronounce over the congregation of Israel as they journeyed to the promised land. The beautiful words with which our holy and tender Mother blesses her numerous offspring, as, weary and way-worn, but with the desert now passed, they climb up the height, and look away—away from Pisgah, up, over the dark river that rolls between, away to the better and lasting Inheritance: for Christ, himself, going before, has prepared the place for them!
               And then Mrs. Maitland, raising herself higher in the bed, had extended her hand and rested it on Brendice's head, and in a low, and tremulous, but trusting voice, repeated the words:
               "The Lord bless thee and keep thee. The Lord make His face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up His countenance upon thee, and give thee peace."
               The "Amen" had risen to Brendice's lips; but she checked its utterance.
               "The peace of God!" No doubt it was a most blessed thing—something to be greatly desired.
               But through the open window—what object, or what distance of time or space could shut out the sound?—she heard a voice coming up from the never-silent sea; her father's voice:
               "Revanche!"
               What had she to do with peace? And she shook off the feeling which was stealing over her.
               Mrs. Maitland had watched the changes of her countenance. She took the Prayer-book after she ceased speaking, and held it for some moments in her clasp, with her eyes closed, but her lips moving inaudibly, and then gave it back to the girl.
               And this Sunday morning, as Brendice was picking up her clothing to return to her old home, she had taken the book, the only thing that she did take from the house, and put it in her bundle.
               She had scarcely realized what she was doing at the moment; but now, as the remembrance of the past Sunday came to her, and she, in her attempts better to dispose the poor furniture of the miserable apartment, had stood before the little dingy window which opened towards the west, and looked away through the cold, drizzling rain, up to the clump of evergreens on the distant hill-side, she thought of the promise to Mrs. Maitland:
               "On the Feast of All Saints, we will utter together the prayer which the Church will offer."
               She took the book and an old copy of the French Bible—she knew in what part of the sea-chest to look for it, for she had often seen it there, and sometimes, though not frequently, for her father had not taught her so to do, she had read a few chapters in it,—and sat down, turning to the Service for the Holy Day.
               Where was she now, who, only one short week since, had spoken, so confidently, of reading the Service with her?
               The question passed through the girl's mind, as her eyes rested on the first Lesson for the evening.
               Perhaps far away in infinite space, beyond the sight or the knowledge of earthly things; gone—"Passed away as a shadow, and a post that hasteth by; as a ship that passeth over the waters; a bird that hath flown through the air, or an arrow shot at a mark;" but, "Numbered among the children of God," and "the care of them is with the Most High!"
               And Brendice thought of herself, and read again and again the words which seemed so applicable to her own case:
               "We have gone through deserts where there lay no way; but as for the way of the Lord, we have not known it."
               There was no more prayer for Mrs. Maitland now, no more striving to follow the blessed Saints, in whose footsteps, Brendice thought, as she was reading the beatitudes, the departed one had so closely walked; one, herself, among them, now, with the words of praise, henceforth, forever upon her lips.
               And the prayer for that day was not for Brendice to utter, for as she turned to the Gospel for the Sabbath, she read:
               "Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Till seven times?
               "And Jesus saith unto him, Until seventy times seven."
               As often as he shall sin against thee!
               And Brendice had not forgiven once! No, and never would forgive!
               The softer expression which overspread her features as she had looked up the hill-side, and thought of her so far away, now among the Blessed, forever removed from all sorrow and pain, had faded very quickly.
               Beyond the opposite window, though now shut out from sight by the heavy rain, lay the islands.
               The hard, cold look, so habitual to it, though nature never meant it to be so, came back to her face.
               When her work was done—when measure should have been given for measure—she might again, perhaps, look over the pages of the Holy Book, and see if there was anything written there for those who, instead of leaving their wrongs in the hands of Him who has said, "Vengeance is mine; I will repay," have taken the adjustment of their affairs entirely upon themselves.
               The little boy upon the floor, though well pleased with his new, wonderful toys, was not so absorbed by his play that he did not often turn the sweet eyes timidly around the strange room, and then up to the face he was beginning to love, to be assured, by its expression, that everything was just as it should be.
               He had been startled by the heavy fall of the Bible lid, and the snap of its clasp, and looked up to see the great change which had passed over her face, great even to him, the child of two and a half years, and he dropped his shells and got upon his feet, and hesitatingly drew near her, the tears trembling in his eyes, and the quivering lip restraining the sobs, only till he could put one little, soft, warm hand upon her fingers, and hide his face in her lap.
               The girl glanced at the little creature, and thought of what Mrs. Maitland had said, the past Sunday, that, when she was gone, the Lord would send some one to Brendice whom she could love.
               She folded her arms around the child, and drew him closely to her, wondering if heaven ever did, really, concern itself with the affairs of men; and hoping that the sweet child, now so innocent and loving, and possessing, as it seemed to, so happy a nature, might be spared such suffering as her childhood had known, and such bitter, maddening grief as was the portion of her youth; hoping, too:—her eyes had rested so long upon the Collect which she had promised to read, on this Holy-day, but which she could not bring herself to utter, that the form of words was passing through her mind:—hoping with an earnestness that was more than half a prayer, that, when this brief life was over, he might "Come to those unspeakable joys which Thou hast prepared for those who unfeignedly love Thee!"
               The desire for another's good was softening her heart; and the child looked up as the tears fell on his brow, and he nestled closer to her, twining his arms about her neck, and cooing gently and pitifully in the little endeavor to soothe her, till the eyelids began to droop, and the head sank down upon her shoulder.
               Then Brendice took up the little sound, in a voice sweet as that of the child, chanting over and over the closing lines of the hymn Mrs. Maitland had selected for the day. The leaf had been turned down, by her white, trembling fingers, at the words: 
                     
                        "And forever from their eyes,
                        God shall wipe away the tears."
                     
                  
               
               The child was still lying in her arms when the cold, dismal day drew to its close.
               It was dark early in that cheerless room; for the two windows in the apartment contained each but a dozen small panes of glass, and they were thickly curtained with cobwebs and dust.
               Here and there, as she looked out into the waning night, a light was springing up, and sending its cheerful rays through the darkness.
               The first which appeared, had blazed out widely over the sea; then the red light came down from the north, and a moment later, the lamps at the Ocean House were lighted.
               The boarders, with a single exception, had gone from the hotel, two months since; but the proprietor made the dwelling his permanent home; it would not be closed during the winter.
               Then lights in the other dwellings came out.
               In the distance, Brendice knew scarcely one of those residences from the other, she was still such a stranger in the place, though, from her earliest remembrance, her home had been there.
               She sat, for so long a time, idly watching them, that her room was almost dark when she rose to place the child upon the bed which had been occupied by her father, and on which articles of his clothing were still lying, as he had thrown them down, just before she had seen him for the last time, walking down the beach, to which his boat had returned empty.
               A shudder ran through her frame, and her fingers trembled as they touched the clothing which she wished to remove in order to make a place for the child to lie comfortably in, and something rustled down upon the floor. It was a folded paper.
               She did not notice it particularly. There was not light enough now in the apartment to enable her to see whether it bore any superscription or not, even if she had endeavored to do so.
               She wondered what it was; but she was so strangely nervous, as it seemed to her, though it was simply long-continued wakefulness, for she had slept very little during the last three nights, which was exerting its influence over her, that she had picked up the paper, and, scarcely glancing at it, dropped it into the pocket of the old coat, which with the other garments, she very quickly hung up in their formerly accustomed place, the darkest corner in the room, and then sank down on the couch, beside the child.
               The frozen rain was falling heavily upon the roof of the rude cabin, and beating against the window panes, and the cold waves were dashing monotonously and gloomily over the rocks.
               Brendice drew the sleeping child into her tender embrace, and thought how much another woman might love him; but the last object on which her eyes rested, before they closed in slumber, was the Convoy light; and her lips shaped themselves, at the close of that holy-day, to the words:
               "'Measure for measure; pressed down and running over.'"
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               CHRISTMAS EVE.
               THE early, cold winter was slowly passing on. It was a particularly severe one, even for that bleak coast. For many days in succession, would the fine dry snow slowly sift down, and then a cold, swift wind would lift the white covering from the earth, tossing it here and there at its will, filling up the highways, and stamping down the huge piles with its viewless feet, so firmly, that the roads would be, for a long time, well nigh impassable, and heaping the thick fleeces one above an other, till the fences and stone walls, and many a low habitation, for man as well as for beast, well nigh disappeared.
               The little fish-houses, all of them now, save one, quite unused during the winter, were more than once thus almost lost to view. But from out the extremity of the long snow ridge, a thin, blue smoke would curl up early each morning, through the frosty air; and no one ever went down to the dwelling without finding a clearing before its entrance, sufficiently wide for the door, which had been hung on the outside of the building, to swing in, and the snow swept away from the windows, so that the sunlight could find its way into the apartment, which was much more orderly and clean now than it had ever been before.
               Brendice Du Bois was very anxious that the few people who interested themselves in her welfare and that of the little boy, should have no reason to suppose that she needed assistance.
               She had voluntarily taken upon herself the charge of the child, and she felt, at most times, quite capable of accomplishing her task. It might not be long that he would remain with her. Some one who had a right to do so, might come and claim him, or she might be obliged to relinquish her care of him; but while she kept him, it should be without the aid of others. And, besides, she could not forget that some of the neighbors, at one time, had contemplated sending her to the alms-house.
               No one had offended her with what might be considered a real offer of assistance.
               Mrs. Adams, of the Ocean House, had brought her down some plain sewing; Brendice had learned from Mrs. Maitland to use the needle very cleverly.
               Miss Sally Jones had come over one day during the first week after Brendice's return to her home, and brought her spinning-wheel, and a bundle of "rolls," and taught the girl to spin. She wanted some coarse yarn for a home-made carpet.
               And during the winter, when the weather would permit, she went down daily on the beach and dug a basket of clams. They were for the old gentleman at the Ocean House, Mr. Hall. He was somewhat an invalid this winter, and he had sent down to inquire if she could furnish him with fresh shell-fish every day; and as Brendice was very glad to do so, when it was possible to gather them, a feeble little lad, the son of a poor woman, widowed by the shipwreck which had happened at the Bar some months before, whom the old gentleman found frequent occasion to employ, was sent down to the girl, every pleasant day, with a small basket and a bright silver "quarter" for the fish.
               The boy was to remain with "Lang"—Miss Jones' abbreviation was accepted—while the clams were dug; and the basket always brought something which added very much to Brendice's necessarily plain fare, and which helped to while away many an hour, which, otherwise, would have been very long and lonely.
               A dozen nice apples or pears, a handful of figs, a slice of dripping honey-comb, a cluster of raisins, or a few nuts, would be sure to come in the basket, well wrapped up in some good, instructive newspaper.
               The old boat, and the drift-wood she occasionally found along the shore, furnished her tolerably well with fuel. She had expected that she would be obliged to sell the new boat, and some other articles, perhaps, which had belonged to her father, to enable her to live through the winter; and before the spring-fishing came on, the purpose she had so much at heart, and which seemed daily to be strengthening, she hoped to have accomplished.
               What was to come after, she did not suffer herself to think. Most likely she would never use the boat again.
               The avails of her labor, however, furnished her with food, without the sale of anything which had been her father's; and she had been able, besides, to purchase such a warm, soft dress for her little charge, that he was very comfortable.
               She made it her especial care that he should be so, and happy, too; at first from principle, and afterwards from affection. The sweet-tempered, engaging little creature found his way to her inmost heart; and his smile, which seemed to light up the apartment like a ray of sunshine after the storm had passed, and the cunning little baby words he would try so hard to utter, awoke emotions which she had supposed herself incapable ever of experiencing.
               She did not know how much she loved the child until one night—it was Christmas Eve—the thought suddenly flashed across her mind that he might, perhaps, be taken immediately from her.
               The old gentleman at the Ocean House gave an entertainment to the children of the neighborhood; and Mrs. Adams herself came down to invite Brendice to go up to the hotel and take little Lang; bringing a warm shawl to wrap him up in, and promising that her son should come and help her carry the child.
               Brendice had not been away from her home since her return to it, now nigh two months ago, except when she went down on the beach for her basket of clams, or had taken a swift walk while the child was sleeping, over to the store, for the purchase of some article for her housekeeping.
               Miss Jones had been very anxious that she should spend Thanksgiving-day with her and William; and Mrs. Brown had compelled Emma, who was very unwilling to do so, to invite her to a quilting-party. Brendice had declined both invitations, and she was very loth to accept that from Mrs. Adams.
               The little boy was not old enough to appreciate the pleasant things prepared for the children, she said. The night was cold, and he had better be at home and asleep.
               And Mrs. Adams assented, but she added that the old gentleman wanted to see all the children in the neighborhood together. He had been at considerable expense to prepare the festival for them, and he was so very kind and good that she thought every one ought to be willing to make some little sacrifice for him. He had not a relative living within hundreds of miles, and no particular friend, now that Mr. Aden, over at The Rocks, to whom Mr. Hall had once been greatly attached, persistently refused to visit him. He had, besides, seen much trouble, and sometimes it weighed very heavily on his mind, making him, in his rather feeble state of health, almost sick, until he could, by the attempt to make some one else happy, regain his accustomed cheerfulness.
               At the best, however, his was a most solitary life, and she felt very sorry for him. He had been quite ill for a week or two past, but had brightened up, as the thought occurred to him of bringing the children together around the Christmas-tree.
               A Christmas festival had never been held at H——
               At St. Mary's, up at the Port, the holy season was observed with all its beautiful and impressive ceremonies.
               The old gentleman had formerly worshipped at St. Mary's, and he had been intending to go up to N——, and spend the holidays there, and renew the acquaintances he had formed there years ago. But his heart had failed him, as the time drew near, and so he would keep the feast here, and gather the little strangers about him.
               "None of the children here, besides my own," Mrs. Adams said, "know anything about the Church; and this little festival will, I am convinced, for Mr. Hall has made it a subject of prayer, produce a very pleasing and lasting impression on their young minds. You will certainly bring the child."
               And Brendice went, though very unwillingly; she could not well refuse, for she felt under great obligations to the stranger, and to Mrs. Adams, too, for the employment they had given her, and for the many very acceptable presents of newspapers and fruits the old gentleman had sent her.
               The festival was a very pleasant affair.
               The good-sized hall at the Ocean House was handsomely trimmed with evergreens, and brilliantly lighted. The walls were hung with pictures, inexpensive, the most of them, but very appropriate for the occasion; and the large Christmas-tree was as much admired by the old, as by the young, for all the people in the neighborhood must be gathered about it, Brendice thought, as she entered the hall, rather late, herself, as she wished to make her stay there as brief as possible.
               The child had fallen asleep in her arms, as she was carrying him up to the house, and had not waked when his blanket was removed, and Mrs. Adams had placed the little fellow beside her own babe in the crib, to be brought to St. Nicholas, she whispered to him softly, just as soon as he should open his eyes.
               Mrs. Maitland had thought, and with good reason, that the mother of Brendice Du Bois was, by far, the most beautiful woman she had ever seen; and as Mrs. Adams conducted her, who to some eyes might have seemed the almost perfect counterpart of that unfortunate lady, into the lighted hall, a similar thought occurred to her.
               Brendice had strangely altered, in her whole appearance, within the past few months. Mrs. Adams did not know which most to admire, the symmetry and delicacy of feature, the perfect good taste displayed in the arrangement of the simple toilet, or her quiet dignity and repose of manner when she suddenly found herself the object to which many wondering eyes turned now with manifest pleasure and respect.
               The host was an old man now; but, had it not been for the sad intelligence which had reached him some months before, and which had sensibly affected both his health and spirits, not aged for his eighty years. Even now, he seemed in better condition than when mention was made of him, earlier in this narrative, though more than fifteen years had passed over his head since the period then referred to.
               He had a fine, pleasant countenance, a somewhat sad, but kind smile; and the eye, yet undimmed, showed that the intellect, which had never been very brilliant, was not yet impaired by age.
               He received Brendice very kindly, holding her hand for a long time in his trembling fingers, and looking up from the soft cushions on which he half reclined—for he seemed rather more feeble than usual that evening—into her face, almost silently, but with an expression of pleased surprise on his features, and following her with his eyes as Mrs. Adams led her away, so that be could continue the remarks which her entrance had interrupted, to those gathered around the beautiful Christmas-tree. Half an hour later, he called her again to his side, and asked her if she would sing for him.
               Those were pleasant little songs which the children had been singing, he said; but he would like to hear a Christmas carol. Jerry Greyson had just been telling him that Miss Brendice had a very fine voice. He had heard her sing many times, and very nicely.
               If she knew some little simple rhyme for Christmas Eve, would she make an old man, who heard none but strange voices now, happy by singing it?
               Brendice flushed slightly, but she could not utter a refusal, for she saw that it would give the old gentleman pleasure to hear her sing, and what mattered it whether that group of girls gathered around Miss Emma Brown, several of whom had been the tormentors of her childhood, made themselves merry at her expense, or not?
               The host saw that she needed no more urging, and he turned to the children and spoke a few words to them, that Brendice might have time to collect her thoughts; but she was only listening to what he said.
               He had wished to tell them something more, he remarked, about Christmas; but he was becoming rather tired, and perhaps they were tired too, though he could detect no sign of weariness in the smiling little faces. He had wanted to say to them that it was not because Christ was born, that those who love him celebrate his birthday, but because he was born to die,—to die, that man might hereafter, have a life which shall never end.
               This tree, he said, ever green, was typical of the tree on which he suffered; never destructible, never to lose its beauty and verdure.
               Once, long ago, there was a beautiful tree in the midst of a beautiful garden. The fruit was very fair to look upon, and very pleasant to the taste. But it was poisonous fruit. And he who had planted that fair garden had said to the man and the woman who walked therein:
               "Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die!"
               But they listened to the voice of the serpent, and ate and died! And their sons and daughters, for many and many a generation, which passed like the hours of a gloomy night, whose silence was only broken, now and then, by the prophetic voice, telling how the time was wearing away, died too!
               Another Tree uprose at length; not fair, at first, to the sight, as that had been, nor as sweet to the taste as was the poisonous fruit. The eyes of man saw not well now, and their taste had become corrupted.
               But as one looked on that Tree, which grew on Mount Calvary—the Tree of the Cross—it grew wondrously beautiful, so beautiful that all the fair and bright things of earth faded before it.
               They who ate of the Fruit of this Tree should hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither should they, ever after, lack any good thing.
               Beneath its branches the sun should not fall upon them, nor any heat. It should be a covert from the storm, a hiding place from the tempest; and the serpent, whose head had been deeply bruised, should never beguile them more charmed he never so wisely.
               And this Fruit is free to all! For God, who planted this Tree—the Healer of that fearful and deadly disease which came with the poisonous fruit, so wickedly eaten—the poison destroying the body, the disobedience destroying the soul,—God, himself, who planted this Tree, the Tree of the wondrous Cross,—
               The aged man raised himself up upon his cushions, and lifted his eyes towards heaven,—
               "'Glory to God in the highest; on earth, peace, good-will to man!' He has said to every one, 'Come, eat, be healed, and live forever!'"
               And then Brendice's voice, now in her native tongue, for the words, to her, seemed to lose a portion of their sweetness in the translation, and now in the language which she spoke quite as well, rose sweet and clear in the simple rhymes she tried to weave out of the words the old gentleman had uttered. In listening to him, the Christmas carol she had learned years ago, and fragments of which had been on her lips many times that day, passed entirely from her recollection.
               Her voice rose singularly clear and sweet, notwithstanding the slight tremulousness of her tones, which, however, no feeling of embarrassment, but simply the sense of loneliness and isolation that stole over her, while he was speaking, had caused:
                     
                        
                           Glorie à Dieu!
                        
                        Not to the tree
                        In the midst of the garden,
                        Though pleasant to see,
                        And laden with fruits the most rich and most rare,
                        For the breath of the serpent was felt on the air,
                        And the long night that followed
                        Of darkness and pain,
                        Caught never a sound
                        Of the welcome refrain:
                        
                           Bonne Volonté,
                        
                        
                           Paix sur la Terre!
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           Glorie à Dieu!
                        
                        The darkness is passed;
                        The Star in the East
                        Has arisen at last;
                        And the long-withered stock of a lovelier Tree
                        Sends a branch o'er the earth and a branch o'er the sea,
                        And the mountains of Judah
                        Re-echo the strain
                        Which the angels are chanting
                        In glorious refrain:
                        
                           Bonne Volonté,
                        
                        
                           Paix sur la Terre!
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           Glorie à Dieu!
                        
                        Ever to Thee,
                        Thou wonderful Fruit
                        Of a wonderful Tree,
                        Thou one great Messiah, Redeemer, and King,
                        Born a babe in the manger, our offerings we bring;
                        While heaven's highest arches
                        Awaken the strain,
                        We taste of the Fruit,
                        And we chant the refrain:
                        
                           Bonne Volonté,
                        
                        
                           Paix sur la Terre!
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVI.
               BURIED TALENTS.
               "BRENDICE, Brendice!" was uttered in a quick, half-frightened, baby voice from the doorway, and a pair of wide-open, wondering eyes glanced about the crowded room.
               Little Lang had caught the sound of her voice, and climbed out of the crib to find her.
               He was a very fair child, so many thought who looked at him, as he stood there; the little brown eyes beginning to moisten, and the lips slightly quivering; very fair when a sweet smile gleamed out like a burst of sunshine on the clouded face, and a short crow of delight came from the rosy mouth, as he spied the object of his search, and ran swiftly forward to meet her, and cling to her hand, and bury his curly head in the folds of her dress, occasionally peeping out shyly, because he knew many strange faces were regarding him, to catch a glimpse of her features, and see that everything was right.
               The old gentleman very near whom Brendice was standing, had heard the child's voice, and had seen the blue-robed figure, with the pale-brown hair floating over the shoulders, bounding across the room, but he had not particularly noticed the child.
               He had been attentively regarding Brendice ever since she commenced singing. In fact his eyes were continually turning towards her, from the moment she was introduced to him.
               He was trying to realize that this young girl, of whom his landlady had told him all that was generally known of Brendice Du Bois, so very good-looking, and apparently wellbred—for her fine intellect and quick perceptions, with the little aid she had received from Mrs. Maitland, were filling up many a gap left by her stern instructor—was the one to whom he was sending, almost daily, for the basket of freshly-gathered fish; his sole purpose in thus employing her being to enable her to eke out a scanty but independent support for herself and the child, and in solving the problem which had so puzzled Miss Emma Brown.
               Sally Jones could not deny herself the pleasure of teasing that young lady, by circulating the report that William's offer of marriage had been firmly rejected by Brendice.
               Mr. Hall, as he looked on her, thought he could understand how this girl might refuse the love and the hand of a good-hearted and sensible young man who could give her a pleasant home, and surround her with all the comforts of life, and then go down, so often, wrapped up in a fisherman's coat, upon the wet, slippery beach, through the cold wind, and sometimes through the drifting snow, with the basket and the fork to dig the clams.
               He did not compliment her singing, as many of the guests were doing, nor thank her for complying so readily with his request; but after a few moments' silence, and while the company were partaking of the nice refreshments prepared for them, he said, so softly that Brendice bent her head to listen:
               "You have read the parable of the man travelling into a far country, who called his servants, and delivered unto them his goods, to one, five talents, to another, two, and to another, one?"
               "Yes, sir!" Brendice said.
               "And you have thought that he who received the one talent—each man had received according to his ability—the proper use of which would, undoubtedly, have furnished him with the means of making himself, and perhaps others too, comfortable and happy, and yet enough have been left of the avails of his labor to pay the usury also, when he returned unto his lord what was his own; you have thought, for digging in the earth, and hiding his lord's money, he deserved to be called the wicked and slothful servant; to have the one talent taken from him, and to belong, no more, to the household of his lord.
               "But did this unprofitable servant, whom his lord adjudged to the outer darkness, more richly merit his fate than he would have done who should employ only one of the five talents entrusted to him, and that perhaps the least worthy, wrapping all the others in a napkin, and burying them in the earth?
               "I have often thought, lately, my child,—my own short-comings first led me to think of it, though the idea has never been so deeply impressed upon my mind as it is now, while I look at you, and remember what my landlady has told me of you,—that by-and-by, when our Lord calls us before Him, for the great and final reckoning, how many of us will have to return to Him, without the usury he requires, the talents, worth thousands of gold and silver, he has entrusted to us, the brightest and best the most carefully wrapped in the napkin, and buried most deeply in the earth!"
               He paused abruptly.
               She had suddenly raised herself erect, and he saw a look of proud contempt flashing out from her eyes, followed quickly, however, by the drooping of the lids, while an expression of deep pain passed over her face.
               She was wondering if Mrs. Adams had told the old gentleman that some of the people who were his guests this evening, had concluded, not many months since, they would be obliged to send her to the almshouse.
               But that was a momentary feeling, for the words which followed that allusion to what his landlady had said, struck a chord in the girl's heart which she was always trying to silence, and which rang out, now, a music like the voice of many waters; and she bowed her head again, as if to suffer the swift billows to roll over it. After a brief pause, during which he was attentively watching the changes of her countenance, Mr. Hall extended his hand, and added, in a gentle tone:
               "Remember it is an old man who is addressing you, my dear, one who always thinks that the words he is speaking may be the last he will ever utter in this life; and do not be offended with me!"
               
               "Oh, sir, I am not offended!" Brendice said, quickly, as she took his offered hand. "I was thinking"—
               "Of what, my child?" he asked, retaining her fingers in his grasp.
               "That if your faith was mine, I would dig the wide earth over to see if there were any buried talents I could believe loaned to me, and consecrate them to the service of Him who may some time recall His own, and to the good of my fellow-beings, the only usury to be offered to Him. But the law of love is not the governing rule of my life!"
               She spoke very sadly and earnestly, and as if to contradict her words, she stooped and gathered the child, who was shyly endeavoring to attract her attention, into her arms, putting into his eager hand the delicacies just brought to her, with such an expression, that a smile came to the face of the aged man, and he was whispering softly to himself:
               "Not far from the kingdom; with such unselfish love as that, not far from the kingdom!" when the child chanced to lift his eyes to the gentleman's countenance; and then some one exclaimed, hurriedly:
               "Mr. Hall has fainted! Bring water, he has fainted, or is dying!"
               Many gathered around him, but of them all, only Brendice knew, or even conjectured rightly, what had caused his sudden emotion.
               She alone observed that Jerry Greyson, who, while the host had been addressing herself, was standing not far off, with that look upon his face of greater stupidity than usual that he always assumed when he had some purpose in his mind which he considered very important, slowly edged his way to Mr. Hall, as she was turning her attention to the child.
               She knew that his keen, searching eyes, half closed as they were, rested on her face. They often did so lately when she chanced to meet him. There was nothing particularly unfriendly in their expression, but there was a disagreeably inquisitive look in them.
               He had drawn close behind Mr. Hall's lounge, and when he thought she was not observing him, he bent his head low, and whispered a few words in the old gentleman's ear. It was at the very moment that little Lang glanced up into his face.
               What Greyson said, Brendice did not know; but through the buzz of voices she heard the whispered words of the old gentleman:
               "Rachel's child! Rachel Ross's child!"
               He tried to extend his arms, but sank back, with a white face, on his cushions.
               No one but Brendice had observed Greyson; but when Miss Jones, who resolutely elbowed her way through the group gathered around the fainting man, happened to confront him, he stood looking so like a culprit before her, that she was certain he was, in some way, responsible for the sudden emotion of their host; and that slip of paper which Jerry had found upon the beach the morning succeeding Luke Maitland's stealthy visit to The Sands, and which had been, ever since, carefully preserved by him, thinking it might be of some pecuniary benefit to its finder, was thrown into the fire an hour after; and no one but Sally could have made him confess he had ever heard of its existence.
               
               Brendice alone, beside Greyson, conjectured what was the cause of Mr. Hall's fainting fit.
               She was sure he had been told something concerning the child. She had not forgotten that lost slip of paper, and she remembered now it was Jerry, who, earliest after day-light had appeared, came down the beach to Mrs. Maitland's dwelling on the morning which followed her death.
               The child of Rachel Ross!
               The woman was dead, Brendice had heard; she had perished when the Essex was wrecked. That was her husband's ship, it was said.
               But Rachel Ross had been Mr. Hall's foster-daughter!
               An icy hand seemed suddenly laid on her heart.
               The parable which the old man had just referred to, came into her thoughts, and though she could not feel that they were particularly applicable to her, she could not deafen her ear to the words she fancied were murmured close beside her:
               "And from him shall be taken away even that which he seemeth to have."
               The guests were thinking only of their host, and Brendice, clasping the child in her arms, passed quickly out of the room, unobserved by any one.
               She made her way to the apartment where the company had left their outer garments, and found the wrappings of herself and the little boy; flinging the shawl loosely around her shoulders, but very carefully shielding him from the bitter cold.
               There had been a sudden change in the weather during the hour and a half that she was in the house. She stepped out into the chilling air. For a moment she hesitated, and glanced back to the lighted windows.
               Most likely this man would immediately try to take the child from her. He had looked as if he had a right to do so. But she would not give him up.
               The little arms were at this moment twined about her neck, and his warm breath was on her cheek.
               She looked away towards the west.
               There was a little confusion in her thoughts.
               She wondered if she could walk up to N—— that night; if she might not drop down on the cold snowy earth, should she attempt to do so, and she and the babe perish together.
               Then she remembered that it was Christmas Eve, and St. Mary's Church would be decked for the holy festival with the emblematic evergreen, and brilliantly lighted; and she thought how many hearts there, and through the wide world, were throbbing with happiness, at this very moment when she was so lonely and wretched.
               Why was not she, too, happy?
               She pressed her lips very firmly together as the silent question arose; and then her eyes turned towards the east, where, throwing its clear, white gleam far and wide over the dark sea, itself seemingly as cold and defiant as were those briny, surging waters, stood the sentinel light, which could always blind her eyes and deaden all other perceptions to everything but the one great object of her life, which rose up now, a mightier skeleton than had ever before confronted her, from its momentary hiding in the unclosed sepulchre, and stalked by her side, as with firm, hasty steps, she walked away to her home.
               
               The dwelling seemed not utterly comfortless on her return.
               She had not intended to accept Mrs. Adams' invitation to pass the night at the Ocean House, or even to make a long stay there; and she had not been absent more than two hours from her home.
               Her fire was not yet quite extinguished, and her lamp burned no more dimly than at the time she left it; and after drawing the embers together and putting a few pieces of fresh fuel upon them, she sat down, and took the little boy, who was now ready to fall asleep again in her arms, holding him closely and tenderly, looking down into his face, and wondering how a nature as unloving as she thought her own to be, could have ever given birth to such a strong affection as she was beginning to feel for the child, and wishing that her arm was powerful enough always to encircle him.
               That Mr. Hall would send for him early the next morning, she had not the least doubt. Perhaps he would endeavor to ascertain who had brought him to The Sands.
               She was very sure he would not learn from her; and the little boy had, some weeks since, ceased his attempts to pronounce the name of Luke. He spoke it, however, that night, with a quick start, and a sweet, wondering smile.
               Brendice had held him in her arms while the hours were passing, heedless, in her strong purpose, and in her bitter grief, how the time was advancing, until, at length, when the fire was burning low, and the lamp was extinguished, the appearance of the heavens told her that it was past midnight; and then she remembered suddenly that it was the festive Christmas.
               Christmas! She and the little one in her arms had been solemnly given to her whose Lord was born on this holy-day,—the blessed mother-Church.
               And then a question came which answered the half-uttered, agonized prayer that had arisen many times to her lips during those lonely hours.
               A far-off wanderer, herself, from the loving bosom, and from the Father's house, and looking down the dark, rough path, whither tending she dared not conjecture, but which she felt sure nothing could ever deter her from treading, how would she venture to trust herself with the charge of this little innocent being, even if she should be permitted to do so? This Church-child, over whom prayers had been made that he might "lead the rest of his life according to this beginning"?
               Following her gaze, where would the untrained vision turn? Guided by her steps, how would the feet ever find their way to "The everlasting Kingdom" of which his sponsors were daily petitioning Heaven he might become an inheritor?
               When Mr. Hall should send for him, in the morning, she would take the child, whose bright eyes, wide open now, were gazing up, with a prematurely thoughtful expression, into her troubled face—she would take him, herself, up to the hotel.
               She would tell the old gentleman that he who had brought the child to The Sands—she would not disclose who he was—had thought he was left in the care of Mrs. Maitland.
               That was all she knew of the little boy.
               She wished she could tell him the child's name. Perhaps Mr. Hall knew it himself, now. Thus far, she had not been able to learn it, though she had many times endeavored to gain it from him. The little fellow could not understand.
               "Brendice's little boy!" was all the name he knew now.
               Lately she had thought of a device which might, perhaps, recall his vanishing recollection. Luke might never return, and if that paper was lost, which, however, she now supposed was not the case, the child might never know his parentage.
               She had labored secretly, but with a will, at the execution of her plan; sometimes hopelessly, and sometimes,—these moments occurred most frequently,—with gushing tears at the consciousness of the power within her, and at its development, as the fabled Undine wept with joy at the coming of the soul.
               In her work, Brendice had two purposes in view. The primary one was to learn the child's name; the other:
               Many years hence, she thought, if she was able to complete her work to her own satisfaction, when the memory of his early childhood had passed away entirely from the mind of her present charge, she would put this work into his hands; or if any accident happened to herself in that other task she hoped soon to accomplish, this might assist in the search after his parentage. Luke Maitland, by that time, might be beyond the reach of any one who cared for his crime or his fate.
               She rose from her seat and placed the little boy near the fire, which she stirred till a bright flame flashed up, for a moment, in the stone fire-place, and then, going into the inner apartment, she brought out an easel, on which was stretched a sheet of canvas.
               The child had never seen what was on the canvas before, for Brendice had worked at her task only at the hours when he was sleeping. She had purposely concealed it from him.
               The idea which had occurred to her, when she began to fear that the little boy was forgetting his name, was to portray on canvas the two faces she had seen, in the bright moonlight, looking through the open window, just beyond the bed on which was lying the lifeless form of Mrs. Maitland; and present them, suddenly, to his gaze. If the work was tolerably well executed, she reasoned, perhaps the unexpected vision would recall the vanishing remembrance to the little mind.
               This was not her first attempt at portraying the human face; nor, though it was not yet finished, were its merits to be questioned, either in design or execution.
               Her father, who, in his own country, had enjoyed some reputation as an amateur painter, and who early perceived the artistic talent of his daughter, had commenced, a few months previous to his sudden disappearance, to give her some valuable instructions.
               She placed the easel so that the child could obtain a good view of what was on the canvas.
               The red flame gave an unnatural hue to the imperfect coloring of the picture, but after a moment of silent wonder, he uttered a cry of delight, and sprang with extended hands towards it.
               "Luke, Luke!" he exclaimed, "and L'enfant,—no, no, Brendice!—little Ross! little Ross Aden, Brendice!" and he looked up in her face, questioningly, and pleadingly, thinking ing it strange she did not call him Ross, and wishing she would; but not knowing how to express his little thoughts.
               Ross Aden! Brendice wondered, when the child should repeat his name to Mr. Hall to-morrow, if it would suggest the same idea to the old gentleman as now occurred to her.
               But the child was not sent, for the next day the little errand boy came down, somewhat later than usual, to her dwelling, for the freshly dug clams.
               The fish-basket contained a rather larger supply of fruits than it commonly brought, and there were besides some trifling but very useful articles for Brendice, and pretty playthings for the child. They were all products of the Christmas-tree, however, and consequently she could do no otherwise than accept them.
               But no message was sent to Brendice from the old gentleman, nor did she hear from him particularly all through the winter; only the basket and the fruits, nicely wrapped in a fresh newspaper, and the silver "quarter," came every day when it was possible for her to go down on the beach.
               Mrs. Adams called quite frequently, on the pretence, Brendice felt sure it was only that, of looking after the sewing entrusted to her; but she was such a kind lady-like woman, so entirely unobtrusive in her manners, that the sensitive girl did not feel that she was under an espionage, or was suffering herself to be patronized; though she never allowed Mrs. Adams to make any progress in the attempt to cultivate her acquaintance; and Brendice could not perceive that she manifested any unusual degree of interest in the child.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               THE CONVOY LIGHT.
               THE winter, as if wearied, itself, by its unusual surliness, had passed away early, and now it was the sweet spring again; very sweet for the time of year in that cold region where The Sands is situated, and the Lental season was drawing to its close.
               It was the Thursday evening before Easter-day; a very mild, serene night, though a few light, fleecy clouds were now and then drawing a thin vail over the face of the rounding moon, or dancing about her in varied fantastic forms.
               The snow had, some weeks since, disappeared from the plains, but the cold, white crown would rest, for some time yet, heavily on the hill-tops.
               With the voice of the unbound stream, hastening so swiftly down to meet the sea, every day with increasing speed and deepening song, mingled many other tongues of awakening nature; and from an open window, that which looked into the west, of one of the little fish-houses on The Sands, a human voice very sweet and clear was chanting a glad, happy song; and the face of the singer was radiant with a smile in which there was no trace of grief or care.
               And yet the singer was Brendice Du Bois.
               An hour before she had been reading, with the softened feeling which had come over her, during that solemn week, very many times, the Church service for the day. Tears dropped from her eyes as she thought of that innocent, patient Prisoner, voluntarily giving Himself up into the power of His guilty accusers, and His unjust judges.
               They dropped very fast as she read how, forgetting His own great present sufferings, and the terrible death to which the weary feet were hastening Him—
               "Jesus turned and said: Daughters, weep not for me, weep for yourselves!"
               And how, even on the cross, he had prayed for those that had nailed Him there, and were now mocking at His agonies: "Father, forgive them!"
               Since she had finished her reading, Brendice had had a visitor. Mrs. Adams stepped in for a few minutes with her two little girls, who had wanted to have a run down over the beach to ask if little Lang might go with them up to N——, on Easter-day.
               There was to be a children's festival at St. Mary's; and Mr. Hall, who had that morning left The Sands, to the great grief of her whole family, the lady said, hoped that many of the children who had gathered around his Christmas-tree, would go up to the festival at the church.
               Mrs. Adams added much more, but Brendice only heard that the old gentleman, who she had, ever since Christmas Eve, been expecting, daily, would send down and take the child from her, had left the neighborhood.
               Would Mr. Hall return after Easter?
               No! he was going to housekeeping. His residence was completed last autumn. He had intended to occupy it during the winter, opening his house before the holidays commenced, but his health was so feeble that he did not like to make the change until the coldest part of the season had passed.
               His housekeeper and her husband, who was also in Mr. Hall's employ, were good people, and would make him very comfortable; and the old gentleman had not yet given up all hope of persuading the lighthouse keeper, who had been a very particular friend of his years since, to resign his post at The Rocks, and make his home with Mr. Hall. There was no one in the world, Mrs. Adams said, beside Mr. Aden, whom the old gentleman took any especial interest in; and him he had not seen for the past fifteen years, or more.
               Brendice did not know, until it was removed, what a great sorrow had been weighing upon her, all through that cold, tedious winter.
               When Mrs. Adams, wondering what had brought that sudden change to the young woman's unusually pale and thoughtful face during her momentary stay in the dwelling, at the readiness with which Brendice had accepted the invitation extended to herself, and especially her pleased assent to the offer her visitor had made her,—went away, leading her two little girls, she had taken the child into her arms, feeling now that he was all her own to love and watch over. Mr. Hall would not take him away.
               For a brief moment she forgot that she had any other work in life to perform than to care for him, or that some some one else might appear to claim the child; and the glad, sweet song had burst from her lips, and the radiant smile had overspread her face.
               The girls had been promised that "Lang"—Brendice did not repeat after him the name he had spoken on Christmas Eve; she was now very willing that he should forget it, and he again seemed to be doing so; the girls had been promised that he should go with them to St. Mary's.
               Mrs. Adams had been told that Brendice would be very well satisfied to receive from that lady, for the sum due her for her needle-work, which her employer suffered to amount now to some dollars, the simple straw hat and low-priced shawl that she had spoken of; and would be willing, herself, to go up to the church, that little Lang might not be timid and troublesome in finding himself among strangers,—the girls wished him, so much, to be his own sweet little self.
               He was wanted by them, for a very particular reason.
               They were going to have a most splendid boquet for the Festival,—they were telling him, as earnestly as if his little three years understood it all.
               Mother's beautiful house-plants were all in full blossom, and she had promised them all the roses and geraniums, and they were going out among the hills on Saturday to look for wild flowers too; and if Brendice was willing, he should carry the boquet up to the chancel, and present it to the rector, because, the eldest girl remarked, baby Lang was nothing but a sweet little rosebud himself.
               And Brendice, loving the girl for her words, remembered what she had said, and wondered how it had come about that such a sweet young blossom had been grafted into her verdureless life; and thought hopefully and confidently, as she looked down so lovingly into his face, and sang the glad song to him, how, though he seemed to have been transplanted into a very uncongenial soil, she would try to shield him from the scorching sun, and chilling winds, and to take all of the thorns out of his life.
               Her thoughts were disturbed by the sound of a light, quick footstep, coming up over the rocks. A shadow passed by the little window which looked towards the east, and through which, now and then partially dimmed by a fleeting cloud, came the soft moonlight.
               An instant after, the figure of a man stood at the open door-way, and looked, silently, into the apartment.
               Brendice readily recognized him, and she knew, instinctively, why he was there; for William Jones had not come to her dwelling before, since that cold, stormy Sunday morning, months previous, when she returned to her old home, and he had walked down the beach with her, and asked her to be his wife.
               She knew why he had come now, and for a moment all consciousness seemed utterly to have forsaken her; and then a fancy seized her that she was dreaming,—a fancy that she was in her boat, adrift far out upon the sea, without sail or oar, with darkness above, and wild billows around her. But calm, concentrated thought, immediately returned.
               
               "I thank you, William!" she said, quickly, as she rose and stood beside him at the door. She had placed the child upon the floor.
               The young man had not spoken yet.
               "Miss Sally told me last week," Brendice proceeded, "that she would have some more work for me, which she would bring over herself. Will you ask her to come down tomorrow morning, very early?"
               "Yes, Brendice! but—would you not prefer that she should come down to-night?"
               It struck him that there was something very peculiar in her appearance, notwithstanding the quietness of her manner, and the evenness of her voice; and why was she so interested in the fact which he had come down to communicate, that she appeared to have comprehended what it was, before he had time to mention it?
               "Or, what would be better, Brendice," he continued, "go over and stop with my aunt, to-night. She will be quite alone. I am going to Mr. Brown's, to watch with his son, who is very sick. I will ask one of the boys to come here, and go up with you to my house, and carry the child."
               But Brendice declined the invitation, and so firmly that the young man did not repeat it; and he walked away, wondering what was the reason that the lamps over to the Convoy were not lighted, and why that fact should interest Brendice Du Bois as much as it seemed to.
               He thought he would watch for the appearance of the light; but though he did not forget to do so, or to feel a little anxiety in regard to Brendice, he could not find opportunity to leave the bedside of the sick lad, to step over to his home, which was only a few rods distant from Mr. Brown's, to ask his aunt to go down to the ledge and pass the night with the girl, as he feared she was either ill, or was in some trouble; nor had he a spare moment, early in the night, to go around to the east of the dwelling, and look for the Convoy light.
               When he did find time to look away, again, over the water, the lamps were brightly burning. It was past midnight then.
               Brendice remained standing by the open door, after Jones had walked away in the direction of Mr. Brown's.
               Scarcely conscious in what direction her eyes were turning, she was glancing up the hillside where, during the past autumn, the grave had been dug under the cluster of evergreens. The spot was turfed over now, and the work had been done by Brendice's own hands, a week or two earlier than the present time; just as soon as the snow had melted away from the hillside, and the ground had softened beneath the influence of the sun.
               They were green, mossy sods, which she had placed there, and small, hardy plants, covered with swelling buds, and lifted so tenderly from their native beds that they would be sure, soon, to turn their fearless little faces up to the smiling, daily brightening sun, and send out their breath to deepen the perfume of the sweet spring air.
               Just as, Brendice thought, when she was planting them there, the gentle slumberer by-and-by, after a long, long time had passed, and Earth's great cycle was run, at the call of the same Voice which was now awakening nature to a new existence,—would lift up her lowly head, and open her wondering eyes, and look away towards the east, where, in the then Long-Ago, the mild radiance of the Advent Star met the gaze of the learnedly-watching Magi, and the trustingly-waiting shepherds; where the Star a second time may be seen, then the Sun—the Sun of Righteousness!
               "Every eye shall see Him!" and she would gaze without fear on that glorious Luminary, before whose inconceivable brightness all created lights shall be as darkness; and join her grateful song to that of the innumerable multitude, each separate voice of which our wonderful Lord shall hear, that the long night has passed, and the dawning of the Day has come.
               Another thought had come, too, to Brendice, as she stood beside the grave when her mournful, but willingly performed task was ended, and looked away to the ocean.
               It took the shape of a fearful question.
               During the winter now passed, every day, since Christmas Eve,—it seemed to be done almost mechanically,—the old French Bible had been lifted out of the sea-chest, and an hour or more had been spent in its perusal; and its great truths were becoming quite familiar to her mind.
               And, though, on the morning of All Saints' day, she had believed she would never again open the book Mrs. Maitland had placed so solemnly and lovingly in her hands, yet every Sunday since, the beautiful Church Service was read very slowly and thoughtfully.
               Somehow, after that first Sunday, when she had read it with the dying woman, the Service seemed to have fastened a strong hold on her. The great truths it taught convinced her understanding; they tried so hard to enter her heart that oftentimes it was only by wrapping her deadly purpose closely about her, that she could shield herself from their influence.
               Mrs. Maitland had prayed that, when she was gone, Heaven would send another friend to Brendice; and sometimes, during those long, lonely Sunday hours, as she sat, slowly reading, and deeply reflecting, the thought had come that there was a form near her, besides that of the sweet little child, if only her vision could discern Him, standing, with eyes full of love and pity, by her side, in the midst of the cold, dark waters which were dashing their great billows over her, as He had walked in the midst of the fire,—the form of the Son of God! But with a shudder, she had wished, only, that her vision might be more deeply darkened.
               As she stood by the grave, a certain text of Scripture had impressed her, very forcibly:
               "And the sea gave up the dead which were in it."
               The sea which had swallowed up, so long ago, her fair young mother. And then this:
               "And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God!"
               Where would her station be?
               Would she join her mother, coming up from the sea, wearing the youth and the beauty which had gone down into it? Would she take the hand of the gentle being whose fingers were encircling her own, when they were becoming icy in death, and who had said, after the cold touch had been laid upon her:
               "Something, sometime, will bind us together!"
               And walk, with them, up to the great white throne, into the presence of the then inexorable Judge, whose eye will see alike the blood-spot upon the hand, and the deeper stain upon the heart?
               But the wish that the defilement might be washed away from the soul, and that no opportunity might ever be afforded her for so marring the body that at the great Day when the offering shall be made unto the Lord—the offering which is to be without spot or blemish—she must stand without the gates of the city, stand there for evermore,—the wish was strangled before its birth.
               Now, as she was leaning aginst the doorway, looking mechanically up the hillside, after the sound of the young man's footsteps, as he walked over the ledge, ceased to fall upon her ear, the thoughts which had come to her a week or two before, as she stood beside that grave, again returned; but that smothered wish no more awoke to life, than did that cold form beneath the clods, and the countenance, which, but a few brief moments before, was so gladdened and fair, now grew dark and terrible in its expression.
               She turned from the dusky west, and fixed her eyes, not on the beautiful Easter-moon, whose light fell softly, and, one might have thought, pityingly, on the suddenly corrugated and ageing face, but on that spot on the horizon which seemed now a dark blot on the moonlit water,—The Rocks, where the Convoy light was not burning, and her lips, quivering from the sternness of her resolve, murmured the words:
               "Measure for measure; pressed down and running over!"
               The child had fallen asleep upon the floor, and without unrobing the little form, or glancing once into the face, over which the sweet dream-smiles were chasing each other like a troop of merry fairies, she lifted him in her arms and placed him on the bed; pinning to his frock a slip of paper on which she had written a few hasty words.
               They were addressed to Miss Jones, who, a very early riser, would, undoubtedly, come over to Brendice's dwelling the next morning, before the child's eyes were open.
               The written words were the little boy's real name, as he, himself, had spoken it; and the request that the woman would take the child to the old gentleman, Mr. Hall.
               Brendice made no allusion to herself in the note.
               When she had done this, she took down her long hair, combed it very smoothly over her temples, and bound it in heavy braids in her neck, and then carefully attired herself in the pretty, deep-green dress.
               She did not light her lamp and glance into her little mirror, as she at first intended to do, to see if the look Mrs. Maitland had said so much resembled her mother's was upon her countenance.
               She knew it could not be there, while such thoughts as she was now cherishing, were surging through her brain.
               If her eager hopes should be realized,—if she could once fasten her hand on her intended victim, she would compel her countenance to wear whatever expression she chose to assume.
               The tide was coming in; but the light breeze, sweet with the breath of the hill-sides, was oceanward; and Brendice, after looking up for a moment into the clear, starry heavens, which were, to her trained vision, as an unsealed book, stepped into her boat, and pushed off from the shore.
               She directed her course to the islands, which, now more than fifteen years before, her father, on a soft, bright night as was this, though then it was early autumn, had so eagerly and hurriedly approached: that night when the lighthouse keeper, George Aden, had quitted his post to make little Rachel Ross his wife, and take her to a home beyond the seas; and his half-brother, Philip Maitland, who, never quite conscience-seared, was trying to hide, not only from the man who was pursuing him, but from his wife, his son, from the whole world and from himself,—took up the employment, for his guilty, restless mind far too light, and the monotonous existence which was, to him, such a wearying burden.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               BREAD UPON THE WATERS.
               AND how had those years passed with Rachel Ross?
               The conviction that she had done right in leaving her guardian, that his charities might be bestowed on those who had a greater claim on him than she could have, and the love and tender care of her husband, had stayed the seemingly vanishing life; and a sojourn in a land more suited to her delicate constitution was slowly making her a healthful and physically strong woman.
               But care and sorrow had often found their way to the little humble home which Mr. Aden had made for himself and his wife in the suburbs of an Italian city.
               Several times Rachel had become a mother, but the lips of each child had grown white and still before another echoed its merry music; and again and again almost absolute want had stared the foreigners in the face.
               Mr. Aden, though of a somewhat provident nature, had expended the means at his command rather lavishly on his young wife. He had not dared hope that she would long be spared to him, and it was his first wish to make that brief life as happy as possible.
               When it became necessary for him to seek employment, he found it very difficult to procure any sufficiently lucrative, even for the support which Rachel could manage to make very inexpensive; and with his best endeavor, his business was always a precarious one.
               Very often, even while her maternal heart was bleeding with a fresh wound, Rachel, walking a mile or more down the dusty road which Mr. Aden would take on his return home from the city, paused and looked up the steep eminence, half-way up whose height stood a little chapel; and, forgetting for a moment her deep grief, prayed earnestly, and with child-like simplicity, for daily bread for herself and her husband.
               One sweet evening,—it was the Feast of St. John, the tenth year of her married life; want was very near her then, for Mr. Aden had been, for several days in succession, in the city, seeking, in vain, for employment—as she drew near the little eminence, the chapel bell began to ring for vespers, and Rachel, though quite wearied with her walk, toiled up the height, and entered the church.
               There was a female figure kneeling near the altar. The woman was magnificently attired, though it was only a travelling-dress that she wore; and at a short distance from her stood an old, but hale, cheerful-looking man, apparently a little wearied with the lengthened devotions of his companion, but maintaining as reverential an attitude as possible.
               The lady, who was speaking audibly, uttered her prayers in a very sad tone, but her voice was remarkably sweet and musical, and after a moment, Rachel caught her words, though she spoke in Italian; for Mr. Aden understood the language very well, and his wife had learned from him and the little peasant girl sometimes in her employ, the import of many phrases.
               She was repeating many times over, a portion of the prophecy for the day; and her voice, at length, grew stronger, as if she was pronouncing absolution over herself:
               "Her iniquity is pardoned! She hath received of the Lord's hand double for all her sins!"
               Then her voice sank to a whisper, and Rachel, kneeling at a little distance, forgot the stranger's presence, as her thoughts went on with the lesson for the day; and her tears dropped fast upon her once handsome, but now worn and faded mourning dress, as her lips shaped themselves to the words:
               "All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field. The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, because the spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it!"
               For a moment she felt that a double portion had been meted out to her. But the hands which were folded upon her breast, rested upon a little locket, and she drew it forth and pressed the picture which it contained to her lips; thinking that, notwithstanding all she had suffered, the Lord had gently led her, and that through all that might yet be before her, He would "feed his flock like a shepherd!" She was still gazing on the painting, which was a striking likeness of her husband, when it was rudely snatched from her hold by a fair, white hand, suddenly thrust out over her shoulder, and a voice, full of horror, whispered in her ear:
               
               "Is this the saint you are praying to?"
               Rachel rose to her feet, and turned towards her strange questioner; and the woman who had been kneeling when she entered the chapel, stood before her. But for a moment she did not reply.
               The vision which met her gaze, though she had seen it once, years before, was of such surpassing loveliness, mature beauty though it was, and though the eyes were lighted up with such a fierce flame, while the tears were yet undried upon her cheeks, that everything else was forgotten in its contemplation.
               "Madam, I pray only to my God!" she said, at length, quietly. "That face is my husband's. You have seen him. You followed us once through a picture-gallery in Florence, and you said, as he turned his face, and looked at you, 'It is not he!'"
               The lady, apparently unconscious that she was addressed, so earnestly was she regarding the painting in her hand, was repeating the same words now; "It is not he! Pardon; it is not he!"
               She returned the miniature without farther apology, and walked away towards her companion, who was now waiting for her at the entrance of the chapel. But before reaching him, she turned and went back to Rachel, and stood, for an instant, silently regarding, first her attire, and then her countenance. Mrs. Aden was sure the lady was contrasting her present appearance with what it was when the stranger's beautiful dark eyes, proud and commanding in their expression, but full of tender love and sympathy, were fastened on her, for a moment, years before.
               Then she was a nicely-dressed, happy young bride; now it was a long-used mourning suit that she wore, and lines of sorrow and care were on her brow, though she strove, so hard, to make her countenance a still cheerful one.
               Rachel quietly bore the scrutiny, for the lady's face had, for her, a strange fascination.
               "We worship the same God!"
               The woman spoke now, with a slight accent, but very sweetly, Mrs. Aden's native tongue.
               "We worship the same God; we kneel at the same altar; we are children of our Father! What is the tearful petition you have offered to Him to-night, my sister?" and the beautiful white fingers, sparkling with jewels, fastened themselves on Mrs. Aden's poorly-gloved hand, with a firm hold.
               Rachel returned the cordial pressure, and replied to the questioner, as if it was the daughter of the same mother, too, who stood before her; for the look of deep-seated, hopeless sorrow, which suddenly came out on her face, knitted Rachel's tender heart closely to that of the stranger.
               "I came here to ask of Him who holds the treasures of the earth in His hand, for daily bread for my husband and myself!" she said. "The remembrance of my lost babes checked the utterance of the prayer; and then want and grief were both forgotten in the thought that my husband, dearer, by far, than everything else earthly could be to me, was mine still. And so my earnest petitions and sad complainings were changed to tearful praise. Our heavenly Father never leaves His children quite destitute of all the good things He has promised shall be added!"
               "No!" said the stranger, but speaking rather to herself than to Mrs. Aden: "Even from me He has not taken the power of doing good!" and she placed something in Rachel's hand, and turned quickly away.
               The immediate entrance into the chapel of a crowd of worshippers, prevented the hasty egress which Mrs. Aden desired to make; and when she had reached the flight of steps leading up to the building, the lady and her companion were nowhere to be seen, and a travelling carriage was rolling rapidly over a highway branching from that which led out from the city—the road which her husband was now coming down, not with his usual light, quick step, but slowly and weariedly, and with his eyes bent to the earth.
               His wife descried him in the distance, and concealing beneath her shawl what had been placed in her hand, half terrified at its apparent value, she hastened towards him, wondering how she should excuse herself to him for retaining that purse of gold.
               But Mr. Aden's proud spirit was, that night, almost broken, though it was an approaching illness which was, more than anything else, subduing him.
               He had again been unsuccessful in his search for employment, and was now returning to his home without the means of furnishing his wife with one suitable meal; and with the confession of his poverty, the extremity of which she did not yet fully comprehend, he had decided to ask her what article of their plainly-furnished cottage could best be dispensed with, that food for the coming day could be purchased by its sale.
               A deep flush came to the unusually pale face when he heard the story of her interview with the strange lady, but he was silent when his wife asked him to take speedy measures to return the gold.
               "Shall I believe that Heaven sent it to us in answer to my prayer?" she asked, when she observed how he was hesitating. "Shall we use the gold, George?"
               "Yes, Rachel!" he replied, "as you need it; for absolute necessities alone, however. I will ascertain who the liberal donor is, and some time we will repay her. Misfortune cannot pursue me forever!"
               But the money, notwithstanding Mrs. Aden's best care, did slip away rapidly, through the long, though not very dangerous illness which came immediately to her husband; and though a former employer sought his services as soon as he was again able to labor, nothing could be spared from his wages to replenish the diminished purse.
               On the contrary, one gold piece after another disappeared, till all that remained of the lady's gift was the silken netting, and the gold clasp with the name Maria engraved upon it.
               His early illness had prevented Mr. Aden from ascertaining who the travellers were; and after the money was all expended, Rachel hoped that her husband would never learn anything about them. Almost every evening, however, when it was possible for her to do so, she knelt near the altar in the little chapel on the hillside, and prayed Heaven to restore to that beautiful lady, whom in her soft whisperings she would often call Sister, all the earthly blessings of which she had been deprived.
               It may be high Heaven heard those earnest prayers, and the restoration of all her good things came to her for that casting of her bread upon the waters.
               
               The strange lady herself thought so, years afterwards, when her blessings returned doubly to her.
               When Rachel saw how the money which had been given her was slipping away, and that there was no prospect that the sum would ever be made whole again, the thought had come to her of returning to their native land while it was possible for them to do so.
               Her health was now very good, and the sale of their few effects, with what remained in the purse, would furnish them with a sum sufficient to defray the expenses of the voyage. She had learned, lately, that her former guardian was now almost alone again.
               His sister was dead, and one or two of her daughters were already married or about to be; and she longed very earnestly to see him, and to care for him again, feeling very sure that his strong love for her could not have quite died out, and that, thereafter, he would regard Mr. Aden only through her eyes.
               They could all be very happy together, she thought.
               But her husband would not listen to her suggestion.
               Through Captain Singleton, from whom they occasionally heard, they learned that Mr. Maitland, whose identity with the former lighthouse keeper had never been doubted, was still at The Rocks, faithfully keeping the promise he had made his brother, and Mr. Aden shrank from dislodging him from the place, and even from having any communication whatever with him. Above all things, he did not wish to meet Mr. Hall.
               "While our kind friend lives, Rachel," he said, "we will not return. I could not stand in his presence again, suffering ing him to retain the same opinion of me which he has so long cherished; and enduring the eager, unbroken scrutiny of those eyes, whose light, I have many times nervously fancied, has been drawn from my very life, leaving to me only gloomy darkness.
               "If I ever seek him again, it will be for the purpose of taking my brother to him, and making him confess how he wronged me in my boyhood; and if he refused to do so, one of us would—
               "The sea must roll between Philip Maitland and myself, my wife!"
               And so Rachel's hopes were crushed; and the weeks and months, till five more years were added to her married life, passed away, with much the same chequering of light and shade as had been woven into the preceding ones; and then the night, whose morning, it seemed most likely, would be the eternal one, settled down upon them.
               There was a terrible pestilence raging in the city, and one evening, as he was returning from his place of employment, from which, at the half frantic entreaties of his wife, he had absented himself for several days, but to which at length, dire necessity compelled him to return, Mr. Aden staggered like a drunken man as he drew near his threshold, falling so insensibly upon it, that, for an hour or more, his wife believed him dead, or quite past resuscitation.
               Rachel had not for some months past had her usual degree of health, and so palsied was she at the sight of her husband's situation, that but one thought would enter her mind; and she knelt beside him, clasping her child, a beautiful boy of two years, to her breast, and praying for the death of herself and her babe.
               Her attention was at length drawn away from herself, for a moment, by the rumbling of carriage wheels, an infrequent sound in the immediate vicinity of her dwelling; and she remembered that her cousin, Captain Singleton, was to visit her that evening.
               His ship had come into a neighboring port a few weeks previous. Her husband had met with him, and the captain had promised to call on her the night before he again sailed for America, and to take charge of a letter to Mr. Maitland.
               Mr. Aden had finally given up all thoughts of ever returning to his native land, and he had concluded to write to his brother to that effect, and to tell him that thereafter he was at liberty to consult his own inclinations in relation to retaining longer his post at The Rocks, with the single condition that he would never seek him again.
               The carriage stopped before the cottage.
               Its occupant was, indeed, Captain Singleton, and his young wife was with him; and Rachel, holding the child in her arms, rushed to the gate, to prevent their entrance.
               "The pestilence is here!" she exclaimed, wildly.
               "My husband is already dead; and I—I am dying!—but my baby—oh, Edgar! if"—
               The young bride stepped quickly forward, and gazed for an instant into the sweet childish face before her, and then she extended her arms.
               "He shall be mine!" she said. "If you live, Edgar will bring him back to you; but he shall never be motherless!"
               While she was speaking, her husband had pushed open the gate, and walked up to the cottage door, though Rachel had tried to stop him, and was now closely examining the prostrate man.
               Mr. Aden was not dead, but the fearful disease was upon him. He would not be likely to recover, and so the captain told his cousin, as she aided him to carry the still insensible man into the dwelling, and place him upon a cot; but he would send a physician down from the city, as soon as he could return there. And then the carriage rolled away, and her sweet boy—she was glad for that—was gone; and she was alone with her husband, whose eyes, most likely, would never again unclose, and whose voice she would never more hear.
               She crouched down on the floor beside the low cot, and looking on the darkening face towards which the soft moonbeams were slowly creeping, she began to fancy, for she was not thinking clearly now, that when the light should fall upon his countenance, and her own, which was very near to his,—it would be midnight then,—that breathing, momentarily more difficult, would cease; and her lips moved again in prayer that her life might pass away with that of her husband.
               She did not know how long she thus prayed; but after a while the air felt very fresh and cool upon her heated brow. She thought she was moving, seemingly without any volition of her own, however, and in what direction, or for what purpose, she did not even try to think; and then there was only confusion in her mind. Even her husband was quite forgotten.
               After a while, however, drops of rich perfume fell upon her brow, an arm was tenderly clasped about her, and soothing words, which reached her yet dull ear like a strain of low, distant music, were whispered close beside her.
               Was that terrible midnight passed, and was this the farther shore of the dark River?
               She opened her eyes, and not the soft moonlight, but the beams of the bright morning sun, clothing themselves in rainbow hues as they came through the richly stained window of the little hillside chapel, were encircling her as with a halo of glory.
               Rachel thought of the "bow of the Covenant:" and the voice beside her was whispering:
               "Out of the deeps I cried unto the Lord, and He heard me! He hath delivered my soul from death!"
               She remembered the voice, and she looked up into the face of the beautiful lady she had met there, five years before, and who had called her Sister, and for whose happiness she had so many times since prayed, in this consecrated place.
               The lady assisted her to rise from the kneeling posture she had sustained for several hours, for, crazed by her grief, as she sat, watching that advancing moonlight, she at last had left her husband's side, and wandered away from her home, directing her steps instinctively towards the little church. And then the Signora Maria—so Mrs. Aden had always spoken of the strange lady to her husband—interrupting Rachel's expressions of dismay and self-accusation that she had left the bedside of her dying husband, informed her that he had been properly cared for during the past night.
               Half an hour since, he was living, though the prospect of his recovery was doubtful.
               While the lady was leading Rachel out of the chapel, and down the hillside to her carriage, she briefly answered the astonished woman's many inquiries.
               She had been, the past evening, on her way to the city, she said, and when a few rods distant from what proved to be Mr. Aden's dwelling, one of her horses stumbled and injured a leg, and while her coachman went forward to procure another, the lady and her female attendant approached the open door near them, to request permission to remain within the cottage until her servant returned.
               The low moans and the labored breathings which met her ear, she had just been listening to in her own family. Her uncle,—the old gentleman whom Mrs. Aden had seen with the lady on the two occasions when the women had met before,—and one of her domestics, had very recently died of the pestilence; and the suffering man was cared for to the best of her ability.
               Fortunately there were medicines in the carriage, and she knew how to administer them.
               After some hours they gave him much relief.
               His torpor had passed away; his reason returned, and he had looked about him, and called for his wife and child. Her servant had informed her that when on his way to the city to procure a horse, he had seen a woman entering the chapel, and therefore the lady had sought her there.
               The skilful but careless physician for whose promised prompt attendance on Mr. Aden, Captain Singleton had most liberally paid, had finally made his appearance; but the sick man had again fallen into a state of insensibility, when his wife returned, and for many succeeding days his life was despaired of.
               Most likely Rachel would not have been alive to rejoice over his, at length, slowly returning health, but for the tender, sisterly care of the beautiful lady—Signora di Leuca, so her attendants called her—who, with a female servant, remained at the cottage for the most of the time, till Mr. Aden was pronounced by his physician out of danger.
               In her great anxiety and grief she scarcely comprehended how she and her husband were watched over, and how their wants were all anticipated and supplied.
               But when those terrible days and nights, so wearying in their rapid alternations of hope and fear, were passed, and on a bright, sweet morning, when all nature seemed rejoicing as in renewed existence, the lady came to her, and put her arms about her neck, and whispered,—herself greatly moved:
               "He will live; and you will again be happy!"
               Rachel, with a flood of tears gushing from her eyes, sank down at the woman's feet, and exclaimed:
               "I told you once that I worshipped my Maker, alone! but henceforth, while I live"—
               The white hand was suddenly placed on her lips.
               "You owe me no thanks!" the lady interrupted; "I have only been seeking my own pleasure. Mine is a darkened life! The one blessing left me, is the ability, sometimes, to serve my fellow-beings!"
               Then she went away, and Rachel, though she was sure that she had never loved a woman in her life half as much as she loved this stranger, and though she believed her little short of an angel in purity and goodness, felt relieved when she was gone.
               "There is something very strange about her, George!" she said, as she sat alone with her husband, her arms about his neck, and her head close to his, drinking in great draughts of life from the renewed fountain of his existence;—"something very strange!
               "I scarcely thought of it when you were so ill, but I remember now, how often, when you were lying with your eyes closed and your face partially averted, and we were watching beside you, if her glance happened suddenly to fall on you, a very terrible expression would come over her features. Agony and hate, deeper and bitterer than I could have believed the human countenance capable of revealing, marked her fair face; and then if you chanced to turn your head or open your eyes, that frightful look would pass quite away, and the sweet, beautiful smile, so full of sad, but patient resignation, would return again;—just as she looked when she first glanced at your miniature, just as she looked after regarding it, attentively, for a moment.
               "But she has been an angel of mercy to us, and may Heaven bless her, and restore to her whatever good she has lost."
               Mr. Aden responded—Amen! very slowly and with unusual thoughtfulness; and then suddenly asked:
               "Do you know anything of this lady's history?"
               Rachel knew nothing farther than that she was unmarried; that the elderly gentleman in whose company she was, when they had seen her in Florence, who was with her when Rachel met with her in the little chapel five years since, was only her uncle, though Mrs. Aden had supposed him her husband. The gentleman had recently died, leaving his niece a very large fortune.
               Those particulars she had gathered from the casual remarks of the lady's maid.
               "And did she make any inquiries, or did you speak to her of our past history?" Mr. Aden asked.
               Rachel had said nothing to the lady about her husband or herself. She had only told her of her little boy, why she had sent him from her, to whose care she had entrusted him, and where he would be taken.
               The lady, she thought, had been singularly reticent about herself, and she had not manifested the least curiosity in relation to the antecedents of the people she was so greatly assisting. She appeared simply desirous of seeing them restored to health.
               A few days after the lady's departure from the cottage, a gentleman from the neighboring city called on Mr. Aden, to offer him a situation of profit and trust at a place some score of miles distant from his present abode.
               His friend Signora di Leuca, who, he incidentally remarked, was about to travel in some foreign country, had spoken to him of the American gentleman as a person well qualified to perform the duties which would be required; and Mr. Aden could retain the situation as long as he chose to do so.
               The offer was very gladly accepted, and Rachel, with fully restored health, now looked forward to the future with brighter hopes than she had ever before suffered herself to entertain.
               A joyful letter was written to her cousin—Captain Singleton ton—to be mailed for the port to which his ship was bound, requesting him, on his next voyage, which he expected would again be to some Italian city, to bring back her little boy to her—when the mother's heart was again most sorely wounded.
               News came to Mr. Aden that Captain Singleton's ship was wrecked only an hour's sail distant from its destined port, and his wife and her child, with most of the crew, had perished.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIX.
               MEASURE FOR MEASURE.
               TWICE during those fifteen years and upwards of his monotonous life at The Rocks, and the shocks were comparatively recent, and they were not wide apart, Mr. Maitland had felt the earth heaving beneath his feet, and ponderous ruins falling about him; but, unmercifully, he then thought, he had not been engulfed, his life had not been crushed out.
               The first woe that came was the supposed drowning of his son, the intelligence of which Greyson had brought to him in the early evening of the day on which Luke's boat had failed to return to the beach; when, hours later, heedless whether the gaping seas made him their prey or not, he had taken his boat, and crossed over to the mainland, to stand for a moment beside his wife, as unknown to her, he had more than once done before since that night when he had first sought the island.
               This time, if he could reach her alive, he was determined to speak to her, whatever the consequences to himself might be.
               Jerry Greyson, for reasons best known to himself alone, had not mentioned to him the disappearance of Du Bois; and for aught Mr. Maitland knew that night, or for some succeeding days, the Frenchman was still in the neighborhood.
               But half-maddened by agony as he was, he had been so terror-stricken at the moment he reached the bedside of his wife, by the sight of that face looking through the window, whose lineaments were clearly defined to his keen gaze by the bright, lingering lightning-flash, that he had fled precipitately from the dwelling, to return to it no more, not even when the second and bitterer woe came—the death of his gentle, wronged wife.
               Monotonous! Beside those two events, nothing had come to disturb that terrible monotony.
               To trim and light those beacon-lamps when the sun was going down, to watch them steadily burning through the seemingly interminable hours, and to extinguish the flame when it was no longer needed; to gather the fuel which could never be consumed, and pile it high above memory's ever-heated ashes, till the fires leaped out dense and wide, and the soul was scorched and the brain seemed maddened, and then to draw over the unhallowed holocaust the thick, dark curtain of despair—this was the employment of the night.
               And the sole business of the day was, frequently, to wander along the rocky shores of the islands with a glass in his hand, seldom elevated, however, to the mainland, or to the white sails coming and going in the distance; sometimes, when the fishermen were absent, to push his boat off a short way oceanward, and sit idly for hours, suffering it to move at its will, repeating to himself, as he often did, the words of "the gentle angler": 
                     
                        watch the sun to rise and set,
                        And meditate my time away,
                        And beg a quiet passage to a welcome grave!"
                     
                  
               
               That was the only future Mr. Maitland came, at length, to look forward to.
               While he knew his wife and son to be living, he had been hoping—very faintly, indeed, sometimes, but always hoping—that, at length, he would be released from his self-imposed imprisonment, which, now and then, but for the sake of those on whom it would bring such sorrow and shame, seemed more intolerable than the most ignominious death would be.
               Perhaps Du Bois, for whose residence at The Sands Mr. Maitland easily enough accounted, might, in time, give up watching and waiting for his return to his wife and son, and quit the neighborhood.
               Then,—though he would not break the promise made to his brother, never to resign his post without the knowledge and consent of George Aden, or, while their old friend Mr. Hall was living, suffer the exchange of "keepers" which had been made at the lighthouse to be known without the acknowledgment of his youthful crime,—he might have some communication with his son.
               Most likely, after Mr. Hall's decease, intelligence of which, knowing the feebleness of the old man's health at the time his ward had left him, he wondered, year after year, did not reach him through Greyson, his half-brother would return; and then, if he could safely do so, he would leave the island.
               But after those two great sorrows came, he looked forward only to the release which death would bring.
               No one, he believed, but Greyson, had ever suspected that he was not George Aden; and the fisherman, who plainly perceived that he would gain nothing by the disclosure of the secret, even if it were a very important one to the lighthouse keeper, and who, as has been before remarked, never concerned himself with any affair which was not likely to bring him some pecuniary profit, manifested, after the first shock of disappointment at the frustration of his hopes in regard to Miss Sally Jones was over, as much interest in the welfare of the present keeper, as he had done in that of the "Commodore."
               The increase of pay, slight as it was, for the services rendered, satisfied Jerry perfectly.
               Mr. Maitland could not have afforded a large sum for the lulling of the fisherman's suspicions. His salary, and that was small, was all the means at his command; and of this a portion was scrupulously put aside, so that when the time should come at which he might safely do so a comfortable home could be provided for the deserted woman who was now laboring so incessantly.
               On the night when he had first gone over to the lighthouse, and persuaded his brother to allow him to remain there, he had, at the moment of parting with him, and unperceived by George Aden, thrust a wallet which had just been well filled, for the purpose of paying off the workmen employed on the house, into his coat pocket; so carelessly, however, that it had fallen thence into the sea as Mr. Aden stepped into his boat.
               
               Mr. Maitland was forgetful, at the time, that that was all the money at his immediate control; and the wealth so guiltily taken from others, was, in his present situation, entirely beyond his reach.
               He could neither use it himself, nor return it to its rightful owner, without confessing his great crime.
               After his wife, and as he supposed, his son were dead, feeling sometimes that his own life would soon be ended, he had written a letter which would come into his brother's hands after his—Mr. Maitland's—death, in which he had told the whole story of his terrible sin, and described the place where that wealth was concealed, that George might find it and see that it was rightly disposed of.
               Occasionally within the first two or three years after he had taken up his residence at the island, and once or twice more recently, the few people in the neighborhood who were friends of George Aden endeavored to keep up an acquaintance with the lighthouse keeper. The visitors, however, Mr. Maitland took good care never to see. The invitations to go over to the mainland were always declined in such a manner that they were seldom repeated by any one except the old gentleman, Mr. Hall, after his return to the vicinity; and the infrequent letters he received, a search among the carefully-preserved papers of his brother enabled him to reply to in a manner which created no surprise in the correspondents. In his solitary walks along the shores of the island, whenever he was hailed by the fishermen, whose homes were at The Rocks or The Sands, he was always called Commodore, or Mr. Aden.
               Greyson, however, began at length to suspect that there was some one beside himself who did not believe that the lighthouse keeper had a right to answer to those names; and after the disappearance of her father, he began, very carefully, to watch the movements of Brendice Du Bois.
               But during the week referred to in a preceding chapter, the week before Easter, the fisherman had been away from his home, back some miles from the coast, and was not expecting to return until Saturday night; and the girl's boat had moved away from the shore in the direction of The Rocks, on the eve of Good Friday, when the Convoy lamps were not lighted, unperceived by any one.
               After his great sorrows had come, Mr. Maitland, as has been said, began to look forward to death alone for release from his present sufferings.
               Through the last terrible winter, the mind began to communicate its ailments to the physical system.
               Several times, when the spring was approaching, as he went over that flight of steps which seemed daily to increase in steepness and in the number of its windings, he had suddenly paused and shivered with something which was not simply coldness; and, after a moment of strange surprise, almost of fear, he had looked cautiously over his right shoulder, feeling that a form, from which some deadly emanation proceeded, had drawn close to his side.
               He had always sat down upon the stairs and rested for a brief space, when that disagreeable sensation was passing away; and when it was quite gone, and he rose again to his feet, he was not perfectly sure that he had not been, for a few minutes, sleeping.
               Every time that feeling had stolen over him, that dread form seemed to draw nearer; and when it passed away, though wondering why the slumber came so suddenly, he was more convinced than before that he had simply been dreaming.
               But on one pleasant spring morning, that Presence did more than merely draw near and stand by his side; and the stupor which followed never quite passed away.
               It was the morning of Maunday Thursday.
               He had not been feeling very well for a few days past; but that morning, when he had extinguished his lamps, and descended the topmost turn of that long flight of steps, and had paused to look out upon the ocean, he was thinking that he had not felt such a buoyancy of spirits, and such freedom from physical weakness, for a long time; and he began to wonder if there might not still be a pleasant future for him in this world.
               He had promised his brother never to quit his post without his knowledge, but he knew at what point a letter would reach Mr Aden; and he thought, a few hours hence, after he had taken a short walk along the beach, he would write to George; the letter to be given to Greyson when he came over to the island the next Saturday evening. He and his brother had agreed in what manner to address each other, if either ever wished to open a correspondence.
               During the preceding night he had written a letter to Mr. Hall, in reply to those frequently sent him, to answer at once, and forever, the gentleman's earnest entreaties that George "would make his future home with his old friend." In the reply he wrote his own name—Philip Maitland—and confessed the ingratitude and crimes of his youth, and begged of Mr. Hall, if he could pity and forgive him, never to seek him or address him again.
               He had not decided, after it was completed, to send this letter to his former friend. The fancy had seized him to pen the few lines; he could not have told why. He would make up his mind, in the course of the morning, whether or not to send it; perhaps when he was determining what he would write to George.
               There might be a pleasant future ready to open before him still. He was not an old man yet, hardly fifty-three; and the various schemes for the acquisition of wealth and happiness—he had decided that henceforth he would employ no unlawful means to secure either—which presented themselves to his mind, were so engrossing his thoughts that he did not heed how the time was passing until the sun had turned an angle of the lighthouse, and was shining brightly upon his face.
               Then he looked up straight at the luminary, and wondered, in a dull way, why his eyes could never gaze on its glare before, and why he did not experience any warmth from its beams; and, though the sky was cloudless, and he was not dazzled by the intense light, why it seemed that there was a curtain of ever-thickening texture unrolling itself between him and the sun.
               Slowly, it seemed to him—and the cold touch which was laid upon his shoulder, and reached upward, over one side of his head, and downwards, the whole length of his body, he thought was many moments in making its terrible progress; though it had been but the briefest space between the first fall of the sunlight upon his brow, and the prostration of his form by the terrible stroke of paralysis.
               
               He was conscious that some heavy body had fallen; fallen upon the stairway; and that it was dropping down, step by step! Then there was a faint consciousness which appeared to come neither by the sense of hearing nor the sense of feeling, of the grating together of broken bones; and a flesh wound upon the brow and down the side of the face, deep, but from which the sluggish blood could scarcely trickle.
               And then there was a long darkness, really hours in length, for when the half-dead man again lifted a single eyelid, ignorant of what had happened to him, and, for a brief space, forgetful even of where he was—for an indistinct remembrance of scenes passed through long years before, came to him with his reluctantly returning and dim consciousness—all was blackness around him.
               There was a sweep of cool air; it seemed to him like the motion of softly-flowing waters, and it partially restored his senses; and looking up, far away he thought it was, a single shaft of moonlight was spanning that river of darkness.
               He tried to rise from his recumbent position, and then he became sensible of the horror of his situation.
               His right arm, from which the coat sleeve was rolled back until the broad, blood-red mark upon the wrist was wholly uncovered, and the right leg, were no longer obedient to his will. The left arm was broken; and between him and the hurried, fearful plunge down that long flight of steps,—down to the flags at the bottom, there was only one foot, accidentally so braced, by the hold of the nails in the heel of his boot to the strip of iron fastened upon the stairs, as to prevent him from falling.
               In this fearfully dangerous situation he had been lying for hours, and he was fully aware how much his danger was increased by the return of sensibility. The strain upon the limb which was upholding him, began to cause him almost as severe suffering as did the fractured arm; and each moment a change of position was becoming more and more absolutely necessary, he thought, to his very existence. And where was help to come from?
               He knew of Greyson's absence from his home, and that he had not intended to return to it for some days.
               The inhabitants of the adjacent islands would not care whether the beacon-light was burning or not, and they felt no interest, he was very certain, in himself.
               There was no ship expected, immediately, at the port, and no person would be likely to come, to-night, to see why the lamps were not lighted. Some one might be over to the lighthouse in the morning; but long before that time, for he knew by the level moonbeams it must be now an early hour in the evening, it would be all over with himself.
               And now that death was so near, it seemed far less welcome to Mr. Maitland than he thought it would be, though it was not so much what was to come after, as what had gone before, of which he was thinking.
               To him, no object looked out from the darkness of the future, and no sound disturbed the portentous silence.
               But in those moments of extremest suffering, both of body and mind—for a stronger vitality, it seemed, had been seized upon by the one part of the system, when the other was struck lifeless; and with a prostration of some of its faculties, more acute perception had come to the mental powers which were yet untouched,—the past spread itself out before him, but not like a wonderfully painted and wonderfully illuminated panorama.
               It was the living, voiceful reality: more distinctly heard and more clearly seen than it was when the eyes of that fair woman, standing on the deck of that burning ship, looked in his so trustingly, as his hand had fastened its hold on hers, and then so wildly and desparingly when his fingers loosened their grasp; the glance of the husband which had been so warmly grateful, changed to that vengeful, maniacal glare; the agonized shriek of the woman, the low wail of the drowning babe, and the unuttered curses of the Frenchman, which were now being fulfilled; the smile of his own gentle wife, which, though it was so sweet, was always so full of unasked questions, and the prattle of his child, whose thoughtless words were often venomous arrows to that guilty heart.
               "Infinite Mercy!" faintly articulated that trembling, half-palsied tongue, as, for a brief moment, he forgot his terrible corporeal sufferings,—"shut out the past from my sight and hearing, and I will ask for nothing more!"
               Was that prayer answered?
               An insensibility was coming, but he must not yield to it; for with it, he believed, death would now come.
               Again he felt that rush of cool air, which had, at first, revived him. And—could it be? Would a so justly offended Heaven be merciful to him?
               Was that faint, echoing sound coming up the stairs, a human footfall, or was his reason forsaking him?
               Nearer and nearer; more and more distinct!
               Not like Greyson's slow, cautious step, but uncertain, and with hurrying swiftness. But Mr. Maitland knew that his hearing was now very imperfect. No one but Jerry would have come to him to-night.
               "You—you,"—he repeated, in a feeble, tremulous voice.
               He remembered the fisherman's name well enough, but he could not utter it; and he strove earnestly, though vainly, he thought, to find words which would express what he wished to say.
               But the eager listener who paused on the stairs a few steps below the prostrate man, understood the words of deep thankfulness which issued from his lips, that some one had come to his aid; the request to pass by him very cautiously and hasten up to the lamps, which were ready to be lighted, and then, taking along the strong rope that would be found easily enough as soon as the lights were burning, hurry back to him. And then, the light, swift tread went on.
               Mr. Maitland fancied that they were flowing garments which swept past him, and when the person darted through that shaft of moonlight, he thought it wore the figure of a woman; but, of course, he must be mistaken.
               He closed his eyes, and tried to collect his scattered senses and to gather strength from hope, to bear his removal to a place of safety, which Greyson would, undoubtedly, be able to effect; sending up an earnest, wordless petition to Heaven—it was a strange thing for Mr. Maitland to pray for himself—that life and reason might be spared him till he could carry out the resolutions which had been suddenly formed in his mind, when his strained ear was listening to the first footfall upon the stairs.
               
               A strange peace came to the agonized heart when that prayer silently arose, and a calmness and collectedness of thought to the widely-tortured brain. When he looked up again, thinking it was time that Jerry should return to him, the lamps were brightly burning; but the light which fell about him did not all proceed from the beacon lamps.
               Some one who stood beside him was holding an unclosed lantern about his head, and the blaze, flashing out in the brisk current of air coming up the long stairway, was glaring so dazzlingly in his face, that, for a moment, he saw nothing but the light.
               When he looked again, however, the lantern had been placed on a step above his head, and the brightness fell full on the countenance of the one at his side. It was not Jerry Greyson, but a tall, stately woman, of elegant form, and transcendently beautiful face;—that face whose features, for now nigh twenty years, had been engraving themselves more and more deeply upon his memory.
               Her arms were folded over her breast, and though a most sweet smile was dimpling the flushed cheek, wreathing the parted lips, and dancing about the brilliant dark eyes, the poise of the head, and the position of the whole figure, was that of proud and exultant triumph.
               The feeble gaze of the prostrate man grew keener as his eyes erested on Brendice Du Bois.
               He knew who she was by her striking resemblance to the woman he had suffered to drop into the sea.
               He had looked on her countenance before, though a great change had passed over her since the night he had seen that face peering through the window when he was standing, for the last time, by the bed of his slumbering wife. This was the girl concerning whom Greyson had, several times, thrown out some dark hints, which Mr. Maitland understood now well enough.
               The man he had so terribly wronged had failed to find him; but his daughter had discovered where he was, and fate had delivered him into her hands.
               Those hands, he knew, had no "sweet mercy" in them, for as his gaze dropped, for an instant, from her face, he saw, though they were still folded upon her breast, that the fingers were beginning to move convulsively; and when he again looked up, the smile had faded from the features, the head was thrown forward, the nether lip held between the teeth, and there was a chill and a terror to the beholder, in the fixed gaze of the dim, half-closed eyes.
               "I accept my fate!" Mr. Maitland said.
               The extremity of despair gave him, for a moment, power to utter the words very intelligibly.
               "It is right that I am lying here, helpless, at your feet;—right that I should die before your eyes, when your hands could save me! I would that the past could be undone, but the dead cannot be restored to life by the bitter repentance of the murderer. What I can, I will return to you. Your wealth"——
               His strength was entirely exhausted; his lips moved only silently.
               Brendice uttered a single word.
               He did not know what it was. A sound which seemed to come from a very great distance fell softly and sweetly as a silvery lute-note upon his deafening ear, and to the dimming vision the face above him grew wondrously fair with a beauty which seemed not of earth, and from the glittering eye a drop fell on his brow which he thought was heavenly dew.
               He heard and saw nothing more.
               He knew that his one sound, but utterly wearied limb could sustain his weight no longer. His foot slipped from the stair to which it had clung, and now—
               No, he was not dropping down that frightful descent. There was the clutch of a hand upon his shoulder, and then he knew nothing more; only once, a while later, he seemed, for an instant, to be dreaming that he caught the sound of a panting, struggling breath above him, that there was a great strain upon the one shoulder not yet beyond feeling, and that he was moving, not swiftly downward, mangled and bleeding, but slowly—very slowly and tenderly, as if drawn by the hand of love, upward!
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               GLORIA TIBI, DOMINE!
               IT had required a long and desperate struggle to remove Mr. Maitland to a place of safety.
               It seemed hours to Brendice before her efforts were crowned with success; and though she had great confidence in her physical strength, and her power of endurance, the thought, several times, flashed across her mind, that her attempts would be unsuccessful.
               Her own life, as well as that of the helpless man, was at stake; for she had not only wound the rope which she passed beneath his arms around her own wrists, but had thrown it over her shoulders.
               She was not thinking, however, much of her own danger, or her own suffering, though the feet which she had bared, lest they should slip, were cut till the blood flowed by the sharp edges of the strips of iron fastened upon the stairs, and her wrists and hands were blistering within the coils of the rope.
               The silent cry of thanksgiving which went up from her heart as each separate step was safely passed over, and an agonized petition that her strength might not be exhausted till she had gained the summit of the stairs, was offered far less for herself than for him whom, so lately, she had thought she would be willing to peril both body and soul to destroy.
               Why was she trying to save him?
               When the perilous ascent was ended, and she had released herself from the rope, and sank down upon a bench before the open window, almost as much exhausted as was the breathing, but insensible man, she began to ask herself the question: Why had she been trying to save him? Why did she now wish that strength would come with the cool, fresh air which was fanning her aching, heated brow, and staying the thoughts which had been rushing tumultuously through her brain, till the dulled organs became again sensitive and acute—that strength would come back to the sharply aching hands and wearied feet, in order that she might descend the long stairway, and take her boat back to The Sands, and seek, there, the aid she could not give him herself!
               She listened to the sounds of the mighty ocean; but she could, no longer, catch the tones of her father's voice:
               
                  Revanche!
               
               It was only the words of the great Father she heard,—the words which she would never listen to before, but which came to her now as with the awful terror and majesty of Sinai:
               "Vengeance is mine! I will repay, saith the Lord."
               She looked down into the water, whose peacefully-flowing, white-crested waves, sparkling in the moonlight, were laving the smooth, shining rocks; and far away, out upon the sea; but there were no eyes glancing up from its depths now, either in sad complaint, or in implacable wrath.
               Only the reflection of the beautiful constellation, the highest in heaven, was there; and Brendice thought of the Lion of the tribe of Judah, who, on the day of which the morrow was the anniversary, became a Lamb, voluntarily giving Himself up a sacrifice on the altar of Infinite Justice, that the flame of the vengeful sword might be quenched in His pure blood, and guilty man, repentant and believing in Him, go free.
               She sank upon her knees and looked up to the clear sky, and answered the question which had arisen in her heart, with quivering, but determined lips:
               "It is for Thy sake, O Lamb of God, my ever blessed Redeemer!" adding, after some moments had passed, very softly, and with flowing tears:
               "Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us!"
               And then thought ran on:
               Out of the boat to which she had clung so long, though it was oarless and sailless, and there was in her hand only a false chart of the dangerous seas—out of the boat, she was flinging herself into a wide, deep ocean, but safely! for coming down to meet her, walking upon the rough billows, which, at His approach, sank to peaceful rest, was a bright Form, with outstretched hands, and a smile which ensured safe conduct to the desired haven.
               When half an hour had passed, Brendice rose to her feet and went to look on the face of Mr. Maitland.
               She had not dared to do so before since the thought came to her that she must try to save his life.
               He was breathing more regularly now, but his reason was gone; and his ability to move himself, though the girl could only conjecture why, aside from the fracture of the left arm, which, she observed, had dropped down helplessly as he attempted to raise it, appeared to be no greater than when she had found him lying upon the stairs. But she knew that he needed skilful and immediate medical assistance.
               Would she be able to procure it for him, while assistance might be availing? She glanced about her to see if anything could be found which would administer, in any degree, to his relief, while she made the attempt to return to the mainland.
               Fortunately there were at hand a couple of pillows, one of which she placed beneath the head, which had been turning uneasily and trying to lift itself from the floor, and on the other she rested the broken limb in a position most comfortable for it; and then she bathed the deeply-wounded face, which would never again be mistaken for that of George Aden, in the fresh water she found near her.
               She felt very faint and sick herself, when, as the long, heavy hair was brushed back from his brow, and the dark, dried blood washed away, the excessive pallor came out on the wasted features.
               But she quickly conquered the weakness, and drew back from the prostrate man, as his eye slowly unclosed and sought to raise itself to her countenance, though she thought there was little intelligence in its expression.
               The few brief words he incoherently strove to utter, she fancied were addressed to his wife, and she did not wish to change the direction of his thoughts to the terrible channel they might follow, if his gaze fastened on her features; and, besides, there was something in the expression of that eye which brought very forcibly to her mind the fact, the existence of which she was always denying to herself, and which must no more be acknowledged, now that she was trying to save this man's life, than when she was seeking for an opportunity to destroy it.
               She turned away from him, thinking that she must delay no longer, though her descent must be slow and cautious, for she believed that the hurried swiftness with which she had ascended the stairs would be fatal to her, exhausted as she now was. She paused a moment near the top of that long, unbroken flight, and looked from the window, out of which Mr. Maitland had been gazing when that cold hand was laid so heavily upon him.
               As she glanced over that stretch of water which must be rowed across, and against a stiffening breeze and an out-flowing tide,—she would have thought little of the task but for the aching shoulders and the swollen hands and wrists,—she endeavored to exercise her new-found faith in heaven, and to force back from the eyes which were very unused to weep, the tears which the fear of failure caused to flow. While still looking from the window, she fancied she heard a faint sound coming up from the spot where she had landed.
               She leaned quickly, and almost dangerously, from the aperture which overlooked the little inlet that ran up between the huge rocks serving for the foundation of the lighthouse, and she saw a figure moving swiftly forward, striving to keep in the shadow of the boulders, towards the spot where she had left her boat.
               
               The great dread which seized on Brendice, as she looked,—for there was no boat but her own there, Mr. Maitland not having supplied himself with one since his had been dashed to pieces, the preceding summer—the great dread gave her strength to go over that long stairway with fearful speed.
               She did not reach her boat an instant earlier than was necessary for its preservation, for the person, who was a woman, whom she had observed while looking from the window, had loosened it from its fastenings, and was just stepping into it, as Brendice suddenly laid her hand upon her shoulder.
               The woman uttered a low cry, and turned her face, which, in the bright moonlight, looked deadly pale, towards her, and she recognized the countenance as that of the young girl she had heard called Ives Dorn, and with whom she had had a long conversation, at her one visit over at The Rocks, on the day after her father's boat had returned, without an occupant, to The Sands.
               She was, herself, also recognized; for the girl, whose color quickly returned when her eyes met those of Brendice, and who was more embarrassed, though less terrified, than she would have been if the new-comer was the one she expected it to be, heightened her confusion by her attempts to conceal it; and confessed plainly enough, by her denials of it, her intended theft; and, at length, laughing at her want of cleverness, she said, half hysterically:
               "What is the use? I know you; you are one of us! better, perhaps, than we are, but you understand us; I wanted the boat; I did not know it was yours, or I would not have tried to get it. I got mad with somebody to-night, and so, two hours ago, I crept down to the beach, and set a boat adrift.
               "I don't mind telling you of it!
               "But after it was gone, and I stood watching its course upon the water, now carried out to the sea, and now thrown up towards the rocks, and the moon and the stars looking down at it and me, I thought that we, the boat and myself—were very much alike.
               "Did you ever think you would like to be good?" she interrupted herself to ask; and before Brendice had time to reply to the sudden question, she continued:
               "It is easy enough to be so, when you can come in on a smooth wave; but you just try it, some time, when the tide is turning, and see what luck you will have!
               "And so I ran along down the shore, to watch the boat; and as the water was not very high, I waded across the channel, hoping that some wave might throw it up so far towards the beach that I could get it; and hoping, too,"—and the girl laughed again, low and sadly, now, but as if in self-derision,—"that somebody, some time, would stretch out a strong hand and save me!
               
               "But when I got over here, it was gone; and I felt sorry for it, and for myself, too; and half wished I was in the boat, out at sea, though it had neither sail nor oars in it, nor ever could find its way"—
               "And you were taking my boat to go out in search of the missing one!" said Brendice, in an apologetic tone.
               "No, I was not!" replied the girl, defiantly. "I was going to steal it! I knew it did not belong to the fisherman who comes over here so often from The Sands. I thought it might have drifted in here lately, and he,"—she pointed up to the lighthouse, "had hauled it on shore. I should have told him, if he had caught me stealing it, that it was my property. I am not so much afraid of him as some of them are; and I wanted a boat to take back to the old woman I quarrelled with to-night, though she was more to blame for our difficulty than myself; and she will not believe it was I who sent her boat adrift, unless I tell her so."
               "Well, you may have mine," said Brendice, "if you will help me row back quickly to The Sands!"
               The girl looked incredulous.
               "Yes, see my hands! You shall have it, if you will hasten." She stepped into the boat.
               Ives Dorn immediately followed her, and lifting both the oars, began to ply them vigorously, expressing unbounded astonishment that one so accustomed to manage a boat as was Brendice, should have injured her hands so much by rowing; and thinking it was not at all strange that she ran her boat ashore, in order to rest awhile.
               "Only I would not have gone in there," she said; "you did not know where you were, though, maybe, as the Commodore lighted his lamps so very late to-night. Haven't got any fish, I see, though you did stay out so long. Well, some of our boats came in almost empty to-night."
               Brendice did not reply to these, and many other volubly expressed remarks, though she was very well satisfied that her presence at the island, which, it suddenly occurred to her, might appear most singular to her companion, was so easily accounted for by the young woman.
               Brendice did not reply; but she was very busily, and, had it not been for her anxiety in regard to Mr. Maitland, very pleasantly thinking and planning for the future of herself and little Lang.
               Yes! this girl, Ives Dorn, should have her boat.
               She would never need it herself again; for the next Monday morning she would take the little boy and go away from The Sands forever, and forget all about her old, cheerless life there.
               She would remember that solitary grave on the hill-side, beneath the clustering evergreens, and always feel very grateful to the gentle being whose image was impressed upon her mind as she was kneeling by the open window, high up in the lighthouse, and looking away towards the sky, as deeply as if her actual presence was there.
               She would always feel very grateful to Mrs. Maitland for the patient, unwearied efforts which she had made to weave some brighter threads into the dark woof of her life; to guide her feet into the path which grows brighter and brighter unto the perfect day.
               Almost with her latest breath the dying woman had commended her to the care of Heaven, and at length, out of the darkness of her old life, she was very humbly thinking, she would come up, henceforth, to walk in that Path; He being her Helper.
               Her future seemed not gloomy to her, now.
               Thanks to her father, who, every day through that long winter, she had been thinking of with softening feelings, though she had not spoken yet to Mr. Brown about putting up, in the graveyard, a simple stone to his memory, or commenced cutting his name into the granite rock on which she had stood, so many times, looking away over the sea for the boat which finally came up to the beach without a hand to guide it, when she had thought of doing either, some feeling which she could not account for having withheld her from the execution of her purpose—thanks to her father, both her physical and intellectual powers had received such a training that it would be very strange if she could not procure for herself and for the little boy a comfortable and respectable livelihood.
               He would be all her own, now, she thought; and she would trust herself to love him.
               Of Luke Maitland there came no intelligence.
               No letter, since her decease, had reached H—— directed to his mother, and Miss Emma Brown, it was certain, had not heard from Luke; for after it became evident, even to herself, that her efforts in another direction would be entirely useless, she began to make a great show of mourning for the young man.
               Brendice had arrived at the conclusion that he had learned, soon after the night he had stealthily visited The Sands, of his mother's death, and that he either had lost the interest he manifested in the child as soon as the little loving face, which alone, she supposed, had excited that interest, was out of his sight; or that some accident had happened to himself.
               The child, by this time, had probably quite forgotten his real name. The passing recollection, called up by the sight of that painting which she took good care he should never see a second time, seemed to have gone from his mind as quickly as it came; and she would keep it a secret until some one who, she was sure, had a right to do so should appear to claim him.
               Luke had referred to his orphanage.
               Mr. Hall, even if he had any real claim to the child, which was not very likely, Brendice preferred to think, could not, with all his wealth, do more for the child than she would do;—the tenderest mother could not surpass her love and care for him; and besides, the old gentleman had returned to his home, without seeking the little boy.
               With the sweet babe to love and cherish, and Heaven to look forward to, and to trust in, Brendice thought she would forget the bitter portion which must always be mingled with her cup; and—
               "Cant you sing something?"
               Ives Dorn, as soon as she found, which was not immediately, her own tongue moved so nimbly that her companion did not reply to her, not offended, however, at Brendice's silence, as she accounted for it by the girl's very apparent fatigue, had commenced singing, in the rude vernacular she had dropped, as far as she was able, while talking
               Her voice was a rather pleasant one, and the boat-song was lively, though not particularly choice.
               Suddenly, as she looked up to the sky, and saw that the midnight was past, she remembered that it was the morning of the day which her mother, who died some years before, had regarded as most holy; and her careless face grew thoughtful, and she held up the oars for a moment, out of the water, and turning to Brendice, asked abruptly, but in a lower tone:
               "Can you sing something which ought to be sung to-day? My mother used to sing a solemn, but sweetly glad song on this morning. I have been forgetting that Good Friday was so near; for nobody over there,"—she nodded towards The Rocks, "cares for anything. I wish they did, though!" she added, huskily.
               "What did your mother sing about?" Brendice inquired, gently,—taking one of the oars from the girl's hand, and lowering it to the water.
               "Oh, I don't know!" she returned, as the boat, now rowed by both the girls, again danced over the sea.
               "They were strange words; in some foreign language, I think. My mother was a foreigner. My father, who once went out as mate in a merchantman, brought her home from over the seas.
               "I only remember,—perhaps you can tell what she meant,—I don't believe I understand it very well,—my mother often said, on this day, if the angels sang when Christ their Lord was born—born to die, what should men do, when He, their elder Brother, died, to live again forever?"
               The tears dropped softly from Brendice's eyes. It was the very question she had asked herself when she was kneeling in the lighthouse; and after a few moments of silence with both the girls, Brendice's voice rose loud and clear, as Ives had said in a very solemn, but sweetly-glad song, ringing far out over the gently rolling waters: 
                     
                        Gloria tibi, Domine!
                     
                  
               
               The boat was now nearing the shore.
               It had moved rapidly for some time past, for Brendice's fatigue was leaving her, or was forgotten, and she was a very swift rower; and William Jones, who was, at length, able to leave the bedside of young Brown, and was walking down towards the beach, looking away to the beacon-light, that now burned brightly, and thinking of Brendice Du Bois, caught the sound of the voice which he, readily enough, recognized as hers.
               He reached the water's edge just as the boat touched the sand, and while Ives, who had consented to defer her return to The Rocks till the morning, as the air had become quite chilly, was caring for the boat, Brendice hastily stepped on shore, and drew near the young man, addressing him in so low a tone that Ives did not comprehend the import of her words.
               "Something very terrible has happened to the man over at the lighthouse!" she said. "I am afraid, by this time, he is beyond the reach of medical skill. Hasten to him, William, and take a good physician with you; and, if he is still alive, oh, try to save him!"
               "I will, Brendice!" he replied, in the same low tone.
               "Doctor Clark is still at Mr. Brown's, but his patient is sleeping; and, it is thought, all danger is passed. We can both leave the sick lad now, and I will get my boat out at once and take the doctor over to the island.
               "Clark is very skilful. He will do all that can be done for Mr. Aden. He is Mr. Hall's physician; and you have heard how much interest the old gentleman takes in the lighthouse keeper. It is said that he is determined to have Mr. Aden at his house before Easter."
               William Jones forgot, for a moment, the concern he naturally felt in the welfare of his fellow-beings, in the pleasure he experienced in lingering near Brendice Du Bois, and looking in her face; but her reply to his words, though it conveyed an idea to him very different from that which was passing through the mind of the girl, crushed forever out of existence the hope he had secretly been cherishing all through those many months past, notwithstanding the prompt rejection of his suit the previous autumn.
               "Do not let it be known how you heard that he needed assistance;" she said, "and, William,"—in her earnestness, she laid her hand upon his arm,—"let this remain a secret with you, until some one else ascertains the fact, or he, himself, reveals it. The man at the lighthouse is not Mr. Aden. He is the father of Luke Maitland!"
               The young man made a great effort to gulp down something which seemed to be choking him, but he did not succeed well enough to trust his voice to answer her.
               He only took the hand she had placed upon his arm, and held it, for a moment, in both of his, and then turned and walked quickly away.
               Very soon after, Brendice, followed by Ives Dorn, moved towards her abode. Ives, who had been heated by her swift handling of the oar, and who had not the physical strength of Brendice, was now trembling with cold, and much exhausted; but she was soon made so very comfortable by a cup of hot tea, and a nice tucking about her of warm bedclothing, that she slept soundly.
               Brendice, however, did not seek her pillow.
               She had listened until her quick ear caught the sound of voices, one of which she knew to be that of young Jones, and the other, she doubted not, was the physician, down upon the beach; and then she knelt by her couch with one arm encircling her little charge, whose slumbers, since his head had dropped heavily on her shoulder at early night-fall, had not been disturbed.
               She had removed the slip of paper that had been fastened to his dress, and thanked Heaven that the Power, she thought it could be nothing else, which stays the raging of the furious, mighty sea, had held back her eager hand, that night, from blood-guiltiness.
               And she prayed, very earnestly, that the hand might, henceforth, be so kept from evil, that it could be fit to point out the path in which he should go, to this sweet child, and to guide therein his uncertain footsteps.
               Then her thoughts went out from herself, and, importunately, as for a very dear friend, she began to ask of Heaven that the efforts which would be made to better the condition of the wretched man over at the island, might be successful; falling insensibly into the form of words, as far as she could recollect it, which she had read at the bedside of Mrs. Maitland, on the last Sabbath of her earthly existence:
               "Give him unfeigned repentance for all the errors of his past life, and steadfast faith in Thy Son Jesus; that his sins may be done away by Thy mercy, and his pardon sealed in Heaven, before he go hence, and be no more seen!"

               THE EASTER-OFFERINGS.
               IVES DORN awoke very early from her sound repose, quite free from her cold, and perfectly rested; but Brendice, whose eyes had not been closed above an hour, was now sleeping quietly and profoundly.
               Her head was resting upon the side of the low couch, and one arm still encircled the little boy. She had not risen from the floor since kneeling down upon it. Sweet sleep had come to her, while the words of prayer were on her lips.
               Ives dressed herself noiselessly, that she might not disturb the sleepers; and when her very unstudied toilet was completed, feeling the necessity of an immediate return to The Rocks, she searched about the room for some article of clothing to protect her shoulders from the cool, fresh morning air.
               There was nothing to be found which she felt at liberty to appropriate to her use but a fisherman's old coat, which was hanging from a peg in a dark corner of the apartment. But that would serve her very well.
               She took it down, and was thrusting her arms into the sleeves, when she heard the rustling of a paper in one of the pockets. She quickly checked the movement, fearful of disturbing Brendice and the little boy, and sought very cautiously to remove the letter, such she thought it was, from the manner in which it was folded, before arraying herself in the tattered garment.
               A letter it proved to be, and addressed to Brendice Du Bois. Ives was not greatly skilled in chirography, but she managed to read the name, for the writing was as legible as it was elegant; and it was so beautiful to the girl that she wished the paper had not been such a "crunkly" one—here came in her vernacular—so she might open it, and see if the contents were as nice as the exterior looked. She would have attached no consequence to the breaking of the seal.
               Ives would have learned nothing, however, had she attempted to gratify her curiosity, for the writing was in a language of which she understood not a single word.
               There was something, however, in the old coat pocket, besides the letter; and that she could examine noiselessly, for the small, solid substance was wrapped in many folds of soft, white cotton.
               She glanced at Brendice and the child. They were both still soundly sleeping, and then she unrolled the cotton windings. But a shade of disappointment passed over her face, for there was nothing before her eager eyes but a small, white, shining stone.
               Ives thought, contemptuously, that she had seen "lots o' just sich dimuns" many a time, over among the rocks. It was encircled—the rest of the setting had been broken away—by a narrow band of gold, on which was a monogram, now partially obliterated, and originally so fancifully described, that it did not occur to the girl the lines were anything but accidental cuttings.
               What Ives would have done with the "dimun," had it not been, in her opinion, so utterly valueless, is uncertain.
               Most likely she would have taken it over to The Rocks, and after a sharp conflict with herself, either would have thrown it into the sea, or in bringing back the old coat, have brought back, too, the roll of cotton in the pocket, and that small, hard substance carefully wrapped within it. But as it was, after deliberating, for a moment, whether she had best try to get off that circlet or not—undoubtedly the band was nothing more than brass, Ives thought—she dropped it behind the couch, which was drawn away a short distance from the wall, upon a pile of little Lang's treasures—the pretty tinted pebbles and sea-shells which Brendice found on the beach for him; and placing the letter on the bed, so near the edge, however, that, unnoticed by her, it, too, fell upon the floor, she finished the arraying of herself in the old coat, and stepped noiselessly out of the dwelling.
               A few minutes later, she was in Brendice's boat, which was skimming, like a white-winged sea-bird, over the smooth water, laughing merrily to herself as she thought of the old fish-woman's surprise, when, on going down to the shore, she would find this nice new boat in the place of her old worn one, and the perfect ignorance which she would, herself, manifest of the exchange that had been made. And then Ives grew very sober.
               She began to wonder how she could make up to Mother Hobart the loss of her boat and get back this one, which she was determined to return to Brendice Du Bois, whose home the girl wished was over at The Rocks, as she had told her companion a dozen times the night previous, while they rowed over the water.
               She was relieved of one anxiety, however, as she drew near the landing. A fisherman was just pushing off from the Convoy,—it was William Jones—and at her request, he very willingly promised to see that Brendice's boat was safe at The Sands before night-fall.
               On the second evening after, which was Saturday night, as Brendice went down on the beach, she found, to her regret, that it had been returned. She would have preferred that Ives should keep it, as she had often thought she would never dispose of, for money, the last thing which her father had purchased, and which always reminded her, so forcibly, of his death; though, in order to carry into execution the plans which had been perfected in her mind while she was returning on Friday morning from The Rocks, she must sell everything else, and there were some quite valuable articles in the sea-chest, at her disposal.
               But the boat she could never offer for sale, though she had decided never to use it again. Even if she remained at The Sands, she could never resume her former avocation; her care of little Lang would prevent that.
               Her woman-heart would never allow her to expose a child to the suffering and danger she had, herself, been subjected to, in her infancy. But she would not remain at The Sands.
               That Saturday night was to be the last of her week-day life there, she thought, and she had gone to the sea-shore to listen, for the last time, to the voices which always seemed coming up to her out of the water.
               She wished to watch once more for the advancing and retreating of the waves, and the quick disappearance of her footprints upon the sand, on whose yielding surface she had, many times, in her early girlhood, long before any idea of what was now absorbing her thoughts had entered into her mind, with her fingers made such traceries, that it saddened her to see them so suddenly obliterated. She would walk once more over the ledge whose stones had been trodden, so often, by her bare feet, and recall the thoughts which had come to her in her childhood; and climb up the high boulder, on which so many hours of her life had been passed, and look away over the water as she had so constantly for years, then with the expectation that her mother would come, sometime, to the earth to seek her child, now with the hope that at no very distant period she would, herself, be searching for that mother, in a far-off, better land.
               The lamps were lighted at the Convoy, while she stood there, upon the beach.
               She had heard nothing in relation to the keeper since she was, herself, at the lighthouse; for no one had been into her dwelling since Thursday, besides Mrs. Adams' little girls. They had stepped in, for a moment, on Saturday afternoon, to bring the pretty hat and shawl for Brendice, and the children's present for the little boy, which was so nice, and would keep him so warm, when he rode with them, to-morrow, they told him, up to the church; and to tell Brendice that their elder brother had taken them over to the hills that morning, and to show her the few sweet wild flowers they had found there, and especially to make sure that she and "dear little Lang" would go up with mother and themselves to the Easter Festival.
               Sally Jones, at whose home Brendice had just called, to return some completed work, hoping to hear something about Mr. Maitland, made no allusion to the lighthouse keeper, or to her absent nephew.
               When she turned back from her long walk up the beach, Brendice paused by the dwelling which had been Mrs. Maitland's, the doors of which had not been opened, she supposed, since she had, herself, closed them; though she had, soon after returning to her own home, the previous autumn, given the keys to Mr. Brown, with a remark which convinced him that she was doing well in not making the house her home, as he had advised her to do. As she looked up to the white-curtained windows, the thought struck her that there was a faint light within the dwelling; but when she drew nearer, she was satisfied that what had caught her eye was nothing but the moonbeams reflected by the glass.
               The second night from this, her own home would be forsaken too. It was a rather saddening thought to her; but she felt that for her own sake, as well as for that of the child, from the sweet burden of which she prayed never to be released, henceforth her life must be a very different one from what it had ever been before; strengthening herself with the thought: 
                     
                        "I shall not fail, who all my trust
                        Repose on Thee, my God!"
                     
                  
               
               
               "Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us; therefore let us keep the Feast!"
               The words came to her at the early dawn; and all through the hours of that bright, sweet, Easter morning, her lips were uttering the glad chant; and as she read the beautiful Service for the most holy-day, her heart, many times, repeated the prayer that the dark shroud which had held her so long in its folds might never again enwrap her; that the sun of a resurrection morning might, indeed, have arisen for her.
               An hour or two before noon, Mrs. Adams' daughters, dressed for church, came down for her and the child.
               Lang had been enjoying himself finely, all the morning. He was a very sweet-tempered little boy.
               Brendice, in her long walk the previous evening, thinking it would be the last time she might ever do so, had picked up a large handful of shells for him, and he was very happy with this great addition to his treasures; and when the girls, with whom he was beginning to feel quite acquainted, came in, he was very eager to display it to them.
               The children, of course, expressed great wonder and delight, and then the eldest, after a moment's sudden silence, exclaimed, in unaffected surprise:
               "Why, Brendice, what is this! Where did you get it?"
               Brendice, busying herself in the other apartment, only glanced carelessly towards the half-open door.
               "Nothing but a pebble, Ruth! I found it on the beach."
               "Did you? Why"—the girl spoke slowly,—"it looks very nice; handsomer, a great deal, I think, than mother's opal, which uncle sent her from France! and I wonder how this happened to be on it."
               She did not say what, or Brendice might have taken a nearer view of that, which not her own hand, but the hand of Ives Dorn had dropped among the little boy's playthings.
               "Oh, I wish you would let Lang carry this to church, for an Easter-offering!" continued the girl.
               "It is valueless, Ruth!" Brendice replied.
               "But it is so beautiful!" the child persisted.
               "It looks so pure and so rich! Mother says that if we give the best we have to God, He will count it above all price, whatever it may be. And she says, too, that very often we don't know how valuable a thing is; and that there were many people who did not think much of it, even when God gave to the world what was worth more than the whole universe, on Easter morning—The Risen Christ!
               
               "Please let Lang take it, Brendice, for an offering!"
               "He may, dear Ruthy!" Brendice said, the tears coming into her eyes. "He should take it, if it were even a diamond, and at my disposal."
               "Oh, I am so glad!" the child replied, and she went behind the couch, to pick up the paper, a corner of which was visible beneath the bed covering, with the intention of wrapping the "pebble" within it, before consigning it to the little boy's pocket.
               The paper proved to be a letter, however, and she dropped it upon the bed; and, not to trouble Brendice, who was busied in preparing for her ride, put the treasure into the little coat pocket, and placed her own handkerchief above it, to keep it safe. And then, stooping down, and taking the round rosy face in her hands, and looking into the dark eyes, sparkling with delight, she said:
               "Now, you little mouse, you must remember every word I say! When we are in the church,—that is the great nice house where we are going"—
               "Yes, Brendice told me!" he interrupted.
               "I shall take hold of your little hand, and lead you up to the chancel, where a tall man stands"—
               "In his white gown—Brendice told me!"
               "And just as soon as you see me put something into his hand, you must take this out of your pocket, and give it to him. Now remember!"
               "May I, Brendice?" asked the child.
               "Yes, dear!" Brendice said. "Ruthy desires it so much."
               "No one will mind it, in such a little creature as you are!" she mentally added; and she wished that the stone was really as beautiful and rich as the little girl's fancy had made it, and that it was in her power to present an Easter-offering, herself, that day, to the Lord; but then, she thought, she had a willing mind, and as Ruth had said, if we offer to the Lord the best that it is in our power to give, it will be acceptable to Him, whatever the offering may be.
               As they were riding over the smooth, hard road, somewhat unusually so, at that season of the year, Mrs. Adams remarked on the beauty of the day, and expressed to Brendice the great sorrow she felt that the old gentleman, lately an inmate of her house, would not be able better to enjoy it, especially as so many of the children, who had been made happy by him on Christmas Eve, were going up, as he had requested them, to the Easter festival.
               "Was he ill?" Brendice asked, faintly.
               For some reason, though she should always feel very grateful to him for the assistance he had so kindly and delicately rendered her, during the past winter, and though her fears that he would try to take the little boy from her had been almost entirely removed, she did not like to hear his name mentioned, and she was afraid that Mrs. Adams would observe the emotion which she fancied that she manifested.
               No, he was not ill, the lady said, but he had met with another great trouble. She did not, herself, understand fully what it was. Somebody had sent down to Mr. Adams, the day before, to see that Jerry Greyson went over to the lighthouse, and remained there until a new keeper was appointed, as something had happened at the Convoy. Mr. Hall sent a boat to the island, Saturday morning, to fetch his friend, Mr. Aden, to the mainland, to pass Easter week with him. His messenger brought back word that only the keeper's deputy, who proved to be a brother, or some near relative of Mr. Aden, the lady had been informed, was there, and he was ill, very dangerously so; but so uncomfortably situated, that an endeavor was to have been made, the afternoon previous, to remove him to the house of Mr. Hall.
               "Why to Mr. Hall's?" Brendice asked.
               Mrs. Adams did not know, unless the man proved to be that brother of Mr. Aden, long supposed to be dead, of whom the old gentleman had once spoken to her, as having been a very fine, promising young man. Mr. Hall had formerly known him very well, and had been greatly attached to him; but it had been so long since he had been heard from, his friend had believed that he could no longer be living.
               
               Was the present illness of this man what was troubling Mr Hall so much? Brendice inquired.
               Yes, that, and the absence of Mr. Aden.
               "And he has had so much trouble!" Mrs. Adams said. "You have heard about Rachel Ross?"
               Brendice's heart gave a great throb, for as the lady uttered the name, in a rather emphatic tone, little Lang, who was whispering softly and laughingly to "kitty"—that was Ruth's white muff—turned a surprised and thoughtful face towards her, and opened his lips to say something, only the lady proceeded:
               "Rachel's mother, who was a very sweet girl, I have heard, was to have been the wife of Mr. Hall; but his friends interfered with his plans, and sent him to a foreign country; (he did not forgive them for it, for many long years,) and the match was broken off.
               "The girl married, but very indiscreetly, and she died young, she, and quite a number of little children, all but one, the youngest, Rachel, who was named for her mother. Mr. Hall found this child, accidentally, as, homeless and friendless, she was wandering in the streets of a southern city. He took her to his home and his heart; but the news of her mother's fate—he had not heard of her marriage, even, until a few weeks before he had found her child, and all through those years, he had been looking forward to the time when she should become his wife,—the news of her mother's fate so affected him, that he was not his own self for years.
               "He seemed to live only, I have been told, in the life of the young girl. And at length she left him.
               "It is now more than fifteen years—it is almost sixteen years since she went away; the same period of time that has elapsed since Mr. Aden"—
               "Why, that is certainly very strange;" she interrupted herself to remark. "People have told me that Mr. Aden was very fond of this girl; and I was formerly acquainted with her cousin, Singleton, whom, it is said, she married.
               "It always surprised me that Edgar Singleton should persuade a girl to marry him in a clandestine manner; and I do not believe now, that he did!" she added, earnestly. "I should not wonder if it was Mr. Aden who became her husband; and that this man, whoever he may be, has been at the lighthouse, all these years since.
               "Mr. Hall was so deeply wounded by the elopement of this girl," continued Mrs. Adams, "that he made no effort to discover what became of her. His feelings towards her, however, were just beginning to undergo a change; and then the news of her supposed death reached him. But she may be living!
               "He has earnestly requested me to stop at his house to-night, and I intend to do so, since he is in such trouble; and he particularly wishes that you and little Lang should remain there with me, till to-morrow.
               "I will tell him what an idea has occurred to me, and if this man, who, it is said, is almost speechless, and has his reason only at brief intervals, can be restored to consciousness, perhaps the old gentleman will be able to ascertain"—
               "Why, you are faint, Brendice! Let me"—
               "I am so unaccustomed to the motion of a carriage!" Brendice managed to say, with tolerable composure, when the window was partially opened, and she could avert her face from her companion's inquiring eyes, under the pretext of seeking the cool, fresh air.
               But a few more words were spoken, before they reached the church. Mrs. Adams was reflecting on the plausibility of the idea which had suddenly occurred to her.
               The more she thought of it, the more convinced she was that her conjecture was well founded; and it would be very gratifying to her kind feelings, should it prove to be so. If Mr. Hall's adopted daughter, she reasoned, had been the wife of Captain Singleton, she was dead; for it had been the ship of that unfortunate man which had struck on the sandbar the preceding summer, and his wife and her child, as well as most of the ship's crew, had been drowned.
               If Rachel Ross had been married to the man that nominally held the post of lighthouse keeper, she might still be living; and the old gentleman who loved her so much, though he was so unfitted to be her guardian, might yet be gladdened by a reconciliation with her; for Mr. Aden's whereabouts, at least, would be likely to become known, now that this accident, or whatever it was, had happened to his relative and deputy.
               As for Brendice, she might not have been able, herself, to tell what was passing through her mind, except that this little creature—who, as he had looked up into the face, to the expression of which he always seemed striving to suit his mood, crept out from the encircling arms of the girls, and nestled closely to her side, and turned his loving, pitiful eyes up to her—this little creature should never be taken from her while she was able properly to care for him, unless his father or his mother claimed him.
               She was thinking only this, and wishing she had not come up to the Festival, but had taken the child, and without a word to any one, had gone away from her old home forever, early the next morning after her work at the island was done.
               And when she knelt in church, it was the first time she had ever done so, and tried to put away the bitter thoughts which were so nearly overwhelming her, and to order her prayers in accordance with the Morning Lesson she had read with so much interest:
               "Not with the old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness"—
               Her heart had responded:
               "I had put it—the old leaven—out of my house, for evermore, before the Pasch was slain!"
               Yet when she thought on:
               "But with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth!"—she could only answer:
               "No one shall ever extract from me the secret in relation to this child: neither his name, nor how I obtained possession of him!"
               "Set your affections on things above; not on things on the earth!"
               And her firm lips framed the words:
               "Have I not already cut off my right hand, and plucked out my right eye? Must I rend out my heart too?"
               And when she rose from her unblest prayer, and Mrs. Adams put into her hand the book from which the children were singing their glad Easter-songs, with the pencilled words:
               
               "Sing, dear Brendice! Mr. Hall bade me ask you to, at the Festival. It will make him very happy to hear your voice. He was looking very sad and thoughtful when we came into church, but a sweet, satisfied smile came to his pale face, when he saw you and the little boy!"
               Brendice thought, if she opened her lips at all, it would only be in self-upbraiding that she had not earlier discovered how dear he was to her, and had not more carefully guarded her treasure; and especially that she had placed it, a second time, before the eyes of that old man.
               Let her once get beyond the reach of those eyes, she thought, which were now, when the children were presenting their simple offerings at the altar, so closely following the figure of little Lang, who, carrying the beautiful bouquet, so heavy that the little fat hand could hardly manage to hold it upright, was led towards the chancel by Ruth Adams—let her but once get beyond the reach of those covetous eyes, and—
               The flowers were placed upon the altar, and Ruth had presented the offering of the Sabbath-school class of which she was a member, and then little Lang, remembering what had been told him, drew forth the beautiful "pebble" from his little pocket, and held it up to the rector.
               The gentleman took it with a look of such marked surprise, that many in the church observed it, and he bent his head, and inquired softly of the girl:
               "Whose child is this little boy?"
               Ruth was so much embarrassed, that she did not know what reply to make. She had noticed his surprise, and was afraid that something was not quite right; and to encourage her to speak, he put the question in another form:
               "What is this child's name?"
               But Ruth still hesitated. She did not know whether she ought to call him Lang, or whether she had best try to speak that French word which Brendice pronounced so queerly.
               The little boy, who appeared to be very glad that his part of the performance was ended, turned his bright, dark eyes from the troubled countenance of Ruth to that of the rector.
               He had heard both questions, and was wondering why they were not replied to; and then he suddenly looked around, and down the aisle, and over the sea of faces, till his eyes rested on that, to him, sure haven—the face of Brendice.
               There was a look of eager inquiry on his face, but he seemed quickly to have found an answer to his question, for he immediately turned his head, and glanced up again to the rector, and the sweet young voice rang through the spacious church:
               "Ross Aden!—Brendice Du Bois' little boy!"
               There was a quick movement, as these words were uttered, somewhere, far back in the church, and a lady who had been kneeling, ever since she entered the edifice, half rose from her seat.
               After a moment, the lady—she was a stranger, and had been shown into the pew where sat Mrs. Smith, the housekeeper of Mr. Hall,—whispered softly, but in a startled tone, to the woman beside her:
               "If you please, what was the name?"
               "Ross Aden!—I thought;" was the reply.
               "No, no!—the other name?"
               
               "Brendice Du Bois!" and Mrs. Smith, who never suffered an opportunity for speaking a good word for a fellow-being to pass unimproved by her, put her book over her mouth and continued:
               "The girl is a poor young fish-woman. She found that child, last autumn, down on the sea-shore, I have heard. The town authorities were intending to send him to the almshouse, but she carried him to her own home, and has fed and clothed him, herself, all through the past severe winter, by the avails of her daily labor, which has been, in great part, digging clams, down on the cold beach."
               "Is the girl in church?" asked the stranger.
               Mrs. Smith glanced about her. She had observed the tall, handsome young woman who had come in with Mrs. Adams, but she could not have thought that was Brendice, the fish-girl, and she replied in the negative.
               How the services of the occasion proceeded, after Ruth Adams and the little boy moved away from the chancel, Brendice could not have told, though she was listening, in a dull way, to the voices which were speaking, and thinking dreamily.
               Now she heard one voice, alone. A kind, pleasant, fatherly voice it was.
               The rector referred to the offerings which the children had just made, telling their worth in the currency of men; and hoped, that, in the standard of Heaven, which weighs what the heart hides away in its secret recesses, as well as what is displayed in the unclosed hand, these bits of silver and gold, or their equivalent, enriched by humble, trusting prayers, by little sacrifices, by love to God and good-will to men, might prove treasures of untold worth; and that these gifts at the altar might be returned to them, in their hour of greatest need, by Him who holds all things in His hand,—and who can bless one without injury to another,—a hundred-fold in this life, and in the life to come he hoped they might receive the reward promised to him, even, who has given a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple.
               And then he ascribed all glory and honor to Him who has made that great and blessed promise, and the whole assembly, Brendice alone excepted, stood up and said—Amen!
               
               She understood something of this, and a faint, strange smile passed over her white face.
               Her offerings had not always been made with prayer and good-will to men,—perhaps never, with true love to God; but had they not been sacrifices such as few people are ever required to make?
               And now the hundred-fold was coming to her!
               After that, many voices were joined in grand chorus.
               They were singing something about "merry Easter-bells," and Brendice remembered how many times through the long years gone by, as, wandering alone, up and down the smooth, white sand, and listening to the sounding sea, on the holy Sabbath, bright and sweet as this fair Easter-day, she had tried to catch the peals of St. Mary's bell. She had often thought how, if she could once find herself within the church which her vivid imagination never pictured to her as more beautiful than this fine edifice proved to be, all the hard, bitter feelings which were so poisoning and deadening her young life, would forever pass away. 
                     "What chant the merry Easter-bells?"
                  
               
               
               The children were repeating the words, and now another voice joined in the chorus,—not commingling with the other voices,—only sweetly harmonizing with them; and reaching the ear separate and distinct in its richness and beauty, as the light of the bright evening star falls upon the eye, unblended with another ray.
               A firm, mature voice, it was; but one of wonderful sweetness and depth, and perfectly trained; and no one who heard those words, somewhat peculiarly pronounced, but articulated with surpassing clearness: 
                     "That Christ, our Lord, is risen again!"
                   would be likely ever to forget the music or the occasion.
               The closing word in the stanza was especially remembered. The unknown singer lingered as long upon it as the deep tones of the organ were reverberating through the church, the voice rising higher and higher, bearing up with it the hearts of the listeners, and ever more and more sweet, till it seemed ready to enter the orchestra above.
               Brendice heard the singer. Was it her own voice to which she listened. No! it was very many times sweeter than her own could be, she thought, though strangely like what her own might have been, if—
               Her perceptions all returned to her now; and her eye glanced down—down, over the wide, arid deserts of the past, through the briny, bitter waters of the present, and away up the vista of the future—long indeed it seemed to be—but a brightness came down from the distance, lighting up all the way, and revealing a path which should be smoother and smoother for the determined tread, and ever more and more radiant, for it led up to the Throne of God!
               The whole prospect stretched itself out before her mental vision, and the words which Mrs. Maitland had repeated to her, came to her thoughts, as if they were whispered now, for the first time, in her ear:
               "What thou knowest not now, thou shalt know hereafter!"
               Three nights since, she had hoped that the waters of Jordan, which were flowing over her, would wash away all the leprosy; but now she saw that she had been bowing in the house of Rimmon, not daring to ask in words—"Pardon Thy servant in this thing!" for she knew that "the Lord our God is a jealous God."
               She had only whispered softly to her own heart:
               "Is it not a little one?"
               But now, looking up and down that pathway, Brendice's firm lips, as she knelt with the congregation in prayer, murmured the words, very humbly:
               "Master, I will follow Thee, whithersoever Thou goest!"
               And then the kind, paternal voice of the rector was saying: "The peace of God, which passeth all understanding,—and the blessing of God Almighty,"—
               A few moments after the Amen was uttered, very softly, but very fervently. Brendice lifted her head, and drew the child near her. The congregation were retiring. The greater part had already left the church.
               She called him "little Ross," now, and whispered to him lovingly, but calmly and very firmly.
               But the boy answered in tearful, pleading accents, reaching up his arms and putting them about her neck:
               "No, no, Brendice! Nobody's little boy but Brendice's!" he said.
               
               The girl unwound the clinging arms, and held the little soft hands in her own, and smiled upon him in such a way that the pain passed slowly from the sweet face, though it was still greatly sobered; and then she led him out of the pew, and up to Mr. Hall, who, with Mrs. Adams, was standing a little apart.
               The people had all retired now, with the exception of two or three gentlemen who had followed the rector into the robing room, and the strange lady, who had not yet risen from her devotions.
               The old man was gazing on Brendice and the child, with eager, anxious eyes.
               She did not observe his hurried, tremulous greeting, but speaking quickly and determinedly, she said:
               "Here is my Easter-offering, sir! To your keeping I entrust it!"
               And she placed the child's hand in that of the old gentleman, and turned immediately away; but he laid his fingers on her arm and detained her.
               "And you, Brendice!" he said, "what are you thinking of? What are you going to do, my dear child? You will certainly consent"—
               She interrupted him.
               "I am thinking of what you said to me on Christmas Eve, sir! and I am going to unearth my talents, that the Lord may have His own, with the usury He requires, when He calls for it!"
               The look and the tone with which she spoke silenced the old man, and he let go his hold on her sleeve. But Mrs. Adams followed her, putting her hand within Brendice's dice's arm, as she walked quickly out of the church, and leading her to the carriage which was waiting at the door.
               When Brendice was seated within it, she placed herself beside her, whispering to Ruth to jump out of the vehicle and climb up into Mr. Hall's carriage,—into which little Ross was at that moment lifted,—and go home with the family, and make the child happy, and be otherwise useful to the old gentleman, till she was sent for to return to her own home.
               The ride back to The Sands was a silent one, though Mrs. Adams, who had believed, for some time past, that the poor, wounded heart beside her was hiding a secret it was sensible it ought to reveal, was very glad, and very sorry, too, for Brendice; sorry for the present suffering, and glad for the happiness in store for her. When the girl was leading the little boy, which all through the winter Mr. Hall felt very sure was the child of his foster-daughter, towards the old gentleman, he had whispered to Mrs. Adams that Brendice, except at her own wish, should never be separated from the child whom she loved and had cared for so tenderly.
               Henceforth she should be to him all that Rachel Ross had been.
               But she would not repeat his words to her to-night.
               She only said, as she took Brendice's hand, when she reached her home, "Come to me in the morning, dear. I have something very pleasant to tell you—something that will give you great happiness!"
               She was a little sorry, however, after Brendice turned and walked away over the ledge towards her own home, that she did not tell her then what Mr. Hall had said; the girl had replied to her, in such a strangely calm tone:
               "I will come some time, dear madam, and thank you for all the kindness you have showed me."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXII.
               UNDER THE EVERGREENS.
               TWILIGHT was fading when Brendice reached her home, and without laying aside her hat and shawl, for the evening was cool, she sat down by her little window and looked up to the deepening blue, where here and there came out a glimpse of the pathway through the skies: 
                     
                        "The road
                        Which lies open to the—abode"
                     
                   of our God! And she thought of the "Ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And, behold, the Lord stood above it!"
               At its foot lay the weary wanderer on whom the sun had set, and the stones were his pillow.
               The steps of the wonderful Ladder which led up to God had been made all glorious by the footprints of angels, but each link in that chain of steps let down before her, had been of burning, sharpened iron, which had scorched the foot, and pierced the soul.
               But safely passed now, Brendice was whispering to herself, with thickly-gathering, but grateful tears:
               
               "The Lord stood above it! and every step is safely passed now. There surely will never be another round for me to cross!"
               The moonbeams came at length through the window. They fell upon the pillow, where at that hour, a little curly head had been wont to be laid at rest. Brendice was looking now at the couch.
               Her eyes fell on something which had the appearance of a folded white paper, and when with trembling fingers she had lighted her lamp, for as she observed it closely in the bright moonlight, she saw that it was a letter, a sheet folded and sealed, with her name upon it, in the handwriting of her father,—pale, almost fainting, she sat down to examine what should have been discovered much earlier than this.
               The letter should have been found on the morning after her father's supposed death.
               It was the folded paper which had rustled down on the floor at her feet, on the night when she was first preparing the couch for little Ross, and thrust by her into the pocket of the old sea-coat. It was what Ives Dorn had removed thence, and what Ruth Adams had that morning picked up and laid upon the bed.
               When the sheet was unfolded, and Brendice saw that the date of the writing was the same night, only two hours after her father's boat was beaten by the waves against the ledge and hauled up by the fishermen over the rocks, and that the opening words were: "My dear child!" she could read no more until a swift prayer had gone up to Heaven, a prayer of deepest thankfulness that the night was passed and the dawning of a day of gladness had come for her, at last.
               Her father was living, and he loved her; and Luke Maitland was not a murderer!
               She had never, for one brief hour, really believed that he could have been, intentionally, guilty of the crime imputed to him; but it was very blessed to be sure of the fact.
               After lingering for a few moments over the opening words, she read on:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "I shall write to you briefly; most likely disconnectedly, for I am still trembling from the grasp which death, itself, seemed, but lately, to have fastened upon me; and the words must be written—they could not be spoken—before you give up your patient watching, out in this furious storm where you have so many times waited and watched, my poor child, for your father's return.
                           "I should not have supposed that any power on earth, or in heaven, could have compelled me to write, even, the words you are about to read; but something down among the deep waters which seemed so much like the cold hand of the dark angel, rent away the thick clouds which have hung before my eyes, ever since the form of your mother passed from my sight.
                           "I see clearly now, and your future life shall be as happy as your past has been comfortless.
                           "You well know why I have remained here in this wretched place so long. Lately I have had good reason for supposing that the man at the island whom the people about here call Mr. Aden is, as I half believed when I first came to The Sands, the man for whom I have been searching; and this noon-day I went over to The Rocks, to assure myself if such were the fact.
                           
                           "I heard that young Maitland was there; and, half maddened by my disappointment, for the man I suppose must have been the lighthouse keeper, and was not the one I wished to find, I threw myself in Luke's way, to give him the opportunity for speaking to me, which he has, I have known, long been seeking.
                           "I wished to drive him from my sight, forever.
                           "He availed himself of the offered opportunity, and he told me that he loved my daughter, and entreated my permission to ask her to become his wife. He spoke of his hopes for the future, and how he had been striving, for years, to qualify himself for a very different employment from his present one; and he mentioned the names of several most respectable gentlemen at N——, upon whose friendship and assistance he could rely.
                           "I listened silently to all he wished to say; and then I replied to him. Any heart but mine would have bled at the agony of the young man, when I had finished speaking; for the villany of his father, and all its consequences to myself and to you, were told him in the bitterest words found in the language he speaks; and I—a fiend must have possessed me—I laughed at his woe!
                           "It is no wonder that an hour later, when we met on the water, in trying to aid me to escape from perils, he guided his boat with such an unskilful hand that I was upset. He leaped into the waves after me, to save my life. I was determined to destroy his, and we sank together. But we drifted apart in the water.
                           "When I rose again to the surface, he was at a distance, clinging to his boat. He is doubtless saved, and, after a time has passed, he will come here and say to you what he has said to me.
                           "I saw the determination to do so in his face, all the time it was so distorted with agony; and when we were struggling together in the water, it was that which nerved my fingers to fasten themselves on his throat.
                           "But that is passed now. And when he comes, with that question on his lips, to you, my child, whose heart I have known longer than you, yourself, have known it, reply to him as your feelings dictate.
                           "I am going back to my native land, that I may never again resume my search after that man; it came to me, while a power which seemed beyond my own strength was urging me through the waves up towards the beach, that the God whom, in my heart, I have tried to deny, but before whom I now reverently bow, will be my Avenger.
                           "I shall leave this neighborhood immediately; but am not intending to embark for France for three weeks.
                           "Should you prefer to return to your native land, leave a letter for me at the post-office at N——.
                           "But such will not be your choice.
                           "You will find this paper to-morrow morning, when you are arranging my bed. Look in the pocket of the old coat you will discover lying above it.
                           "The diamond I leave you, is a valuable one.
                           "After you are married, let your husband take it to some lapidary. The sum it will bring will enable him—you can trust him in all things, he is worthy of your confidence—to enter at once into the business for which the education he has managed to obtain, even under the disadvantageous circumstances in which he has been placed, well qualifies him, and which he would have made an effort to engage in, in a small way, some time since, only he could not bring himself to leave The Sands. You heart will tell you why.
                           "Adieu, my child! If I do not hear from you within two weeks—I say it not unkindly—never seek your father! Heaven preserve and bless you!"
                           
                              "ETIENNE DU BOIS."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Brendice read the letter through twice.
               Once, it was perused very hurriedly, and very eagerly, while every word, though the arm of the writer was suffering so greatly, and would, sometimes, be so very weary, that, to another eye, much might have been well nigh illegible, came out plainly to her, as a printed page; and the closing words—her father's name and his benediction, were bedewed by her with grateful tears, and kissed by loving lips.
               But the second reading had been slow and difficult. The parallel lines were crossing each other, and the words were dancing up and down before her eyes, chasing each other so swiftly over the page, that it was a task for the reader to arrest them, and settle them back in their places. And when it was ended, and the paper was folded in its old seams, and the wax was heated, and the pieces joined together again, and it was laid on the table beside her, the dry, aching eyes gazed hopelessly upon it, as if it had been the Book of Fate.
               "One more round of the ladder is yet to be crossed! and then—will life end with the struggle?"
               Brendice rose as she spoke, and opened the door of her dwelling. The cool air was very grateful now to the uncovered ered brow, and she stepped out into it, looking mechanically up the beach, along the row of fish-houses, and resting on the most distant of them; and then a thrill ran through her frame.
               She had, most likely, not been mistaken, the previous evening, in thinking there was a light burning in the Maitland dwelling. At least now one was plainly enough visible there.
               For a moment a sense of weakness stole over the girl, and she stepped back to the doorway, and leaned heavily against it. But it passed from her, and she grew stronger and stronger, as she saw a form coming down quickly over the ledge, strengthened, it seemed, by the sound of the swift, firm tread upon the rocks; and she was quite herself, when the young man drew near and paused abruptly, but a few feet distant from her.
               He seemed a little embarrassed at meeting her so suddenly face to face, for his voice was slightly unsteady as he said, simply: "Brendice!"
               But she was very calm, outwardly, as she pronounced his name:
               "Luke!" and after a pause, which he seemed unable to break, she added, quietly, coming directly to the point which was uppermost, at the moment, in his mind:
               "My father is in France! He sailed for his native land, early last autumn."
               "Alive? thank Heaven!" exclaimed the young man, fervently and devoutly.
               "I have just now, within the hour, learned the fact," she continued, "from a letter which my father left for me; and which, through my carelessness, I failed to find until to-night!"
               "You have not been thinking, all this time, while you supposed he was dead"—he spoke quickly and earnestly now,—"you have not for a moment believed that I"—
               "No!" Brendice interrupted quietly, "never really believed that you intended to injure him! I did not know what might have been done accidentally."
               "I was sure you could not believe it!" he said, drawing a step or two nearer to her, though she retreated from the doorway till the same distance was again between them.
               "The story in regard to my connection with your father's disappearance was the fabrication of a foolish young fellow who had taken a liking to the girl, living at The Rocks, called Ives Dorn.
               "He fancied that my frequent visits at the islands, during the few months previous to my departure from The Sands, which were made for the sole purpose of learning something about the lighthouse keeper, in whom from a child, though I was far from suspecting who he was, I had felt a great interest, (which interest was much increased by some words I last spring heard Greyson muttering to himself), were to see this young girl. He hoped to get me out of the neighborhood by starting this story, which he knew I could not prove to be false; his brother would have confirmed his words.
               "He knew I had escaped drowning, but he would not reveal the fact, lest it should reach the ears of the girl.
               "I feared that the public trial of her son would kill my mother, and when my boat was picked up the second day after it was supposed I was drowned, I passed for one of the sailors belonging to the Essex, which was wrecked on the Bar during that violent gale.
               "I had the good fortune to save the life of the ship's captain, and that of the child, whom, some months later, I brought here to place in the care of my mother—the child you have cherished so tenderly and lovingly, Brendice!"
               His voice was trembling a little now.
               "I have just come down from Mr. Hall's, where I have been sitting all day, beside—beside him whose life you saved, three nights since, over at the lighthouse!
               "You have had a noble revenge, Brendice! Heaven itself must have interfered to give you the power to execute it. In his intervals of reason to-day, my father has told me all about it. And Mr. Hall has informed me also of what you have done for the little boy. If"—
               "You were speaking of yourself, Luke!" Brendice interrupted. "You saved the life of the ship's captain, Singleton. Was he the husband of Mr. Hall's adopted daughter? or did Rachel Ross marry Mr. Aden?"
               She asked the question without feeling much concern in the reply. She only wished to draw away his thoughts from herself; and she was wondering what she would do when this interview with the young man was ended.
               He perceived her lack of interest in the subject, but he went on: "She married Mr. Aden, my father's half-brother. Little Ross is my cousin. When I brought him here, the probability was, as I then said to you, for I knew, soon after doing so, that it was in your arms I had placed the child, that he was an orphan.
               
               "Captain Singleton and the boy, with myself, were out upon the sea for a day and a night. We could not manage the boat, and we were too far from the land to attempt to reach it by swimming. And, beside, he had received such an injury at the time of the shipwreck, that it caused his death a few months after.
               "I was almost as much exhausted as he was, by my long strugglings with the waves, and my abstinence from food.
               "We did not expect to escape death; the captain was very sure that his days were numbered, and we began to tell each other about ourselves. But when I mentioned my name, I found that he knew more about my family than I did myself. He informed me of the marriage of my uncle with his, the captain's cousin; and that Mr. Aden, in part for his own pleasure, in part at the earnest desire of his brother, had given up his post at the lighthouse to my father. My uncle, he told me, took his wife to Italy.
               "Her delicate health was much improved by the change of climate, and they were happy in each other; but he had not prospered in his pecuniary affairs. In fact their circumstances were such that they finally gave up all thoughts of ever returning to their native land, and Captain Singleton, just before sailing on what proved to be his last voyage, sought out their humble dwelling, as he had promised to do, to receive my uncle's instructions relative to his affairs here. He found the family in the utmost destitution and distress.
               "Mr. Aden was, it was thought, dying of a most malignant fever, which was raging in the neighborhood; and his distracted wife, who was scarcely more alive than her husband, begged her cousin to take her only child with him to America. The captain, who had been married less than a year, willingly took charge of the child, to whom his wife soon became very much attached; but that unfortunate lady, with her own infant, only a few days old, was drowned when the Essex was wrecked.
               "The little boy was saved, and I promised Captain Singleton, for I did not leave him for the few months he survived the loss of his wife, that the child should be my very especial charge.
               "That child was little Ross. I brought him here to leave him in the care of my mother, until the time should come when I could return here openly, and ask somebody to be my dear wife, and a mother to the sweet babe!"
               He spoke the words softly, but suddenly; and Brendice, whose eyes were turned towards the eastern sky, where the beacon lamps were burning brightly, and whose stern will was beginning to answer the question—what would she do when this interview with Luke was ended?—knew that the young man stood closely by the doorway, now, and that he was watching, eagerly, in the bright moonlight, for some change in the impassive expression of her features.
               She did not move farther away. No matter what her heart was doing; not a muscle of her face could stir, not the faintest flush could come into the cheek, which had been strangely pale ever since that letter had been refolded and sealed, except at her bidding; and her words were firm and cold as if they were issuing from lips of ice.
               "When you brought the child here, the probability was, you say, that he was an orphan. Have you learned, since, that such was the fact?"
               
               "No!" he replied, after a brief pause, while his hand passed once or twice over his brow.
               "It was Captain Singleton's wish that I should learn the fate of his cousin and her husband. It was my own wish too. If they were living, he desired me to place in their hands the little property he bequeathed them; and the next morning after I brought the child here, I went as a sailor on board a steamship bound for Italy, thinking, by the time I should be able to return home, the young girl, Ives Dorn, and her lover, would have settled the difficulty between them, and the man could be persuaded to retract what he had said in relation to me.
               "I obtained my discharge as soon as the ship reached her port; but as they had changed their place of residence soon after learning, as they did, from a foreign journal, of the loss of Captain Singleton's ship, and the death of his wife and the child, which they doubted not was their own, it was some time before I found them.
               "They were then in good health, and thanks to a noble lady to whom both of them, my aunt thought, owed their lives, my uncle was engaged in such a lucrative business that they were purposing, in a year or two, to return to their native land.
               "You should have seen their joy, Brendice, when I told them that their child was alive, and heard their expressions of gratitude for your care of him.
               "Some papers from home had come to our ship's officers, and one of them, published at N——, contained quite a lengthened account, though an inaccurate one, of the finding of a young child, wandering, at midnight, far down on the sea-shore, where it probably had been left to perish. Its cries had been heard by a young girl, watching at the bedside of a dead woman, it was said.
               "The town authorities had decided to send the deserted child to the almshouse, but the girl who discovered it and rescued it from death, took it to her own destitute home, and was bestowing on it the tenderest care and attention.
               "I knew then to whom I had given the child, and I told them of you, Brendice! Words cannot express their gratitude to you; and my own thanks"—
               "No thanks are due me, from any one. I cared for the child because I wished to. We will not talk about it!"
               Brendice said this, and something in her manner, added, pleasantly enough, but firmly:
               "We will not converse farther, on any subject, Luke Maitland! Good-night!"
               But the young man would not understand the implied words. He had stepped close to her side, now, and was leaning against the doorway; and when he spoke again, it was in such a low, moved tone, that she looked into his face.
               "I came over to The Sands last night," he said, "and spent some hours in the room where my mother died,—near the spot where I last saw her lying, as I then thought, in peaceful sleep; and when I went from there, it was to go over to the hill-side, to the cluster of evergreens.
               "Mr. Hall had told me where she was buried, and who had selected the place; and who, by the right she had acquired, by, most likely, saving my mother's life on the night when she was watching on the cliff for the return of her boy; by her loved companionship ever after, and by her kind, tender care,—it has all been told me, Brendice,—of the feeble, deserted woman, had stood as chief mourner beside her grave. It seemed to me, as I knelt there under the evergreens, that the face of my mother was looking down upon me from among the many bright eyes of heaven; and in the soft, plaintive sounds of the whispering trees, that I could catch the tones of her low, gentle voice.
               "It would not be in my power to put into words what the face looked, or the loved voice uttered. But I must tell you what I replied to her, Brendice!
               "I told her, on my bended knee, and audibly, that when I forgot to make it the first business of my life to atone to Brendice Du Bois for the injury done her family by my father,—when my tender care of her fell short of that she had showed not only to my mother, and to the little child I had, unwittingly, put into her arms; but, in his hour of terrible need, to him who had wronged her so greatly; and when"—he took the hands she had clasped firmly over her heart, and held them closely in his:
               "When I suffered anything to weaken the strong love I have cherished for her these years past"—
               Years past! how they came up before Brendice's vision, evoked by his presence!—so like the rolling of great, dark billows over her, that everything about her now but that voice, speaking softly in her ear, and those eyes, looking so gratefully and lovingly in hers,—went from her thoughts. The gleam of those bright, dancing eyes was the one light she had seen all through that dark past; the sound of that clear, assured voice was the one note of music she had heard.
               "When I forget all this, then may Heaven forget"—
               "Hush, Luke, hush! Say no more!"
               She could not command her lips earlier to speak. But the tightening hold upon her hands had not only given her strength to withdraw them; it had imparted power, too, to speak quietly.
               "Your reason tells you, you should not have uttered the words;" she said, "but since you have spoken, I must reply: I do not need your kindness; I will not accept your love!—not accept it," she added, after a pause, and with deep solemnity, "until my lost mother shall come up out of the sea! Then"—
               For a moment they looked in each other's eyes, and there was an expression on the features of both, such as the faces might have worn, had they been bending over the suffering and beloved dying; the agony of grief for each other and for themselves. And then a smile, as holy as it was beautiful, for it was the smile of Faith, the firm trust in each other, and the unwavering reliance on Heaven, passed over their countenances.
               The smile was enough! There was no joining of hands, and no words of farewell!
               The young man turned away, and walked with the same brisk, firm tread with which he had, half an hour before, come down the beach; perfecting the plans,—now changed, however, in one very essential particular,—he had been very busily forming while riding down from the Port, an hour before.
               That plan was, as soon as the crisis in the state of his father's health had passed—for his physician had, that afternoon, decided that Mr. Maitland would, in time, recover in some degree the use of his limbs, to leave him in the care of his friend Mr. Hall, the old gentleman being very desirous that he should do so, and go back to Italy. He would acquaint himself with his uncle's business, and then take it off his hands, in order that Mr. Aden might return to his native land, from which there now, no longer, existed a reason why he should absent himself. Her foster-father would be very anxiously looking forward now to the time when he could welcome Rachel Aden and her husband to his home.
               When Luke went abroad, it would be with the intention of remaining there. He had hoped that Brendice would become his wife, and go with him.
               But that was over now. He would never see her again. Yet she loved him;—she would never forget him!
               He must defer his journey now, until his father had so far recovered the use of his limbs as to be able to travel; for he must leave the country, with his son. Du Bois was still alive. Luke was very glad of that; but if the Frenchman ever returned to the neighborhood, Mr. Maitland must not be there.
               And Brendice?
               Her eyes had not followed the young man as he moved away. She stepped back quickly into her dwelling, and wrote a few hasty lines, addressed to the editor of the morning paper published at N——, and then walked over to Mr. Brown's and gave her letter to one of his sons who she had heard was going up to the Port that night. When she returned to her home, she trimmed her lamp, and brought out her easel, on which the unfinished painting was still stretched.
               The countenances upon the canvas were very life-like; that painted from memory, even more so than was the sweet, changeful countenance of little Ross.
               The past night, with the pleasant burden of the child upon her, and her own future to care for, her plan had been to cultivate her taste for music and painting, assured that her voice or her hand would secure for her a good income. Her first work, she thought, after providing herself (by the sale of some valuable articles left behind him, by her father) with a comfortable lodging, should be the completion of this painting. She would finish the youthful face after nature. Its rare, sweet beauty could not be improved. The other, she would try to make a copy of what her father had given her for a study, the countenance of a St. Joseph.
               But now her own future she had alone to care for.
               Her father most likely would never seek her again. He had left no clue which might lead her to him, and, besides, he had particularly requested that she would never search for him. Hard as it was to do so she would obey him.
               She had conceived and perfected in her mind a new plan for her future, while standing in the doorway and listening to the voice of Luke Maitland, and looking away to the islands.
               When she was presenting her Easter-offering, she was, in her heart, promising heaven to follow the great Master; and His footsteps had marked out, for his disciples, the pathway of mercy alone.
               After carefully removing the canvas from the easel, she rolled it up, and laid it away, and then sat down to read the Evening Lesson for the holy Easter-day.
               
               "The gate of everlasting life."
               Who will complain of the roughness of the way, if that shall be found open at the termination of the journey?
               She had expected to have a fierce conflict with herself, but a Voice had spoken to the billows, rising up before her, in the distance: "Peace, be still!"
               And the smooth waters, suddenly all bright and glorious with the reflection of the divine Presence, and echoing and re-echoing in their deep swelling cadences their eternal Amen, were flowing gently beneath her feet, lifting her up higher and higher towards heaven; and with firm lip and trusting heart, Brendice knelt and prayed:
               "We humbly beseech Thee, that, as by Thy special grace preventing us, Thou dost put into our minds good desires, so by Thy continual help we may bring the same to good effect."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               EASTER-FLOWERS.
               RACHEL'S child!"
               Mr. Hall, not quite satisfied with himself for having taken little Ross from Brendice Du Bois, but feeling sure that Mrs. Adams would tell her it was by no means his intention to separate the child from her, and thinking he would send for her very early the next morning and ask her to become an honored inmate of his house, was whispering the words to himself, "Rachel's child!" over and over, as his carriage rolled away from the church.
               His moistened eyes rested on the little face, which, notwithstanding Ruth's best endeavor to call back the sweet smile, would turn very often with an eager, anxious look, and quivering lip, towards the road the carriage had passed over.
               "Rachel's child, and George Aden is his father!"
               Mrs. Adams had whispered her suspicions to him as soon as the services of the church were ended; but Mr. Hall had been told, hours earlier, by Luke Maitland, that it was not her cousin whom Rachel Ross had married, but the young man's uncle, Mr. Aden, and that her child was in the neighborhood. He, himself, months before, had left the boy in the care of a female, whom he afterwards ascertained to be Brendice Du Bois.
               All through the winter the old gentleman had suspected the little boy to be the child of his foster-daughter, and that Brendice knew more in relation to him than she appeared to. He had seen the look which passed over her face when he repeated the words whispered in his ear on Christmas Eve. But the girl took such loving, unselfish care of him, that he determined not to trouble her with questions which she might not choose to answer; compelling himself to be silent in regard to the child, and satisfying himself with the hope that when the weather and his health would suffer him to open his house, she would be persuaded to become a member of his family; and that by his kindness to herself and the little boy, he would be able, at length, to win her confidence.
               Strangely enough, Luke Maitland had returned to The Sands on the very day that his father was taken to the house of Mr. Hall. He had sought him at The Rocks, and was informed by Greyson, who was there in charge of the lights, where he might be found.
               "Poor George!" Mr. Hall said to himself, as his carriage was rolling back towards his home, "he should not have deceived me so; but, remembering the past, he could not ask me for Rachel. I should not have given her to him, if he had. I should only have told him that he was seeking my wealth then in a no less dishonorable way than that in which he had sought it once before; and that would have been wronging him, greatly, for it was only her, I see, that he wanted.
               "But I had not forgiven him, then, his youthful crimes!"
               He was forgiven now, freely forgiven, the old gentleman thought, with deepening emotion, and he prayed that he might have strength—for the surprises which had come to him within the two past days, and especially the anxiety which he felt in regard to Mr. Maitland, had greatly shaken his feeble frame—that he might have strength sufficient to send the words of forgiveness to George Aden, and of tenderest love to his foster-daughter, and to ask them to return to him, and bless his last days with their presence.
               Some hours before, he had told Mr. Maitland what he would write to George Aden, and Philip had made such a strange reply that Mr. Hall feared his reason had quite left him; but as the old gentleman approached his dwelling, he met the physician just coming out from a visit to his patient; and to his anxious inquiry, the doctor replied that the paralyzed man was now in full possession of his reason, and could speak quite intelligibly; and, without doubt, he would soon have the partial use of his limbs. The same opinion had just been expressed to Mr. Maitland, and he had told his son to draw the curtains more closely over the windows, and leave the chamber; he wished to be alone.
               Luke understood, very well, why that spasm of pain passed over his father's face as the physician spoke; yet unable to utter a hopeful or encouraging word, not venturing even to seek the averted eye, he quitted the room to meet those just returning from church, and to catch his little cousin in his arms.
               
               The child seemed not quite to have forgotten him, though it had been months since anything had happened to recal the remembrance of him; and very soon, encouraged by Luke's caresses, he began, almost sobbingly, to whisper the story of his great grief in the attentive ear:
               He could not find his dear Brendice!
               But the reply which was given in the same tone, brought back its sweetest smiles to the little face, and the arms were reached up slowly and half timidly, to be clasped around the young man's neck.
               And then Luke began to speak to him of his mother, whose portrait, painted in her early youth, the housekeeper was directed to bring from Mr. Hall's private sitting-room, that the little boy might see it.
               Brendice had a nice picture too, the child was trying to say to his new-found friend, who listened with a thrill of surprise and pleasure,—"a nice picture; little Ross and"—he looked into Luke's face, very undecidedly for a moment,—"and this man!"
               Through the partially open door, Mr. Maitland heard the pleasant blending of voices. His ear was yet too dull to distinguish the words, but he knew they were cheerfully spoken.
               The remark of the physician in relation to himself, had perhaps caused the altered tone, and he tried to draw the bed-covering over his head to shut out the sound; and endeavored to forget, or to disbelieve, what the doctor had said.
               Life was not desired by him, now, as he lay there.
               Death had seemed very terrible when he was lying, helpless less, far up the stairway at the lighthouse, expecting momentarily to commence that fearful descent; and at the intervals when consciousness had returned, he felt very grateful that the end had not come to him in that frightful way. At his lucid moments since, he had promised himself and Heaven that the remnant of his life should be spent in undoing, so far as possible, his former evil work.
               For two days and two nights his intervals of consciousness had been few and brief. He had waked for the first time from his death-like swoon, to find himself in the spot where Brendice Du Bois had left him; his broken arm and wearied head placed carefully upon cushions, and to hear feet, which proved to be those of young Jones and a physician, coming up to him over the stairs. Hours after, he was conscious that he was carried from the island, to be conveyed to the house of Mr. Hall.
               His wandering thoughts were next called back by a sound he had not heard for many years:—"Father!" and as he lifted his feeble glance upward, thinking that he must be dreaming, the face of his son, which he had supposed months ago to have turned, in dying agony, its last look towards Heaven, as another face,—he thought of it at that moment of returning reason, for he could never shut out those features from his gaze,—had looked up, long time ago.
               And then the young man bent over him, and as if that weary lapse of years had not come between them, had touched his lips to his father's brow; and began to talk to him quietly and pleasantly, answering the questions which the tongue could not ask,—where he had been, why he had gone from The Sands, and how the report which had connected his disappearance with that of Monsieur Du Bois, would be likely, now, to be contradicted by its foolish originator.
               When Mr. Maitland was at length assured that it was no pleasant fancy, but a living reality which was before him, an expression of gratitude rose to his lips that the sin of the father had not been visited on the son, and that, in addition to being spared long enough to restore to Brendice Du Bois the wealth which had belonged to her parents, and to undeceive his kind friend, Mr. Hall, in relation to himself and his brother, before his eyes were closed forever, they were permitted to look on this loved face.
               The letter which had been written for Mr. Hall's perusal on the previous Wednesday, containing the humble confession of his own crimes against the benefactor of his youth, and the entire exculpation of his brother, he was sure had not yet reached the old gentleman, and he was very glad of it. It would be time enough to make that confession, when he was certain his last moment was drawing near.
               He would then send for the proprietor of the Ocean House, and tell him of the treasure concealed in the wall of one of his chambers, and to whom that treasure belonged. He would confess to Mr. Hall that his brother, George Aden, had always been most worthy, and he, himself, most undeserving of the kindness the old gentleman had ever been disposed to show them. He would say to his son that it was no want of love for his mother, nor lack of paternal affection for him, which had induced his father to leave his family alone, and in destitute circumstances,—a fatal error, committed in a moment of great excitement, and sincerely repented of, ever after, having been the sole cause of their desertion, and of his voluntary exclusion from all society.
               But to live on after these confessions had been made, with a shattered body, and perhaps enfeebled mind, to meet the watchful, pitying glance of his old friend, as he had seen it turn on his wronged brother; to receive his support from the young man whose gentle mother had been so injured by him, and on whom he had brought such disgrace! The gloss he might throw over his deeds would soon be worn away; and—why might not Du Bois have escaped death as well as Luke—again, perhaps, to be hunted by the Frenchman, who, if Mr. Maitland had confessed the robbery, would use that confession as a proof of his commission of that other fearfully greater crime.
               
                  Live! Yes, his mental agony, sharpening his perceptions, convinced him that life was surely, and not very slowly returning to him; and a wild wish crossed his mind—a wish that its full strength would come back, for a moment, to that palsied right arm, that his fingers could fasten one strong hold on that sharp knife accidentally left on the table by his side.
               But nothing, save that feeble gaze, could be extended towards it; and a deeper mist seemed rising before his eye.
               His thoughts began again to wander.
               "What mean ye by this Service?"
               The voices below stairs were reading the Evening Lesson, and the words arrested his scattering senses.
               "It is the sacrifice of the Lord's Passover, when He passed over the houses of the"—
               And Mr. Maitland knew that the day which now drew to a close, for a bright sunbeam found its way quite athwart his chamber, was the joyful Easter-day, and the bells he had listened to awhile since, were the merry Easter-bells; and he thought of an Easter evening, many years ago, when he was in a foreign land. It was the evening of his nineteenth birth-day, but it was not a joyous occasion to him.
               He had been for some weeks suffering from a painful illness, and during all the time, he had scarcely seen a face at his bedside, besides that of his careful but unsympathizing attendant. But as the sunlight of that Easter-day was fading, the sound of little pattering feet was heard near his door; a sweet, musical voice said something in a strange language, and then a pair of bright black eyes peered into the room, and a white hand held up before his gaze a bunch of beautiful flowers. "Easter-flowers" they were.
               The child had carried them to the church, but she had received them again from the hand of the priest, to be taken to the young man who was sick in the neighborhood.
               The flowers were bound together by a white ribbon on which the skilful little fingers had wrought some sacred emblems, one encircling her own name.
               He had seen the child before, as she was a distant relative of his employer, and when she drew near his pillow, and laid her sweet gift upon it, she pointed to the name "Marie," and to the slip of paper also twisted about the flowers, and on which was written:
               "'In Adam all die; in Christ shall all be made alive.' Pray for the donor, that the life in Christ may be given to her! She is praying that the earthly life may be restored to thee!"
               He had never afterwards seen the child, for she was only a visitor at the city. Her home was in another land. But he had not forgotten her, and the bit of ribbon was in his possession still, always kept about his person, as his wife's miniature had been.
               He had looked at it many times on Easter-evenings, especially during those long years he had passed at The Rocks, and wondered what had been the fate of the sweet child, and if she was living still.
               He was thinking of her now, so busily, that he had forgotten himself, and was quite regardless of the light footsteps within his chamber, and his lips began to move audibly. Many times, as he had thought of that beautiful child, had he wished that human existence and all the blessings it may afford, might long be hers. Of the life she had asked him to pray might be given her, he had not cared to think.
               But now, as he lay there, the contemplation of the commission of a deed more fearful than any of which he had been guilty, and the cursing of the physical weakness which prevented its execution, yet scarcely passed away from his mind, his lips were murmuring the words andibly, but with feeble voice and impaired memory—the thought of the past, long years quite gone from his mind, and the faith his mother had taught him in his early youth, returning to him with all its strength and holy beauty.
               "Heaven bless the sweet child, little Marie, on this joyous Easter-day, with that great gift she desires—the 'Life in Christ,' as she is praying for my earthly life!"
               The eye closed then. He thought, as the lid was drooping, that a vision of beautiful forms, and soft, rainbow hues was presenting itself to his failing sight, and that the air was filled with a pure sweet perfume; but his reason must be leaving him, he believed, with the closing of the eye, and the dulling of the ear, for a low sound seemed to be mingling with that odorous air, reminding him of the voice he had listened to so long ago,—he perceived now, again, the interval of time,—and he fancied that the eyes which had been following him, ever since those fearful moments when he stood on the deck of the burning ship, were resting on him, looking out from those fair shapes and soft hues. And then the thoroughly-exhausted nature sank into a quiet sleep.
               When he awoke again, several hours had passed. It was near midnight now.
               His son was sitting beside him, and on the table where that object towards which his eye had so wistfully turned, had been lying, was now a beautiful boquet of Easter-flowers.
               A lady had brought them to the sick-room while he was sleeping. She was a stranger in the city, and was boarding at one of the hotels, Mr. Hall's housekeeper said.
               She had been attending the church services for the past two days, and at the Easter-festival the lady had sent a great profusion of flowers to St. Mary's, which she afterwards, accompanied by the sister of the rector, assisted in distributing among the sick of the parish.
               Luke said this, as he gently lifted his father's head from the bed, and gave him some drops of nourishment. Mr. Maitland did not notice the remarks, particularly, for that dream had not yet passed away from his mind. It certainly must have been a dream.
               He had fancied that some one was praying for the restoration ration of his physical powers, and the healing of his wounded soul; and as his head, with much of its terrible pain gone, rested again on the smoothed pillows, and his eyes turned towards those sweet flowers, he seemed to be drawing from their pure, fresh breath, health for the body, and strength for the mind.
               There were no rare and costly exotics among the sweet flowers, though the lady had sent many choice clusters, very artistically arranged, to the church that day.
               They were all wild-wood flowers, grouped simply and naturally; little, modest, pale-hued things, but their pure breath seemed voiceful with the words of faith and hope, and Mr. Maitland lay quiet and silent, listening to their utterance, and thinking of years long gone by, when his heart and his hands were unstained by crimes.
               The happy, sinless childhood had passed away like the fleeting bloom of the early spring flowers; but Nature brought back beauty and perfume to the long-withered plants: and Grace could purify the soul, and impart to it even a nobler element than it contained when the great Creator had breathed into man the breath of life. The sweetest of all songs which will ascend to the ear of our God, shall be that which the redeemed shall sing.
               After a while Mr. Maitland turned his eyes towards his son, whose face was partially averted; but he could see, even in the subdued light which fell upon it, that a change had come over the young man's countenance since he left his side, just before sunset.
               The joyousness in the eyes, and the smile about the lips, were gone, and the face seemed to have grown older and more thoughtful. Once, as the father gazed, a troubled, uncertain look came over the features, which, in a woman, would have been resolved into tears; but it passed away with the lifting of the bowed head, and the firmer pressure of the closed lips, and then the young man's eyes turned to meet his father's.
               For a moment longer the silence was unbroken, though Mr. Maitland seemed striving to give utterance to some dreaded word; and then Luke dropped on one knee close beside the bed.
               "Father," he said, looking so quietly in his face, that his listener grew calmer,—"father, you wish to say something; but there is nothing to confess to your son, or to any one else. Those who have any right to know them are fully aware of all the miserable facts which we will never refer to after to-night. Mr. Hall received a few hours since the letter you wrote him shortly before this calamity befel you. He feels most kindly towards you. The remembrance of his own injustice makes him very lenient toward others.
               "And that other affair, Monsieur Du Bois told me about it long ago. But I have just heard he is still alive. He has returned to France. He may never come back. If he does, he will not find us here.
               "When I return to Italy, you must accompany me. I will make a pleasant home there for you and me.
               "We will restore to Du Bois the wealth which has not been spent, and, some time, the whole amount shall be returned to him. And we will be happy together yet, dear father, notwithstanding all that has happened—you and I—there will be only two of us; but we will be happy, remembering bering the past only to urge us to ever increasing effort to do good to our fellow-beings.
               "If there were no sin in the world, father, our great Passover would have been sacrificed in vain!"
               "And she who saved my life?" said Mr. Maitland, after a pause, and falteringly, "the poor, wronged girl?"
               Luke was silent, and he continued:
               "Jerry Greyson has told me that you and Brendice Du Bois loved each other. Leave me here, and take her to the happy home, heaven grant, you may find in a spot where your father's name will never be heard. By your love and care you will make her forget the sorrows of her past life, and him whose crimes brought them upon her."
               "You do not know her, father," Luke said, in a changed tone. "I did not, myself, and so I went down to The Sands to-night, and asked her, as I have purposed to do for years past, to be my wife."
               He did not say anything more—it was not necessary that he should; and Mr. Maitland knew now what that shadow was which had fallen on his son's life.
               When the young man, as he ceased speaking, rose to his feet and walked across the room, to draw aside the window curtain, and look up for a moment to the calm, moon-lighted sky, and then returned to his seat at the bedside, with that expression of composure on his face, the wretched father believed that all of the punishment which he had merited had now fallen upon him.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               OUT OF THE SEA.
               IVES DORN and her young brother, Erle, were sitting idly on the rocks near which stood their rude cabin, looking away over the water and watching the fishing-boats, whose white sails were fast disappearing in the morning mists, catching now and then a fragment of some rude nautical song, which, usually, their strong and clear, though untrained voices, would have caught up and rung out far above the waves.
               But they were quite silent now, not even addressing each other. The boy appeared very sullen; and his sister, though there was a look of determined purpose on her countenance, seemed angry and perplexed.
               At a short distance from them was their boat, with the fishing-tackle within it, drawn up upon the sand.
               The girl was not looking at it, however.
               After some time, a woman of fifty years, with her two half-grown boys,—it was an older brother of these lads, who had been some months before the lover of Ives Dorn, and whose attentions, to the great vexation of his mother, she had refused fused in her very decided manner to receive—came down the shore.
               The boys were talking to each other, in a low tone, but loud enough for the Dorns to hear, and with most emphatic gestures, and their mother joined in their boisterous laughter.
               "Will you lend us your boat, this morning, my young lady?" asked the old woman, drawing near to Ives, and dropping a low curtesy, while the boys gave an upward twist to their long, uncovered elf-locks, and bowed, almost to the ground, before little Erle.
               "And wish us good luck with our fishing; wont you?"
               And the woman and her sons, with a fresh burst of laughter at their extreme wit, turned away, without expecting a reply, and began to push Ives' boat off into the water.
               The girl's face turned very red before she was addressed, but it was now as white as its brown tint would suffer it to be, and her long ragged nails cut deep into her calloused palms; but she called out after them, in her loudest tones, as they pushed off from the shore:
               "That boat is old Mother Hub's and her cubs; and I hope she will have good luck to-day and catch the"—
               She did not finish the sentence, for at that moment the sound of oars, coming from an opposite direction, fell on her ear; and looking behind her, she perceived a boat rounding the high rock on which she and Erle were sitting, and a sweet, clear voice, so pleasant and cheerful that Ives scarcely recognized it, said:
               "It will be a fine day for fishing, and I am going down to the 'lower grounds.' Come with me—you too! I intend to fish there this season, and you must go with me, for I have never"—
               But the boy interrupted the speaker to say that he and Ives had no boat; they could not go.
               His sullenness was all gone, now; and between the sobs which he could not choke down, though he felt somewhat ashamed of them, he began alternately to reproach his sister, and to utter complaints against her to the new comer, who, though she could not well understand his words, comprehended, at length, the cause of his grief.
               It was the loss of their boat, their only means of procuring a subsistence.
               Ives was looking askance at Brendice Du Bois, and wondering how she would decide between Erle and herself—whether she had done right in confessing to Mother Hobart that it was herself who had set the boat adrift, and then given the woman her own for that she had lost, or kept her boat,—everything which her father had left for his children besides their little miserable cabin—for the use of herself and her brother, who might starve now, the boy thought, since it was gone; while the old fish-woman could have bought another boat, and never felt it.
               Brendice determined this—to the poor, orphaned brother and sister—very important point in casuistry, quickly.
               "Well, I am glad you let the woman have the boat!" she said, "because I am not going out in my boat, alone, any more; it is too large for one to handle well; and now I can coax you to fish with me, this season!"
               Ives rose to her feet, and walked down to the waters' edge. She could not believe what was said to her.
               "And besides," Brendice continued, "'the lower grounds' are too far distant from The Sands, for me, and I wish to come over here and live with you. You remember you invited me to come, a few evenings since; and, see! I have brought some of my things over. I could not take them all, because I was obliged to row a part of the way. But if we have good luck to-day, we will go over to The Sands, and get the remainder, to-morrow morning.
               "Do you wish me to go on shore?"
               The brother and sister manifested their wishes that she should do so, in very different ways.
               The boy hastened down to the boat's side by a series of summersaults through the water, shouting at the top of his voice every time that his head came uppermost; while Ives, striving in vain to check the tears, which seldom, except in the moments of her fiercest anger, came to her eyes, kissed the narrow gold circlet upon her finger—it had been her mother's wedding ring—smoothed with her nails her tangled hair, and tried to put into a little better order her untidy garments.
               The contents of the boat, all but the fishing-tackle, were soon stored away in the Dorns' cabin, and a few moments after, with the trio on board, Brendice's boat was gliding over the water, down towards the lower fishing-grounds, on which her father had spent so many weary days and nights, but where she had never yet been; and the boy, Erle Dorn, very proud and happy, in being allowed to steer, was describing the waters to her, as another lad might have described the features of a very varied landscape.
               But Ives sat, very still and thoughtful, replying only in monosyllables to Brendice, who frequently addressed her with some pleasant remark.
               Now she was looking down into the placid sea, whose dark waters were here and there flecked with light, from the fleecy clouds, tipped with sunbeams, that floated far away through the zenith; as, in the web of her dark thoughts, were woven many a soft and silvery thread; and now, when she supposed the eyes of her companion were averted, she was glancing furtively up into Brendice's face, and observing how nicely the hair was arranged under the narrow-brimmed hat, and how neatly the coarse, but clean fishing-dress fitted to her person.
               Ives had noticed, when she last saw her, that there had been a change in Brendice's personal appearance.
               Now she saw that there was something new in her face, too; and she was wondering, with an undefined, but uncomfortable feeling, what had happened to the girl, who when she had come over to The Rocks the past summer, Ives thought, was just like one of the islanders.
               "How long have you been trying to be so wonderful good?" she asked, at length, in an abrupt, sarcastic tone.
               "Oh, not long!" said Brendice, softly; "only since that night when you told me about your mother, and how she sang the sweet, holy songs on Good Friday to you and your brother. How nice it is that you can remember about it and that she used to pray you might be good when you grew up!
               "Do you know I was only three months old when my mother died, and never had a brother or sister to talk with me about being good?"
               "No!" said Ives, more kindly; "well, then," glancing up into the thoughtful, pleasant face, "how did you find out the way? or," seeing that there was a trace of sadness in the countenance, for Ives was a pretty good physiognomist, "are you not very good yet?"
               "Not very good yet," Brendice replied. "Only trying to be! And you will tell me, and help me about it, will you not? You have told me something already."
               "O yes! I know all about being good, and I will help you!" said Ives, confidently, "only it is pretty hard work, and you will find it so. I have tried to be good ever so many times; but in a little while I am bad again, worse than I was before!
               "I have got an old book which my mother used to read," she resumed, after a pause, and in a still softer tone, "that tells all about these things, only I can't read much.
               "We have a school here, two or three months in the year, out we never go to it. We are too busy for that, and, besides, I, and most of the other large girls, do not like to go to the school, the teacher who comes down from the Port is so unlike ourselves. Erle and I have forgotten most all that our mother taught us. I wish we could read, though!"
               "Well, I can read, and will teach you," said Brendice, "if you will help me"—
               "Do you hear that, Erle?" inquired Ives, interrupting her, "and what do you think of it?"
               The boy had heard, and he uttered a loud and prolonged shout of joy, much more, probably, to express his satisfaction with the state of things in general, than with the simple fact of having an opportunity of learning to read.
               
               But Ives was very much in earnest; and each time that Brendice began to speak on another subject, she would refer to that, and it was settled between them before they reached their point of destination, that the reading should commence the ensuing evening, after their labors were finished, and that one or two girls of Ives' age should be invited into the Dorns' cabin, to be taught too; Ives reiterating her promise that she would help Brendice to become good, and silently wondering if she had not, herself, better make one more effort in that direction.
               As Brendice threw her line out into the sea,—how much had happened to her since she had last seen the lead sinking into the water,—she tried to forget her dull heartache, and to fix her thoughts on Him, who, as His form was about to pass away forever from human sight, had said, on the day of which this was commemorative—Monday in Easter-week—"Lo, I am with you alway;" and prayed that the work she was about, humbly, to undertake, might have the Divine approval, and be followed by the Divine blessing; prayed, too, that she might so skilfully employ her talents, that when the Lord should call for His own, she would be able to return to Him those entrusted to her keeping, polished bright in the using, and with them the usury He would strictly require.
               While Brendice's boat was gliding over the water, and she and Ives were chatting pleasantly with each other, Mr. Hall, whose carriage was ready to go down to The Sands for the purpose of bringing her up to his house, was busily engaged in writing the kind letter of invitation, which was not destined to be delivered to her.
               Luke Maitland, whom the old gentleman had made acquainted with his intentions in relation to Brendice, not only excused himself from driving down to The Sands after her, but tried to dissuade Mr. Hall from his purpose. The reasons he offered, by no means the most important ones which occurred to himself, were, however, not at all satisfactory to the old gentleman.
               He was determined, both for the sake of little Ross, and her who had so tenderly cared for him, that they should not be separated from each other until his parents should claim the child; and when they returned, the poor girl, who, he said, should never know want again, would find, in Rachel and her husband, a most loving father and mother.
               Luke knew, for a certainty, that the invitation would not be accepted by Brendice; no connection of his, he said to himself, as he left Mr. Hall, and returned to the bedside of his father, would ever be regarded by Brendice Du Bois in the light of a friend.
               She could show kindness, but never receive it.
               He had, a moment before, been looking over the morning paper, and his eye fell on a notice conspicuously inserted. It was to the effect that the report in circulation the preceding autumn in regard to the disappearance of Mr. Stephen Du Bois, who had been, for the last fifteen years, a resident of H——, was entirely without foundation; he having returned, after a brief stay in New York, to his native land.
               Brendice, he doubted not, had sent the notice to the publishing office, just as soon as her father's letter had been found by her, lest the story in relation to himself should be revived.
               
               Mr. Maitland was just waking, when his son re-entered his chamber.
               After his brief conversation with Luke, he had been unable to sleep at all during the remainder of the night, and his bitter reflections had so much exhausted him, that the half hour's slumber in the morning had refreshed him but a little.
               He was lying in a heavy stupor when Ruth Adams came into the room, and whispered to Luke.
               A lady had called to see Mr. Maitland. She had sent up her card.
               The young man glanced at it. It bore but one word, "Marie."
               "She is the lady who brought the Easter-flowers to him yesterday," Ruth said. "Mrs. Smith sent me up here with her. She is a stranger in the city, the housekeeper says, but I think she knows your father, there was such a look on her face when she stood by his bed.
               "And when he said something, I did not notice what it was, he was talking in his sleep, I suppose, his eyes were closed, the lady knelt by his bed and prayed very earnestly, I thought, but in another language."
               Luke partially succeeded in arousing his father, and tried to make him understand that some one wished to see him.
               The woman had sent up the name—Marie! She was the same who had brought him the Easter-flowers the preceding evening.
               "Yes, I thought it was little Marie who came to me!" he said, dreamily, and then his thoughts began to wander.
               "She was a little French girl, but she had relatives in Italy. It was there I saw her. She was visiting an uncle. He was my employer. He was very wealthy, and she was to be his heir, and take his name. She will be now, if her uncle is not living, Maria di Leuca.—Little Marie! Yes, tell her to come to me, Luke! I would like to see the sweet child."
               Maria di Luca! Luke remembered that name.
               He had many times heard it spoken with words of earnest blessing by his uncle and aunt in Italy; and he hastened from the apartment, preceded, down the stairway, by little Ruth, to conduct the stranger to his father's bedside. The lady's back was towards him as he drew near her, and her veil had fallen over her face.
               "My father—Mr. Maitland—will be pleased to see you!" he said, "and, madam, if you are the lady he supposes you to be, permit me to express the deep gratitude we owe you for the disinterested kindness you showed to our nearest friends—George and Rachel Aden, in the hour of their great need. He calls you Signora di Leuca!"
               "That is the name I have lately borne," said the lady, in a sweet, musical voice, and it struck the young man that there was something familiar in the tone; but when she raised her veil, and turned her face towards him, he was sure he had never seen those features before. He had never looked on anything half as lovely as was that countenance.
               Brendice Du Bois was very beautiful; but this face, how strange it was, he thought, that he should be comparing the two countenances,—this face, now in its full maturity, had something in its expression far transcending, in loveliness, its really wonderful beauty—a sweetness and joy was there, such as one might almost believe the angels wear.
               
               "You have spoken the name I have been called by," the lady said, "but within the hour I have taken another name—that of my husband!" and she put a paper into the young man's hand, and pointed to a particular paragraph.
               "Just married!" Luke thought.
               Rachel Aden had told him that the lady had no husband, and as he was conducting her to his father's presence, he hoped that the lovely woman might find as much happiness in the life before her, as in this hour of her deep joy she was looking forward to.
               He did not glance at the paper she had given him, until after he had returned to the sick chamber, the door of which the lady closed behind her, as soon as she was within the room; but as she drew near the bedside, he sought the lines she had pointed out, that he might mention her new name to his father.
               Her eyes rested on the pale, worn face of the sufferer, so earnestly, that she did not notice the sudden emotion of the young man; but Mr. Maitland, stupefied as were his senses, heard the fervent "Thank God!" which his son uttered; and looking up, he saw Luke in the attitude of prayer, while tears were dropping from his eyes. He was not sufficiently aroused, however, to wonder at the cause of such deep feeling.
               He was trying to lift his eyes to the female figure beside him, but the heavy lids drooped again.
               "Little Marie," he said, feebly, "the sweet, child face which, so long ago, looked pityingly on the sick, sad stranger, has never been forgotten by me. I have remembered it as the face of an angel. Has the holy, blessed Life you desired, been given to you?
               "The earthly existence you prayed might be mine, has been a curse to me and to those it should have rendered happy!—that life has been continued in crime and sorrow; its end must be despair!"
               "Father—dear father!" Luke exclaimed, coming forward, and bending over him, "look up, and try to comprehend the great joy this lady's presence brings to us!
               "The past is not the dark night you think it is. The future will be all brightness to you, and to me.
               "Look up, dear father! The terrible crime you believed yourself guilty of, was not commited, for"—
               His utterance was almost choked, but Mr. Maitland was fully aroused now.
               "This lady is Madame Du Bois, the mother of Brendice!"
               The sick man's eyes fastened on the face which he had believed, the evening previous, he only fancied was bending over him. He would have thought, at the present moment, that his reason was gone, but the lady's fingers were resting on his hand,—the right hand, which seemed, long ago, to have her life in its hold, and whose hold was loosened!—the hand so palsied now that it had lain, for days, apparently lifeless at his side; and a thrill, as if it had been an electric touch, ran through his whole frame.
               "Yesterday, at this hour," the lady said, "I believed myself, as I have long done, childless, and a widow, and you, I thought, had bereaved me; and my anguished life has been spent in alternately striving to be resigned to the loss of what seemed to me all my earthly good, and in seeking to find the author of my misery.
               "I knew who you were, Philip Maitland, when we stood beside each other on the deck of that ill-fated ship. I recollected the face I had seen ten years previous, and the name of the one to whom my uncle sent me with flowers, on Easter-day; and when I stood, not many months since, at the sick-bed of your brother—though this I did not then know—the sound of your name, whispered at a moment when his reason was quite gone, reached my ear.
               "He coupled your name with that of his child, and his wife had told me to what place her babe had been sent.
               "I prayed Heaven that the distance which separated you and me might never be lessened; but in spite of my best endeavor, rather guided by an All-merciful hand, I found myself near you at last. Your name and the account of the calamity which had befallen you, were the first words which reached me on my arrival in this city; and I thought that He who, alone, could understand how I had striven against my evil thoughts, had become my Avenger! and yesterday, at the children's pleasant festival, I tried to thank Him that finally I was delivered from temptation; and thought that, to-day, I would prepare for a return to my native land, and strive to forget the past; and while offering up a thanksgiving that the struggle with myself was, as I trusted, over, I heard a name spoken—the name of my child! and when the assembly had left the church, for my heart was too full of hope and fear for an immediate departure from it, I sought the rector to make inquiries respecting her whose name I had listened to.
               "He told me what he had heard of Brendice Du Bois, from an old gentleman who had known her for some months past, and he showed me a valuable diamond which the child who had been in her care had presented for an Easter-offering.
               "The diamond was my own. The broken chasing still bore the initials of my husband and myself.
               "The gentleman was certain its value could not have been known by the real donor; but it was a simple thank-offering to be returned for the great joy which had come to me in that church.
               "There was a wish in my heart, then, to look on your face, Philip Maitland!
               "I would see one of the shadows I had thought resting so heavily upon you, fallen away; and when I stood here last evening, and heard you, half insanely, whisper my childhood's name, and murmur a prayer for me, I called the past, dead, and drew a heavy shroud over it, and laid the sweet Easter-flowers above its bier!
               "To-day a new joy has come to me. My husband, too, is living! and"—her fingers fastened themselves closely to the cold hand, "may Heaven forgive your intended crime, freely as I forgive you for all you have caused me to suffer!"
               Brendice's boat came in early that night.
               She and the Dorns had had very good success for the time they had been out, and Ives and her brother, singing their choicest songs in the cheeriest of voices, steered the boat up between the jutting rocks, where their own had always come in before, and laughed at the surprise of Mother Hobart, who really had intended to use Ives' boat only for the day, just to punish her.
               The old fish-woman had a heart once, and it was not quite dead yet; and after giving scarcely more than half the avails of her day's labor in charge of one of her boys, she was trying to run the boat into its accustomed place, when Ives and Erle, with merry laughter, and an "Off with you, old sea-gull!" shot past her into the little inlet.
               The care of the fish was left to the boy, and Ives and Brendice prepared the simple evening repast, and tried to make the rude cabin, scarcely more uncomfortable and untidy than that of Brendice had formerly been, a little more orderly and neat, while they amused themselves with planning what they would shortly do for its improvement.
               After the labors of the toilet, which comprised only the good scrubbing of a really pleasant face, and the combing, though that was rather a serious affair, of the thick, curling hair, had been performed by Ives, the girl ran out to find her young companions, and tell them about Brendice—that she was nothing but a fish-girl like themselves, only she knew ever so much, and could be coaxed, Ives knew, not only to teach them to read much better than they could, at present, but to tell them about many other things—and to invite them over to her cabin that evening.
               She was absent some time, for the girls, willing to return with her to see the stranger, as soon as their labors were ended, were obliged, the most of them, first to bathe and comb their hair; and Brendice, with the fish-dress laid aside, and attired now very simply, but neatly, had gone down to the edge of the water, and was sitting on a high boulder, looking away over the peaceful waves, into the crimsoning west, waiting for the coming of the young girls and Erle Dorn.
               Many dark and painful thoughts were striving to enter her mind, as she sat there, but she resolutely put them from her, and turned to the Lesson for the evening; and her lips murmured the words again and again:
               "Abide with us, for it is toward evening; and the day is far spent!"
               And a promise had been made, long ago, by Him whose word is forever unfailing:
               "At evening-time it shall be light!"
               The few fond hopes she had ever dared to cherish, were all dead now. The life of the dearest had been crushed out by her own hand, but its destruction was none the less agonizing to her for that. All dead now!
               They had passed away like the dreams of her early childhood, when she had stood on that topmost height of the ledge, and looked away into the sea, and waited for her beautiful mother to come up out of its depths.
               The fishing-boats were coming in slowly.
               One or two were running down from the Port, where the red beacon-light was just faintly seen, mingling with the last rays of the sinking sun.
               And now the Convoy sent out its clear, white light.
               Jerry Greyson was at the lighthouse, as keeper, for the time, and Brendice had been told by Mrs. Adams, the preceding evening, that most likely he would remain there; as letters, strongly recommending him for the post, had already been mailed for Washington; and then Sally Jones would have another offer of marriage, which, this time, she would accept.
               Brendice had said this to Miss Jones that very morning, for the woman had come into her cabin, just as she was quitting it to go over to The Rocks, and Sally, though she had tossed her head scornfully, blushed like a young girl.
               Brendice was thinking of this now, with pleasure, for the woman was her firm friend. Notwithstanding her uninteresting exterior, she had a fund of sound sense, and the girl would have a good coadjutor in the work she contemplated, and of which she had spoken to Miss Jones, briefly but very earnestly.
               Her words had surprised her auditor much; but after a thoughtful pause, Sally had taken her hand, and said, huskily, that Brendice might rely on her ready assistance whenever she needed it.
               There was another boat coming over, apparently from The Sands. She did not gaze at it particularly, though it was quite near. Probably, she thought, its occupants were going to the Convoy to see Greyson; and not wishing to be recognized by them, for the boat seemed likely to pass very near the island, at the point where she was sitting, Brendice turned away, and was looking up the path Ives had taken in search of her young companions.
               The girls were not yet within sight, and her eyes again fell upon the book lying in her lap.
               "Abide with us!"
               How long it might be, ere the lengthened day before her was "far spent"! and yet every one of its hours would be given by the Lord, for the earnest working, and the patient waiting.
               But, at length, the night must come!
               Her thoughts rested there, at the termination of the day of life; when the once strong hand should feebly end its allotted tasks, when the tired ear should listen only to blending sounds, and the curtain thicken before the eyes; when human companionship should depart, and the stranger come in to tarry: and then her lips began to move in simple rhymes: 
                     
                        "Be patient, my soul, there's another sphere,
                        For the earnest, unwearying toiler here;
                        The deafening ear, and the dimming eyes
                        Shall ope at the gate of Paradise.
                     
                     
                        "So wait I, and watch, while sitting alone,
                        And the echoes are coming in deepening tone;
                        For the welcome roll of the mightier sea,
                        Which shall bear me away to Eternity."
                     
                  
               
               A footfall upon the rocks attracted her attention, and a moment after, some one spoke; but a sudden surprise, almost fear, seemed so to deaden her senses, that when she turned and lifted her eyes, she hardly knew whether it was Luke Maitland, or not, who was bending over her, and she only caught his closing words, so softly, but eagerly uttered:
               —"up, out of the sea, Brendice!"
               And then her eyes rested on another face, the face of a beautiful woman; and the woman said:
               "My child!" and laid her hand on the bewildered head, and murmured some words of deep thankfulness.
               Her thoughts came then, and Brendice knew that it was her mother who had sat down by her side, whose arms were folding themselves about her,—her mother, on whose breast her head was resting, into whose face, so long waited for, she was at length gazing.
               She was speaking the dear word over and over; it seemed to her expressive of all she wished to say, and she felt herself more a child than she had ever been before.
               "Mother! come up, at length, out of the sea!"
               That was what Luke had just said; and then other thoughts presented themselves to her, and she turned her eyes towards the young man.
               He had withdrawn to a little distance, and was now slowly walking up and down the short stretch of sandy beach, with varied, conflicting emotions, which Brendice readily enough understood, described on his fair, open countenance.
               Her mother followed the direction of her eyes, and she drew her daughter more closely to her, and whispered a question. It was one in which the lady felt the deepest interest, though it was very quietly spoken.
               Brendice lifted her head, and looked into her mother's face for a moment, and then she spoke in French, very briefly, but very eloquently, it seemed, by the expression which came over the features of the elder lady.
               When she ceased, she drew a letter from her bosom, her father's letter, which she had carefully re-sealed the preceding evening, after its second perusal, and put it into her mother's hand. She had thought that seal would never again be broken; at least not until years had passed away would she trust herself to read those pages, though the precious words must always be near her. The lady opened it, and her eyes rested on the writing, but it was some moments before she could think of anything except that it was only a few months since those lines were penned by the husband, whose supposed death she had been mourning over for so many long years.
               After her escape from death, which seemed to her almost miraculous, she had not returned to her former home in France, nor, for months, to her uncle in Italy. She and a young sailor, to whom she owed the immediate preservation of her life, were found clinging to a spar, some hours after the burning of the ship, and were picked up by a passing vessel, bound to an English port.
               In the published detail of the loss of the ship, the name of her husband did not appear in the list of the rescued; on the contrary, the account Mr. Maitland had given his wife of the finding of the lifeless and charred body, supposed to be that of Du Bois, floating upon the water, had met her eye.
               Her own escape, and that of the young sailor, from death, was told by the newspapers, simply as, "Two persons saved!" Her marriage had taken place without the knowledge of her uncle, who had other views for her; and it was not until some time after she had returned to him, that she informed him of the sad episode in her life. She had, however, never mentioned to him or to any other person, the name of Mr. Maitland. Her uncle had wished that the image of her husband should drop out from her memory, and for that reason he had dissuaded her from holding intercourse with her friends in France; and he never made reference to her married life, or called her by her husband's name; and in gratitude for his love and kindness, she had tried to bury her grief in her heart, and answered to the name he gave her.
               When Madame Du Bois had read the letter and returned it to her daughter, she spoke only of the diamond to which reference had been made. Was it that which the little boy, lately under her care, had taken to St. Mary's for an Easter-offering? Brendice supposed that it must be, though she had not, at the time he took it to the church, any idea of its value. She had not, in fact, seen it.
               It must have fallen among his playthings, accidentally; and she had supposed, when his young friend was so anxious he should carry it to church for an offering, that it was nothing but a shining pebble.
               If her mother was willing, however, she would be very glad that the offering should be, indeed, made to the Lord.
               Madame Du Bois said that it was her own wish, only her daughter must specify for what religious purpose its avails should be employed.
               Brendice expressed her deep thanks.
               She had come over to the islands, she said, to make her home there, and to endeavor, in a quiet, unobtrusive way, to do good to the young people who would be her associates; and especially to one poor girl, motherless, as she had supposed herself to be.
               She had thought that, in a few days, she would go up to the Port, and call on the Rector of St. Mary's, and tell him that the diamond had been the gift of her father to her, and that she was thankful it had been an Easter-offering, and ask him if the sum, or a part of it, which would be realized by its sale, might be employed for the benefit of the people at The Rocks.
               "I have been planning a great deal," she interrupted herself, with a smile, "but it will not cost much besides labor to do all I wish. They will help themselves, when once they have become interested."
               "What you wish shall be done!" her mother replied, "but there is no work here for you, my child! Your business in life, henceforth, is to make your parents and this young man, who has told me that he loves you, happy!"
               The lady turned towards Luke Maitland.
               His eager glance read her decision in relation to himself, in her face, and he drew near them, and held Brendice's hand in his for a moment, and then walked quickly down to the boat, to prepare for an immediate return to the mainland.
               The daylight was fading now, and the evening air, though very mild for the season, was becoming uncomfortably cool for one less hardy than those young fishers.
               Ives Dorn had, some moments previous, appeared in sight, with half a dozen of her youthful companions.
               They had come bounding down over the rocks, like a troop of young kids; but halted very suddenly and timidly, when they observed the strangers. They had seen Brendice before, but her appearance had wonderfully changed since she had come over to The Rocks the previous summer; and Ives, seeing the lady's arms around her, and the happy smiles on Brendice's face, began to feel very ill at ease, very envious, though she did not know why, and very angry. But when Brendice went to her side and told her, with the tears which now, for the first time, began to flow, of the great happiness which had just come to her, Ives forgot herself, and softly wept with her, and said how glad she was that Brendice had somebody to tell her how to be good; and she and the girls would run up to the cabin, and fetch down all of the things brought over from The Sands that morning, and get the boat ready for her; and did she not want some of the fish they had caught?
               No, Brendice did not want the fish, or the boat, or any of the things it had brought over. They were all for Ives and Erle. The boat was already her own for helping Brendice row it over to The Sands on the morning of Good Friday, when she was so tired.
               Ives—and her young companions seemed disposed to participate in her joy,—was made still more happy by being told that her friend was coming over to The Rocks in a very few days, to talk with her and the other girls about something in which she knew they would be interested; and when Luke's boat was again gliding over the water, in the soft moonlight, a chorus of young voices rose up from the high rocks that jutted out into the sea, in an old, quaint melody.
               The occupants of the boat, silent in their deep happiness, listened to the music, which became sweeter and sweeter as the distance widened, and more and more plaintive, till it was lost in the roll of the ocean, and the soft whispering of the evening air.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXV.
               AFTER TWO YEARS.
               TWO years had passed since the cold, blustering night when Mr. Hall had called the people whose houses were at, or near The Sands, around the Christmas-tree; and the same company, with few losses and many additions, were gathered again at what had then been called the Ocean House.
               The dwelling was now a private residence, though probably, in the future, it would be occupied only during the warm season.
               Its present owner was Luke Maitland.
               It had been purchased, a year and a half before, by Madame Du Bois; and though Mr. and Mrs. Adams continued to occupy the house for some months subsequent to its sale, its purchaser had some alterations early made within it.
               Among them was the removal of the partition between two of the chambers, ostensibly for the better accommodation of the lady and her daughter, who were boarders in the house.
               Luke Maitland had suggested this alteration, and had superintended the slight job; and no one but himself and his father knew what was found within the wall; but Monsieur Du Bois, in the second letter received from his wife, for she knew to what part of his native land he must have returned, was informed that the greater part of their wealth, which she had supposed forever lost to them, was now in her possession.
               This Christmas Eve was a very mild and pleasant one,—so mild and pleasant that Mr. Hall had come down from his home, to take part in the festivities.
               He was not the host, this evening, however, only the guest, greatly loved and honored by all who were there.
               Brendice, the bride of two days, and Luke Maitland, her husband, received the company,—a very beautiful and charming hostess, and a very well satisfied host; for the seemingly incongruous elements which Brendice had brought together, were harmonizing wonderfully well.
               The addition to the party were a score or more of people from N—, highly educated and refined, recently-formed acquaintances of the fair bride; and a bevy of young girls, quite as much cared for, and honored by her, as were any of the party.
               These latter were shy, timid things. They might have been thought bashful and awkward, but for the interest their hostess took in them, and the good management of Mrs. Jerry Greyson, formerly Miss Sally Jones, who was always perfectly self-possessed.
               These girls were from The Rocks.
               William Jones had brought them and his aunt, who considered herself their chaperone, over to the Christmas festival; and from the furtive glances which were exchanged between the young man and the prettiest of these girls—Ives Dorn—one might have supposed he had quite forgotten the preference he formerly felt for Brendice Du Bois.
               It was very pleasant to observe the affection which existed between Brendice and these young girls; particularly so, to Mr. Hall.
               Madame Du Bois had told her daughter it must be only by the expenditure of a sum of money, employed, however, as she saw fit, that she could carry out her wish in relation to these young islanders; but when she saw how happy it would make Brendice to follow, in part, her original design, she suffered her to do as she pleased. Consequently, on every Saturday afternoon of the lady's first summer at The Sands, when the weather was favorable, Brendice took a light boat and went over to The Rocks; sometimes alone with two young fisher-lads, and sometimes accompanied by Ruth Adams. The night would be spent with Mrs. Greyson, and the next day with the girls, who, one after another, willingly relinquished, and were allowed by their parents to do so, their accustomed amusements and labors, on the Sabbath.
               The past summer she had only made an occasional week-day visit to them; for Mrs. Greyson, and the good, sensible young woman employed as school-teacher, managed the Sunday-school; and religious services were held, once in two weeks, in the little church, large enough, however, for the accommodation of the islanders, which had been built by the Easter-offering of Ross Aden.
               Mr. Hall had been the purchaser of the diamond; and on this Christmas Eve he had presented it to the young bride, nicely re-set, for a wedding gift.
               
               Aside from its intrinsic value, it would be to Brendice, always, a most highly prized treasure; not only for the sake of the donor, whose words, uttered two years before, had forced her thoughts into a channel from which she had always striven to hold them back, but because it was through this Easter-offering that all her present joy had found its way to her—her father, her mother, and her husband; and, by its agency, their happiness had been effected.
               Brendice, and her father, who on the receipt of his wife's letters was obliged to go to Italy to attend to some affairs connected with the estate recently inherited by her, and had quite lately returned to H——, were looking at the jewel, and walking slowly through one of the least crowded of the rooms.
               Though Brendice knew where she was leading him, he, in listening to her words, did not observe whom they were approaching, till she withdrew her arm from his, and hastened away to meet the little fellow who had slipped from the fond arm that encircled him, to whisper to her that though he was "Papa's son, and mother's own darling," he was "nobody's little boy but Brendice's!"
               And then Du Bois found himself beside Philip Maitland, who, leaning heavily upon a cane, stood looking, attentively, at a painting on the wall.
               It was a moonlight scene which was before him.
               In the foreground, on a low couch, lay a woman, whose arms were peacefully folded upon her breast, and whose marble-like brow, and closed, white lips, seemed to have been just touched by the holy chrism; and at the foot of the bed were the faint, dim outlines of a female figure, kneeling upon the floor.
               Outside the open window and leaning against the sill, was a young man, holding a child tenderly in his arms. The ocean was beyond, and the dark line in the distance was The Rocks.
               Mr. Maitland was looking only at the dead.
               That face, he thought, was more beautiful than ever, in its last repose.
               "Heaven bless the noble and gifted girl!" he said. "She completed this painting for me, George!"
               He turned his head as he spoke. It was not his brother who stood beside him, but Du Bois.
               The two men had not met before since the Frenchman's return; and for a moment, each looked silently into the other's face.
               The voice of Mr. Hall came through the open door. He was talking to the young people gathered around the Christmas-tree, and they were listening attentively, for his words were always very pleasant, even to them.
               He was telling them about the Vineyard of the Lord; and when some old people, attracted by his remarks, drew near, he began to say how readily the Master accepted service, at whatever time in the day it was offered; and how surely the promised wages would be paid to all who wrought faithfully, even though they came at the eleventh hour.
               "But it never has been said by our Lord," added the old gentleman, solemnly, "that he shall receive a reward who has not labored at all in the Vineyard!"
               These words, uttered in a somewhat louder tone, reached the ears of the two men; and Du Bois, remembering how much had been forgiven him, how lovingly his daughter had met him on his return, how kindly she had avoided his every allusion to the painful past, took up the old gentleman's idea.
               "And we can never truly enter into the Vineyard of the Lord," he said, "until we are ready to pray in sincerity—'And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us!'"
               And he took the still feeble hand of Mr. Maitland, and held it, for a full minute, in his firm clasp.
               Both Brendice and Luke saw and heard what passed between the two men; and to hide the emotion called up by her now unalloyed happiness, Brendice turned to the window, and drawing aside the curtain, looked out into the night, away up to the neighboring hills, where the bright moonlight was stealing through the dark branches of the clustering evergreens, and falling upon a white stone, against which, while her knee was bent, and the name of the gentle slumberer there was upon her lips, her head had many times most reverently rested.
               She was thinking now of the hour when that voice, that was then so soon to be silenced by death, had gently, but confidently murmured the words:
               "Something, sometime, will bind us together."
               Luke came and stood by her side, and took her hand. He knew to what point her eyes had turned.
               "If she were only with us!" he said.
               "Perhaps she is," Brendice softly whispered. "Who knows?"
